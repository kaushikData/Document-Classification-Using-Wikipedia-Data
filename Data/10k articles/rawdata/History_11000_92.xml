      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1700">'''Albinus''' (died 732) was an abbot of [[St Augustine's Abbey]], [[Canterbury]]. He assisted [[Bede]] in the compilation of his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', and what we know concerning him is chiefly derived from the dedicatory epistle at the beginning of that work. Albinus was a pupil of [[Theodore of Tarsus|Archbishop Theodore]] and his coadjutor [[Adrian of Canterbury]], abbot of St. Peter's. Through the instructions of the latter he became not only versed in the Scriptures, but likewise a master of Greek and Latin (Chron. G. Thorne). On the death of Adrian, Albinus succeeded to the abbacy, being the first native Englishman who filled that post. Bede in his epistle says that he was indebted to Albinus for all the facts contained in his history relating to the [[Kingdom of Kent|Kentish]] church between the first conversion of the English and the time at which he was writing. Much of this information was collected by the presbyter [[Nothelm]], who, at the instigation of Albinus, undertook a journey to [[Rome]] and searched the archives there. Nothelm was the medium of communication between Bede and Albinus, for it does not appear that the two ever met. Albinus died in 732, and was buried beside his master Adrian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6023">'''Allan David Franklin''' (born 11 August 1938, [[Brooklyn]])&lt;ref&gt;biographical information from ''American Men and Women of Science'', Thomson Gale 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American physicist, historian of science, and philosopher of science.

Franklin received in 1959 his bachelor's degree from [[Columbia University]] and in 1965 his PhD in physics from [[Cornell University]]. He was from 1965 to 1966 a postdoc and from 1966 to 1967 an instructor at Princeton University. At the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] he became in 1982 a full professor in physics, after having been there from 1967 to 1973 an assistant professor and from 1973 to 1982 an associate professor.

At the beginning of his career he did research on [[particle physics]]. Since the 1970s his research has dealt with the history and philosophy of science, in particular, the role of experiments in physics. He has done research on the history of experiments on parity violation, CP violation, neutrinos, and a possible fifth force, as well as the Millikan oil drop experiment and the relationship between theory and experiment in research on [[weak interaction]]s.

As a philosopher, he dealt with the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], the theory of [[Scientific method#Confirmation|confirmation]] using [[Bayesian statistics]], the [[Defeasible reasoning|corrigibility]] and reliability of experimental results, and the resolution of conflicting observations.

In 2016 he received the [[Abraham Pais Prize for History of Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Abraham Pais Prize for History of Physics Recipient|website=American Physical Society|url=https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Franklin&amp;first_nm=Allan&amp;year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected in 1988 a Fellow of [[American Physical Society]] and was twice the chair of the Society's Forum for the History of Science. in 2000 he was a Miegunyah Distinguished Fellow at the [[University of Melbourne]].

'''Aubert le Mire''', [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] '''Aubertus Miraeus''' (30 November 1573&amp;nbsp;– 19 October 1640) was an ecclesiastical historian in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].

==Life==
Miraeus was born in [[Brussels]]. After studying at [[University of Douai|Douai]] and [[Old University of Leuven|Leuven]] he was made canon of [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Antwerp cathedral]] in 1608 and secretary to his uncle, [[Joannes Miraeus]], who was then Bishop of Antwerp. In 1611 he was appointed [[almoner]] and librarian to [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert of Austria]], then sovereign of the Netherlands, and in 1624 he became [[dean (Christianity)|dean]] of the cathedral of Antwerp and [[vicar general]] of the diocese. He remained in Antwerp until his death. He wrote numerous works in the fields of history, ecclesiastical history, and related disciplines. Some have suggested that his works lack thoroughness and accuracy.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The '''circumscription theory''' is a  theory of the role of warfare in [[state formation]] in [[political anthropology]], created by anthropologist [[Robert L. Carneiro|Robert Carneiro]]. The theory has been summarized in one sentence by Schacht: “In areas of circumscribed agricultural land, population pressure led to warfare that resulted in the evolution of the state”.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Robert M., “Circumscription Theory: A Critical Review,” American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 439, March/April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graber, Robert B., and Paul Roscoe, “Introduction: Circumscription and the Evolution of Society,” American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 406, March/April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The more circumscribed is an agricultural area, Carneiro argues, the sooner it politically unifies.

==Outline of the theory==

The theory begins with some assumptions. Warfare usually disperses people rather than uniting them. Environmental circumscription occurs when an area of productive agricultural land is surrounded by a less productive area such as the mountains, desert, or sea. Application of [[extensive agriculture]] would bring severely diminishing returns.

If there is no environmental circumscription, then losers in a war can migrate out from the region and settle somewhere else. If there is environmental circumscription, then losers in warfare are forced to submit to their conquerors, because migration is not an option and the populations of the conquered and conqueror are united. The new state organization strives to alleviate the population pressure by increasing the productive capacity of agricultural land through, for instance, more intensive cultivation using irrigation.

==Primary and secondary state development==

''Primary state development'' occurred in the six original states of the Nile Valley, Peru, Mesoamerican, Yellow River Valley China, Indus River Valley, and Mesopotamia. ''Secondary state development'' occurred in states that developed from contact with already existing states. Primary state development occurred in areas with environmental circumscription.

The presumption, under the Carneiro Hypothesis, is that agricultural intensification, and the social coordination and coercion necessary to achieve this end was a result of warfare in which vanquished populations could not disperse; the coercive coordination necessary for increased production of surplus is, under Carneiro's hypothesis, a causal factor in the origins of the State.  For example, the mountainous river valleys of Peru which descend to the Pacific coast were severely environmentally circumscribed. Amazonian populations could always disperse and maintain sparse contact with other, potentially hostile, neighbors, whereas Andean coastal populations could not.

==Criticism==

Carneiro's theory has been criticized by the Dutch "early state school" emerging in the 1970s around cultural anthropologist [[Henri J. M. Claessen|Henri J.M. Claessen]], on the ground that considerable contrary evidence can be found to Carneiro's theory. There are also cases of circumscribed environments and violent cultures which have failed to develop states, for example in the narrow highland valleys of interior Papua New Guinea, or the north west Pacific coastlines of North America.  Also for example, the formation of some early states in East Africa, Sri Lanka, and Polynesia do not easily fit with Carneiro's model. Hence Claessen's school developed a "complex interaction model" to explain early state formation, in which factors such as ecology, social and demographic structures, economic conditions, conflicts, and ideology become aligned in ways which favour state organisation.&lt;ref&gt;For some other criticisms see, e.g., [https://www.academia.edu/30911274/Circumscription_Theory_of_the_Origins_of_the_State_A_Cross-Cultural_Re-Analysis Circumscription Theory of the Origins of the State: A Cross-Cultural Re-Analysis. ''Cliodynamics'' 7/2 (2016): 187–203].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development and revision==

The theory has since been applied to many other contexts, with some arguing it can be applied globally.&lt;ref&gt;One of the leading experts on [[world-systems theory]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], noted in 1990 that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system. "World State Formation: Historical Processes and Emergent Necessity," California: Institute for research on World System, working paper 1, 1990, http://irows.ucr.edu/papers/irows1.txxt&lt;/ref&gt; Carneiro has since also revised his theory in various ways. He has argued that population ''concentration'' can act as a lower level impetus for tribal conflict than geographic circumscription. He has also argued that, in addition to the necessities of conquest, a more important reason for creation of chiefdoms was the rise of war chiefs who use their military loyalists to [[coup d'etat|take over a group of villages]] and become [[Paramount chief|paramount chiefs]].&lt;ref name="Car2012"&gt;Carneiro, Robert. 2012. [https://www.socionauki.ru/journal/files/seh/2012_2/005-030.pdf The Circumscription Theory: A Clarification, Amplification, and Reformulation]. Social Evolution &amp; History 11(2): 5–30&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1551">King [[Francis I of France]] issued the '''Edict of Coucy''' on July 16, 1535, ending the persecution of [[Protestants]] that followed [[Nicolas Cop]]'s speech on November 1, 1533 calling for reform in the [[Catholic Church]], and the provocative placards that were posted almost a year later in [[Paris]] and elsewhere, attacking the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] as a [[blasphemy]]. Backed by the king, some dissenters were jailed, twenty-four were executed, and over seventy fled, including Cop and his friend [[John Calvin]]. 

The '''Edict of Coucy''' freed all of the jailed, and offered amnesty to the exiles. The "Sacramentarians", who held to [[Zwingli]]'s view of the [[Eucharist]] (which had appeared on the placards), were included only if they would repudiate their anti-Romanist views. Francis sought by the edict to assuage the anger of some [[Germans|German]] Protestant princes with whom he was attempting to form an alliance, which ultimately failed. Even so, he extended pardon to the Sacramentarians in 1536.

'''Eppstein''' is a town in the [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]], in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].

==Geography==

===Geographical situation===
Eppstein lies west of [[Frankfurt am Main]], around 12&amp;nbsp;km north east of the state capital [[Wiesbaden]], and is at the edge of the [[Taunus]] mountains.

===Neighbouring municipalities and areas===
To the north, Eppstein borders the city of [[Idstein]] ([[Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis]]) and the municipality of [[Glashütten (Taunus)|Glashütten]] ([[Hochtaunuskreis]]). To the east is the city of [[Kelkheim (Taunus)|Kelkheim]], to the south the city of [[Hofheim am Taunus|Hofheim]], and to the west the city of [[Wiesbaden]] and the municipality of [[Niedernhausen]].

===City arrangement===
Eppstein consists of five areas: Bremthal, Ehlhalten, Eppstein, Niederjosbach and Vockenhausen.

====Bremthal====
[[File:Eppstein.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Eppstein and the ruin of Castle Eppstein, between 1890 and 1905]]
[[File:102-0225 IMGa 1.JPG|thumb|220px|Eppstein and the Wernerplatz, in the centre of the old town.]]

Bremthal has a rapid-transit railway stop on line S2. With approximately 5000 inhabitants, Bremthal is the most populous quarter of Eppstein, and is the economic and cultural centre. Bremthal has several associations e.g. a brass band, Germania singing association, Liederkranz singing association, an association of small animal breeders and a volunteer [[fire brigade]].

Bremthal was founded by the [[Lords of Eppstein]] in the 10th/11th century because the narrow valley around their castle did not allow for arable land. Bremthal's church, St. Margareta, was built in 1889. The church has a baptismal font (1749) from an earlier church on the site.

A small skate park and forest adventure path off the Wildsachsenerstraße are fun for children.

====Niederjosbach====
Niederjosbach has a rapid-transit railway stop on line S2 as well as a bus connection to the Wiesbadener transportation network.

Motorway connections are about 3 minutes away. In Niederjosbach is a large campsite, the very well-maintained terrace-like "Taunuscamp", which is on the Sonnenhang. It is open all year round. The GCC - Gusbacher Carnevalsclub - organizes several meetings annually, and on "carnival Tuesday", a noteworthy parade by the village's local associations; two sport clubs, two singing clubs, a fruit and horticulture club, church choir, fire-brigade, "Gusbacher chaoten" (carnival parade organisers), federation of housewives, German Red Cross local association and neighbourhood municipalities. There is an industrial area and several craft enterprises, as well as an urban [[kindergarten]] with three groups. The Catholic community centre "Am Honigbaum" ("at the honey tree") is used for church and also for private and other social meetings. The place has been part of Eppstein since 1972. The Niederjosbach [[coat of arms]] has a silver fir tree on a red background.

====Vockenhausen====
Vockenhausen is the seat of the mayor. It has around 4500 people. The administration is distributed between the two city halls in Vockenhausen and Eppstein. On the Vockenhäuser "Gemarkung" are the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Schule (comprehensive school) and the Burg-Schule (primary school).

This "Stadtteil" of Eppstein was founded around 1100 by the [[Lords of Eppstein]] and belonged to them until they died out in 1535. Historically, the area was a site for manufacturing. A number of mills (e.g. for grinding grain, dye-making, leather-tanning, and iron extraction) made use of the stream that runs through the town.

The sculpture before the Vockenhausen turn-off between Alt-Eppstein and Bremthal is a reminder of Vockenhausen's "Schmelzmühle" (smelting mill) as well as Vockenhausen's two well-known artists Robert and Ella Bergmann-Michel, who lived at the mill from the 1920s until their deaths.

The sunny hillside of Vockenhausen is home to many families and Eppstein's elementary and middle schools; the valley has a number of traditional German, as well as Greek, Italian, and Chinese restaurants, a few bakeries, guest houses, hair salons, doctors' offices, a tanning and waxing salon, drugstores, dry cleaners/post office, and local grocery stores.

The "Bergstraße" — also called the "Schmerzberg" ("Pain Mountain") during an annual 1 May bike race — goes over the hill to Alt-Eppstein.

====Ehlhalten====
Ehlhalten is the part with the fewest number of inhabitants (about 1350) but the largest area due to its rather big forests. According to legend, Ehlhalten once provided a cutter that tailors used at the water of the brook in Ehlhalten. As the water rose and fell, affecting the measurement of the inch, people cried: "Elle halten!" ("hold the inch!"), leading to the name Ehlhalten.

Ehlhalten was also the name of a settlement in the municipal forest near a [[Source (river or stream)|source]]. It was burned down however by soldiers and destroyed completely. In 2004 Ehlhalten competed in the final of the series "Dolles Dorf" on [[Hessischer Rundfunk|hr]] television, winning a 3rd prize in this show about different villages in Hesse.

==Economy==

===Transport===
[[Eppstein station]] is on the [[Main-Lahn Railway]] and is served by [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|line S 2]] of the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]], running between [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] and [[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]] via Frankfurt and the town is around 3&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3 Autobahn]]. [[Bundesstraße 455]] passes through the town.

===Local industry===
The Stanniolfabrik Eppstein is in the central part Eppstein, beneath the castle. They are manufacturing [[tin foil]] and similar metal foils for highly specialised applications. It has become famous due to an appearance in the television series [[MythBusters]], because they supplied lead foil for the lead ballon myth.

RUCO printing inks (A. M. Ramp &amp; Co GmbH) also has a facility here.

==Education==
''for the educational system in Germany, see [[Education in Germany]]''

Eppstein has two [[primary school]]s and one [[comprehensive school]]. In addition, the Hessen-Thüringen bank academy is located here. The Eppstein-Rossert music school and the Eppstein music society offer instruction in various [[musical instrument]]s.

===Primary schools===
In Eppstein Vockenhausen, near the training and sports centre at the Bienroth, is the "Burg-Schule" (''castle school''). It is somewhat larger with approx. 300 pupils than the "Commenius-Schule," which is the primary school for pupils from Eppstein's parts Bremthal and Niederjosbach.

===Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gesamtschule===
Eppstein's comprehensive school, the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gesamtschule, is located at the sports and school centre "Am Bienroth". Five-hundred and sixty students in the fifth to tenth years attend the school, which is divided into three sections: [[Hauptschule]] (year 5 to 9),  [[Realschule]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (both year 5 to 10).
A special feature of the school is the annual exchange of students with Eppstein's twinned town of [[Kenilworth]], [[England]], as well as a school in [[Tours]], [[France]]. Every two years the school also hosts an exchange with the Bornova Anadolu Lisesi in [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]].

The school is known for a [[Eppstein school shooting|tragic attack]]: on 3 June 1983 a man shot three children, one teacher and a police officer dead. The attacker then committed suicide. 14 were injured.

==Town partnerships==
Eppstein is twinned with four different towns:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eppstein.de Website Eppstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
[[File:Burg Eppstein-JR-F-8-B-28a-2002-06-02.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Ruins of Eppstein castle. View from north-western direction]]
The ruins of the Eppstein castle (first mention in 1122--"Ebbensten") give character to the old city centre of Eppstein.

The museum in Eppstein's castle is in the one building within the castle walls which was spared breakup in the early 19th century. You'll notice the baroque altar in the back, which Eppstein's Catholics acquired when they used the building as their chapel after the valley church (Talkirche) became Protestant during the Reformation. Upstairs are some books written by early travel writers who refer to Eppstein, including a copy of Dumas's Le chateau d'Eppstein, as well as paintings of the castle, some painted by members of one of the first painters' colonies in Germany—the "Kronberger Malerkolonie."
At the foot of the castle, in the middle of the historical old city, is the Talkirche (Valley Church), which today accommodates Eppstein's evangelical parish.

Eppstein's turn-of-the-century train station (1903) has been newly renovated and houses not only an RMV counter (Rhine-Main bus and commuter train information counter), the Bürgerbüro (citizens' information center), but also a restaurant/cafe.

The Villa Anna, above the train station, was built  in the 1880s by the wealthy Frankfurt businessman Alfred von Neufville. Its grounds were designed by the famous landscaper Andreas Weber (who also designed the Frankfurt Zoo). With 200 exotic trees and bushes, its park is one of only two "Bergparks" (mountainside parks) in all of Hesse.

The Neufville Tower was built by the Neufvilles to house their private art collection and to serve as their "Jagdhaus" (hunting lodge).

Eppstein's beautification society keeps up a number of scenic overlooks, most of them built over a century ago during the flowering of Eppstein as a "Luftkurort" (climatic spa town).

The "Pionier-Tempel," an iron structure, earlier nicknamed the "omnibus" or "tram temple," is a five-minute walk from the train station. It was built in 1889 by the 2nd company of the "pionier" (engineer) battalion XI from Mainz-Kastel. In four days, 500 men cut the forest path between the Eppstein train station and Wildsachsen for the transport of timber. When they finished, in keeping with the late 18th-century English tradition of landscape gardens dotted by gazebos and observation points, they built the scenic overlook.

The Kaisertempel with its Doric columns was built in 1894 as a memorial to commemorate the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870/71), which unified the German Empire under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. From the temple, there is a wonderful view of Eppstein as far as Bremthal.

==Meetings==
The annual [[bicycle race]] '''[[Rund um den Henninger-Turm]]''' (around the Henninger tower) runs through Eppstein, on the first of May each year.

Since 2003 the Taunus Trails [[mountain bike]] marathon, open to everyone, takes place each summer.

Regular events at the castle include the Burgfestspiele (castle festival) in summer. In the inner court of the castle, drama groups present classic works as well as new productions. Another notable highlight is the Saxdays.

'''Alan Geoffrey Serle''' {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|AO|FAHA|FASSA}} (10 March 1922 – 27 April 1998), known as Geoff, was an Australian historian, who is best known for his books on the colony of Victoria; ''The Golden Age'' (1963) and ''The Rush to be Rich'' (1971) and his biographies of [[John Monash]], [[John Curtin]] and [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]].&lt;ref&gt;http://john.curtin.edu.au/events/speeches/serlebio.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Kirsop (1998) ''The La Trobe Journal'', No 61, autumn 1998, State Library of Victoria Foundation. {{ISSN|0041-3151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Serle was born on 10 March 1922, in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]], the son of [[Percival Serle]] and Dora, née Hake. He attended [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] and briefly read history at the [[University of Melbourne]] before joining the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] in 1941. He was seriously wounded in action at [[Finschhafen]], [[New Guinea]]. He was discharged in 1944, and resumed study at the University of Melbourne, also being active in the University Labour Club. In 1946, he completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree and won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]]. This enabled him to enter [[University College, Oxford]], where he graduated with a doctorate in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;http://adb.anu.edu.au/node/54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
From 1950 Serle taught Australian History at the [[University of Melbourne]], and after 1961 was Reader in History at the newly established [[Monash University]]. His first book appeared in 1957; ''The Melbourne Scene'' was a selection of documents relating to Victoria and was edited with James Grant.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Serle and James Grant (1957) ''The Melbourne Scene 1803–1956.'' Melbourne University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Serle was active in the establishment of the Victorian branch of the [[Australian Fabian Society]] and in establishing the [[Friends of the La Trobe Library]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Kirsop(1998)''The La Trobe Journal'', No 61, autumn 1998, State Library of Victoria Foundation.{{ISSN|0041-3151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also closely associated with [[Meanjin]] and [[Overland (literary journal)|Overland]] magazines. Serle also edited Volumes 7–11 of the [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] (Volumes 7–10 with Bede Nairn).&lt;ref&gt;http://adb.anu.edu.au/node/54&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ritchie's entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography makes pointed reference to Serle's passion for Australia. When Ritchie sent him a letter from London in 1972 "extolling the virtues of England, [Serle] sent a postcard in reply: on one side it had a painting by [[Tom Roberts]], on the other he wrote, ''aut Australia, aut nihil''."&lt;ref&gt;Meaning roughly "Either Australia or nothing." Recounted in http://adb.anu.edu.au/node/54&lt;/ref&gt;

Serle was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] in 1986. He married Jessie Macdonald in 1955, and together they had a daughter and three sons.

'''Geoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex''' (d 1166) was an English nobleman, the second son of [[Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex]] and [[Rohese de Vere, Countess of Essex]].

==Life==
During or soon after during his father's rebellion against [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] 1143-1144, young Geoffrey was sent or made his way to Devizes, a base of the [[Empress Matilda]].  After the earl's death, the empress recognized the right of Geoffrey III to the earldom of Essex and the vast Mandeville holdings.&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of the Foundation of Walden Monastery," ed. Watkiss &amp; Greenway (Oxford: 1999), p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;  His whereabouts during the remaining years of King Stephen's reign are unknown. In January 1156 [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] confirmed Geoffrey's title as earl of Essex and the Mandeville lands, but not those lands or offices granted to his father during the civil war.

The earl served as an itinerant royal justice with Richard de Lucy in 1165-1166, visiting many of the counties of England.  In 1166 he was engaged in preparations for a royal campaign in Wales when he fell ill and died in September or October.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Eyton, ''Court, household, and itinerary of King Henry II'' (London: 1878), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried at Walden Priory in Essex, a monastery founded by his father. Geoffrey was succeeded by his brother, [[William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex]].

==Family==
Earl Geoffrey married a kinswoman of King Henry, Eustachia, but when she complained that her husband would not live with her, the king helped her obtain an [[annulment]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of the Foundation of Walden Monastery," pp. xxi-xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple were apparently childless.

{{Aromanians}}
This article is about the '''history of the [[Aromanians]]'''. For the history of Northern [[Vlachs]] ([[Romanians]]), see [[History of Romania]].

==Origins==

[[Vlachs]] originate from the Romanised people of south-eastern [[Europe]]; from a mix of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colonists (from various [[Roman provinces]]) and indigenous peoples who were Latinised.  The Vlach peoples from the south [[Balkans]] have generally been identified as the indigenous populations with Thracian &amp; Illyrian (Thraco-Illyrian) and Greco-Roman (Hellenic) origins. Many Vlachs settled into the less-accessible mountainous areas of Greece and other areas in the Balkans because of the barbarian (Germanic, Slavic, Avar and Bulgar) invasions and immigrations of the 5th-7th centuries. Their more exact place of origin is hard to determine, as they can be found all over the [[Balkan peninsula]]. [[Aromanians]] can be found in [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]], while [[Romanians]] in [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], [[Serbia]] and [[Hungary]]. Their occupations were mostly [[trade|trading]], live-stock breeding, [[shepherd]]ing and [[Artisan|craftsmanship]]. It is not known exactly when the Vlachs who were the ancestors of present-day Aromanians broke off from the general body of Vlach people; historians point to a period between the 5th and 9th centuries.

==History==

===Byzantine period===
In these times, their migratory lifestyle earned them a bad reputation. In 980 emperor [[Basil II]] conferred the dominion over the Vlachs of Thessaly on one Nicoulitza. The Vlachs in Thessaly and parts of Macedonia became very numerous during the 11th century revolt of the Vlachs in 1066 under their chieftain Verivoi, as attested by the Byzantine historian [[Kekaumenos]], would provide total independence. As Kekaumenos records, a first revolt against imperial rule occurred in 1066, but it was not until after the collapse of the Empire in the [[Fourth Crusade]] that the Vlachs would set up their own, autonomous, principality - "[[Great Wallachia]]".&lt;ref&gt;D. Seward and S. Mountgarret - Byzantium: A Journey and a Guide; Harrap, London 1985 (p.183 etc.): '' Metsovo is the Greek capital of this shepherd race. After the Empire's temporary collapse in 1204 the Vlachs even set up their own kingdom of Great Wallachia''&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicles of [[Nicetas Choniates]], [[Benjamin of Tudela]],&lt;ref&gt;Libro de Viages de Benjamin de Tudela, Volume VIII, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffroy de Villehardouin]], Henri de Valenciennes, Robert de Clary, and other sources account for the existence of this state, comprising Thessaly, as opposed to other two "Wallachias", "Little Wallachia" in Acarnania and Aetolia, and an "Upper Wallachia" in Epirus. This coincides with the period of the first [[Vlachs|Vlachian]] state entities across the Balkan Peninsula: Great Wallachia, [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]. Benjamin of Tudela, a Spanish Jew who visited Thessaly in 1173, describes the Vlachs as living in the mountains and coming down from them to attack the Greeks. In relation with the Byzantine Empire, he adds: "no Emperor can conquer them".&lt;ref&gt;Libro de Viages de Benjamin de Tudela.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman period===
During the Ottoman period, Aromanian culture and economic power became more evident, as Vlachs concentrated in major urban centers. For example, the city of [[Moscopole]] at that time was one of the largest cities of the Balkans, having a population of 60,000 (for comparison, at that time [[Athens]] was a village inhabited by 8,000 people). Moscopole had its own printing houses and academies, flowing water and sewerage network. They enjoyed some degree of religious and cultural autonomy within the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Greek Orthodox millet]] (a Turkish term for a legally protected ethnic and religious minority groups). They enjoyed a special status, being formally exempted from the law prohibiting non-Muslims from carrying weapons,&lt;ref&gt;N. Malcolm: “Bosnia: A Short History, p. 66.”&lt;/ref&gt; only having to pay a modest [[tribute]] to the Ottomans. In 1778 however, Moscopole was nearly razed to the ground by the troops of [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena|Ali Pasha]]. This episode and the Orthodox religion of the Vlachs were the factors which caused a violent and energetic struggle against the Ottomans, assigning to the Vlachs a major role in the various wars and revolutions against Ottoman rule that culminated in the creation of the states which they now inhabit: Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Greece.

People of Aromanian origin were to be found among the protagonists of early Greek political life, as they found opportunities to establish themselves in this new state. This is explained by the fact that many Aromanians, who, as mentioned, belonged to the Greek Orthodox millet, adopted the Greek language under the influence of the Greek schools and churches, the only ones entitled by the Ottomans to function and to by maintained by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople]]. Thus, in Ottoman eyes, they were practically equated with Greeks. For instance, the future [[Patriarch Athenagoras]], born in Ottoman [[Epirus]], was considered a Greek by descent. But some Vlachs wanted to preserve their language, customs and culture, and as might be expected there was a strong reaction against this policy of Hellenization. Sir [[Charles Eliot (diplomat)|Charles Eliot]] clearly states his work "Turkey in Europe" that "...The Bulgarians, Serbs and Vlachs have [[millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millets]] of their own and do not cooperate in the Hellenic cause" and that "we hear of Vlach bands who are said to contend (fight against) Greeks in the region of Karaferia (Veria)"".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Charles Eliot: “Turkey in Europe”, London 1908, re-printed: Frank Cass &amp; Co. Ltd - London 1965, pp.370-379;&lt;/ref&gt; There was also pressure on Aromanians to become linguistically assimilated, which can be traced back to the 18th century, when assimilation efforts were encouraged by the Greek missionary [[Cosmas of Aetolia]] (1714-1779) who taught that Aromanians should speak Greek because as he said ''"it's the language of our Church"'' and established over 100 Greek schools in northern and western Greece. The offensive of the clergy against the use of Aromanian was by no means limited to religious issues but was a tool devised in order to convince the non-Greek speakers to abandon what they regarded as a "worthless" idiom and adopt the superior Greek speech: ''"There we are [[Metsovon|Metsovian]] brothers, together with those who are fooling themselves with this sordid and vile Aromanian language... forgive me for calling it a language"'', ''"repulsive speech with a disgusting diction"''.&lt;ref&gt;Neofytos Doukas, "Logos peri katastaseos skholeion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thede Kahl, Ethnizität und räumliche Verteilung der Aromunen in Südeuropa. Münster, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the destruction of their major urban centers, historiography speaks about a "re-pastoralization" of the Vlachs, returning to their basic traditional occupation, animal husbandry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Several thousands of Vlachs, many of them belonging to the Aromanian intelligentsia, emigrated northward to Wallachia, Moldavia, Serbia or the Habsburg Empire (notably to [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]]).

===Awakening of the Aromanian identity, and Romanian sponsorship===
Their arrival there coincided with the spreading in Europe of the ideals of the [[French Revolution]]: nationhood, equality, mother tongue and "human rights". In Habsburg-occupied [[Transylvania]], they would connect with the latinophile Romanian intelligentsia, as part of what was known as the [[Transylvanian School]]. These intellectuals promoted the ideas which would spark the period known as the [[National awakening of Romania]], which, after a century's time ceased to be under ''de jure'' Ottoman rule. It is in these times that Aromanian personalities became prominent, such as Gheorghe Roja, the author of ''"Untersuchungen uber die Romanier oder sogenannten Wlachen, welche jenseits der Donau wohnen"'' ("Researches upon the Romanians or the so-called Vlachs, who live beyond the Danube"; Pesth, 1808). The first attempt to create a literary language for those described as "Macedo-Romanians" was Roja's ''"Maiestria ghiovasirii romanesti cu litere latinesti, care sant literele Romanilor ceale vechi"''(Buda, 1809). Another Vlach emigrant was Mihail G. Boiagi. In 1813, he would publish in Vienna the book ''"Aromunisch oder Mazedowalachisch Sprachlehre"'' (Aromanian or Macedo-Vlach grammar). In the foreword to his work, Boiagi wrote: ''"Even if the Vlachs would claim, say, [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentot]] origin, even in that case they ought to have the right and duty to cultivate themselves in their mother tongue, as the most appropriate way to fulfill their creed"''. The Metsovo-born D.D. Cozacovici would publish in 1865 in Bucharest the ''"Gramatica Romaneasca tra Romanilii dit drepta Dunarelei lucrata de D. Athanasescu, si typarita cu spesele D.D. Cosacovici, Roman din Metsova, spre an inaugura prima scoala Romana din Macedonia"'' ("Romanian Grammar to serve the Romanians South of the Danube worked by D. Athanasescu and printed from the donations of D.D. Cozacovici, Romanian of Metsovo, in order to inaugurate the first Romanian school of Macedonia").

A century later, almost 100 Romanian schools were opened in the Ottoman territories of Macedonia and Albania, starting as early as 1860. It is noted that this initiative was proposed by the Aromanian Diaspora living in Bucharest. The first nucleus of the Vlach schooling in Macedonia and Pindus was to be established in 1860 and its initiators were a group of Aromanians then living in [[Bucharest]]: D.D. Cozacovici (native of Metsovo), Zisu Sideri, Iordache Goga (native of Klissoura) and others. Together they initiated the "Society for Macedo-Romanian Culture", under the endorsement of the then Romanian ruling class. "Societatea Culturala Macedo-Romana" ("The Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society") had as its members (together with its Aromanian founding core represented by D.D. Cozacovici, Sideri, Goga, Grandea etc.) also the acting Prime and Foreign Ministers, as well as the Head of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], and the elite of the Romanian political class: [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [[Ion Ghica]], [[Constantin Rosetti]], etc.

[[File:ValacosDeMacedonia--bulgariaherpeopl00monr.png|thumb|200px|Macedonian Vlachs, circa 1914.]]

One of the greatest figures during the Aroumanian awakening was [[Apostol Margarit]], a native of [[Avdela]] in southern Macedonia, on the slopes of the Pindus mountains. As early as 1862, Apostol Margarit introduced the vernacular in the school of the large prosperous town of Klissoura (''Vlaho-Klisura''), in the Kastoria region of Macedonia. Nicepheros, the Greek bishop of Kastoria tried for many years to close down the school, but without success. In December, 1879, the first unsuccessful attempt on the life of Apostol Margarit took place. Margarit was wounded during a second attempt on his life during December 1890. There were Vlach schools in [[Klissoura]], [[Krushevo]], [[Nizepole]], [[Trnovo, Bitola|Trnovo]], [[Gopesh]], [[Ohrid]], old [[Avdela]] in the Pindus mountains and new [[Avdela]] near [[Veria]]. Later more schools were founded in Macedonia, and then a Vlach high school was established in Bitola(Monastir) in the 1880s. The Greeks were naturally alarmed by the national reawakening of the Vlachs. At their peak, just before the [[Balkan Wars]],there were 6 secondary gymnasiums, and 113 primary schools, teaching in Vlach. Due to the ongoing pressures from the Greek Church in the Ottoman provinces of [[Rumelia]], Vlachs and their schools were viewed with suspicion. In 1880 Greek guerrillas attacked some villages near Resen because the village priests had committed the unpardonable sin of using Vlach in the church services. In the same year the Greek bishop of Kastoria had the schoolmaster in Klissoura arrested because he taught in the Vlahs'native language. A momentous date in the history of the Vlachs was May 23, 1905, when the Sultan issued a decree officially recognizing the Vlachs and affirming their rights to maintain their schools and churches. Following the proclamation of the decree, the Greek bishops, and the armed bands they supported, unleashed a campaign of terror on the Aromanians to discourage them from taking advantage of their rights. In 1905, the Vlach abbot of the Holy Archangel monastery in the Meglen region was murdered by a Greek band. In the summer of 1905 some villages near Bitola were attacked. On October 27, 1905, Greek guerillas attacked the village of Avdela in the Pindus, birthplace of Apostol Margarit, and razed it to the ground. Then in 1906, in the town of Véria(''Berea''), the priest Papanace was murdered as he was on his way to church to serve the Divine Liturgy in Vlach. The Romanian Vlach school in the village of Avdhela in Pindus, which was one of the first Romanian sponsored Vlach schools, active as early as 1867, was burned and razed to the ground on 27 October 1905 by Greek [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Papanace: “A Memorandum to the United Nations in favour of the Macedo-Romanians”, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; This event prompted street anti-Greek demonstrations in Bucharest in the autumn of 1905 of the Aromanians living there, and a rupture of diplomatic relations between Romania and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition; 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania, with the support of Austro-Hungary, succeeded in the acceptance of Vlachs as a separate [[millet]] (ethno-religious community) with the decree ([[Irade-i senniye|irade]]) of May 22, 1905 by [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdulhamid]], so the "Ullah millet" ('''Vlach Millet''') could have its own churches and schools.&lt;ref name="Kahl"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ebpDLhkVWcC&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=aromanians%20millet&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=aromanians%20millet&amp;f=false The ethnicity of Aromanians after 1990: the Identity of a Minority that Behaves like a Majority], Thede Kahl, Ethnologia Balkanica, Vol. 6 (2002), σελ. 148&lt;/ref&gt; This was a success of the Romanian national agitation policy in European Turkey in the last part of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rethinking Violence: States and Non-state Actors in Conflict|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7on0obGSuVIC|publisher = MIT Press|date = 2010|isbn = 9780262014205|language = en|first = Erica|last = Chenoweth|first2 = Adria|last2 = Lawrence|page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romania]] continued to subsidize schools until 1948, when the communist regime ended all links. George Padioti, an Aromanian author (born and living all his life in Greece) describes one of the last liturgy services in Vlach:

{{cquote|February 1952, the Aromanian Church 'Biserica ramana Santu Dumitru', burned by German troops in spring 1944. The priest Costa Bacou officiated the last allowed liturgy in Aromanian language. Afterwards, he was not permitted anymore because he refused to forcibly officiate the divine service in Greek language.&lt;ref&gt;George Ap. Padioti - Cantitii Farserotesti - Tragoudia Farsarioton Arvanitovlahon - Published by Etaireia Aromanikou (Vlahikou) Politismou, Athens: January 1991, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Sevold Braga in his treatise ''Die Aromunische Minderheit in Griechenland'' (Albumul Macedo-Roman II, Freiburg 1964), the Romanian help suddenly stopped with the coming of [[Communism]]. Braga's explanation was that in fact Romania had shown its true face, having used the Aromanians for its own purposes during the Ottoman rule, but afterwards throwing them away and disowning them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Greek historians, when mentioning the Vlachs that attended the Romanian-sponsored churches and schools of Macedonia, Epirus and parts of Albania, describe them as being victims of Romanian propaganda, suggesting that they sent their children to schools where they were taught that they are Romanians.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Due to the sponsoring of the schools, the Kingdom of Romania was accused by Greece of alliance with the Ottomans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Vlachs, recognized as a separate nation by the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], were for the first time incorporated in Greece only in 1881, when Thessaly and a part of Epirus were offered to Greece by the Great Powers. Having been split into two by the new borders, the bulk of the Vlachs of these province petitioned&lt;ref&gt;Sir Charles Eliot - "Turkey in Europe" - London 1908, re-printed 1965 (pp. 370-382; 430 - 441): ''"..After the Greco-Turkish war the Vlachs of Thessaly petitioned the Powers that they might be placed under Ottoman and not Greek Government." [...]&lt;/ref&gt; the Great Powers of the time to be let to stay within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire, but in vain. Greece followed a policy of creating a Greater Greece, according to the "[[Megali Idea]]". Most of the Aromanians became part of the Greek state in 1913 after the rest of Epirus and parts of Macedonia became part of Greece after the [[First Balkan War]].

Roughly at the same time, the first studies regarding the Aromanians were published by western observers. Among these, names like [[Rebecca West]], [[Osbert Lancaster]] or Sir [[Charles Eliot (diplomat)|Charles Eliot]]'s are worth to be mentioned. Lancaster, who visited Greece in 1947, stated:

{{cquote|Although Metsovo, with its gigantic plane tree in the middle of the little square, its stone paved streets and abundant gardens, is typical of many a village in Epirus, in respect of its inhabitants it is unique. The Vlachs, to which race this people belong, are nomads, claiming with some degree of probability to partial descent from the Roman colonists of the Danube valley. In former times they were far more numerous than to-day, occupying the larger part of Thrace and Macedonia and establishing in the twelfth century a Bulgaro-Vlach empire in Thessaly which survived in practical independence until the coming of the Turk.

Although for the most part herdsmen, horse-breeder and shepherds following their beasts from pasture to pasture and living in temporary encampments of round wattle huts, the existence of urban settlements, of which Metsovo is the most considerable, would seem to afford evidence that, their nomadism is not natural but acquired. In general they are fairer in complexion and more industrious in their habits than the Greeks whom they affect to despise.&lt;ref&gt;Osbert Lancaster - Classical Landscape with Figures - London, 1975, John Murray&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vlachs, this very interesting people are not Greek at all but a race of nomads, who come down from the Balkan lands in the winter with their flock and pass the cold months in Greece. They are shepherd by business, and their tribal name has become a sort of synonym for an ancient profession. Generally they are a people as kindly as they are picturesque, patriarchally hospitable and good sportsmen, as many an English Consul knows, and by no means ill favoured&lt;ref&gt;W.A. Wigram D.D. - Hellenic Travel, Faber and Faber Ltd., London 1947 (pp.109-11)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Interbellum and World War II===
The Inter-war period is of great interest regarding Aromanian history. The main event was the immigration of the Aromanians in the first decades of the 20th century. One of the reasons for the sudden departure of the Vlachs, had to do with the policies of the Greek state, who had to accommodate one and a half million of Greeks of Asia Minor following the 1923 [[exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey]]. In addition, the Romanian state had offered them land and privilleges, in order to populate its new province of [[Dobruja]], soon after annexing it from Bulgaria. The 25% of the region's population still traces its origins in Greece.

The last important episode concerns the [[Principality of Pindus]] episode. During [[World War II]], the [[Axis Occupation of Greece|Italian occupation of Greece]] provided an opportunity for some Aromanians to create what they called ''"Vlach homeland"''. This [[fascism|fascist]] puppet state would not survive even nominally past Italy's exit from the war in September 1943.

===Post-war situation in Greece===
Aromanians today come after more than 50 years after the closure of the last school and church in the Vlach language. The old term "Vlachos" is still used as a "pejorative" by Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;John Nandris - "The Aromani" (In "World Archaeology" 17/1985, p. 261)&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Regime of the Colonels]] fell in 1974 however, the first local cultural organizations were formed to prevent the extinction of the language and culture. These organisations never had government support. Aromanian language had never been included in the educational curriculum of Greece, as it had always been considered a vulgar language. On the contrary, their use has been strongly discouraged. Such attitudes have led many Vlach parents to discourage their children from learning their mother tongue in order to avoid discrimination and maltreatment.&lt;ref name=greekhelsinki&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report: The Vlachs |journal=Greek Monitor of Human &amp; Minority Rights |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=1995 |url=http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/vlachs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there is no education for Aromanian children in their [[mother tongue]], and there are no public television or radio stations broadcasting fully or partially in Aromanian.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe examined a report on the Aromanians in 1997 which reported the critical situation of the Aromanian language and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aromanians: Report - Document 7728 |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/doc97/edoc7728.htm |publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe |date=17 January 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806032315/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/doc97/edoc7728.htm |archivedate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted a recommendation that the Greek government should do whatever is necessary to respect their culture and facilitate education in Aromanian and to implement its use in schools, churches and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/AdoptedText/TA97/Erec1333.htm|title=Recommendation 1333 (1997) on the Aromanian culture and language|last=|first=|date=24 June 1997|website=|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706191124/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/AdoptedText/ta97/eREC1333.htm|archivedate=6 July 2011|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek Vlachs oppose the introduction of the language into the education system as [[European Union]] and leading Greek political figures have suggested, viewing it as an artificial distinction between them and other Greeks. For example, the former education minister, [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], received a negative response from Aromanian mayors and associations to his proposal for a trial Aromanian language education programme. The Panhellenic Federation of Cultural Associations of Vlachs (Πανελλήνια Ομοσπονδία Πολιτιστικών Συλλόγων Βλάχων) expressed strong opposition to EU's recommendation in 1997 that the tuition of Aromanian be supported so as to avoid its extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter to Chapters No. 167 |url=http://vlahos.xan.duth.gr/nea/180304.htm |publisher=Panhellenic Federation of Cultural Associations of Vlachs |language=Greek |date=18 March 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812154953/http://vlahos.xan.duth.gr/nea/180304.htm |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is a small minority within the community which strongly supports such efforts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} On a visit to [[Metsovo]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] in 1998, the Greek President [[Costis Stephanopoulos]] called on Aromanians to speak and teach their language, so as not to be lost. There are currently no schools or churches teaching and holding services in Aromanian language.

While many Aromanians identify themselves as both Vlachs and Greeks, a small segment of the native Vlach inhabitants of Greece identify themselves as fully separate from the [[Greeks]]. This appears to be the case of some of the more remote villages of Pindus, where, sheltered somehow from contact with the dominant Greek culture, the older generation of the Vlachs converses in a separate language and customs. Dr. Thede Kahl, whose broader perspective on the Aromanian community in Greece has been questioned by some nationalists, argues in his study ''"Ethnologica Balkanica ("The Ethnicity of Aromanians after 1990: the Identity of a Minority that Behaves like a Majority")":

{{cquote|There are still pro-Vlach Aromanians in Greece, especially in villages in which strong Vlach communities were once accepted by the Greek authorities, above all in Avdhela, Perivoli, Samarina, Vovusa, Krania, Edessa, Veria and surrounding areas, as well in a few villages in the district of Kastoria and Ioannina. On a whole, they are a minute and dwindling number of Aromanians.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Thede Kahl - Ethnologica Balkanica ("The Ethnicity of Aromanians after 1990: the Identity of a Minority that Behaves like a Majority" 6/2002, p.154)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Debate and discussion continues, with differing perspectives. Vlachs in Greece insist they are happy in practicing their dual identity. Some Vlachs outside Greece suggest difficulties may still be illustrated by the [[Sotiris Bletsas]] case.&lt;ref name=greekhelsinki /&gt; Bletsas was arrested in Greece while distributing copies of [[European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages]] material covering linguistic minorities in Greece at an Aromanian festival in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=It’s not Greek enough to them |url=http://www.vlachophiles.net/index_on_censorship.htm |date=13 July 2001 |publisher=Aromanian Vlachs: The Vanishing Tribes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204041012/http://www.vlachophiles.net/index_on_censorship.htm |archivedate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was put on trial on 2 February 2001 and was first convicted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parlaimentary Question - Subject: 15-month prison sentence handed down to Mr Sotiris Bletsas for distributing information material financed by the Commission |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/omk/sipade3?PROG=WQ&amp;L=EN&amp;PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2001-1325+0+DOC+SGML+V0//EN&amp;LEVEL=2 |publisher=European Parliament |date=3 May 2001 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was subsequently cleared on 18 October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Thede Kahl, Istoria Aromânilor, Editura Tritonic, 2005, Bucureşti, {{ISBN|973-733-041-2}}, p. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inanna'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɑː|n|ə}}; {{lang-sux|{{cuneiform|𒀭𒈹}}}} {{transl|sux|&lt;sup&gt;[[Dingir|D]]&lt;/sup&gt;inanna}}{{snf|Heffron|2016}}}} is an [[List of Mesopotamian deities|ancient Mesopotamian goddess]] associated with love, beauty, sex, desire, fertility, war, justice, and political power. She was originally worshipped in [[Sumer]] and was later worshipped by the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylonians]], and [[Assyria]]ns under the name '''Ishtar'''.{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|ʃ|t|ɑːr|}}; {{transl|sux|&lt;sup&gt;[[Dingir|D]]&lt;/sup&gt;ištar}}{{sfn|Heffron|2016}}}} She was known as the "[[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]" and was the patron goddess of the [[Eanna]] temple at the city of [[Uruk]], which was her main cult center. She was associated with the planet [[Venus]] and her most prominent symbols included the [[Lion of Babylon|lion]] and the [[Star of Ishtar|eight-pointed star]]. Her husband was the god [[Dumuzid]] (later known as Tammuz) and her ''sukkal'', or personal attendant, was the goddess [[Ninshubur]] (who later became the male deity [[Papsukkal]]).

Inanna was worshipped in [[Sumer]] at least as early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 BC – {{circa}} 3100 BC), but she had little cult prior to the conquest of [[Sargon of Akkad]]. During the post-Sargonic era, she became one of the most widely venerated deities in the Sumerian pantheon,{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xviii}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=182}} with temples across [[Mesopotamia]]. The cult of Inanna-Ishtar, which may have been associated with a variety of sexual rites, including [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] [[Transvestism|transvestite]] priests and [[sacred prostitution]], was continued by the [[East Semitic]]-speaking people who succeeded the Sumerians in the region. She was especially beloved by the Assyrians, who elevated her to become the highest deity in their pantheon, ranking above their own [[national god]] [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]. Inanna-Ishtar is alluded to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and she greatly influenced the [[Phoenicia]]n goddess [[Astarte]], who later influenced the development of the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Her cult continued to flourish until its gradual decline between the first and sixth centuries AD in the wake of [[Christianity]], though it survived in parts of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] as late as the eighteenth century.

Inanna appears in more myths than any other Sumerian deity.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xv}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=42–43}}{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}} Many of her myths involve her taking over the domains of other deities. She was believed to have stolen the ''[[Me (mythology)|mes]]'', which represented all positive and negative aspects of civilization, from [[Enki]], the god of wisdom. She was also believed to have taken over the Eanna temple from [[Anu|An]], the god of the sky. Alongside her twin brother [[Utu]] (later known as Shamash), Inanna was the enforcer of [[Divine judgment|divine justice]]; she destroyed Mount Ebih for having challenged her authority, unleashed her fury upon the gardener [[Shukaletuda]] after he [[rape]]d her in her sleep, and tracked down the bandit woman Bilulu and killed her in [[divine retribution]] for having murdered Dumuzid. In the standard [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian]] version of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Ishtar asks [[Gilgamesh]] to become her consort. When he refuses, she unleashes the [[Bull of Heaven]], resulting in the death of [[Enkidu]] and Gilgamesh's subsequent grapple with his mortality.

Inanna-Ishtar's most famous myth is the story of her descent into and return from ''[[Kur]]'', the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|ancient Sumerian Underworld]], a myth in which she attempts to conquer the domain of her older sister [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the Underworld, but is instead deemed guilty of [[hubris]] by the [[Anunnaki|seven judges of the Underworld]] and struck dead. Three days later, Ninshubur pleads with all the gods to bring Inanna back, but all of them refuse her except Enki, who sends two sexless beings to rescue Inanna. They escort Inanna out of the Underworld, but the ''[[gallu|galla]]'', the guardians of the Underworld, drag her husband Dumuzid down to the Underworld as her replacement. Dumuzid is eventually permitted to return to heaven for half the year while his sister [[Geshtinanna]] remains in the Underworld for the other half, resulting in the cycle of the seasons.

==Etymology==
Inanna and Ishtar were originally separate, unrelated deities,{{sfn|Mark|2011}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110–111}} but they were equated with each other during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] and came to be regarded as effectively the same goddess under two different names.{{sfn|Mark|2011}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110–111}} Inanna's name may derive from the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] phrase ''nin-an-ak'', meaning "Lady of Heaven",{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=86}}{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}} but the cuneiform sign for ''Inanna'' ({{cuneiform|𒈹}}) is not a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] of the signs ''lady'' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[EREŠ|nin]]; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|𒊩𒌆}} SAL.TUG&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''sky'' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[DINGIR|an]]; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|𒀭}} AN).{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=86}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xiii–xix}} These difficulties led some early [[Assyriologists]] to suggest that Inanna may have originally been a [[Proto-Euphratean]] goddess, possibly related to the [[Hurrian]] mother goddess [[Hannahannah]], who was only later accepted into the [[Sumerian pantheon]]. This idea was supported by Inanna's youthfulness, and as well as the fact that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she seems to have initially lacked a distinct sphere of responsibilities.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}} The view that there was a Proto-Euphratean substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists.{{snf|Rubio|1999|pages=1–16}}

The name ''Ishtar'' occurs as an element in personal names from both the pre-[[Sargon of Akkad|Sargonic]] and post-Sargonic eras in Akkad, Assyria, and Babylonia.{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} It is of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] derivation{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=96}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} and is probably etymologically related to the name of the [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] god [[Attar (god)|Attar]], who is mentioned in later inscriptions from [[Ugarit]] and southern Arabia.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=96}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} The morning star may have been conceived as a male deity who presided over the arts of war and the evening star may have been conceived as a female deity who presided over the arts of love.{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} Among the Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, the name of the male god eventually supplanted the name of his female counterpart,{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110–111}} but, due to extensive syncretism with Inanna, the deity remained as female, despite the fact that her name was in the masculine form.{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110–111}}

==Origins and development==
[[File:Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin 051.jpg|thumb|Copy of the [[Uruk Vase]] in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin, Germany{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=51}}]]

Inanna has posed a problem for many scholars of ancient Sumer due to the fact that her sphere of power contained more distinct and contradictory aspects than that of any other deity.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225–228}} Two major theories regarding her origins have been proposed.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The first explanation holds that Inanna is the result of a [[syncretism]] between several previously unrelated Sumerian deities with totally different domains.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The second explanation holds that Inanna was originally a [[Semitic deity]] who entered the Sumerian pantheon after it was already fully structured, and who took on all the roles that had not yet been assigned to other deities.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=228–229}}

As early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 – {{circa}} 3100 BC), Inanna was already associated with the city of [[Uruk]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} During this period, the symbol of a ring-headed doorpost was closely associated with Inanna.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} The famous [[Uruk Vase]] (found in a deposit of cult objects of the Uruk III period) depicts a row of naked men carrying various objects, including bowls, vessels, and baskets of farm products,{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=551}} and bringing sheep and goats to a [[female figure]] facing the ruler.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550–552}} The female stands in front of Inanna's symbol of the two twisted reeds of the doorpost,{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550–552}} while the male figure holds a box and stack of bowls, the later [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sign signifying the [[EN (cuneiform)|''En'']], or high priest of the temple.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=552–554}}

Seal impressions from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] ({{circa}} 3100 – {{circa}} 2900 BC) show a fixed sequence of symbols representing various cities, including those of [[Ur]], [[Larsa]], [[Zabalam]], [[Urum (Babylonia)|Urum]], [[Arina]], and probably [[Kesh (Sumer)|Kesh]].{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} This list probably reflects the report of contributions to Inanna at Uruk from cities supporting her cult.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} A large number of similar seals have been discovered from phase I of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic period]] ({{circa}} 2900 – {{circa}} 2350 BC) at [[Ur]], in a slightly different order, combined with the rosette symbol of Inanna.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} These seals were used to lock storerooms to preserve materials set aside for her cult.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}}

During the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian period]] ({{circa}} 2334 – 2154 BC), following the conquests of [[Sargon of Akkad]], Inanna and Ishtar became so extensively syncretized that they became regarded as effectively the same.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110–111}} The Akkadian poetess [[Enheduanna]], the daughter of Sargon, wrote numerous hymns to Inanna, identifying her with Ishtar.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=111}} Sargon himself proclaimed Inanna and An as the sources of his authority.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} As a result of this,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}} the popularity of Inanna-Ishtar's cult skyrocketed.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}

During the Pre-Sargonic era, Inanna had virtually no cult,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}} but, after the reign of Sargon, she quickly became one of the most widely venerated deities in the Sumerian pantheon.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=101}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xiii–xix}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=182}} She had temples in [[Nippur]], [[Lagash]], [[Shuruppak]], [[Zabalam]], and [[Ur]],{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}} but her main cult center was the [[Eanna]] temple in [[Uruk]],{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108–109}}{{sfn|Harris|1991|pages=261–278}}{{efn|modern-day Warka, Biblical [[Erech]]}} whose name means "House of Heaven" (Sumerian: e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-anna; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|𒂍𒀭}} E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.AN),{{efn|''é-an-na'' means "sanctuary" ("house" + "Heaven" ["An"] + genitive){{sfn|Halloran|2009}}}} The original patron deity of this fourth-millennium BC city was probably [[Anu|An]].{{sfn|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}} After its dedication to Inanna, the temple seems to have housed priestesses of the goddess.{{sfn|Harris|1991|pages=261–278}} During later times, while her cult in Uruk continued to flourish,{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=99}} Ishtar also became particularly worshipped in the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n kingdom of [[Assyria]] (modern northern [[Iraq]], northeast [[Syria]] and southeast [[Turkey]]), especially in the cities of [[Nineveh]], [[Assur|Aššur]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]] (modern Erbil).{{sfn|Guirand|1968|page=58}} During the reign of the Assyrian king [[Assurbanipal]], Ishtar rose to become the most important and widely venerated deity in the Assyrian pantheon, surpassing even the Assyrian national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]].{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=99}}

As Ishtar became more prominent, several lesser or regional deities were assimilated into her,{{snf|Monaghan|2014|page=39}} including [[Aya (goddess)|Aya]] (the wife of Utu), Anatu (a Semitic warrior goddess), Anunitu (an Akkadian light goddess), Agasayam (a warrior goddess), Irnini (the goddess of cedar forests in the Lebanese mountains), [[Burney Relief#Ishtar|Kilili]] or Kulili (the symbol of desirable women), Sahirtu (the messenger of lovers), Kir-gu-lu (the bringer of rain), and Sarbanda (the personification of sovereignty).{{snf|Monaghan|2014|page=39}}

[[Androgynous]] and [[hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]] men were heavily involved in the cult of Inanna-Ishtar.{{sfn|Leick|1994|pages=157–158}} During Sumerian times, a set of priests known as ''[[gala (priests)|gala]]'' worked in Inanna's temples, where they performed elegies and lamentations.{{sfn|Leick|1994|page=285}} ''Gala'' took female names, spoke in the ''[[Sumerian language#Dialects|eme-sal]]'' dialect, which was traditionally reserved for women, and appear to have engaged in [[Gay sexual practices|homosexual intercourse]].{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|page=65}} During the Akkadian Period, ''kurgarrū'' and ''assinnu'' were servants of Ishtar who [[cross-dressing|dressed in female clothing]] and performed war dances in Ishtar's temples.{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|pages=65–66}} Several Akkadian [[proverb]]s seem to suggest that they may have also had homosexual proclivities.{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|pages=65–66}} Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]''.{{sfn|Leick|1994|pages=158–163}} In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women.{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|page=66}}

According to the early scholar [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], towards the end of the third millennium BC, kings of Uruk may have established their legitimacy by taking on the role of the shepherd [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], Inanna's consort.{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}} This ritual lasted for one night on the tenth day of the [[Akitu]],{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=196}} the Sumerian new year festival,{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=196}} which was celebrated annually at the [[spring equinox]].{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}} The king would then partake in a "[[hieros gamos|sacred marriage]]" ceremony,{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}} during which he engaged in ritual sexual intercourse with the high priestess of Inanna, who took on the role of the goddess.{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=196}} In the late twentieth century, the historicity of the sacred marriage ritual was treated by scholars as more-or-less an established fact,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=128}} but, largely due to the writings of Pirjo Lapinkivi, many have begun to regard the sacred marriage as a literary invention rather than an actual ritual.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=128}}

The [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] of Ishtar may have involved [[sacred prostitution]],{{snf|Day|2004|pages=15–17}}{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|page=49}}{{sfn|Guirand|1968|page=58}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=193}} but this is disputed.{{sfn|Assante|2003|pages=14–47}}{{sfn|Day|2004|pages=2–21}}{{sfn|Sweet|1994|pages=85–104}} [[Hierodules]] known as ''ishtaritum'' are reported to have worked in Ishtar's temples,{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|page=49}} but it is unclear if such priestesses actually performed any [[sex act]]s{{sfn|Day|2004|pages=2–21}} and several modern scholars have argued that they did not.{{sfn|Sweet|1994|pages=85–104}}{{sfn|Assante|2003|pages=14–47}} Women across the ancient Near East worshipped Ishtar by dedicating to her cakes baked in ashes (known as ''kamān tumri'').{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|pages=116–117}} A dedication of this type is described in an Akkadian hymn.{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|page=115}} Several clay cake molds discovered at Mari are shaped like naked women with large hips clutching their breasts.{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|page=115}} Some scholars have suggested that the cakes made from these molds were intended as representations of Ishtar herself.{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|pages=115–116}}

}}

Inanna-Ishtar's most common symbol was the eight-pointed star,{{snf|Black|Green|1992|pp=156, 169–170}} though the exact number of points sometimes varies.{{sfn|Liungman|2004|page=228}} Six-pointed stars also occur frequently, but their symbolic meaning is unknown.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=170}} The eight-pointed star seems to have originally borne a general association with the heavens,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=169–170}} but, by the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1830 – {{circa}} 1531 BC), it had come to be specifically associated with the planet [[Venus]], with which Ishtar was identified.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=169–170}} Starting during this same period, the star of Ishtar was normally enclosed within a circular disc.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=170}} During later Babylonian times, slaves who worked in Ishtar's temples were sometimes branded with the seal of the eight-pointed star.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=170}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=193–194}} On [[kudurru|boundary stones]] and [[cylinder seals]], the eight-pointed star is sometimes shown alongside the [[crescent|crescent moon]], which was the symbol of [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] (Sumerian Nanna) and the rayed [[solar symbol|solar disk]], which was a symbol of [[Shamash]] (Sumerian Utu).{{sfn|Gressman|Obermann|1928|page=81}}{{sfn|Liungman|2004|page=228}}

Inanna's cuneiform [[ideogram]] was a hook-shaped twisted knot of reeds, representing the doorpost of the storehouse, a common symbol of fertility and plenty.{{sfn|Jacobsen |1976|page=}} The [[rosette (design)|rosette]] was another important symbol of Inanna, which continued to be used as a symbol of Ishtar after their syncretism.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=156}} During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]] (911 – 609 BC), the rosette may have actually eclipsed the eight-pointed star and become Ishtar's primary symbol.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=156–157}} The temple of Ishtar in the city of [[Aššur]] was adorned with numerous rosettes.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=156}}

Inanna-Ishtar was associated with lions,{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=118}}{{snf|Collins|1994|pages=113–114}} which the ancient Mesopotamians regarded as a symbol of power.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=118}} Her associations with lions began during Sumerian times;{{snf|Collins|1994|pages=113–114}} a chlorite bowl from the temple of Inanna at Nippur depicts a large feline battling a giant snake and a cuneiform inscription on the bowl reads "Inanna and the Serpent," indicating that the cat is supposed to represent the goddess.{{snf|Collins|1994|pages=113–114}} During the Akkadian Period, Ishtar was frequently depicted as a heavily armed warrior goddess with a lion as one of her attributes.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|pp=119}}

Doves were also prominent animal symbols associated with Inanna-Ishtar.{{sfn|Lewis|Llewellyn-Jones|2018|page=335}}{{sfn|Botterweck|Ringgren|1990|page=35}} Doves are shown on cultic objects associated with Inanna as early as the beginning of the third millennium BC.{{sfn|Botterweck|Ringgren|1990|page=35}} Lead dove figurines were discovered in the temple of Ishtar at Aššur, dating to the thirteenth century BC{{sfn|Botterweck|Ringgren|1990|page=35}} and a painted fresco from [[Mari, Syria]] shows a giant dove emerging from a palm tree in the temple of Ishtar,{{sfn|Lewis|Llewellyn-Jones|2018|page=335}} indicating that the goddess herself was sometimes believed to take the form of a dove.{{sfn|Lewis|Llewellyn-Jones|2018|page=335}}

===As the planet Venus===
Inanna was associated with the planet Venus.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108–109}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108–109}} Several hymns praise Inanna in her role as the goddess of the planet Venus.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}} Theology professor Jeffrey Cooley has argued that, in many myths, Inanna's movements may correspond with the movements of the planet Venus in the sky.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}} In ''Inanna's Descent to the Underworld'', unlike any other deity, Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens. The planet Venus appears to make a similar descent, setting in the West and then rising again in the East.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}} An introductory hymn describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for ''Kur'', what could be presumed to be, the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}} In ''Inanna and Shukaletuda'', Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the eastern and western horizons.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=163–164}} In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}}

Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the sun, for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as single entity;{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}} instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}} Nonetheless, a [[cylinder seal]] from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] indicates that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}} The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both mythology as well as Inanna's dual nature.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}}

Inanna in her aspect as Anunītu was associated with the eastern fish of the last of the zodiacal constellations, [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]].{{sfn|Foxvog|1993|page=106}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=34–35}} Her consort Dumuzi was associated with the contiguous first constellation, [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]].{{sfn|Foxvog|1993|page=106}}

The [[Sumer]]ians worshipped Inanna as the goddess of both warfare and sexuality.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} Unlike other gods, whose roles were static and whose domains were limited, the stories of Inanna describe her as moving from conquest to conquest.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225–228}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=15–17}} She was portrayed as young and impetuous, constantly striving for more power than she had been allotted.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225–228}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=15–17}}

Although she was worshipped as the goddess of love, Inanna was not the goddess of marriage, nor was she ever viewed as a mother goddess.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pp=108–9}}{{sfn|Leick|1994|pages=65–66}} A description of her from one of her hymns declares, "When the servants let the flocks loose, and when cattle and sheep are returned to cow-pen and sheepfold, then, my lady, like the nameless poor, you wear only a single garment. The pearls of a prostitute are placed around your neck, and you are likely to snatch a man from the tavern."{{sfn|Fiore|1965|page=}} In ''Inanna's Descent to the Underworld'', Inanna treats her lover Dumuzid in a very capricious manner.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pp=108–9}} This aspect of Inanna's personality is emphasized in the later standard Akkadian version of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' in which [[Gilgamesh]] points out Ishtar's infamous ill-treatment of her lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Gilgamesh|''Gilgamesh'']], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=146}}

Inanna was also worshipped as one of the Sumerian war deities.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108–109}}{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=226–227}} One of her hymns declares: "She stirs confusion and chaos against those who are disobedient to her, speeding carnage and inciting the devastating flood, clothed in terrifying radiance. It is her game to speed conflict and battle, untiring, strapping on her sandals."&lt;ref&gt;[[Enheduanna]] pre 2250 BCE {{cite web |title=A hymn to Inana (Inana C) |id=4.07.3 |year=2003 |work=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.4.07.3# |at=lines 18–28 |ref={{harvid|ETCSL 4.07.3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battle itself was occasionally referred to as the "Dance of Inanna".{{snf|Vanstiphout|1984|page=227}}

Inanna's twin brother was [[Utu]], the god of the sun and justice (who was later known as Shamash in East Semitic languages).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108, 182}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=x–xi}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=36}} In Sumerian texts, Inanna and Utu are shown as extremely close;{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=36–37}} in fact, their relationship frequently borders on [[incest]]uous.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=36–37}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=183}} Inanna's ''sukkal'' is the goddess [[Ninshubur]],{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=94}} whose relationship with Inanna is one of mutual devotion.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=94}} In the myth of her descent into the Underworld, Inanna addresses [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the underworld, as her "older sister",{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=77}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=108}} but the two goddesses almost never appear together in Sumerian literature.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=108}} In Uruk, Inanna was usually regarded as the daughter of the sky god [[Anu|An]],{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=88}} but, in the [[Isin]] tradition, she is usually described as the daughter of the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]] (who was later known as Sin).{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=ix-xi}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=88}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} In literary texts, she is sometimes described as the daughter of [[Enlil]]{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=88}} or the daughter of Enki.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=88}} In some later stories, Inanna-Ishtar is the sister of Ishkur ([[Hadad]]), the god of storms,{{sfn|Jordan|2002|page=137}} and, in Hittite mythology, Ishtar is the sister of [[Teshub]], the Hittite storm god.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=25}}

[[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] (later known as Tammuz), the god of shepherds, is usually described as Inanna's husband,{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=x–xi}} but Inanna's loyalty to him is questionable;{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} in the myth of her descent into the Underworld, she abandons Dumuzid and permits the ''[[gallu|galla]]'' demons to drag him down into the Underworld as her replacement,{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=71–84}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=93}} but in the later myth of ''The Return of Dumuzid'' Inanna paradoxically mourns over Dumuzid's death and ultimately decrees that he will be allowed to return to Heaven to be with her for one half of the year.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=89}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=93}} Inanna is not usually described as having any offspring,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} but, in the myth of [[Lugalbanda]] and in a single building inscription from the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa}} 2112 – {{circa}} 2004 BC), the warrior god [[Shara (god)|Shara]] is described as her son.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=173}} She was also sometimes considered the mother of [[Lulal]],{{sfn|Hallo|2010|page=233}} who is described in other texts as the son of [[Ninsun]].{{sfn|Hallo|2010|page=233}}

==Sumerian mythology==
===Origin myths===
The poem of ''Enki and the World Order'' ([[Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature|ETCSL]] [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr113.htm 1.1.3]) begins by describing the god [[Enki]] and his establishment of the cosmic organization of the universe.{{snf|Kramer|1963|pages=172–174}} Towards the end of the poem, Inanna comes to Enki and complains that he has assigned a domain and special powers to all of the other gods except for her.{{snf|Kramer|1963|page=174}} She declares that she has been treated unfairly.{{snf|Kramer|1963|page=182}} Enki responds by telling her that she already has a domain and that he does not need to assign her one.{{snf|Kramer|1963|page=183}}

The myth of "Inanna and the ''Huluppu'' Tree", found in the preamble to the epic of ''[[Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld]]'' (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1814.htm 1.8.1.4]),{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=30}} centers around a young Inanna, not yet stable in her power.{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=141}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=153–154}} It begins with a ''huluppu'' tree, which Kramer identifies as possibly a [[willow]],{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=33}} growing on the banks of the river [[Euphrates]].{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=33}}{{sfn|Mark|2018}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=172}} Inanna moves the tree to her garden in [[Uruk]] with the intention to carve it into a throne once it is fully grown.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=33}}{{sfn|Mark|2018}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=172}} The tree grows and matures, but the serpent "who knows no charm," the ''[[Anzû (mythology)|Anzû]]''-bird, and ''Lilitu'', the Sumerian forerunner to the [[Lilith]] of Jewish folklore, all take up residence within the tree, causing Inanna to cry with sorrow.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=33}}{{sfn|Mark|2018}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=172}} The hero [[Gilgamesh]], who, in this story, is portrayed as her brother, comes along and slays the serpent, causing the ''Anzû''-bird and Lilitu to flee.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=33–34}}{{sfn|Mark|2018}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=172}} Gilgamesh's companions chop down the tree and carve its wood into a bed and a throne, which they give to Inanna,{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=140}}{{sfn|Mark|2018}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=172}} who fashions a ''pikku'' and a ''mikku'' (probably a drum and drumsticks respectively, although the exact identifications are uncertain),{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=34}} which she gives to Gilgamesh as a reward for his heroism.{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=9}}{{sfn|Mark|2018}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=172}}

The Sumerian hymn ''Inanna and Utu'' contains an [[Origin myth|etiological myth]] describing how Inanna became the goddess of sex.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=91}} At the beginning of the hymn, Inanna knows nothing of sex,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=91}} so she begs her brother Utu to take her to [[Kur]] (the Sumerian Underworld),{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=91}} so that she may taste the fruit of a tree that grows there,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=91}} which will reveal to her all the secrets of sex.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=91}} Utu complies and, in Kur, Inanna tastes the fruit and becomes knowledgeable.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=91}} The hymn employs the same [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] found in the myth of ''Enki and Ninhursag'' and in the later Biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]].{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=91}}

The poem ''Inanna Prefers the Farmer'' (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section4/tr40833.htm 4.0.8.3.3]) begins with a rather playful conversation between Inanna and Utu, who incrementally reveals to her that it is time for her to marry.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=30–49}} She is courted by a farmer named [[Enkimdu]] and a shepherd named [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]].{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}} At first, Inanna prefers the farmer,{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}} but Utu and Dumuzid gradually persuade her that Dumuzid is the better choice for a husband, arguing that, for every gift the farmer can give to her, the shepherd can give her something even better.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=102–103}} In the end, Inanna marries Dumuzid.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=102–103}} The shepherd and the farmer reconcile their differences, offering each other gifts.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=101–103}} Samuel Noah Kramer compares the myth to the later Biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]] because both myths center around a farmer and a shepherd competing for divine favor and, in both stories, the deity in question ultimately chooses the shepherd.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=101}}

===Conquests and patronage===
[[File:Ea (Babilonian) - EnKi (Sumerian).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Akkadian [[cylinder seal]] from {{circa|2300}} BC or thereabouts depicting the deities Inanna, [[Utu]], [[Enki]], and [[Isimud]]{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=32–33}}]]

''Inanna and Enki'' (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.3.1# t.1.3.1]) is a lengthy poem written in Sumerian, which may date to the Third Dynasty of Ur;{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=90}} it tells the story of how Inanna stole the sacred ''[[Me (mythology)|mes]]'' from [[Enki]], the god of water and human culture.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=66}} In ancient Sumerian mythology, the ''mes'' were sacred powers or properties belonging the gods that allowed human civilization to exist.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=130}} Each ''me'' embodied one specific aspect of human culture.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=130}} These aspects were very diverse and the ''mes'' listed in the poem include abstract concepts such as [[Truth]], [[Victory]], and Counsel, technologies such as [[writing]] and [[weaving]], and also social constructs such as [[law]], priestly offices, kingship, and [[prostitution]]. The ''mes'' were believed to grant power over all the aspects of [[civilization]], both positive and negative.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=66}}

In the myth, Inanna travels from her own city of [[Uruk]] to Enki's city of [[Eridu]], where she visits his temple, the [[Abzu|E-Abzu]].{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=65}} Inanna is greeted by Enki's ''sukkal'', [[Isimud]], who offers her food and drink.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|pages=13–14}} Inanna starts up a drinking competition with Enki.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=66}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=14}} Then, once Enki is thoroughly intoxicated, Inanna persuades him to give her the ''mes''.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=66}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=14–20}} Inanna flees from Eridu in the Boat of Heaven, taking the ''mes'' back with her to Uruk.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=66–67}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=20}} Enki wakes up to discover that the mes are gone and asks Isimud what has happened to them.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=66–67}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=20–21}} Isimud replies that Enki has given all of them to Inanna.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=67}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer1983|page=21}} Enki becomes infuriated and sends multiple sets of fierce monsters after Inanna to take back the ''mes'' before she reaches the city of Uruk.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=67–68}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=20–24}} Inanna's ''sukkal'' [[Ninshubur]] fends off all of the monsters that Enki sends after them.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=68}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1961|pages=20–24}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=94}} Through Ninshubur's aid, Inanna successfully manages to take the ''mes'' back with her to the city of Uruk.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=68}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=24–25}} After Inanna escapes, Enki reconciles with her and bids her a positive farewell.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=26–27}} It is possible that this legend may represent a historic transfer of power from the city of [[Eridu]] to the city of [[Uruk]].{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}}{{sfn|Green|2003|page=74}} It is also possible that this legend may be a symbolic representation of Inanna's maturity and her readiness to become the [[Queen of Heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]].{{snf|Wolkstein| Kramer|1983|page=146-150}}

The poem ''Inanna Takes Command of Heaven'' is an extremely fragmentary, but important, account of Inanna's conquest of the [[Eanna]] temple in Uruk.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages=261–278}} It begins with a conversation between Inanna and her brother [[Utu]] in which Inanna laments that the Eanna temple is not within their domain and resolves to claim it as her own.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages=261–278}} The text becomes increasingly fragmentary at this point in the narrative,{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}} but appears to describe her difficult passage through a marshland to reach the temple while a fisherman instructs her on which route is best to take.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}} Ultimately, Inanna reaches her father [[Anu|An]], who is shocked by her arrogance, but nevertheless concedes that she has succeeded and that the temple is now her domain.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}} The text ends with a hymn expounding Inanna's greatness.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}} This myth may represent an eclipse in the authority of the priests of An in Uruk and a transfer of power to the priests of Inanna.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261–278}}

Inanna briefly appears  at the beginning and end of the epic poem ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]'' (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1823.htm 1.8.2.3]). The epic deals with a rivalry between the cities of Uruk and [[Aratta]]. Enmerkar, the king of Uruk, wishes to adorn his city with jewels and precious metals, but cannot do so because such minerals are only found in Aratta and, since trade does not yet exist, the resources are not available to him.{{snf|Vanstiphout|2003|pages=57–61}} Inanna, who is the patron goddess of both cities,{{snf|Vanstiphout|2003|page=49}} appears to Enmerkar at the beginning of the poem{{snf|Vanstiphout|2003|pages=57–63}} and tells him that she favors Uruk over Aratta.{{snf|Vanstiphout|2003|pages=61–63}} She instructs Enmerkar to send a messenger to the lord of Aratta to ask for the resources Uruk needs.{{snf|Vanstiphout|2003|page=49}} The majority of the epic revolves around a great contest between the two kings over Inanna's favor.{{snf|Vanstiphout|2003|pages=63–87}} Inanna reappears at the end of the poem to resolve the conflict by telling Enmerkar to establish trade between his city and Aratta.{{snf|Vanstiphout|2003|page=50}}

=== Justice myths ===

Inanna and her brother Utu were regarded as the dispensers of divine justice,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=36–37}} a role which Inanna exemplifies in several of her myths.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=162–173}} ''Inanna and Ebih'' (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr132.htm 1.3.2]), otherwise known as ''Goddess of the Fearsome Divine Powers'', is a 184-line poem written by the Akkadian poetess [[Enheduanna]] describing Inanna's confrontation with Mount Ebih, a mountain in the [[Zagros]] mountain range.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=165}} The poem begins with an introductory hymn praising Inanna.{{snf|Attinger|1988|pages=164–195}} The goddess journeys all over the entire world, until she comes across Mount Ebih and becomes infuriated by its glorious might and natural beauty,{{snf|Karahashi|2004|page=111}} considering its very existence as an outright affront to her own authority.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=82–83}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=165}} She rails at Mount Ebih, shouting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Mountain, because of your elevation, because of your height,
Because of your goodness, because of your beauty,
Because you wore a holy garment,
Because An organized(?) you,
Because you did not bring (your) nose close to the ground,
Because you did not press (your) lips in the dust.{{snf|Karahashi|2004|pages=111–118}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inanna petitions to [[Anu|An]], the Sumerian god of the heavens, to allow her to destroy Mount Ebih.{{snf|Karahashi|2004|page=111}} An warns Inanna not to attack the mountain,{{snf|Karahashi|2004|page=111}} but she ignores his warning and proceeds to attack and destroy Mount Ebih regardless.{{snf|Karahashi|2004|page=111}} In the conclusion of the myth, she explains to Mount Ebih why she attacked it.{{snf|Karahashi|2004|pages=111–118}} In Sumerian poetry, the phrase "destroyer of Kur" is occasionally used as one of Inanna's epithets.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=82}}

{{anchor|Inanna and Shukaletuda}}The poem ''Inanna and Shukaletuda'' (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr133.htm 1.3.3]) begins with a hymn to Inanna, praising her as the planet Venus.{{snf|Cooley|2008|page=162}} It then introduces Shukaletuda, a gardener who is terrible at his job and partially blind. All of his plants die, except for one poplar tree.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} Shukaletuda prays to the gods for guidance in his work. To his surprise, the goddess Inanna sees his one poplar tree and decides to rest under the shade of its branches.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} Shukaletuda removes her clothes and rapes Inanna while she sleeps.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} When the goddess wakes up and realizes she has been violated, she becomes furious and determines to bring her attacker to justice.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} In a fit of rage, Inanna unleashes horrible plagues upon the Earth, turning water into blood.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} Shukaletuda, terrified for his life, pleads his father for advice on how to escape Inanna's wrath.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} His father tells him to hide in the city, amongst the hordes of people, where he will hopefully blend in.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} Inanna searches the mountains of the East for her attacker,{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} but is not able to find him.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} She then releases a series of storms and closes all roads to the city, but is still unable to find Shukaletuda,{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} so she asks [[Enki]] to help her find him, threatening to leave her temple in [[Uruk]] if he does not.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} Enki consents and allows Inanna to "fly across the sky like a rainbow".{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=162}} Inanna finally locates Shukaletuda, who vainly attempts to invent excuses for his crime against her. Inanna rejects these excuses and kills him.{{snf|Cooley|2008|page=163}} Theology professor Jeffrey Cooley has cited the story of Shukaletuda as a Sumerian astral myth, arguing that the movements of Inanna in the story correspond with the movements of the planet Venus.{{snf|Cooley|2008|pages=161–172}} He has also stated that, while Shukaletuda was praying to the goddess, he may have been looking toward Venus on the horizon.{{sfn|Cooley|2008|page=163}}

The text of the poem ''Inanna and Bilulu'' (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr144.htm 1.4.4]), discovered at Nippur, is badly mutilated{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} and scholars have interpreted it in a number of different ways.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} The beginning of the poem is mostly destroyed,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} but seems to be a lament.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} The intelligible part of the poem describes Inanna pining after her husband Dumuzid, who is in the steppe watching his flocks.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=165}} Inanna sets out to find him.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} After this, a large portion of the text is missing.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} When the story resumes, Inanna is being told that Dumuzid has been murdered.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} Inanna discovers that the old bandit woman Bilulu and her son Girgire are responsible.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=166}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=165}} She travels along the road to Edenlila and stops at an [[inn]], where she finds the two murderers.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} Inanna stands on top of a stool{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}} and transforms Bilulu into "the waterskin that men carry in the desert",{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=109}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=166}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=165}} forcing her to pour the funerary [[libation]]s for Dumuzid.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=89}}{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=165}}

Two different versions of the story of Inanna-Ishtar's [[Katabasis|descent into the Underworld]] have survived:{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=83–86}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=127–135}} a Sumerian version dating to the Third Dynasty of Ur (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr141.htm 1.4.1]){{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=83–86}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=127–135}} and a clearly derivative Akkadian version from the early second millennium BC.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=83–86}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=127–135}} The Sumerian version of the story is nearly three times the length of the later Akkadian version and contains much greater detail.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=154}}

===Sumerian version===
In [[Sumerian religion]], the ''[[Kur]]'' was conceived of as a dark, dreary cavern located deep underground;{{sfn|Choksi|2014}} life there was envisioned as "a shadowy version of life on earth".{{sfn|Choksi|2014}} It was ruled by Inanna's sister, the goddess [[Ereshkigal]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=77}}{{sfn|Choksi|2014}} Before leaving, Inanna instructs her minister and servant [[Ninshubur]] to plead with the deities [[Enlil]], [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], [[Anu]], and [[Enki]] to rescue her if she does not return after three days.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=86–87}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=17}} The laws of the underworld dictate that, with the exception of appointed messengers, those who enter it may never leave.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=86–87}} Inanna dresses elaborately for the visit; she wears a turban, wig, [[lapis lazuli]] necklace, beads upon her breast, the '''pala'' dress' (the ladyship garment), mascara, a pectoral, and golden ring, and holds a lapis lazuli [[measuring rod]].{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=88}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=56}} Each garment is a representation of a powerful ''me'' she possesses.{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=157}}

Inanna pounds on the gates of the Underworld, demanding to be let in.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=90}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=54–55}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=17}} The gatekeeper [[Neti (deity)|Neti]] asks her why she has come{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=90}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=55}} and Inanna replies that she wishes to attend the funeral rites of [[Gugalanna]], the "husband of my elder sister Ereshkigal".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=77}}{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=90}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=55}} Neti reports this to Ereshkigal,{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=91}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=56–57}} who tells him: "Bolt the seven gates of the underworld.

In the Sumerian poem ''The Return of Dumuzid'', which begins where ''The Dream of Dumuzid'' ends, Dumuzid's sister [[Geshtinanna]] laments continually for days and nights over Dumuzid's death, joined by Inanna, who has apparently experienced a change of heart, and [[Sirtur]], Dumuzid's mother.{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=85–87}} The three goddesses mourn continually until a [[fly]] reveals to Inanna the location of her husband.{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=87–89}} Together, Inanna and Geshtinanna go to the place where the fly has told them they will find Dumuzid.{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=88–89}} They find him there and Inanna decrees that, from that point onwards, Dumuzid will spend half of the year with her sister Ereshkigal in the Underworld and the other half of the year in Heaven with her, while his sister Geshtinanna takes his place in the Underworld.{{snf|Kramer|1966|page=31}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=18}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=85–89}}

===Akkadian version===
The Akkadian version begins with Ishtar approaching the gates of the [[Irkalla|Underworld]] and demanding the gatekeeper to let her in:
{{quote|If you do not open the gate for me to come in,&lt;br/&gt;I shall smash the door and shatter the bolt,&lt;br/&gt;I shall smash the doorpost and overturn the doors,&lt;br/&gt;I shall raise up the dead and they shall eat the living:&lt;br/&gt;And the dead shall outnumber the living!{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=155}}}} The gatekeeper (whose name is not given in the Akkadian version{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=155}}) hurries to tell Ereshkigal of Ishtar's arrival. Ereshkigal orders him to let Ishtar enter, but tells him to "treat her according to the ancient rites."{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=156}} The gatekeeper lets Ishtar into the underworld, opening one gate at a time.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=156}} At each gate, Ishtar is forced to shed one article of clothing. When she finally passes the seventh gate, she is naked.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=156–157}} In a rage, Ishtar throws herself at Ereshkigal, but Ereshkigal orders her servant [[Namtar]] to imprison Ishtar and unleash sixty diseases against her.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=157-158}}

After Ishtar descends to the underworld, all sexual activity ceases on earth.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=158–160}} The god [[Papsukkal]], the Akkadian counterpart to Ninshubur,{{snf|Bertman|2003|page=124}} reports the situation to [[Enki|Ea]], the god of wisdom and culture.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=158–160}} Ea creates an [[androgynous|intersex]] being called Asu-shu-namir and sends them to Ereshkigal, telling them to invoke "the name of the great gods" against her and to ask for the bag containing the waters of life. Ereshkigal becomes enraged when she hears Asu-shu-namir's demand, but she is forced to give them the water of life. Asu-shu-namir sprinkles Ishtar with this water, reviving her. Then, Ishtar passes back through the seven gates, receiving one article of clothing back at each gate, and exiting the final gate fully clothed.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=158–160}}

===Interpretations===
[[File:British Museum Queen of the Night.jpg|thumb|The "[[Burney Relief]]," which is believed to represent either Ishtar or her older sister [[Ereshkigal]] ({{circa}} 19th or 18th century BC)]]

Folklorist [[Diane Wolkstein]] interprets the myth as a union between Inanna and her own "dark side": her twin sister-self, Ereshkigal. When Inanna ascends from the Underworld, it is through Ereshkigal's powers, but, while Inanna is in the underworld, it is Ereshkigal who apparently takes on the powers of fertility. The poem ends with a line in praise, not of Inanna, but of Ereshkigal. Wolkstein interprets the narrative as a praise-poem dedicated to the more negative aspects of Inanna's domain, symbolic of an acceptance of the necessity of death in order to facilitate the continuance of life.{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=158–162}} [[Joseph Campbell]] interprets the myth as being about the psychological power of a descent into the unconscious, the realization of one's own strength through an episode of seeming powerlessness, and the acceptance of one's own negative qualities.{{snf|Campbell|2008|pages=88–90}}

Conversely, Joshua Mark argues that the most likely moral intended by the original author of the ''Descent of Inanna'' is that there are always consequences for one's actions: "The Descent of Inanna, then, about one of the gods behaving badly and other gods and mortals having to suffer for that behavior, would have given to an ancient listener the same basic understanding anyone today would take from an account of a tragic accident caused by someone’s negligence or poor judgment: that, sometimes, life is just not fair."{{sfn|Mark|2011}}

Another recent interpretation, by Clyde Hostetter, holds that the myth is an allegorical report of related movements of the planets Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter;{{sfn|Hostetter|1991|page=53}} and those of the waxing crescent Moon in the Second Millennium, beginning with the [[spring equinox]] and concluding with a meteor shower near the end of one synodic period of Venus.{{snf|Hostetter|1991|page=53}} The three-day disappearance of Inanna refers to the three-day planetary disappearance of Venus between its appearance as a morning or evening star.{{sfn|Hostetter|1991|page=53}} The fact that Gugalana is slain refers to the disappearance of the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] when the sun rises in that part of the sky, which in the [[Bronze Age]] marked the occurrence of the [[vernal equinox]].{{sfn|Hostetter|1991|page=53}}

{{main|Epic of Gilgamesh}}
In the [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian]] ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Ishtar appears to Gilgamesh after he and his companion [[Enkidu]] have returned to Uruk from defeating the ogre [[Humbaba]] and demands Gilgamesh to become her consort.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=80}} Gilgamesh refuses her, pointing out that all of her previous lovers have suffered:{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=80}}

{{quote|Listen to me while I tell the tale of your lovers. There was Tammuz, the lover of your youth, for him you decreed wailing, year after year. You loved the many-coloured [[lilac-breasted roller|Lilac-breasted Roller]], but still you struck and broke his wing [...] You have loved the lion tremendous in strength: seven pits you dug for him, and seven. You have loved the stallion magnificent in battle, and for him you decreed the whip and spur and a thong [...] You have loved the shepherd of the flock; he made meal-cake for you day after day, he killed kids for your sake. You struck and turned him into a wolf; now his own herd-boys chase him away, his own hounds worry his flanks."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Gilgamesh|''Gilgamesh'']], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Infuriated by Gilgamesh's refusal,{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=80}} Ishtar goes to heaven and tells her father [[Anu]] that Gilgamesh has insulted her.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=80}} Anu asks her why she is complaining to him instead of confronting Gilgamesh herself.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=80}} Ishtar demands that Anu give her the [[Bull of Heaven]]{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=80}} and swears that if he does not give it to her, she will "break in the doors of hell and smash the bolts; there will be confusion [i.e., mixing] of people, those above with those from the lower depths. I shall bring up the dead to eat food like the living; and the hosts of the dead will outnumber the living."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Gilgamesh|''Gilgamesh'']], p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the epic, [[Utnapishtim]] tells Gilgamesh the story of the [[Great Flood]],{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=109–116}} which was sent by the god [[Enlil]] to annihilate all life on earth because the humans, who were vastly overpopulated, made too much noise and prevented him from sleeping.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=109–111}} Utnapishtim tells how, when the flood came, Ishtar wept and mourned over the destruction of humanity, alongside the [[Anunnaki]].{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=113}} Later, after the flood subsides, Utnapishtim makes an offering to the gods.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=114}} Ishtar appears to Utnapishtim wearing a [[lapis lazuli]] necklace with beads shaped like [[flies]] and tells him that Enlil never discussed the flood with any of the other gods.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=114–115}} She swears him that she will never allow Enlil to cause another flood{{snf|Dalley|pages=114–115}} and declares her lapis lazuli necklace a sign of her oath.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=114–115}} Ishtar invites all the gods except for Enlil to gather around the offering and enjoy.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=115}}

===Other tales===
In the [[Hittite mythology|Hittite Creation myth]], Ishtar is born after the god [[Kumarbi]] overthrows his father [[Anu]].{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=25}} Kumarbi [[Emasculation|bites off Anu's genitals]] and swallows them,{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=25}} causing him to become pregnant with Anu's offspring,{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=25}} including Ishtar and her brother, the Hittite [[storm god]] [[Teshub]].{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=25}} This account later became the basis for the Greek story of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]'s castration by his son [[Cronus]], resulting in the birth of [[Aphrodite]], described in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]''.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=27}} Later in the Hittite myth, Ishtar attempts to seduce the monster [[Ullikummi]],{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=25}} but fails because the monster is both blind and deaf and is unable to see or hear her.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=25}} The Hurrians and Hittites appear to have syncretized Ishtar with their own goddess [[Ishara|Išḫara]].{{sfn|Güterbock|Yener|Hoffner|Dhesi|2002|page=29}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=110}} In [[Sargon of Akkad#Birth legend|a pseudepigraphical Neo-Assyrian text]] written in the seventh century BCE, but which claims to be the autobiography of Sargon of Akkad,{{snf|Westenholz|1997|pages=33–49}} Ishtar is claimed to have appeared to Sargon "surrounded by a cloud of doves" while he was working as a gardener for Akki, the drawer of the water.{{snf|Westenholz|1997|pages=33–49}} Ishtar then proclaimed Sargon her lover and allowed him to become the ruler of Sumer and Akkad.{{snf|Westenholz|1997|pages=33–49}}

The cult of Inanna-Ishtar may have been introduced to the [[Kingdom of Judah]] during the reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|King Manasseh]]{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=193}} and, although Inanna herself is not directly mentioned in the [[Bible]] by name,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=193, 195}} the [[Old Testament]] contains numerous allusions to her cult.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=193–195}} {{bibleverse|Jeremiah|7:18|9}} and {{bibleverse|Jeremiah|44:15-19|9}} mention "the Queen of Heaven", who is probably a syncretism of Inanna-Ishtar and the West Semitic goddess [[Astarte]].{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=193}}{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=10}}{{sfn|Smith|2002|page=182}}{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|pages=116–117}} Jeremiah states that the Queen of Heaven was worshipped by women who baked cakes for her.{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|pages=115–116}}

The [[Song of Songs]] bears strong similarities to the Sumerian love poems involving Inanna and Dumuzid,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=194}} particularly in its usage of natural symbolism to represent the lovers' physicality.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=194}} {{bibleverse|Song of Songs|6:10|9}} ("Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?") is almost certainly a reference to Inanna-Ishtar.{{sfn|Baring|Cashford|1991}} {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|8:14|9}} mentions Inanna's husband Dumuzid under his later East Semitic name [[Tammuz (mythology)|Tammuz]]{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=73}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=195}}{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=211}} and describes a group of women mourning Tammuz's death while sitting near the north gate of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=195}}{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=211}}

The cult of Inanna-Ishtar also heavily influenced the cult of the [[Phoenicia]]n goddess [[Astarte]].{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|pages=43–59}} The Phoenicians introduced Astarte to the Greek islands of [[Cyprus]] and [[Kythira|Cythera]],{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=10}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=49–52}} where she either gave rise to or heavily influenced the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]].{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|pages=8–12}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=49–52}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=27}}{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|pages=43–59}} Aphrodite took on Inanna-Ishtar's associations with sexuality and procreation.{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=8}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=162}} Furthermore, she was known as [[Aphrodite Urania|Ourania]] (Οὐρανία), which means "heavenly",{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|pages=10–11}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=162}} a title corresponding to Inanna's role as the Queen of Heaven.{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|pages=10–11}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=162}}

Early artistic and literary portrayals of Aphrodite are extremely similar to Inanna-Ishtar.{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=8}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=162}} Aphrodite was also a warrior goddess;{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=8}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=49–52}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=163}} the second-century AD Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as ''[[Aphrodite Areia]]'', which means "warlike".{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=51–52}}{{sfn|Budin|2010|pages=85–86, 96, 100, 102–103, 112, 123, 125}} He also mentions that Aphrodite's most ancient cult statues in [[Sparta]] and on Cythera showed her bearing arms.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=51–52}}{{sfn|Budin|2010|pages=85–86, 96, 100, 102–103, 112, 123, 125}}{{sfn|Graz|1984|page=250}}{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=8}} Modern scholars note that Aphrodite's warrior-goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship{{sfn|Iossif|Lorber|2007|page=77}} and see it as an indication of her Near Eastern origins.{{sfn|Iossif|Lorber|2007|page=77}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=163}} Aphrodite also absorbed Ishtar's association with doves,{{sfn|Lewis|Llewellyn-Jones|2018|page=335}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=163}} which were sacrificed to her alone.{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=163}} The Greek word for "dove" was ''peristerá'',{{sfn|Lewis|Llewellyn-Jones|2018|page=335}}{{sfn|Botterweck|Ringgren|1990|page=35}} which may be derived from the Semitic phrase ''peraḥ Ištar'', meaning "bird of Ishtar".{{sfn|Botterweck|Ringgren|1990|page=35}} The myth of Aphrodite and [[Adonis]] is derived from the story of Inanna and Dumuzid.{{sfn|West|1997|page=57}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=177}}

The cult of Inanna may also have influenced the deities [[Ainina and Danina]] of the [[Caucasian Iberia]]ns mentioned by the medieval [[Georgian Chronicles]].{{sfn|Tseretheli|1935|pages=55–56}} Anthropologist [[Kevin Tuite]] argues that the [[Georgian mythology|Georgian goddess]] [[Dali (goddess)|Dali]] was also influenced by Inanna,{{sfn|Tuite|2004|pages=16–18}} noting that both Dali and Inanna were associated with the morning star,{{sfn|Tuite|2004|page=16}} both were characteristically depicted nude,{{sfn|Tuite|2004|pages=16–17}} both were associated with gold jewelry,{{sfn|Tuite|2004|pages=16–17}} both sexually preyed on mortal men,{{sfn|Tuite|2004|page=17}} both were associated with human and animal fertility,{{sfn|Tuite|2004|pages=17–18}} and both had ambiguous natures as sexually attractive, but dangerous, women.{{sfn|Tuite|2004|page=18}} The [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess [[Durga]] may also have been influenced by Inanna.{{sfn|Parpola|1998|pages=224–225, 260}}{{sfn|Parpola|2015}} Like Inanna, Durga was envisioned as a warrior goddess with a fierce temper who slew demons.{{sfn|Parpola|1998|page=225}}{{sfn|Baring|Cashford|1991}} Both goddesses were portrayed riding on the backs of lions{{sfn|Baring|Cashford|1991}} and both were associated with the destruction of the wicked.{{sfn|Baring|Cashford|1991}} Like Inanna, Durga was also associated with sexuality.{{sfn|Parpola|1998|page=260}}

Traditional Mesopotamian religion began to gradually decline between the third and fifth centuries AD as [[Assyrian people|ethnic Assyrians]] converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Parpola|2004|page=17}} Nonetheless, the cult of Ishtar and Tammuz managed to survive in parts of Upper Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=211}} In the tenth century AD, an Arab traveler wrote that "All the [[Sabaeans]] of our time, those of Babylonia as well as those of [[Harran]], lament and weep to this day over Tammuz at a festival which they, more particularly the women, hold in the month of the same name."{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=211}} The cult of Ishtar still existed in [[Mardin]] as late as the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Parpola|2004|page=17}} [[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] in the Middle East assimilated elements of Ishtar into the cult of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].{{sfn|Warner|2016|pages=210–212}}{{sfn|Baring|Cashford|1991}} The Syrian writers [[Jacob of Serugh]] and [[Romanos the Melodist]] both wrote laments in which the Virgin Mary describes her compassion for [[Jesus|her son]] at the foot of the cross in deeply personal terms closely resembling Ishtar's laments over the death of Tammuz.{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=212}}

[[File:ISHTAR-EPOS p067 ISHTAR'S MIDNIGHT COURTSHIP.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Illustration of ''Ishtar's Midnight Courtship'' from Leonidas Le Cenci Hamilton's 1884 book-length poem ''Ishtar and Izdubar'', loosely based on [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]]'s recent translation of the ''Epic of Gilgamesh''{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}}]]

In his 1853 pamphlet ''[[The Two Babylons]]'', as part of his argument that [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is actually Babylonian paganism in disguise, [[Alexander Hislop]], a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] minister in the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], incorrectly argued that the modern English word ''[[Easter]]'' must be derived from ''Ishtar'' due to the phonetic similarity of the two words.{{sfn|Hislop|1903|page=103}} Modern scholars have unanimously rejected Hislop's arguments as erroneous and based on a flawed understanding of Babylonian religion.{{sfn|Grabbe|1997|page=28}}{{sfn|Mcllhenny|2011|page=60}}{{sfn|Brown|1976|page=268}}{{sfn|D'Costa|2013}} Nonetheless, Hislop's book is still popular among some groups of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestants]]{{sfn|Grabbe|1997|page=28}}{{sfn|Mcllhenny|2011|page=60}} and the ideas promoted in it have become widely circulated, especially through the [[Internet]], due to a number of popular [[Internet meme]]s.{{sfn|D'Costa|2013}}

Ishtar's first major appearance in modern literature was in ''Ishtar and Izdubar'',{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=20–21}} a book-length poem written in 1884 by Leonidas Le Cenci Hamilton, an American lawyer and businessman, loosely based on the recently-translated ''Epic of Gilgamesh''.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=20–21}} ''Ishtar and Izdubar'' expanded the original roughly 3,000 lines of the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' to roughly 6,000 lines of rhyming couplets grouped into forty-eight [[canto]]s.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} Hamilton significantly altered most of the characters and introduced entirely new episodes not found in the original epic.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} Significantly influenced by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' and [[Edwin Arnold]]'s ''[[The Light of Asia]]'',{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=21}} Hamilton's characters dress more like nineteenth-century Turks than ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=22–23}} In the poem, Izdubar (the earlier misreading for the name "Gilgamesh") falls in love with Ishtar,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=22}} but, then, "with hot and balmy breath, and trembling form aglow," she attempts to seduce him, leading Izdubar to reject her advances.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=22}} Several "columns" of the book are devoted to an account of Ishtar's descent into the Underworld.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=22–23}} At the conclusion of the book, Izdubar, now a god, is reconciled with Ishtar in Heaven.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=23}} In 1887, the composer [[Vincent d'Indy]] wrote ''Symphony Ishtar, variations symphonique, Op. 42'', a symphony inspired by the Assyrian monuments in the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}}

Inanna has become an important figure in modern [[feminist theory]] because she appears in the [[patriarchy|male-dominated]] [[Sumerian pantheon]],{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=196–197}} but is equally as powerful, if not more powerful than, the male deities she appears alongside.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=196–197}} [[Simone de Beauvoir]], in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), argues that Inanna, along with other powerful female deities from antiquity, have been marginalized by modern culture in favor of male deities.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} [[Tikva Frymer-Kensky]] has argued that Inanna was a "marginal figure" in Sumerian religion who embodies the "socially unacceptable" [[archetype]] of the "undomesticated, unattached woman".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} Johanna Stuckey has argued against this idea, pointing out Inanna's centrality in Sumerian religion and her broad diversity of powers, neither of which seem to fit the idea that she was in any way regarded as "marginal".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}}

[[File:Myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916) (14801964123).jpg|thumb|left|A modern illustration depicting Inanna-Ishtar's descent into the [[Kur|Underworld]] taken from [[Lewis Spence]]'s ''Myths and Legends of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]'' (1916)]]

While classical deities such as [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]] frequently appear in modern popular culture,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} Mesopotamian deities have, by contrast, fallen into almost complete obscurity.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} Inanna-Ishtar has somewhat resisted this tendency, but has not been immune to it.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} She usually only appears in works with strong mythological input,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} and most modern portrayals of Inanna-Ishtar have virtually nothing in common with the ancient goddess except for her name.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} The 1963 [[splatter film]] ''[[Blood Feast]]'' concerns a serial killer who sacrifices his victims to Ishtar, who is incorrectly identified as an "Egyptian goddess".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=203}} Ishtar also gave her name to the 1987 [[box office bomb]] ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'', in which the character Shirra was loosely modeled on her.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=196–197}} According to Louise Pryke, the character [[Buffy Summers]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' bears remarkably strong similarities to Ishtar,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=202–203}} but these may be coincidental.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=202}} ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'', following the portrayal in ''Blood Feast'', portrays Ishtar as a soul-eating Egyptian mummy.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=203}} One of the two highlands of the planet Venus is named "Ishtar Terra".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=203}} [[John Craton]] composed a full-length opera about Ishtar{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} and she has also been referenced in numerous [[Rock music|rock]] and [[death metal]] songs.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=197}}

The Argentinian-born Jewish feminist artist Liliana Kleiner created an exhibition of paintings depicting her interpretations of Inanna's myths,{{sfn|Kleiner|2016}} which was first displayed in Mexico in 2008.{{sfn|Kleiner|2016}} The exhibition was later shown in [[Jerusalem]] in 2011 and in [[Berlin]] in 2015.{{sfn|Kleiner|2016}} Inanna is one of the names on the Heritage Floor of ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' by American [[feminist art]]ist [[Judy Chicago]] as a related woman to [[Ishtar]], who has a seat at the table.{{sfn|Chicago|2007|page=}} Inanna is worshipped as a form of the [[Goddess movement|Goddess]] in modern [[Neopaganism]] and [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Rountree|2017|page=167}} Her name occurs in the refrain of the "Burning Times Chant",{{sfn|Weston|Bennett|2013|page=165}} one of the most widely used Wiccan [[liturgy|liturgies]].{{sfn|Weston|Bennett|page=165}} ''Inanna's Descent into the Underworld'' was the inspiration for the "Descent of the Goddess",{{sfn|Buckland|2001|pages=74–75}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|page=358}} one of the most popular and most important myths in [[Gardnerian Wicca]].{{sfn|Buckland|2001|pages=74–75}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|page=358}}

Inanna is also an important figure in modern [[BDSM]] culture.{{sfn|Nomis|2013|pages=59–60}} Author and historian Anne O. Nomis has cited the portrayal of Inanna in the myth of ''Inanna and Ebih'' as an early example of the [[dominatrix]] archetype,{{sfn|Nomis|2013|page=53}} characterizing her as a powerful female who forces gods and men into submission to her.{{sfn|Nomis|2013|page=53}} Scholar Paul Thomas has criticized the modern portrayal of Inanna, accusing it of anachronistically imposing modern gender conventions on the ancient Sumerian story, portraying Inanna as a wife and mother,{{sfn|Thomas|2007|page=1}} two roles the ancient Sumerians never ascribed to her,{{sfn|Thomas|2007|page=1}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} while ignoring the more masculine elements of Inanna's cult, particularly her associations with warfare and violence.{{sfn|Thomas|2007|page=1}} Douglas E. Cowan has also criticized the portrayal of Inanna in modern Neopaganism, remarking that it "reduces [her] to little more than a patron goddess of parking lots and crawlspaces".{{sfn|Cowan|2005|page=49}}

[[File:James Grant, Old And New Edinburgh, 1880.jpg|thumb|James Grant's Old And New Edinburgh, published in 1880]]
'''James Grant''' (1822–1887) was a [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] and miscellaneous writer.

Grant was born in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], and was a distant relation of [[Sir Walter Scott]]. He was a prolific author, writing some 90 books, including many [[yellow-backs]]. Titles included ''Adventures of an Aide-de-camp'', ''One of "The six hundred"'', ''The Scottish musketeers'' and ''The Scottish cavalier''.

Many of his 56 novels are about important characters and events in Scottish history. In 1853 he founded the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights. Grant is known today as an historian, primarily because of his thoroughly-researched six-volume ''Old And New Edinburgh'', published in 1880 by Cassell.{{sfn|Grant|1880s|loc=Old and New Edinburgh}}

==Biography==
Grant was born at Edinburgh 1 August 1822. He was eldest son of John Grant and grandson of [[Grant, James (1743?-1835)|James Grant]] of Corrimony (1743?–1835) advocate. From his grandfather, James Grant, the novelist inherited strong Jacobite proclivities, and he was connected by descent with the Veitches of Dawyck, Peeblesshire, and thus possessed a strain of border blood. His mother, who died when he was a child, belonged to the Watson family of Overmains, not unknown in the artistic annals of Scotland, and through her he was intimately related to [[Sir Walter Scott]], the Swintons of Swinton, and other eminent families.{{sfn|Watkins|1890|p=391}}

The father, Captain John Grant, of the [[92nd Gordon Highlanders]], had served with distinction throughout the Peninsular war. After his wife's death Captain Grant obtained a command in Newfoundland, whither he sailed in 1833, taking with him his three sons. After spending six years in American barracks Grant returned home with his father, who had resigned his command, in 1839.{{sfn|Watkins|1890|p=391}}

A year later (in 1840), through the influence of [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Lord Hill]], under whom Captain John Grant had served in Spain, Grant was gazetted to an ensigncy in the [[62nd Foot]], and joined the provisional battalion at Chatham. He was soon appointed to command the depot, but in 1843 resigned his commission and entered the office of Mr. Rhind, architect, Edinburgh.{{sfn|Watkins|1890|p=391}}

Grant became a skilled draughtsman, but other and literary tastes were showing themselves, and he now devoted himself to novel writing, speedily becoming a most prolific writer. His first novel, and in some respects his best, ''The Romance of War'', appeared in 1845. It owed its birth to the many anecdotes of Spain and the French war, which had been related to him by his father, and described the adventures of the Gordon highlanders in the Peninsula. The vivid description of battles speedily procured for it an enormous sale; but it only produced £20 for its author. A sequel entitled ''The Highlanders in Belgium'' soon followed. Then came ''The Adventures of an Aide-de-Camp'', of which the popularity equalled that of his first novel. ''The Yellow Frigate'', ''Bothwell'', ''Jane Seton'', and many more succeeded, and from that time to his death never a year passed without one, often two, and even three novels being produced. His last works of fiction were 'Love's Labour Won' (1888), dealing with incidents of Burmese dacoity, and ''Playing with Fire'' (1887), a story of the war in the Soudan.{{sfn|Watkins|1890|pp=391–392}}

He wrote in all some fifty-six novels. A quick succession of incidents, much vivacity of style, and a dialogue that seldom flags characterise all of them. Those dealing with Scottish history embody considerable research, are vigorous and picturesque in style, and express much sympathy with the reckless daring, loyalty, and manliness of Scotch and border heroes.{{sfn|Watkins|1890|p=392}}

A charge of plagiarism has been brought against Grant owing to his having incorporated without acknowledgment a good many descriptive passages from a book of travels and campaigning in one of his novels. Grant, however, does not seem to have exceeded the license justly allowed a novelist of appropriating local colour for his fictions from graver writers .&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watkins|1890|p=392}}  cites Athenæum, 9 January 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant wrote much and well on history, especially the history of his native land. The following are his works in this department of literature:{{sfn|Watkins|1890|p=392}}
# ''Memoirs and Adventures of Sir W. Kirkaldy of Grange'', 1849.
# ''Memorials of the Castle of Edinburgh'', 1850. 
# ''Memoirs and Adventures of Sir J. Hepburn'', 1851. 
# ''Memoirs of Montrose'', 1858. 
# ''The Cavaliers of Fortune, or British Heroes in Foreign Wars'', 1859; reissued with title reversed, 1873. 
# ''British Battles on Land and Sea'', 1873; followed in 1884 by ''Recent British Battles on Land and Sea.' 
# ''Illustrated History of India'', 1876.
# ''Old and New Edinburgh'', 1880;{{sfn|Grant|1880s|loc=Old and New Edinburgh}}&lt;ref&gt;Over thirty thousand copies of ''Old and New Edinburgh'' were sold in the United States {{harv|Watkins|1890|p=392}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''History of the War in the Soudan'', 1885-6. 
# ''The Tartans of the Clans of Scotland'', 1886. 
# ''Scottish Soldiers of Fortune'', 1889 (posthumous).

In 1852 Grant founded and acted as secretary to the [[National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights]], upholding its views steadily in spite of the ridicule heaped upon him by ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' and many English newspapers. He was an energetic supporter of the volunteer movement, and one of the first to join its ranks.{{sfn|Watkins|1890|p=392}}

As an authority on military matters he was frequently consulted by the war office, and was examined as a witness in connection with the present territorial system, and many of his suggestions, such as the present facings of the British army, were adopted. The plans for the proposed alterations in Edinburgh Castle were also submitted to him.{{sfn|Watkins|1890|p=392}}

Grant married the eldest daughter of James Browne, LL.D.. and had two sons: James, who died before his father, and Roderick, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest. He had himself embraced the Roman Catholic faith in 1875. He died 5 May 1887 in London, at the age of sixty-five. His popularity had decayed before his death. He was modest and retiring, genial, intensely patriotic, and of strong religious susceptibilities; but with all his devotion to literature he died penniless.{{sfn|Watkins|1890|p=392}}

'''Josef Vratislav Monse''' (June 15, 1733 – February 6, 1793) was a [[Moravia]]n lawyer and historian.

He was a leading [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] figure in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and an early exponent of the [[Moravian Revival]] in [[Moravia]].  Monse played a key role in the development of modern Moravian [[historiography]]. He was a professor of law and, in 1780, the rector at the [[University of Olomouc]].

==Biography==

===Early life, studies in Prague and Vienna===
Josef ''Vít'' Monse was the eighth of nine children born into the family of a [[syndic|municipal legal official]] in [[Vysočina Region]]. His parents were Johann Karl Monse and Anna Monse (born Moudrá). The family lived at house number eight on the main square at [[Nové Město na Moravě]] ({{lang-de|Neustadtl in Mähren}}).&lt;ref name="labsky"/&gt; Josef Monse attended the local school. When Monse was 14, his father died. His uncle, a local priest also named Josef Monse, sent him to study at a [[Jesuit order|Jesuit]] [[gymnasium (school)]] in [[Telč]]. He covered the (normally) six year high school curriculum in four years  and then, in 1752&lt;ref name="labsky"/&gt; he left for [[Prague]], where he studied at the Faculty of Philosophy of [[Charles University]], gaining a [[master's degree]].&lt;ref name="cro"&gt;{{Citation

By this time Monse was becoming interested in the history of his own nation, which, since the [[Battle of White Mountain]] back in 1620, had been subjected to Catholization and [[Germanization]], while the Czech language had become no more than a means of communication between the peasants.

Monse left Prague for Vienna, where he attended the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Vienna]] and obtained a [[Doctor of law#Czech Republic and Slovakia (former Czechoslovakia)|doctorate]] [[Doctor of both laws|"juris utriusque" (of both civil and canon law)]] in 1762.&lt;ref name="geryk"&gt;{{Citation

===Professor of law at University of Olomouc===
[[File:Olomouc01 Faculty of Law2.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Palacký University of Olomouc#Law|University of Olomouc Faculty of Law]] holds annual conference named after Monse, the ''Monse's Olomouc Law Days'']]
In 1764 Monse moved to Olomouc, where he became an [[advocate]]. In 1768 he was appointed a [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Law|professor of law at the University of Olomouc]] for which he received 900 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] a year, lecturing on [[public law|public]] and [[natural law]]. He still also found time to continue with his advocacy work.

After Professor Josef Antonín Sommer, died in 1774, Monse added to his responsibilities Sommer's courses on [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Canon law]].&lt;ref name="cro"/&gt;  1774 was also the year in which he changed his middle name from ''Vít'' to ''Vratislav'',&lt;ref name="labsky"/&gt; a determined reflection of his "motto": "''Return the Old Glory to the Homeland!''" ({{lang-cs|Vraťte starou slávu otčině!}}).&lt;ref name="cro"/&gt;

The lectures on [[Canon law]] for theology students were given separately at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Saints Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology|Faculty of Theology]] until 1771, after which they started to be officially taught by the secular professors of law. Classes normally comprised some 50 law students, but for Monse's Canon law classes, some 300 theology students of theology also took to attending. By this time Monse had become a fierce proponent of the newly developing [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideals. In his lectures he defended the reforms of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. While the traditional theologians were merely resentful of to his spoken lectures, the publication of his ideas evoked real outrage.&lt;ref name="cro"/&gt; The Catholics leadership incited the town's poor against Monse, spreading malicious gossip that the altar-bread fell out of his mouth during [[Communion (Christian)|Communion]], and that the burning of a nearby village represented God's punishment for Monse's teachings.&lt;ref name="geryk"/&gt;

The theologians' fury peaked when Monse published the work of an anonymous 13th century French author entitled in {{lang-la|Dialogus inter clericum et militem supra dignitate papali et regia}}, a dialogue between a priest and a soldier discussing the relative status of popes and of kings. &lt;!-- THIS IS BAD TRANSLATION, PLEASE IF YOU KNOW THE CORRECT NAME, CHANGE IT --&gt; The treatise was found by one of the Monse's former students in a library at [[Znojmo]] monastery. He sent the work to Monse, who translated it, adding an introduction and commentary while preserving the original content, and published it. Well aware that the ideas in the thesis were still controversial even 500 years after they had first been written, he added at the end of the book that it was published with the best of intentions, and "''not to irritate''". That did not help much.   Monse received harsh criticism not only from Olomouc, but also from Prague and Vienna, and came close to being ousted from the University. Monse's advocacy of the suppression of church institutions in favour of the secular state was nevertheless welcomed at the [[royal court]], and he was able to retain the professorship of secular law, but was nonetheless prevented from giving lectures on [[canon law]].&lt;ref name="cro"/&gt;

Despite the dissolution of the Jesuit order in 1773, the Catholics maintained a strong grip over the [[University of Olomouc]]. In the second half of the 1770s some shortcomings by the University management were uncovered, which was used by the emperor as pretext to move the University beyond the reach of the church at Olomouc, and the university was for a few years, until 1782, relocated to [[Brno]]. At the same time as this relocation the ''Directorate of Law'' was established (replacing the previously existing ''Professorate of Law'') and Monse became its head. However Monse was not able now to continue with his advocacy career. In Brno Monse started to publish works about history of Moravia, this time in [[German language|German]].

===Rector of the University, elevation to noble status===
In 1780 Monse was appointed Rector of the University; he gave his inauguration speech on the history of Moravia. He was also elevated to [[Nobility|noble]] status (together with his family) on December 1, 1780.&lt;ref name="geryk"/&gt; Despite these achievements, or maybe because of them, Monse remained the main target of catholic reaction.&lt;ref name="cro"/&gt; In the same year Monse started the lectures about Moravian history according to {{lang-cs|Kniha Tovačovská}} ({{lang-en|The Book of Tovačov}}) written by [[:de:Ctibor Tobischau von Cimburg|Ctibor Tovačovský z Cimburka]] in the 1490s. He also started writing his own history of Moravia, although this work only reaches to 1306.&lt;ref name="geryk"/&gt;

Monse became a member of the [[Learned society|learned societies]] of [[Hesse-Homburg]] (1780), [[Burghausen, Altötting|Burghausen]] (1782) and [[Prague]] (1785). (He was lawyer-member in the first two societies, and a historian-member of the Prague society.) He was also in frequent contact with other figures of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] in [[Habsburg Monarchy]], such as Riegger and [[Josef Dobrovský]] and many others.&lt;ref name="geryk"/&gt;

In 1782 the first Archbishop of Olomouc [[:de:Anton Theodor von Colloredo|Antonín Theodor Colloredo-Waldsee]] enforced relocation of the University back to Olomouc by decree of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. At the same time the institution lost its university status, becoming a mere three-year Lyceum. The Emperor had decided to retain only three universities, in [[Charles University|Prague]], [[Vienna University|Vienna]], and [[Lviv University|Lviv]].&lt;ref&gt;Other universities were reduced to lyceum status at the same time, including, in the Austrian heartland, the [[University of Innsbruck|universities at Innsbruck]] and at [[University of Graz|Graz]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Collegium Nobilium (Olomouc)|Collegium Nobilium]] was also dissolved by the emperor. Back in Olomouc, Monse started publishing in [[Czech language|Czech]] (Moravian) language. At the same time Monse insisted upon the establishment of a Department of National (=Moravian) Law and History: however this department lasted only until 1786, when it was dissolved.&lt;ref name="labsky"&gt;{{Citation

Monse's health was by now deteriorating and he ceased lecturing in 1792.

The persisting issues with the catholic reaction as well as his health problems led to a reduction in Monse's publishing activity. He died in Olomouc on February 6, 1793.&lt;ref name="cro"/&gt; With his death the lectures on Moravian law and history also ended.&lt;ref name="labsky"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Through his interest in both Moravian humanism and Benedictine historiography Monse linked the earlier [[Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis]] in Olomouc with the [[Société patriotique]] in Brno. The record of his lectures demonstrates an increasing willingness to link the early Enlightenment claims made on behalf of natural law with an appreciation of the virtues of the historical law of Moravia.  This reveals the influence both of a critical historical perception and of the judicial theory of the renowned jurist, [[Joseph von Sonnenfels]]. Monse also saw the need for an ideological basis capable of uniting the new educated middle class with the Enlightened intelligentsia's interest in the arts and sciences. He found such a basis in critical historiography, and eventually created the platform for a Moravian patriotic revival, enriched by historical Renaissance humanism.&lt;ref name="teich"&gt;{{Citation

'''Karlsruhe''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkaɐ̯lsˌʁuːə|-|De-Karlsruhe.ogg}}; formerly '''Carlsruhe'''{{cite needed|date=November 2018}}) is the second-largest city of the [[Germany|German]] federal state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] after its capital of [[Stuttgart]], and its 309,999 (2016) inhabitants make it the [[List of cities in Germany by population|21st largest city]] of Germany. On the right bank of the [[Rhine]], the city lies near the French-German border, between the [[Mannheim]]/[[Ludwigshafen]] conurbation to the north, and the [[Strasbourg]]/[[Kehl]] conurbation to the south. It is the largest city of [[Baden]], a region named after Hohenbaden Castle in the city of [[Baden-Baden]]. Karlsruhe is also the largest city in the [[South Franconian]] dialect area (transitional dialects between [[Central German|Central]] and [[Upper German]]), the only other larger city in that area being [[Heilbronn]]. The city is the seat of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht''), as well as of the [[Federal Court of Justice]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'') and the [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice]] (''Generalbundesanwalt beim Bundesgerichtshof'').

Karlsruhe was the capital of the [[Margraviate of Baden-Durlach]] ([[Durlach]]: 1565-1718; Karlsruhe: 1718-1771), the [[Margraviate of Baden]] (1771-1803), the [[Electorate of Baden]] (1803-1806), the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] (1806-1918), and the [[Republic of Baden]] (1918-1945). Its most remarkable building is [[Karlsruhe Palace]], which was built in 1715. There are nine institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (''Karlsruher Institut für Technologie''). [[Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport]] (''Flughafen Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden'') is the second-busiest airport of Baden-Württemberg after [[Stuttgart Airport]], and the 17th-busiest airport of Germany.

==Geography==
[[File:49th Parallel Karlsruhe.JPG|thumb|left|The [[49th parallel north]] in the Karlsruhe Stadtgarten]]
Karlsruhe lies completely to the east of the [[Rhine]], and almost completely on the [[Upper Rhine Plain]]. It contains the [[Turmberg]] in the east, and also lies on the borders of the [[Kraichgau]] leading to the [[Northern Black Forest]].

The Rhine, one of the world's most important shipping routes, forms the western limits of the city, beyond which lie the towns of [[Maximiliansau]] and [[Wörth am Rhein]] in the German state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The city centre is about {{convert|7.5|km|abbr=on}} from the river, as measured from the Marktplatz (Market Square). Two tributaries of the Rhine, the [[Alb]] and the [[Pfinz]], flow through the city from the Kraichgau to eventually join the Rhine.

The city lies at an altitude between 100 and 322&amp;nbsp;m (near the communications tower in the suburb of Grünwettersbach). Its geographical coordinates are {{Coord|49|00|N|8|24|E|type:city(282595)_region:DE-BW}}; the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] runs through the city centre, which puts it at the same latitude as much of the [[Canada–United States border]], the cities [[Vancouver]] (Canada), [[Paris]] (France), [[Regensburg]] (Germany), and [[Hulunbuir]] (China). Its course is marked by a stone and painted line in the ''Stadtgarten'' (municipal park). The total area of the city is {{convert|173.46|km2|abbr=on}},  hence it is the 30th largest city in Germany measured by land area. The longest north-south distance is {{convert|16.8|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19.3|km|abbr=on}} in the east-west direction.

Karlsruhe is part of the urban area of Karlsruhe/Pforzheim, to which certain other towns in the [[Karlsruhe (district)|district of Karlsruhe]] such as [[Bruchsal]], [[Ettlingen]], [[Stutensee]], and [[Rheinstetten]], as well as the city of [[Pforzheim]], belong.

[[File:MiRO8.jpg|thumb|MiRO oil refinery]]

The city was planned with the palace tower (''Schloss'') at the center and 32&amp;nbsp;streets radiating out from it like the [[spokes]] of a wheel, or the ribs of a [[fan (implement)|folding fan]], so that one [[nickname]] for Karlsruhe in German is the "fan city" (''Fächerstadt''). Almost all of these streets survive to this day. Because of this city layout, in [[metric geometry]], [[Karlsruhe metric]] refers to a measure of distance that assumes travel is only possible along radial streets and along circular avenues around the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rashid Bin Muhammad |url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Compgeometry/MyCG/CG-Applets/VoroKarlsruhe/karlcli.htm |title=Karlsruhe-Metric Voronoi Diagram |publisher=Personal.kent.edu |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city centre is the oldest part of town and lies south of the palace in the quadrant defined by nine of the radial streets. The central part of the palace runs east-west, with two wings, each at a 45°&amp;nbsp;angle, directed southeast and southwest (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;parallel with the streets marking the boundaries of the quadrant defining the city center).

The [[market square]] lies on the street running south from the palace to [[Ettlingen]]. The market square has the [[town hall]] (''Rathaus'') to the west, the main [[Lutheran]] church (''Evangelische Stadtkirche'') to the east, and the tomb of [[Charles III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Margrave Charles III William]] in [[Karlsruhe Pyramid|a pyramid]] in the buildings, resulting in Karlsruhe being one of only three large cities in Germany where buildings are laid out in the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style.

The area north of the palace is a park and forest. Originally the area to the east of the palace consisted of gardens and forests, some of which remain, but the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (founded in 1825), [[Wildparkstadion]] football stadium, and residential areas have been built there. The area west of the palace is now mostly residential.

Wings of the palace align with streets, all radiating out from the centre of town, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the palace tower.]]

===Climate===
Karlsruhe experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') and its winter climate is milder, compared to most other German cities, except for the [[Rhine-Ruhr#Climate|Rhine-Ruhr]] area. Summers are also hotter than elsewhere in the country and it is one of the sunniest cities in Germany, like the [[Rhine Palatinate|Rhine-Palatinate]] area. Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year. In 2008, the weather station in Karlsruhe, which had been operating since 1876, was closed; it was replaced by a weather station in [[Rheinstetten]], south of Karlsruhe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetter.im-licht-der-natur.de/Wetterstation.htm |title=Die Wetterstationen in Karlsruhe |publisher=Wetter.im-licht-der-natur.de |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to legend, the name ''Karlsruhe'', which translates as "Charles’ repose", was given to the new city after a hunting trip when Margrave [[Charles&amp;nbsp;III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Charles III William]] of [[Margraviate of Baden-Durlach|Baden-Durlach]], woke from a dream in which he dreamt of founding his new city. A variation of this story claims that he built the new palace to find peace from his wife.

Charles William founded the city on June 17, 1715, after a dispute with the citizens of his previous capital, [[Durlach]]. The founding of the city is closely linked to the construction of the [[Karlsruhe Palace|palace]]. Karlsruhe became the capital of [[Baden-Durlach]], and in 1771, of the united [[Baden]] until 1945. Built in 1822, the ''Ständehaus'' was the first parliament building in a German state. In the aftermath of the democratic revolution of 1848, a republican government was elected here.

Karlsruhe was visited by [[Thomas Jefferson]] during his time as the American envoy to France; when [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] was planning the layout of [[Washington, DC]], Jefferson passed to him maps of 12 European towns to consult, one of which was a sketch he had made of Karlsruhe during his visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D5ypKh0Tg5oC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Karlsruhe and the United States|pages=35–37|author=Volker C. Ihle|publisher=Sonstige|date= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, the first-ever international professional [[convention (meeting)|convention]] of chemists, the [[Karlsruhe Congress]], was held in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ihde, Aaron J. |title=The Karlsruhe Congress: A Centennial Retrospective |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |year=1961 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=83&amp;ndash;86 |url=http://search.jce.divched.org/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&amp;-lay=wwwform&amp;combo=karlsruhe&amp;-find=&amp;-format=detail.html&amp;-skip=0&amp;-max=1&amp;-token.2=0&amp;-token.3=10 |doi=10.1021/ed038p83 |format= |bibcode=1961JChEd..38...83I }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the central area, including the palace, was reduced to rubble by [[Allied bombing of Germany|Allied bombing]] during World War II, but was rebuilt after the war. Located in the American zone of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|postwar Allied occupation]], Karlsruhe was home to an [[United States Armed Forces|American military]] base, established in 1945. In 1995, the bases [[List of United States Army installations in Germany#Former installations|closed]], and their facilities were turned over to the city of Karlsruhe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Walter |last=Elkins |url=http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont.htm?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.usarmygermany.com/USAREUR_City_Karlsruhe.htm |title=U.S. Army Installations - Karlsruhe |publisher=U.S. Army in Germany |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
The ''Stadtgarten'' is a recreational area near the main railway station (''Hauptbahnhof'') and was rebuilt for the 1967 [[Federal Garden Show]] (''Bundesgartenschau''). It is also the site of the [[Karlsruhe Zoo]].

The ''[[Durlach]]er [[Turmberg]]'' has a look-out tower (hence its name). It is a former [[keep]] dating back to the 13th century.

The city has two botanical gardens: the municipal ''[[Botanischer Garten Karlsruhe]]'', which forms part of the Palace complex, and the ''[[Botanischer Garten der Universität Karlsruhe]]'', which is maintained by the university.

[[File:Karlsruhe Orangerie garden panorama.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Panorama of the courtyard of [[Botanischer Garten Karlsruhe]].]]

The ''Marktplatz'' has a [[Karlsruhe Pyramid|stone pyramid]] marking the grave of the city's founder. Built in 1825, it is the emblem of Karlsruhe.
The city is nicknamed the "fan city" (''die Fächerstadt'') because of its design layout, with straight streets radiating fan-like from the Palace.

The [[Karlsruhe Palace]] (''Schloss'') is an interesting piece of architecture; the adjacent ''Schlossgarten'' includes the Botanical Garden with a palm, cactus and orchid house, and walking paths through the woods to the north.

The so-called ''Kleine Kirche'' (Little Church), built between 1773 and 1776, is the oldest church of Karlsruhe's city centre.

The architect [[Friedrich Weinbrenner]] designed many of the city's most important sights. Another sight is the ''Rondellplatz'' with its 'Constitution Building Columns' (1826). It is dedicated to Baden's first constitution in 1818, which was one of the most liberal of its time. The ''Münze'' (mint), erected in 1826/27, was also built by Weinbrenner.

[[File:Karlsruhe StStephan.jpg|thumb|St. Stephan parish church]]
The St. Stephan parish church is one of the masterpieces of neoclassical church architecture in.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Weinbrenner, who built this church between 1808 and 1814, orientated it to the [[Pantheon, Rome]].
[[File:Karlsruhe Grabkapelle.jpg|thumb|Grand Ducal burial chapel]]
The [[neo-Gothic]] Grand Ducal Burial Chapel, built between 1889 and 1896, is a [[mausoleum]] rather than a church, and is located in the middle of the forest.

The main cemetery of Karlsruhe is the oldest park-like cemetery in Germany. The [[cremation|crematorium]] was the first to be built in the style of a church.

Karlsruhe is also home to a Museum of Natural History, an opera house (the [[Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe|Baden State Theatre]]), as well as a number of independent theatres and art galleries. The [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe|State Art Gallery]], built in 1846 by [[Heinrich Hübsch]], displays paintings and sculptures from six centuries, particularly from France, Germany and Holland. Karlsruhe's newly renovated art museum is one of the most important art museums in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. Further cultural attractions are scattered throughout Karlsruhe's various incorporated suburbs. Established in 1924, the Scheffel Association is the largest [[literary society]] in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Today the ''Prinz-Max-Palais'', built between 1881 and 1884 in neoclassical style, houses the organisation and includes its museum.
[[File:Karlsruhe Moninger Jugendstil.jpg|thumb|Breweries and buildings in art nouveau style were predominant in the western city]]
Due to population growth in the late 19th century, Karlsruhe developed several suburban areas (''[[Vorstadt]]'') in the ''[[Gründerzeit]]'' and especially [[art nouveau]] styles of architecture, with many preserved examples.

Karlsruhe is also home to the ''Majolika-Manufaktur'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staatliche Majolika Manufaktur Karlsruhe GmbH |url=http://www.majolika-karlsruhe.com/ |title=Majolika-Manufaktur |publisher=Majolika-karlsruhe.com |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only art-ceramics pottery studio in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Founded in 1901, it is located in the ''Schlossgarten''. A 'blue streak' (''Blauer Strahl'') consisting of 1,645 ceramic tiles, connects the studio with the Palace. It is the world's largest ceramic artwork.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Another tourist attraction is the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|Centre for Art and Media]] (''Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie'', or ZKM), which is located in a converted ammunition factory.

==Government==

===Justice===
[[File:Karlsruhe bundesverfassungsgericht.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]]]
Karlsruhe is the seat of the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] ''(Bundesverfassungsgericht)'' and the highest [[Court of Appeals]] in civil and criminal cases, the ''[[Bundesgerichtshof]]''. The courts came to Karlsruhe after World War II, when the provinces of [[Baden Germany|Baden]] and [[Württemberg]] were merged. [[Stuttgart]], capital of Württemberg, became the capital of the new province ([[Württemberg-Baden]] in 1945 and [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952). In compensation for the state authorities relocated to Stuttgart, Karlsruhe applied to become the seat of the high court.&lt;ref&gt;Stadt Karlsruhe Stadtarchiv (ed.): ''Karlsruhe. Die Stadtgeschichte.'' Badenia, Karlsruhe 1998, {{ISBN|3-7617-0353-8}}, p. 591–594&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health===
There are four hospitals: The municipal ''Klinikum Karlsruhe'' provides the maximum level of medical services, the ''St. Vincentius-Kliniken'' and the ''[[Deaconess|Diakonissen]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;krankenhaus'', connected to the Catholic and Protestant churches, respectively, offer central services, and the private ''Paracelsus-Klinik'' basic medical care, according to state hospital demand planning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Economy==
Germany's largest [[oil refinery]] is located in Karlsruhe, at the western edge of the city, directly on the river [[Rhine]]. The ''Technologieregion Karlsruhe'' is a loose confederation of the region's cities in order to promote high tech industries; today, about 20% of the region's jobs are in research and development. [[EnBW]], one of Germany's biggest [[electric utility]] companies and a revenue of 19.2&amp;nbsp;billion € in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Report 2012|url=https://www.enbw.com/media/konzern/docs/integrierte-berichterstattung/bericht-2012/enbw-finanzbericht-2012.pdf|publisher=EnBW|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is headquartered in the city.

===Internet activities===
Due to the [[University of Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] providing services until the late 1990, Karlsruhe became known as the ''internet capital'' of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.young-germany.de/topic/study/city-campus/karlsruhe-germanys-internet-capital], a webpage by the Federal Foreign Office&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DENIC]], Germany's [[Network Information Centre]], has since moved to Frankfurt, though, where [[DE-CIX]] is located.

Two major [[internet service provider]]s, [[WEB.DE]] and [[schlund+partner]]/[[1&amp;1 Internet|1&amp;1]], now both owned by [[United Internet]]&amp;nbsp;AG, are located at Karlsruhe.

The library of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] developed the [[Karlsruher Virtueller Katalog]], the first internet site that allowed researchers worldwide (for free) to search multiple library catalogues worldwide.

In the year 2000 the regional online "newspaper" ''ka&amp;#8209;news.de'' was created. As a daily newspaper, it not only provides the news, but also informs readers about upcoming events in Karlsruhe and surrounding areas.
[[File:Karlsruhe Rbf Einfahrgruppe.jpg|thumb|[[Rail yard]], [[bypass (road)|bypass road]] Südtangente]]

In addition to established companies, Karlsruhe has a vivid and spreading startup community with well-known startups like STAPPZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.techtag.de/startups/10-fragen-christian-von-stappz/ | title=Interview mit einem Gründer aus Karlsruhe | accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stappz.com | title=STAPPZ App from Karlsruhe, Homepage | accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the local high tech industry is responsible for over 22.000 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.clusterportal-bw.de/clusterdatenbank/clusterdb/Clusterinitiative/show/clusterinitiative/cyberforum-e-v/ | title=Region: Mittlerer Oberrhein Informationstechnologie, IT-Anwendungen / Unternehmenssoftware | accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
The [[Verkehrsbetriebe Karlsruhe]] (VBK) operates the city's urban public transport network, comprising seven tram routes and a network of bus routes. This network is well developed and all city areas can be reached round the clock by tram and a night bus system. The [[Turmbergbahn]] [[funicular|funicular railway]], to the east of the city centre, is also operated by the VBK.

The VBK is also a partner, with the [[Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft]] and [[Deutsche Bahn]], in the operation of the [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]], the rail system that serves a larger area around the city. This system makes it possible to reach other towns in the region, like [[Ettlingen]], [[Wörth am Rhein]], [[Pforzheim]], [[Bad Wildbad]], [[Bretten]], [[Bruchsal]], [[Heilbronn]], [[Baden-Baden]], and even [[Freudenstadt]] in the [[Black Forest]] right from the city centre. The Stadtbahn is well known in transport circles around the world for pioneering the concept of operating trams on train tracks, to achieve a more effective and attractive [[public transport]] system, to the extent that this is often known as the [[Karlsruhe model]] [[tram-train]] system.

Karlsruhe is well-connected via road and rail, with [[Autobahn]] and [[InterCityExpress]] connections going to [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]]/[[Munich]] and [[Freiburg]]/[[Basel]] from [[Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof]]. Since June 2007 it has been connected to the [[TGV]] network, reducing travel time to [[Paris]] to only three hours (previously it had taken five hours).

[[File:Karlsruhe OElhafen.jpg|thumb|Oil port]]
Two ports on the [[Rhine]] provide transport capacity on [[cargo ship]]s, especially for [[petroleum products]].

The nearest airport is part of the [[Baden Airpark]] (officially ''Flughafen Karlsruhe/[[Baden-Baden]]'') about {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Karlsruhe, with regular connections to airports in Germany and Europe in general. [[Frankfurt International Airport]] can be reached in about an hour and a half by car (one hour by [[InterCityExpress]]); [[Stuttgart Airport]] can be reached in about one hour (about an hour and a half by train and [[S-Bahn|S&amp;#8209;Bahn]]).

Two interesting facts in transportation history are that both [[Karl Drais]], the inventor of the bicycle, as well as [[Karl Benz]], the inventor of the automobile were born in Karlsruhe. Benz was born in Mühlburg, which later became a borough of Karlsruhe (in 1886). Benz also studied at the Karlsruhe University. It also is interesting that Benz’s wife [[Bertha Benz|Bertha]] took the world's first long distance-drive with an automobile from [[Mannheim]] to Karlsruhe-Grötzingen and [[Pforzheim]] (see [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]]). Their professional lives led both men to the neighboring city of Mannheim, where they first applied their most famous inventions.

==Jewish community==
Jews settled in Karlsruhe soon after its founding.&lt;ref name="Singer1906"&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=SzsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA448 Karlsruhe (Carlsruhe)]" (1906). ''The Jewish Encyclopedia''. Ed. Isidore Singer. Vol. 7. p. 448-449.&lt;/ref&gt; They were attracted by the numerous privileges granted by its founder to settlers, without discrimination as to creed. Official documents attest the presence of several Jewish families at Karlsruhe in 1717.&lt;ref name="Singer1906"/&gt; A year later the city council addressed to the margrave a report in which a question was raised as to the proportion of municipal charges to be borne by the newly arrived Jews, who in that year formed an organized congregation, with Rabbi Nathan Uri Kohen of [[Metz]] at its head. A document dated 1726 gives the names of twenty-four Jews who had taken part in an election of municipal officers.

As the city grew, permission to settle there became less easily obtained by Jews, and the community developed more slowly. A 1752 Jewry ordinance stated Jews were forbidden to leave the city on Sundays and Christian holidays, or to go out of their houses during church services, but they were exempted from service by court summonses on Sabbaths. They could sell wine only in inns owned by Jews and graze their cattle, not on the [[commons]], but on the wayside only. [[Nethaneel Weil|Nethanael Weill]] was a rabbi in Karlsruhe from 1750 until his death.

In 1783, by a decree issued by Margrave [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick of Baden]], the Jews ceased to be [[serf]]s, and consequently could settle wherever they pleased. The same decree freed them from the ''Todfall'' tax, paid to the clergy for each Jewish burial. In commemoration of these changes special prayers were prepared by the acting rabbi Jedidiah Tiah Weill, who, succeeding his father in 1770, held the office until 1805.

In 1808 the new constitution of what at that time, during the [[Napoleonic era]], had become the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] granted Jews citizenship status; a subsequent edict, in 1809, constitutionally acknowledged Jews as a religious group.&lt;ref name="Dubnow1920"&gt;[[Simon Dubnow|Dubnow, Simon]] (1920). ''Die neueste Geschichte des Jüdischen Volkes (1789-1914)''. {{De icon}} Translated from the Russian by Alexander Eliasberg. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zJPuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA228 Vol. 1.

New York: Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Inc. p. 330-332; here: p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter edict provided for a hierarchical organization of the Jewish communities of Baden, under the umbrella of a central council of Baden Jewry (Oberrat der Israeliten Badens), with its seat in Karlsruhe,&lt;ref name="Dubnow1920"/&gt; and the appointment of a chief rabbi of Karlsruhe, as the spiritual head of the Jews in all of Baden.&lt;ref name="Singer1906"/&gt; The first chief rabbi of Karlsruhe and Baden was Rabbi Asher Loew, who served from 1809 until his death in 1837.&lt;ref name="Oelsner"&gt;Oelsner, Toni (2007). "Karlsruhe." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Vol. 11. Detroit: Macmillan Reference. p. 810-811.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complete [[emancipation]] was given in 1862, Jews were elected to city council and Baden parliament, and from 1890 were appointed judges. Jews were persecuted in the [[Hep-Hep riots|'Hep-Hep' riots]] that occurred in 1819; and anti-Jewish demonstrations were held in 1843, 1848, and the 1880s. The well-known German-Israeli artist [[Leo Kahn]] studied in Karlsruhe before leaving for France and Israel in the 1920s and 1930s.

Today, there are about 900 members in the Jewish community, many of whom are recent immigrants from Russia, and an orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jg-karlsruhe.de |title=Jewish Community Karlsruhe - Karlsruhe, Germany }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karlsruhe has memorialized its Jewish community and notable pre-war synagogues with a memorial park.&lt;ref name="alemannia-judaica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/images/Images%2021/ka%20syn.jpg|title=images/Images%2021/ka%20syn|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karlsruhe and the Holocaust===
In 1933, 3,358 Jews lived in Karlsruhe. The Jewish community owned buildings and property, such as two synagogues, one on Karl-Friedrich-Straße and one on Kronenstraße, two elderly citizens' homes, a Jewish school, a hospital, welfare institutions, and several Jewish cemeteries. During the first years of the Nazi regime, the community continued to function, particularly to prepare Jews for emigration. On October 28, 1938, all male Polish Jews living in Karlsruhe were deported to Poland. Synagogues were destroyed on [[Kristallnacht]], 9–10 November 1938. Most of the men were arrested and sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]], but were released after they had furnished proof that they intended to emigrate. In October 1940, 895 Jews were expelled during [[Operation Wagner-Bürckel]] and interned by the French [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities in [[Camp Gurs|Gurs]] in southern France. Most of these were then deported from there to [[Auschwitz]] (via the [[Drancy deportation camp]], on the outskirts of [[Paris]]) between August and November 1942. Most of the 429 remaining Jews and other so‑called "non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]]" were deported to the east between 1941 and 1944. In 1945 there were only 18 Jews in Karlsruhe. More than 1,000 of them had been killed between 1933 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karlsruhe.de/kultur/stadtgeschichte/gedenkbuch.de |title=Karlsruhe condolence book |publisher=Karlsruhe.de |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baden Central Jewish Council was reorganized in 1948. A new synagogue was built in 1969.

Some 113 holocaust victims are commemorated by brass plaques on Karlsruhe's sidewalks, the so-called [[Stolperstein]]e.

In 1999 the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM]] (''Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie'', Centre for Art and Media) was opened. Within a short time it built up a worldwide reputation as a cultural institution. Linking new media theory and practice, the ZKM is located in a former weapons factory. Among the institutes related to the ZKM are the ''[[Staatliche Hochschule für Gestaltung]]'' (State University of Design), whose president is philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]] and the Museum for Contemporary Art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3265">'''Marian Kamil Dziewanowski''' (May 1913, [[Zhytomyr]] – 18 February 2005, [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]) was a historian of Poland, Russia and modern Europe.

==Life==
Born in [[Zhytomir]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Ukraine]]), Dziewanowski grew up and studied in [[interwar Poland]] at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]].  In 1937–39 he was a foreign correspondent in Berlin, covering the ''[[Anschluss]]'' with [[Austria]], the [[Munich Conference]], and the German occupation of the [[Sudetenland]].

During the German invasion of [[Poland]], Dziewanowski served as a Polish cavalry platoon leader.  Later he served in England as an instructor/interpreter at a school for paratroopers and saboteurs, as an editor of a secret radio station working with the resistance in Poland, as a [[BBC news]] commentator, and, in Washington, as an aide to the Polish military attache.  After the war, he chose to remain in exile rather than return to communist Poland.

He moved to the [[United States]], where at [[Harvard University]] he earned one of the first postwar doctorates in Russian and East European history.  He taught at Boston University, where he attained the rank of [[professor]]. From 1979 to 1984 he taught at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]].

He authored many articles and books on 19th- and 20th-century [[history of Poland|Polish]] and [[history of Russia|Russian]] history. He wrote important works on the political ideas of [[Józef Piłsudski]], the most prominent Polish politician of the [[interbellum]], and of the great 19th-century Polish and Russian politician, Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]].

Dziewanowski was a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]], headquartered in [[Kraków]].

'''Medicine in ancient Rome''' combined various techniques using different tools, methodology, and ingredients. Roman [[medicine]] was highly influenced by Greek medicine.  Greek physicians including [[Dioscorides]] and [[Galen]] practiced medicine and recorded their discoveries in the [[Roman Empire]]. These three physicians had knowledge of hundreds of herbal, among other, medicines.

[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] medicine was divided into specializations such as [[ophthalmology]] and [[urology]]. A variety of [[Surgery|surgical procedures]] were carried out using many different instruments including [[forceps]], [[scalpel]]s and [[catheter]]s.

==Introduction==

The Roman Empire was a complex and vigorous combination of Greek and Roman cultural elements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Medicine|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qtUzscI9_VIC|publisher = CRC Press|date = 1992-03-17|isbn = 9780824786731|first = Lois N.|last = Magner|pages = 80–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; forged through centuries of contact. Later Latin authors, notably [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], believed in a specifically Roman type of healing based on herbs, chants, prayers and charms easily available to any head of household.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Western medical tradition.

Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9780521475648|location = Cambridge|pages = 33–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek medicine was introduced into Italy with the establishment and development of military and political contacts between the two regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Western Medical Thought from Antiquity to the Middle Ages|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2luR1Ki7NX8C|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 2002-05-01|isbn = 9780674007956|first = Mirko D.|last = Grmek|first2 = Bernardino|last2 = Fantini|first3 = Antony|last3 = Shugaar|pages = 111–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until the introduction of the healing god [[Asclepius]] in 291 BC and the arrival of the Greek doctor Archagathus in 219 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Western Medical Tradition: 800 BC to AD 1800|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GeCFKXHYYEEC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1995-08-17|isbn = 9780521475648|first = Lawrence I.|last = Conrad|first2 = Wellcome Institute for the History of|last2 = Medicine|pages = 39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; that foreign medicine was publicly accepted in Rome.

Setting aside some of the broader implications of the Greek influence on Roman society, the effect of Greek medicine, ethnography, and meteorology was particularly pertinent to two fields: architecture and health care. This was particularly important from the perspective of the Roman army,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Patients and Healers in the High Roman Empire|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tSp-BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = JHU Press|date = 2015-01-23|isbn = 9781421416281|first = Ido|last = Israelowich|pages = 90–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which there were many medical advances. A medical corpus was established,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; permanent physicians were appointed, the ''valetudinaria'' (military hospitals) were established, and in Caesar's time, the first traces of systematic care for the wounded appeared. The variety and nature of the surgical instruments discovered in Roman remains indicate a good knowledge of surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3286964|title = Medicine in the Roman Army|last = Byrne|first = Eugene Hugh|date = Apr 1910|journal = The Classical Journal|doi = |pmid = |publisher = The Classical Association of the Middle West and South}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman medicine ==
Roman medicine was highly influenced by the Greek medical tradition. The incorporation of Greek medicine into Roman society allowed Rome to transform into a monumental{{clarify|date=May 2017}} city by 100 BCE.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient medicine|last=Nutton|first=Vivian|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0-415-36848-3|location=London|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Greek physicians, Roman physicians relied on naturalistic observations rather than on spiritual rituals; but that does not imply an absence of spiritual belief. Tragic famines and plagues were often attributed to divine punishment; and appeasement of the gods through rituals was believed to alleviate such events. [[Miasma theory|Miasma]] was perceived to be the root cause of many diseases, whether caused by famine, wars, or plague. The concept of contagion was formulated, resulting in practices of quarantine and improved sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Conrad|first1 = Lawrence I.|title = The Western medical tradition, 800 BC to AD 1800|date = 1998|publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge|isbn = 0521475643|edition = Reprinted.|pages = 53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first prominent doctors in Rome was [[Galen]]. He became an expert on the human anatomy by dissecting animals, including monkeys, in Greece.&lt;ref name="What Is Ancient Roman Medicine"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is Ancient Roman Medicine?|url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/medicine/ancient-roman-medicine.php|website = www.medicalnewstoday.com|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his prominence and expertise in ancient Rome, [[Galen]] became Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]' personal physician.&lt;ref name="What Is Ancient Roman Medicine" /&gt;

The Romans also conquered the city of Alexandria, which was an important center for learning; its [[Library of Alexandria|Great Library]] held countless volumes of ancient Greek medical information.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The Romans adopted into their medical practices many of the practices and procedures they found in the Great Library.[[File:Caduceus.png|thumbnail|The caduceus is a winged staff with two snakes wrapped around it]]

Greek symbols and gods greatly influenced ancient Roman medicine. The [[caduceus]], pictured right, was originally associated with Hermes, the Greek god of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hermes|url = http://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html|website = www.greekmythology.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried a staff wrapped with two snakes, known as the caduceus. This [[Caduceus as a symbol of medicine|symbol]] later became associated with the Roman God, Mercury. Later, in the 7th century, the caduceus became associated with health and medicine due to its association with the Azoth, the alchemical "universal solvent".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Opposition to Greek medicine in Rome / Pre Physicians==
[[Cato the Elder]] despised every aspect of Greek society the Romans decided to mimic including sculptures, literature and medicine. Cato regarded the welcome given in Rome to [[ancient Greek medicine|Greek medicine and physicians]] as a major threat.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;“Household Medicine In Ancient Rome.”&amp;nbsp;''The British Medical Journal'', vol. 1, no. 2140, 1902, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, before there were doctors, the ''paterfamilias'' (head of the family) was responsible for treating the sick. Cato the Elder himself examined those who lived near him, often prescribing cabbage as a treatment for many ailments ranging from constipation to deafness. He would issue precise instructions on how to prepare the cabbage for patients with specific ailments. He also used cabbage in liquid form. For example, a mixture of cabbage, water, and wine would be embedded in a deaf man's ear to allow his hearing to be restored. Cato would treat fractured or broken appendages with two ends of a cut reed that were bandaged around the injury.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Physicians==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

Many Greek doctors came to Rome. Many of them strongly believed in achieving the right balance of the [[Humorism|four humors]] and restoring the natural heat of patients. Around 200 BCE many wealthy families in Rome had personal Greek physicians. By around 50 BCE, it was more common than not to have a Greek physician.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Dioscorides ===
{{main|Pedanius Dioscorides}}

[[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (c. 40–90 CE), was a Greek botanist, pharmacologist and physician who practised in Rome during the reign of Nero. He became a famous army doctor. Dioscorides wrote a 5-volume encyclopedia, ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'', which listed over 600 herbal cures, forming an influential and long-lasting [[pharmacopoeia]]. ''De Materia Medica'' was used extensively by doctors for the following 1500 years.&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_dioscorides.html | title=Greek Medicine | publisher=National Institutes of Health, USA | date=16 September 2002 | accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soranus ===
{{main|Soranus of Ephesus}}

'''Soranus''' was a Greek physician, born in Ephesus, who lived during the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Medicine |volume=18 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (98–138 CE). According to the ''[[Suda]]'', he practised in Alexandria and subsequently in Rome. He was the chief representative of the [[Methodic school]] of physicians. His treatise ''[[Gynaecology]]'' is extant (first published in 1838, later by [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|V. Rose]], in 1882, with a 6th-century Latin translation by [[Muscio]], a physician of the same school).

=== Galen ===
{{main|Galen}}

Galen (129 CE&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Galen | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | volume = IV | pages = 385  | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year = 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; c. 200 or 216 CE) of [[Pergamon]] was a prominent Greek&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-223895/Galen-of-Pergamum Galen of Pergamum]&lt;/ref&gt; physician, whose theories dominated [[Western culture|Western]] medical science for well over a millennium. By the age of 20, he had served for four years in the local temple as a ''therapeutes'' ("attendant" or "associate") of the [[Greek pantheon|god]] [[Asclepius]]. Although Galen studied the human body, dissection of human corpses was against [[Roman law]], so instead he used pigs, apes, and other animals.

Galen moved to Rome in 162. There he lectured, wrote extensively, and performed public demonstrations of his [[anatomy|anatomical]] knowledge. He soon gained a reputation as an experienced physician, attracting to his practice a large number of patients. Among them was the [[consul]] [[Flavius Boethius]], who introduced him to the imperial court, where he became a physician to Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].

Despite being a member of the court, Galen reputedly shunned [[Latin]], preferring to speak and write in his native [[Greek language|Greek]], a tongue that was actually quite popular in Rome. He treated Roman luminaries such as [[Lucius Verus]], [[Commodus]], and [[Septimius Severus]]. In 166 Galen returned to Pergamon, but went back to Rome for good in 169.

Galen followed Hippocrates' theory of the [[Humorism|four humours]], believing that one's health depended on the balance between the four main fluids of the body (blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm). Food was believed to be the initial object that allowed the stabilization of these humours. By contrast, drugs, [[venesection]], [[cautery]] and surgery were drastic and were to be used only when diet could no longer help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Galen: on food and diet|author = Galen|publisher = Routledge|year = 2000|isbn = 0415232325|location = London and New York|pages = 5–7|others = Translator: Grant, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival and amendment of Hippocratic medicine is attributed to [[Galen]]. He writes that a physician "must be skilled at reasoning about the problems presented to him, must understand the nature and function of the body within the physician world{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and must "practice temperance and despise all money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Jonsen|first1 = Albert R.|title = A short history of medical ethics|date = 2000|publisher = Oxford University Press|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K21wU-TOVbEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22is+staunched+not+by+medication+but+by+incantation,+a+religious%22+%22clarity+is+required+about+dates.+I+shall+use+the+convention+of+a+minus+sign+(-)+to%22+&amp;ots=5P7w5WVRIc&amp;sig=B2DQHhdZrqnv4qLb7dAl1tz2ikE|page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal physician treats both the poor and elite fairly and is a student of all that affects health. Galen references Hippocrates throughout his writings, saying that Hippocratic literature is the basis for physicians' conduct and treatments. The writings of Galen survived more{{clarify|date=May 2017}} than other medical writings in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Conrad|first1 = Lawrence I.|title = The Western medical tradition, 800 BC to AD 1800|isbn = 0521475643|page = 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&amp;nbsp;Asclepiades ===
{{Main|Asclepiades of Bithynia}}
Asclepiades studied to be a physician in Alexandria and practiced medicine in Asia Minor as well as Greece before he moved to Rome in the 1st century BCE. His knowledge of medicine allowed him to flourish as a physician. Asclepiades was a leading physician in Rome and was a close friend of Cicero.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;“A Fashionable Physician Of Ancient Rome.”&amp;nbsp;''The British Medical Journal'', vol. 2, no. 1763, 1894, pp. 820–820.&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed his own version of the molecular structure of the human body. Asclepiades' atomic model contained multi-shaped atoms that passed through bodily pores. The two were required to be in sync{{clarify|date=May 2017}} in order to avoid disease.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Asclepiades strongly believed in hot and cold baths as a remedy for illness; his techniques purposely did not inflict severe pain upon the patient. His other remedies included: listening to music to induce sedation, and consuming wine to cure headache and to cure a fever. Asclepiades is the first documented physician in Rome to use massage therapy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Hospitals ==
[[File:Roman Military Hospital - Valetudinarium - late 1st c. A.D. Wellcome L0002116.jpg|thumb|upright|Plan of Valetudinarium, near Düsseldorf, Germany. Late 1st century]]
The Roman medical system saw the establishment of the first hospitals; these were reserved for slaves and soldiers. Physicians were assigned to follow armies or ships, tending to the injured. Medical care for the poor was almost non-existent, so the poor had to resort to spiritual aid.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The earliest known Roman hospitals of the Roman Empire were built in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Military Medicine: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5BXB9QtUfFQC|publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 2008-01-01|isbn = 9781851096930|first = Jack Edward|last = McCallum|pages = 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the reign of the emperor [[Trajan]]. The army's expansion beyond the [[Italian Peninsula]] meant that the wounded could no longer be cared for in private homes.{{Fix|text=why?}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For this reason the ''valetudinarium'' was established.

The ''valetudinaria'' (plural of ''valetudinarium'')  were field hospitals or flying military camps&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Medicine in the Roman Army|jstor = 3286964|journal = The Classical Journal|date = 1910-04-01|pages = 267–272|volume = 5|issue = 6|first = Eugene Hugh|last = Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began as a small cluster of tents and fortresses dedicated to wounded soldiers. Over time, the temporary forts developed into permanent facilities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man and Wound in the Ancient World: A History of Military Medicine from Sumer to the Fall of Constantinople|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KDi8CB3B6vgC|publisher = Potomac Books, Inc.|date = 2012-01-01|isbn = 9781597978484|first = Richard A.|last = Gabriel|pages = 168–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original hospitals were built along major roads, and soon became part of [[Castra|Roman fort architecture]]. They were usually placed near the outer wall in a quiet part of the fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The evolution of hospitals from antiquity to the Renaissance|url = http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/view/52575|journal = Acta Theologica|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 1015-8758|pages = 213–232|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.4314/actat.v26i2.52575|first = F.

=== The hospital building ===
A standard valetudinarium was a rectangular building consisting of four wings, connected by an entrance hall that could be used as a [[triage]] center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ancient World|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780313333484|first = Richard A.|last = Gabriel|pages = 156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each legion's hospital was constructed to accommodate 6% to 10% of the legion's 5,000 men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The building also included a large hall, reception ward, dispensary, kitchen, staff quarters, and washing and latrine facilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Surgical instruments==

[[File:Roman catheters BM GR1968.6-26.1to39.jpg|thumb|Ancient Roman bronze [[catheter]]s (1st century CE)]]

A variety of surgical instruments are known from archaeology and Roman medical literature, including:&lt;ref name=tools&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/romansurgical/ | title=Surgical Instruments from Ancient Rome | publisher=University of Virginia Claude Moore Health Services Library | date=2007 | accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rectal speculum: An instrument mentioned by [[Hippocrates]], which allowed physicians to examine the rectal cavity of a patient.

;Bone levers: A tool used to leverage bones back into their proper place in a limb.

;Cupping vessels: Containers used for bloodletting. Vessels of different sizes were used depending on how much blood was expected.

;Tubes: After surgery, a bronze or lead tube would be inserted into the patient to prevent adhesion or contractions.

;Tile cautery: A physician's "bread and butter" tool. This instrument was used for several purposes, such as stopping bleeding, cutting flesh or removing growths.&lt;ref name=tools/&gt;

;Surgical scissors: Hair cutting was actually considered a medical procedure.

;Spatula probes: A double sided instrument used by almost every physician. One end was used for mixing medications, while the other end was flat and used to spread the medications onto the patient.

;Scalpels: Could be made of either steel or bronze. Ancient scalpels had almost the same form and function as those of today. The most usual type of scalpels were the longer, steel scalpels. These could be used to make a variety of incisions, but they seem to be particularly suited for deep or long cuts. Smaller, bronze scalpels, referred to as bellied scalpels, were also used frequently since the shape allowed delicate and precise cuts to be made.&lt;ref name=tools/&gt;

;Obstetrical hooks: A common instrument used by Roman and Greek doctors. There were two basic types of hooks: sharp hooks and blunt hooks. Blunt hooks were used primarily as probes for dissection and for raising blood vessels. Sharp hooks, on the other hand, were used to hold and lift small pieces of tissue so that they could be extracted, and to retract the edges of wounds.&lt;ref name=tools/&gt;

;Bone drills: Driven in their rotary motion by means of a thong in various configurations. They were used to remove diseased bone tissue from the skull and to remove foreign objects (such as a weapon) from a bone.

;Bone forceps: Used to extract small fragments of bone which could not be grasped by the fingers.&lt;ref name=tools/&gt;

;Male catheters: Used in order to open up a blocked urinary tract to let urine pass freely from the body. Early catheters were hollow tubes made of steel or bronze, and had two basic designs. There were catheters with a slight S curve for male patients and a straighter one for females. There were similar shaped devices called bladder sounds that were used to probe the bladder in search of calcifications.&lt;ref name=tools/&gt;

;Uvula (crushing) forceps: These finely toothed jawed forceps were designed for the amputation of the uvula. The physician crushed the uvula with forceps before cutting it off in order to reduce bleeding.&lt;ref name=tools/&gt;

;Vaginal specula: Among the most complex instruments used by Roman and Greek physicians. Most of the vaginal specula discovered consist of a screw device which, when turned, forces a cross-bar to push the blades outwards.&lt;ref name=tools/&gt;

;Spatula: Used to mix and apply various ointments.&lt;ref name=tools/&gt;

;Surgical saw: Used to cut through bones, e.g. in amputations.

== Medicines ==

=== Diet ===
Correct [[Food and diet in Ancient medicine|diet]] was seen as essential to healthy living. Food was perceived to have a healing effect or a causative effect on disease, determined by its impact on the humors; as well as preventing disease. Moderation of foods was key to healthy living and gave rise to healthy eating philosophies. When diet no longer promoted health, drugs, [[phlebotomy]], [[cautery]], or surgery were used. Patients having control of their lives, managing their own preventative medical diets, and the freedom to seek physicians, indicates that patient autonomy was valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Grant|first1 = Mark|title = Galen on food and diet|date = 2000|publisher = Routledge|location = London|isbn = 0-415-23232-5|pages = 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbal and other medicines===

Roman physicians used a wide range of herbal and other medicines. Their ancient names, often derived from Greek, do not necessarily correspond to individual modern species, even if these have the same names. Known medicines include:&lt;ref name=Osb&gt;Osbaldeston 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Statues and healing shrines were sites of prayer and sacrifice for both the poor and the elite, and were common throughout the Roman Empire. Reverence for shrines and statues reflected a search for healing, guidance, and alternatives to ineffectual human physicians and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Conrad|first1 = Lawrence I.|title = The Western medical tradition, 800 BC to AD 1800|isbn = 0521475643|pages = 47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Italian scientists studied the content of a Roman shipping vessel, known as the ''Relitto del Pozzino'', sank off the coast of [[Populonia]], [[Tuscany]] around 120 BC, which was excavated during the 1980s and 90s. The vessel had a medicine chest with [[pyxides]] inside, which contained medicinal tablets or pills full of a number of zinc compounds, as well as iron oxide, starch, beeswax, pine resin and other plant-derived materials, all probably served as some sort of eye medicine or eyewash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/whats-inside-a-2000-year-old-shipwreck-preserved-roman-pill-403649/?utm_campaign=20130107&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_content=surprisingscienceromanpill3|title=What’s Inside a 2,000-Year-Old, Shipwreck-Preserved Roman Pill?|work=Smithsonianmag.com|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/scientists-learn-ingredients-2000-year-old-roman-pills-found-ancient-021485|title=Scientists Learn Ingredients of 2,000-Year-Old Roman Pills Found in Ancient Shipwreck|work=Ancient Origins|date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==
===Healing sanctuaries===

A physician's overall goal was to help those afflicted by disease or injury as best as they could; the physician's credibility rested on their successful cures. Of course they could not reliably cure ailments; sometimes the best they could hope for was that their treatments did not worsen their patients' problems. Many physicians were criticised by their peers for their inability to cure an apparently simple illness. Gaps in physician-provided care were filled with several types of supernatural healthcare; the Romans believed in the power of divine messages and healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=24444508|title=On the Understanding of Medicine Among the Romans|last=Scarborough|first=John|date=1997-02-01|publisher=The Historian|pages=459–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been descriptions of many gods from multiple religions that dealt with destruction or healing.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scattered across Greco-Roman and Egyptian history are descriptions of healing sanctuaries dedicated to the various healing gods. Sick or injured Romans would often flock to temples dedicated to [[Asclepius]], the god of healing, as it was believed that the god actually inhabited the sanctuary and would provide divine healing to supplicants. The process itself was simple: the sick person would give a specified donation to the temple, and then undergo a process called "incubation" in which they would relocate to a special room where the god would be able to contact them, often through dreams in which the god would either prescribe care or provide it themselves. Often the type of cure prescribed would be rather similar to the actual medical practices of physicians of the time. This type of supernatural care did not conflict with mainstream healthcare. Physicians would often recommend that patients go to a healing sanctuary when they were afflicted by an illness that the physician could not cure. This allowed the reputation of the physician to remain unharmed, as it was seen more as a referral than as a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interpreting Dreams for Corrective Regimen|jstor = 24623949|publisher = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|date = 2001-10-01|first = Andrew|last = Holowchak|pages = 382–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colostrum===

Both Greek and Roman medical texts prescribe the use of a variety of substances, of varying medical and religious significance. Several substances, such as [[sulfur]], [[asphalt]] and animal excrement, were associated with the practice of human purification. The practice of using a woman's breast milk as a medicine has very early roots in Egyptian medical texts. In several such texts there are references to the use of the milk of a woman who has given birth to a male child. This practice is said to be based on depictions in several statues of the goddess [[Isis]] breastfeeding her son, the god [[Horus]]. Both Egyptian and Greek texts state that the milk used for medicinal purposes should be strictly from a woman who has borne a male child. The treatments using breast milk differed vastly between Greek and Roman culture. In Greek medicine, milk was very rarely actually consumed. Instead, it was used in recipes for ointments and washes that would treat burns and other skin-related maladies. These treatments were exclusively given to women, as women's bodies were viewed as "polluted" in some sense. In stark contrast, the Roman use of colostrum was more widespread and varied. The milk was instead ingested by the patient, and the treatment was given to both men and women. In general, the Romans seemed less concerned about the so-called "pollution" of a woman's body. The bodies of both men and women were viewed as analogous.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nursing Mothers in Greek and Roman Medicine|publisher = American Journal of Archaeology|date = 2008|first = Julie|last = Laskaris|pages = 459–464 | jstor=20627484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown in modern times that having patients ingest mother's milk (or [[colostrum]]) is actually a rather effective treatment. Colostrum has been shown to prevent the growth of ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' bacteria, which are a known cause of several types of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Antibacterial Properties of Breast Milk|pmid = 1802694|publisher = US Library of medicine|date = 1991 |first = Avery|last = VM|pages = 1034–1039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colostrum is about half as effective as some antibiotics prescribed to patients today. Colostrum is also effective against the bacterium [[chlamydia]]; this is the cause of a sexually transmitted disease and also can cause severe sight impairment, if not blindness. Thus, colostrum was a rather effective treatment in the ancient world – perhaps that is why it was viewed as a divine treatment.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Diagnostic methods==

===Dreams===

The interpretation of dreams was another avenue for treatment of illnesses by physicians. Often the interpretations of a patient's dreams would actually determine what treatment they received. A Hippocratic work called ''[[Regimen]]'' details much of the principles outlined by [[Galen]]: specifically the humors and examples of how they could be used to prescribe treatment. The theme of this method is knowing the patient. To know how to treat a person, the physician must become familiar with and interpret the important aspects of their lives: the climate, their food intake, how much they sleep, how much they drink, any injuries. They would then draw conclusions about the patient and what must be done to set them back to equilibrium. The fourth book of the ''Regimen'' is the earliest mention of the topic of dream medicine. Dreams were used by physicians in diagnosis. They added another layer of depth to the physician's investigation of the patient. The soul was thought to serve the purpose that the brain has been discovered to serve. Sensation, pain, motion and other physiological concepts were thought to be the work of the soul. It was also thought that the soul continues the work of bodily upkeep even when a person is sleeping. Thus, dreams would show what ailed a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interpreting Dreams for Corrective Regimen|publisher = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|date = 2001-10-01|first = Andrew|last = Holowchak|pages = 382–399| jstor=24623949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two types of dreams associated with medicine: prophetic and diagnostic. [[Prophetic dream]]s were divine in origin and foretold good or bad tidings for the future. Diagnostic dreams were a result of the soul telling what afflicted the body. If the dreams were of normal everyday events, their body was healthy and in equilibrium. The farther from the norm, and the more chaotic the dreams were, the more ill the patient was. The treatments that were recommended addressed what the dreams showed, and attempted to set the body right through consumption of food that carried the correct humor characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Greek and Roman Medicine|publisher = Archaeology|date = 1981-04-01|first = Lawrence|last = Bliquez|pages = 10–17 | jstor=41727119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual transmission==

[[File:Galen1.jpg|thumbnail|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Overview|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/shp/ancient/romanknowledgerev1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen, a prominent ancient Roman physician of Greek descent]]

Galenic medical texts embody the written medical tradition of classical antiquity. Little written word has survived from before that era. The volume of Galen's extant written works, however, is nearly 350 – far surpassing any other writer of the period.&lt;ref&gt;King, Helen (2002). ''Greek and Roman medicine''. London: Bristol Classical. p. 38. {{ISBN|978-1-85399-545-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Galen, much of medical knowledge survived through word of mouth. The tradition of transmission and translation originated with the ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', an encyclopedia written by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] between 50 AD and 70 AD. Dioscorides was a Roman physician of Greek descent. The manuscripts classified and illustrated over 1000 substances and their uses.&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, George; Komaroff, Linda (2005). "Illustrated Books May Be Hazardous to Your Health: A New Reading of the Arabic Reception and Rendition of the" Materia Medica" of Dioscorides". ''Ars Orientalis'' '''35''': 8&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' influenced medical knowledge for centuries, due to its dissemination and translation into Greek, Arabic, and Latin. Galen wrote in Greek, but Arabic and Syriac translations survived as well. He referenced and challenged written works by [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] physicians and authors, which gave insight into other popular medical philosophies. [[Herophilos|Herophilus]], known for his texts on anatomy through dissection, and [[Erasistratus]], also known for anatomy and physiology, survive through Galenic reference.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Nutton, Vivian (2009). ''The Western medical tradition: 800 BC to AD 1800''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

''Ancient medicine''. London: Routledge. p. 201.{{ISBN|978-0-415-36848-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His synthesis of earlier medical philosophies and broad range of subjects produced the textual legacy that Galen left for the medical community for the next 1500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Ralph (1988).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was one of the most outstanding [[historian]]s of [[Polish Jews|Polish]] and [[Galician Jews]], and the founder of Polish Jewish [[historiography]].

==Early years==

Balaban was born in 1877 in the city of [[Lviv]] (then known as Lemberg in Austria-Hungary's centre of Polish Galicia). He received a traditional education at home and traditional Jewish schooling ([[Hebrew language]] and [[Old Testament|Bible]] study) in a ''[[cheder]]''.

==Biography and initial studies on Jewish history==

He studied law, philosophy and history at [[Lviv University]]. He accidentally encountered materials on the history of Jews in [[Kraków]], and on the request of the Kraków Jewish [[Kehilla (modern)|kahal]], he wrote the first volume of "The History of Jews in Cracow and Kazimiria 1304-1655" (Kraków, 1912). It gave him some reputation in Lviv University. Balaban then won a high ministry scholarship, and departed for a long scientific trip to [[Poznań]], [[Berlin]] and [[Gdańsk]]. He stayed for several months in Kraków collecting materials for the second volume of the history of Kraków Jews. Simultaneously he started the publication "The history of Jewish system in Poland" in "Evreiskaia Starina" ("Jewish Old Times", as translated from Russian) magazine. He taught in different schools in the Lviv region and Lviv combining studying with teaching and research. He spent the first year of  [[World War I]] in [[Vienna]] teaching at the gymnasium for Galician refugees. The next three years, he spent in [[Lublin]] as a referent (reporter) on Jewish matters by the Austrian General Government. At these posts, he organised many Jewish kahals and gymnasiums. Together with Dr. [[Ozjasz Thon]] and Dr. [[Moses Schorr]], Balaban was one of the founders of the [[Institute of Jewish Sciences]] in Warsaw. Here Balaban taught Jewish history and led the historical seminar which issued many works on the history of Jews in Poland and in particular in the Polish kingdom. Balaban had also published "The history of Jews in Galicia" in 1916. Since 1903 Balaban led the review of the  bibliography of  the history of Jews in Poland in the Polish historical magazine "Kwartalnik historyczny" ("History Quarterly"). During nine years Balaban had been administering the [[Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary]] (1920–1929)  and for 1920-1921 he had been also the rector of the gymnasium "Askola". The fate of Balaban was also tragic like Schorr's one. He died in the [[Warsaw ghetto]] on 26 December 1942.

==Works on the history of Polish Jews==
[[Image:MeirBalabanSt.jpg|thumb|Meir Balaban commemorated in a street's name in [[Holon]], [[Israel]]]]

He was the first outstanding historian of Polish Jewry and he is fairly considered as the founder of  the historiography of Polish Jews. Among his works the most important ones are:

* Jews of Lvov (Lemberg) on the eve of 17th century (1916);
* History of Jews of Cracow (2 vols, 1931)
* Jewry of [[Lublin]] (1919).

He wrote also a detailed article about the Vaad of four lands for the 11th volume of "History of Jewish people". He published hundreds of articles which are devoted to the researches of rabbis', scholars', community leaders' activities as well as the history of bloody pogroms, about the Karaims in Poland and other topics. All they were published mostly in German, Polish or in Yiddish. Balaban's researches written in Hebrew on the history of movements of Shabatai Zwi and Jakob Frank are especially important to note. They are resumed in his book "Le toldot ha-tnua ha-frankit" (The history of the Frank movement, 2 vols., 1934–1935). It was published in Tel Aviv. Balaban had written also "The history of the progressive synagogue in Lvov" (in polish original "Historia postępowej synagogi we Lwowie") as well as "The Bibliography of the history of Jews in Poland during 1900-1930" which encompasses more than 10.000 entries.

Since 1906 he published many scientific articles in the newspaper "Kurjer Lwowski". The first more essential  essays appeared in the almanac  "Rocznik Żydowske" in 1902-1906:

* "Izak Nachmanovicz, Żyd Lwowski XVI wieku" ([[Izak Nachmanowicz]] - a Polish Jew of the 16th Century);
* "Josefus Flavius, Charakterystyka czlowieka i historyka na tle wspolczesnych wypadkow" ([[Josephus Flavius]]. A Characterization of a Person and  a Historian on the Background of the Contemporary Events, 1904);
* "Makabeusze" ([[Maccabees]], 1905);
* "Lewko Balaban, burmistrz kahalny Lwowski z konca XVIII wieku" (Lewko Balaban (Leo Balaban), the Kahal Burgmeister of [[Lviv]] of the End of the 17th Century).

Some of these articles became the preparation for the mentioned already Balaban's work entitled "Żydzi Lwowscy na przelomie XVI i XVII wieku" (Jews of Lvov in the break of  the 16th and 17th centuries, 1906, 577 pages of the text and 188 pages of the materials). Balaban was awarded the first premium of [[Ipolit Wawelberg]] for this work. The work consists of 3 parts. In the first part Balaban depicts the live history of the external events of the community, discussing in details the clamorous deal of Lviv Jews with [[Jesuits]] and the eager leaders of the community of the Nachman family; the second part is devoted to the detailed contemplation over the community self-administration and the Rabbinate and the last part consists of  a few essays about the trade, crafts, family life, and like that. Balaban used rich archival data of the Archive of Bernardines in Lviv as well as of the Lviv City Archive and the Archive of Jewish Community in Lviv.

==Memory==

One of the streets in the downtown of [[Lviv]], Ukraine is named after him (Majer Balaban Street, Lviv). There are also streets named after him in Israel, in [[Holon]] for example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2560">'''Menander Protector''' ('''Menander the Guardsman''', '''Menander the Byzantian'''; {{lang-el|Μένανδρος Προτήκτωρ}} or Προτέκτωρ), [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[historian]], was born in [[Constantinople]] in the middle of the 6th century AD. The little that is known of his life is contained in the account of himself quoted in the ''[[Suda]]'' (Mu,591: Μένανδρος). Menander mentions his father Euphratas, who came from Byzantium, and his brother Herodotus. He at first took up the study of law, but abandoned it for a life of pleasure. When his fortunes were low, the patronage accorded to literature by the Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], at whose court he was a military officer (hence the epithet ''Protector'', which denotes his military function), encouraged him to try writing history.

Menander took as his model [[Agathias]] who like him had been a jurist, and his history begins at the point where Agathias leaves off. It embraces the period from the arrival of the [[Kutrigurs]] in [[Thrace]] during the reign of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in 558 down to the death of the emperor [[Tiberius II Constantine|Tiberius]] in 582. Considerable fragments of the work are preserved in the ''Excerpts'' of [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] and in the ''Suda''. Although the style is sometimes bombastic, he is considered trustworthy and is one of the most valuable authorities for the history of the 6th century, especially on geographical and ethnographical matters. Menander was an eye-witness of some of the events he describes. Like Agathias, he wrote epigrams, one of which, on a Persian [[magus]] who became a convert to [[Christianity]] and died the death of a martyr, is preserved in the ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' (i.101).

Fragments of his work can be found in:
* [[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Müller|C. W. Müller]], ''Fragmenta historicorum Graecorum'', 4, 200
* [[Jacques Paul Migne|J. P. Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', 113
* [[L. Dindorf]], ''Historici Graeci minores'', 2

{{Psychology sidebar|applied}}
'''Military psychology''' is the research, design and application of [[psychology | psychological theories]] and [[empirical data]] towards understanding, predicting, and countering [[behaviour]]s either in friendly or enemy forces or the [[civilian population]] that may be undesirable, threatening or potentially dangerous to the conduct of [[military operation]]s. Military psychology transforms from sub-branch groups of different psychology disciplines into a tool used by the military, as will all tools of the military, to enable the troops to better survive the stresses of war while using psychological principles to unbalance the enemy forces for easier wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hdl.handle.net/10945/30286 |title=What is military psychology? |work=Proceedings for a symposium held on 3 September 1979 at the 87th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association |location= New York City | publisher=Hdl.handle.net | date=1979-09-03 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All stresses and psychological illnesses that military psychology looks at are not specific only to the military. However, soldiers tend to face a specific combination of these otherwise generic stresses. Military psychology then specializes in looking at this unique combination of stresses that plagues the military and war settings. These stresses include [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), guilt, family difficulties with the veteran's spouse, [[nightmare]]s and flashbacks, and many more. Military psychology is applied towards [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselling]] and treatment of stress and fatigue of military personnel or military families as well as treatment of [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Painful Stories Take a Toll on Military Therapists |author=Benedict Carey |author2=Damien Cave |author3=Lizette Alvarez |author4=Erica Goode |author5=Gretel C. Kovach |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/us/08stress.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=7 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Mark |year=2010 |title=Invisible Wounds: Mental Health and the Military |journal=Time |publisher= Time Magazine |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2008886,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Role==

The [[military]] is a group of individuals who are usually trained and equipped to perform [[national security]] tasks in unique and often chaotic and trauma-filled situations. These situations can include the front-lines of [[battle]], [[State of emergency|national emergencies]], allied assistance, or the disaster response scenarios where they are providing relief-aid for the host populations of both friendly and enemy states. Though many [[Psychologist|psychologists]] may have a general understanding with regards to a humans response to traumatic situations, military psychologists are uniquely trained and experienced specialists in [[Clinical psychology|applied science and practice]] among this special population. While the soldiers may be providing direct aid to the victims of events, military psychologists are providing specialized aid to both soldiers, their families, and the victims of military operations as they cope with the often "normal" response or reaction to uncommon and abnormal circumstances.

In addition to the specialized roles previously mentioned, military psychologists often study the dynamics, train people in, and consult on hostage negotiations. In some cases the psychologists might not be the one directly handling the [[Hostage|hostage situation]], but hostage negotiators find value in resolving the hostage crisis using many of the scientific principles that are derived from the science of psychology. In addition, many of the principles of the scientific discipline of clinical psychology have their roots in the work of the early military psychologists of [[World War II]].

Another common practice domain for military psychologists is in performing fitness for duty evaluations, especially in high risk and high reliability occupations. The set of unique challenges often faced by those in the military and the professions of arms such as: police, strategic security, and protective services personnel, the ability to perform reliable and accurate fitness for duty evaluations adds value and maximizes the [[human capital]] investment in the workplace by optimizing retention of the talents of active and prospective service men and women while minimizing risk in many areas including violence, mishap, and injury potential. The types of fitness evaluations include both basic entry examinations and career progression examinations such as those conducted when individuals are seeking promotion, higher-classification clearance status, and specialized, hazardous, and mission critical working conditions. When operational commanders become concerned about the impact of continuous, critical, and traumatic operations on those in their command, they often consult with a military psychologist. Military psychologists can assess, diagnose, treat and recommend the duty status most suitable for the optimal well-being of the individual, group, and organization. Events that affect the mental state, resilience or psychological assets and vulnerabilities of the warrior and the command are where military psychologists are most equipped to meet the unique challenges and provide expert care and consultation to preserve the behavioural health of the fighting force.&lt;ref name=zill&gt;{{cite book |title=Military Psychology: Clinical and Operational Applications|year=2006|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-57230-724-7 |pages=35–60|url=http://www.igetdoc.com/ddata/84.pdf#page=52|author1=Frank C. Budd|edition=1|author2=Sally Harvey |editor1=Carrie H. Kennedy |editor2=Eric A. Zillmer |chapter=Military Fitness-for-Duty Evaluations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fitness evaluations might lead to command directed administrative actions or provide the information necessary to make decisions by a medical board or other tribunal and must be thoroughly conducted by non-biased individuals with the experience and training necessary to render a professional opinion that is critical to key decision makers. Military psychologists must be well versed in the art and science of psychology as specialized applied practice professionals. They must also be highly competent generalists in the military profession, and be able to understand both professions well enough to examine human behavior in the context of military operations. It takes the psychologist several years beyond the doctorate to develop the expertise necessary to understand how to integrate psychology with the complex needs of the military.

Another very select and infrequent use of military psychology is in the interview of subjects, the [[interrogation]] of prisoners, and the vetting of those who may provide information of operational or intelligence value that would enhance outcomes of friendly military operations or reduce friendly and enemy casualties. Psychology's scientific  principles applied here allow the interviewer, agent, or interrogator to get as much information as possible through non-invasive means without the need to resort to active measures or risk violating the rules of engagement, host nation agreements, international and military law or crossing the threshold of the [[Geneva Conventions]]' guidelines to which the United States and its allies subscribe, regardless of the status of many of the modern belligerent countries on the [[international law]]s and United Nations agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/ella/notinmyname/chapter5.htm | title=Not in MY name| publisher=Groups.csail.mit.edu |date= | accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area of study==
{{underlinked|section|date=March 2017}}
The goals and missions of current military psychologists have been retained over the years, varying with the focus and strength of intensity of research put forth into each sector. The need for mental health care is now an expected part of high-stress military environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Military Psychology: Clinical and Operational Applications| year=2006| publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-57230-724-7 |url=http://www.igetdoc.com/ddata/84.pdf| editor=Carrie H. Kennedy and Eric A. Zillmer|chapter=Military Fitness-for-Duty Evaluations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance and severity of [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) has gained more credibility than those suffering from it received in the past, and is being highlighted in treatment programs. More extensive post-deployment screenings take place now to home in on problematic recoveries that used to be passed unnoticed and untreated.

=== Terrorism ===
[[Terrorism]] and [[Counter-terrorism|counterterrorism]], information management, and [[psychological warfare]] are value-added roles for the applied aspects of military psychology that are developing. For instance, contrary to the common myths and stereotypes about modern terrorists, that tend portray them as mentally disturbed individuals; most terrorists are far from that typology according to studies conducted by behavioural and [[social scientists]] who have either directly interviewed and observed terrorists or conducted meta-analytic studies of terrorism and terrorists. 

Terrorists have tended to be from among the more well educated in their host countries. They often have developed a well thought out, but not very often publicized or well articulated, rigid ideology that provides the foundation for their strategy and tactics. Psychologically disturbed terrorists increase the risk of damage to the terror organization's strategic outcomes. As in any organization, mentally disturbed terrorists are a liability and the leaders of terrorist groups are well aware of the risks that these types of persons present. As any good organizational leader, the effective terrorist will try to recruit the best person for the job. It is doubtful that modern terrorist groups would adopt the affirmative action and other hiring practices dictated under employment laws in the United States or other Western countries. 

It is important to understand when and how the label of terrorism is applied because of its psychological impact as suggested above. The causes, [[goal]]s, [[methodology]], and [[strategy]] of the terrorist mindset is well suited for psychological inquiry and the development of the strategy and tactics used to confront it. Terrorism is an ideology that uses behavioral, emotional, and group dynamics, along with social and psychological principles to influence populations for political purposes. It is a form of psychological warfare. The terrorists are experts in the use of fear, violence, threats of violence and trauma in order to advance the political agenda. Terrorists seek psychological control and use violent behavior to cause the population to behave in ways that disrupt and destroy the existing political processes and symbols of political power. They control people by using deep primal emotions to elicit a reaction and shape behavior. 

The goal of a terrorist is to use violence to create the natural fear of death and dismemberment and use it to change or shape political behavior, control thought and modify speech. Military and operational psychologists are highly trained and experienced. They are experts equipped with the specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities in the art and science of the military and psychology professions that give them a great deal of potential in this unique operational environment.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://kucampus.kaplan.edu/documentstore/docs09/pdf/picj/vol2/issue1/Psychological_Warfare_and_Terrorism.pdf Psychological Warfare and Terrorism]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational psychology===

Operational psychology is a specialty within the field of psychology that applies behavioral science principles through the use of consultation to enable key decision makers to more effectively understand, develop, target, and influence an individual, group or organization to accomplish tactical, operational, or strategic objectives within the domain of national security or national defense. This is a relatively new sub-discipline that has been employed largely by psychologists and behavioral scientists in military, intelligence, and law enforcement arenas (although other areas of public safety employ psychologists in this capacity as well). While psychology has been utilized in non-health related fields for many decades, recent years have seen an increased focus on its national security applications. Examples of such applications include the development of counterinsurgency strategy through human profiling, interrogation and detention support, information-psychological operations, and the selection of personnel for specialized military or other public safety activities.&lt;ref name=staal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staal|first1=Mark A.|author2=James A. Stephenson|title=Operational Psychology: An Emerging Subdiscipline|journal=Military Psychology|year=2006|volume=18|issue=4|pages=269–282|doi=10.1207/s15327876mp1804_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staal, M.A. &amp; Stephenson, J.A. (2013). Operational Psychology Post-9/11: A Decade of Evolution. Military Psychology, 25(2), 93-104. DOI: 10.1037/h0094951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, C. H., &amp; Williams, T. J. (2010). Operational psychology ethics: Addressing evolving dilemmas. In C. Kennedy and T. Williams (Eds.), The ethics of operational psychology. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, operational psychology has been under increased scrutiny due to allegations of unethical conduct by some practitioners supporting military and law enforcement interrogations. As a result, a small group of psychologists have raised concerns about the ethics of such practice.&lt;ref&gt;Arrigo, J. M., Eidelson, R. J., &amp; Bennett, R. (2012). Psychology under fire: Adversarial operational psychology and psychological ethics. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 18, 384–400.
&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of operational psychology have responded by providing an ethical defense of such activity. They argue that the American Psychological Association's ethical code is sufficient to support operational psychologists in a number of activities (to include legal interrogation by the military and other law enforcement agencies).&lt;ref&gt;Staal, M. A., &amp; Greene, C. (2015). An Examination of “Adversarial” Operational Psychology. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 21, 264–268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staal, M. A., &amp; Greene, C. (2015). Operational psychology: An ethical practice–A reply to Arrigo, Eidelson, and Rockwood (2015). Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 21, 279–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tactical psychology===

Tactical psychology is "a sharp focus on what soldiers do once they are in contact with the enemy...on what a front-line soldier can do to win a battle". It combines psychology and historical analysis (the application of statistics to military historical data) to find out how tactics make the enemy freeze, flee or fuss, instead of fight. Tactical psychology examines how techniques like [[suppressive fire]], combined arms or flanking reduce the enemy's will to fight.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, L., ''Brains and Bullets: How Psychology Wins War'' (London: Biteback, 2013) {{ISBN|978-1849545167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health, organizational, and occupational psychology===

Military psychologists perform work in a variety of areas, to include operating mental health and family counseling clinics, performing research to help select recruits for the armed forces, determining which recruits will be best suited for various military occupational specialties, and performing analysis on humanitarian and peacekeeping missions to determine procedures that could save military and civilian lives. Some military psychologists also work to improve the lives of service personnel and their families. Other military psychologists work with large social policy programs within the military that are designed to increase diversity and equal opportunity.&lt;ref name=division&gt;"[http://www.apadivisions.org/division-19/about/index.aspx Division 19 – Society for Military Psychology]", (2009). ''About Military Psychology''. Retrieved 24 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern programs employ the skills and knowledge of military psychologists to address issues such as integrating diverse ethnic and racial groups into the military and reducing sexual assault and discrimination. Others assist in the employment of women in combat positions and other positions traditionally held by men. Some military psychologists help to utilize low-capability recruits and rehabilitate drug-addicted and wounded service members. They are in charge of drug testing and psychological treatment for lifestyle problems, such as alcohol and substance abuse. In modern times, the advisement of military psychologists are being heard and taken more seriously into consideration for national policy than ever before. There are now more psychologists employed by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] than by any other organization in the world. Since the downsizing of the military in the 1990s, however, there has been a considerable reduction in psychological research and support in the armed forces as well.&lt;ref name=division/&gt;

=== Feminism ===
[[Feminism (international relations)|Women in military roles]] is an area of study receiving an increasing amount of attention. Currently women make up 10%-15% of the armed forces. As women tended to move to away from nursing and helping roles, increasing attention is given to how the brutal realities of [[combat]] would affect the women psychologically. Interesting research shows that, when affected, women tend to ask for help, more so than men, thus avoiding many of the long-term [[mental suffering]] that male soldiers face after their deployment has ended.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/advancesinsocialwork/article/download/1878/1961&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Psychological stress and disorders have always been a part of military life, especially during and after wartime, but the mental health section of military psychology has not always experienced the awareness it does now. Even in the present day there is much more research and awareness needed concerning this area.

One of the first institutions created to care for military psychiatric patients was [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Formerly known as the United States Government Hospital for the Insane, the hospital was founded by the [[United States Congress]] in 1855 and is currently in a state of disrepair although operational, with revitalization plans scheduled to begin in 2010.&lt;ref name=Michels&gt;Michels, K. (2004)." [http://www.historyofmilitarypsychology.com/index.html Intelligence Testing in the United States Military] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130125091745/http://www.historyofmilitarypsychology.com/index.html |date=25 January 2013 }}". Retrieved 29 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]. (2006). "[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medtour/elizabeths.html Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital]". Retrieved 1 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early work===

In 1890 [[James McKeen Cattell]] coined the term “mental tests”. Cattell studied under Wundt at [[Leipzig]] in Germany at one point during his life and strongly advocated for psychology to be viewed as a science on par with the physical and life sciences.&lt;ref name=Plucker&gt;Plucker, J. A. (Ed.). (2003). ''Human intelligence: Historical influences, current controversies, teaching resources''. Retrieved 19 November 2009, from http://www.indiana.edu/~intell&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted the need for standardization of procedures, use of norms, and advocated the use of statistical analysis to study individual differences. He was unwavering in his opposition to America’s involvement in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name=Michels/&gt;

[[Lightner Witmer]], who also spent some time working under Wundt, changed the scene for psychology forever from his position at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] when he coined the term “[[clinical psychology]]” and outlined a program of training and study.&lt;ref&gt;Grassetti, S. (2007). [http://www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Witmer__Lightner.html ''Lightner Witmer'']. Retrieved 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This model for clinical psychology is still followed in modern times. Eleven years later in 1907 Witmer founded the journal ''The Psychological Clinic''.

Also in 1907, a routine psychological screening plan for hospitalized psychiatric patients was developed by Shepard Ivory Franz, civilian research psychologist at St.&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth’s Hospital. Two years later, under the leadership of [[William Alanson White]], St.&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth’s Hospital became known for research and training of psychiatrists and military medical officers. In 1911 Hebert Butts, a navy medical officer stationed at St.&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth's, published the first protocol for psychological screening of navy recruits based on Franz's work.&lt;ref name=Michels/&gt;

===Intelligence testing in the U.S. military===

[[Lewis M. Terman]], a professor at [[Stanford University]], revised the Binet-Simon Scale in 1916, renaming it the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford-Binet Revision]].&lt;ref name=Plucker/&gt; This test was the beginning of the “Intelligence Testing Movement” and was administered to over 170,000 soldiers in the [[United States Army]] during World War&amp;nbsp;I. Yerkes published the results of these tests in 1921 in a document that became known as the Army Report.&lt;ref name=Michels/&gt;

There were two tests that initially made up the intelligence tests for the military: [[Army Alpha]] and [[Army Beta]] tests. They were developed to evaluate vast numbers of military recruits that were both literate (Army Alpha tests) and illiterate (Army Beta tests). The Army Beta test were designed to “measure native intellectual capacity”. The Army Beta test also helped to test non-English speaking service members.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;"[http://officialasvab.com/history_coun.htm History of Military Testing]", [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery|ASVAB]]. Retrieved 21 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standardized intelligence and entrance tests that have been used for each military branch in the United States has transformed over the years. Finally, in 1974, “the Department of Defense decided that all Services should use [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]] (ASVAB) for both screening enlistees and assigning them to military occupations. Combining selection and classification testing made the testing process more efficient. It also enabled the Services to improve the matching of applicants with available job positions and allowed job guarantees for those qualified”. This went fully into effect in 1976.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

===Yerkes and war===

[[Robert M. Yerkes]], while he was president of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in 1917, worked with [[Edward B. Titchener]] and a group of psychologists that were known as the “Experimentalists”. Their work resulted in formulating a plan for APA members to offer their professional services to the World War&amp;nbsp;I effort, even though Yerkes was known for being opposed to America being involved in the war at all. It was decided that psychologists could provide support in developing methods for selection of recruits and treatment of war victims.&lt;ref name=Michels/&gt; This was spurred, in part, by America’s growing interest in the work of [[Alfred Binet]] in [[France]] on mental measurement, as well as the scientific management movement to enhance worker productivity.&lt;ref name=division/&gt;

In 1919, Yerkes was commissioned as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Service Corps. In a plan proposed to the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], Yerkes wrote: "The Council of the [[American Psychological Association]] is convinced that in the present emergency American psychology can substantially serve the Government, under the medical corps of the Army and Navy, by examining recruits with respect to intellectual deficiency, [[psychopath]]ic tendencies, nervous instability, and inadequate self-control". Also in 1919, the Army Division of Psychology in the Medical Department was established at the medical training camp at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia]] to train personnel to provide mental testing of large groups.&lt;ref name=Michels/&gt;

This was also the era when the condition referred to as “[[shell shock]]” was first seriously studied by psychologists and standardized screening tests for pilots were administered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Xiao, H. (2007). "[http://www.cwu.edu/~relation/pr-jan23-07.html CWU Lecture to Outline History of Military Psychology]", News and Headlines. Retrieved 24 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

[[World War II]] ushered in an era of substantial growth for the psychological field, centering around four major areas: testing for individual abilities, applied social psychology, instruction and training, and clinical psychology.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; During World War&amp;nbsp;II, the [[Army General Classification Test]] (AGCT) and the Navy General Classification Test (NGCT) were used in place of the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests for similar purposes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

The [[United States Army]] had no unified program for the use of clinical psychologists until 1944, towards the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II. Before this time, no clinical psychologists were serving in Army hospitals under the supervision of psychiatrists. This had to do with psychologists’ opposition to this type of service and also to the limited role the Army assigned to psychiatry. At this time, the only psychiatric interview that was being processed on the ever-increasing numbers of military recruits lasted only three minutes and could only manage to weed out the severely disturbed recruits. Under these conditions, it was impossible to determine which seemingly normal recruits would crack under the strain of military duties, and the need for clinical psychologists grew. By 1945 there were over 450 clinical psychologists serving in the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=Michels/&gt;

Military psychology matured well past the areas aforementioned that concerned psychologists up until this time, branching off into sectors that included military leadership, the effects of environmental factors on human performance, military intelligence, psychological operations and warfare (such as Special Forces like [[Psychological Operations (United States)|PSYOP]]), selection for special duties, and the influences of personal background, attitudes, and the work group on soldier [[motivation]] and morals.&lt;ref name=division/&gt;

===Korean War===

Korean War was the first war in which clinical psychologists served overseas, positioned in hospitals as well as combat zones. Their particular roles were vague, broad, and fairly undefined, except for the [[U.S. Air Force]], which provided detailed job descriptions. The Air Force also outlined the standardized tests and procedures for evaluating recruits that were to be used.&lt;ref name=Michels/&gt;

===Vietnam War===

In the [[Vietnam War]], there were significant challenges that obstructed the regular use of psychologists to support combat troops. The mental health teams were very small, usually only consisting of one psychiatrist, one psychologist, and three or four enlisted corpsmen. Quite often, medical officers, including psychologists, were working in severe conditions with little or no field experience.&lt;ref name=Michels/&gt; Despite these challenges, military psychiatry had improved compared to previous wars, which focused on maximizing function and minimizing disability by preventive and therapeutic measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United States Veterans Administration and Department of Medicine and Surgery|title=The Vietnam Veteran in contemporary society; collected materials pertaining to the young veterans|year=1972|publisher=Department of Medicine and Surgery|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=III-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global War on Terror===

A 2014 study of soldiers who had mental health problems after [[Overseas Contingency Operation]] service found that a majority of them had symptoms before they enlisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/03/04/study-nearly-1-in-5-us-army-soldiers-had-mental-illness-before-enlistment/ |title=Study: Nearly 1-In-5 US Army Soldiers Had Mental Illness Before Enlistment |date=4 March 2014 |website=cbslocal.com |publisher=CBS DC |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nuclear weapons}}

'''Nuclear strategy''' involves the development of [[military doctrine|doctrine]]s and [[strategy|strategies]] for the production and use of [[nuclear weapon]]s.

As a sub-branch of [[military strategy]], nuclear strategy attempts to match nuclear weapons as means to political ends. In addition to the actual use of nuclear weapons whether [[tactical nuclear weapon|in the battlefield]] or [[strategic nuclear weapon|strategically]], a large part of nuclear strategy involves their use as a bargaining tool.

Some of the issues considered within nuclear strategy include:

*Under what conditions does it serve a nation's interest to develop nuclear weapons?
*What types of nuclear weapons should be developed?
*When and how should such weapons be used?

Many strategists argue that nuclear strategy differs from other forms of [[military strategy]]. The immense and terrifying power of the weapons makes their use, in seeking victory in a traditional military sense, impossible.

Perhaps counterintuitively, an important focus of nuclear strategy has been determining how to prevent and deter their use, a crucial part of [[mutual assured destruction]].

In the context of [[nuclear proliferation]] and maintaining the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]], states also seek to prevent other states from acquiring nuclear weapons as part of nuclear strategy.

==Nuclear deterrent composition==
The doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD) assumes that a nuclear deterrent force must be credible and survivable. That is, each deterrent force must survive a [[first strike]] with sufficient capability to effectively destroy the other country in a [[second strike]]. Therefore, a first strike would be suicidal for the launching country.

In the late 1940s and 1950s as the [[Cold War]] developed, the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] pursued multiple delivery methods and platforms to deliver nuclear weapons. Three types of platforms proved most successful and are collectively called a "[[nuclear triad]]". These are air-delivered weapons (bombs or missiles), [[ballistic missile submarines]] (usually nuclear-powered and called SSBNs), and [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs), usually deployed in land-based hardened [[missile silo]]s or on vehicles.

Although not considered part of the deterrent forces, all of the nuclear powers deployed large numbers of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s in the Cold War. These could be delivered by virtually all platforms capable of delivering large conventional weapons.

{{Anchor|deter2016-01-29}}During the 1970s there was growing concern that the combined conventional forces of the [[Warsaw Pact|Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact]] could overwhelm the forces of [[NATO]].  It seemed unthinkable to respond to a Soviet/Warsaw Pact incursion into Western Europe with [[strategic nuclear weapon]]s, inviting a catastrophic exchange.  Thus, technologies were developed to greatly reduce collateral damage while being effective against advancing conventional military forces.  Some of these were [[Neutron bomb|low-yield neutron bombs]], which were lethal to tank crews, especially with tanks massed in tight formation, while producing relatively little blast, thermal radiation, or radioactive fallout.  Other technologies were so-called "suppressed radiation devices," which produced mostly blast with little radioactivity, making them much like conventional explosives, but with much more energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J.

The OSL age is the cooling age of the quartz and/or feldspar.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This cooling history is a record of the mineral's thermal history, which is used to reconstruct the geological event.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Georgina E.|last2=Herman|first2=Frédéric|last3=Guralnik|first3=Benny|date=2016b|title=Northward migration of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis revealed by OSL thermochronometry|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6301/800|journal=Science|language=en|volume=353|issue=6301|pages=800–804|doi=10.1126/science.aaf2637|issn=0036-8075|pmid=27540169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sub-[[Quaternary]] period ( 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years) is the geological age where OSL is a favourable dating technique&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; because of low [[closure temperature]] of quartz and feldspar used in this technique. The Quaternary period marked by intense crustal erosion at mountain ranges, including high exhumation rate of [[crust (geology)|crust]]al rocks&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; and formation of sub-[[Quaternary|Quaternary sediments]]. Previous techniques (e.g. Apatite [[Fission track dating|Fission Track,]] Zircon [[Fission track dating|Fission Track,]] and (Uranium-Thorium)/ [[Helium dating]]) could not be adequately used to track the geological age records particularly in the last &lt;math&gt;\thicksim&lt;/math&gt;300 Million years.  OSL dating is currently the only dating method that has been successfully applied to understand the cooling ages of the geological events&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;.

==Theoretical concepts of electron trapping==
In natural environment, [[crystal lattices]] of quartz and/or feldspar are bombarded with radiation released from [[radiogenic heating|radiogenic source]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; such as ''in -situ'' [[radioactive decay]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As the crystals are [[Irradiation|irradiated]], [[Electron charge|charges]] are stored up in their [[Crystallographic defect|crystallographic defects.]] The [[Electron charge|charge]] trapping process involves atomic-scale [[ion]]ic substitution of both electron and hole within the [[crystal lattices]] of [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[Electrodiffusion|electron diffusion]] happens in response to [[ionizing radiation]] as the minerals cools below their [[closure temperature]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Martin H.|date=1973|title=Closure temperature in cooling geochronological and petrological systems|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00373790|journal=Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=259–274|doi=10.1007/bf00373790|issn=0010-7999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If quartz or feldspar gains are exposed to natural light source such as the sun, the trapped charges will be evicted in form of [[luminescence]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This natural process is called bleaching. Optical bleaching of the mineral leads to eviction of trapped charges in the minerals,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; hence, careful sampling and handling must be followed to avoid using bleached sample for OSL thermochronometry.

==&lt;small&gt;Determination of cooling rate of OSL minerals&lt;/small&gt;  ==
The age recorded by either [[quartz]] or [[feldspar]] represent the cooling age&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and reflects the time since [[quartz]] and/or [[feldspar]] began to trap [[Radiogenic nuclide|charges]] as the minerals cooled through the effective [[closure temperature]]. The number of stored charges as temperature decreases is defined by [[Arrhenius relationship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randall|first=J. T.|last2=Wilkins|first2=M. H.

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;is number of accumulated electrons, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;is the filling rate, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;is the time (a), &lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt;is the activation energy (eV), &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency factor (s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;math&gt;A_s&lt;/math&gt;is the saturation age (a), &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (e''V/K)'' and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] (K).

To determine the [[closure temperature]], it is assumed that the cooling history linearly increases with &lt;math&gt;1/T&lt;/math&gt; at a certain range of temperature.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; By substituting &lt;math&gt;1/T&lt;/math&gt; into the [[Arrhenius relationship|Arrhenius equation]], the [[closure temperature]]&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; can be determined as expressed below.

&lt;math&gt;T_c=\frac{E_a}{kln(\gamma'(\frac{-kT^2}{E_a\dot{T}}s)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Tc&lt;/math&gt;is the closure temperature, &lt;math&gt;\gamma'&lt;/math&gt; is a constant equivalent to 1.78 and &lt;math&gt;\dot{T}&lt;/math&gt;is the cooling rate.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Sample preparation==
Bedrock samples from earth surface or boreholes are required materials for OSL dating.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Minerals ([[quartz]] and/or [[feldspar]]) are usually separated from the rock or sediment samples under regulated laboratory lighting system similar to procedures used in [[Archaeology|archaeological]] OSL dating.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The light source is usually a controlled red light condition to avoid luminescence signal resetting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Crushing of samples is carried out gently to avoid generating heat that is strong enough to reset the OSL signal in the minerals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Crushed samples are separated by means of a [[sieve]] to get fine-grained (90 - 125 &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; for OSL measurement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The selected grains are chemically treated with [[hydrochloric acid]] to digest [[carbonates]] and with [[hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] to remove organic materials&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; that can contaminate the sensitivity of OSL signal during measurement.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Feldspar and quartz with densities of under 2.62 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;  and under 2.68 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; respectively are separated from other heavier minerals by [[density separation]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Inclusions of [[zircon]], [[apatite]] and feldspar in quartz as well as alpha-particle irradiated grain edges that can contaminate OSL signals are removed by etching in [[hydrofluoric acid]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==OSL signal detection system==
[[File:BlessJoy1.png|alt=|thumb|A sketch diagram of OSL detection system. The Infra-red and Blue LEDs ([[Light-emitting diode|Light Emitting Diode)]] provide the optical stimulation depending on the mineral under study. The photomultiplier tube collects and record the OSL signal emitted by the mineral.]]
OSL ages are commonly measured using an automated Ris&lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;[https://www.earthsciences.hku.hk/research/research-group/facilities/thermoluminescence-tl-optically-stimulated-luminescence-osl-reader Thermal Luminescence Reader (e.g. TL-DA-20)]. It contains an internal beta-source (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr/&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y) with optical stimulation emitted through laser diodes (LEDs). The reader also has a detection filter for transmission of stimulated luminescence signals. During this measurement, the mineral grain (quartz or feldspar) is glued on a heater strip (stainless-steel discs) using adhesive (commonly silicone spray). The mineral grain is stimulated with the light source.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This light is the series of [[Light-emitting diode|light emitting diode]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This bombardment stimulates the electrons, which are trapped and begin to [[Recombination (physics)|recombine]] in the crystal.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; During this process, they give the OSL signal, which is collected or recorded in the ray sensitive [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tube]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== OSL age determination ==
[[File:BleJoy.png|alt=|thumb|Plot A shows the decay curve of an OSL signal emitted by an [[aliquot]]. Plot B shows sensitivity correction of OSL signal using the single aliquot regenerative (SAR) technique. The signal is recorded in the photomultiplier tube (OSL counter). The OSL signal is displayed in a computing system attached to the OSL detection system. The natural dose OSL sensitivity (N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; / N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) is shown by the red circle. The natural dose will plot directly on the vertical axis because SAR dose has not been introduced. The regenerative dose signals (R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) are represented by the red circles and the regenerative dose curve is the line that passes through the dose signals (i.e. 5 blue circles) as labelled. To determine the equivalent dose (&lt;math&gt;D_E&lt;/math&gt;), a line is drawn horizontally from the natural OSL signal to intercept with the regenerative curve. The horizontal value at the point of intercept corresponds to the equivalent dose (&lt;math&gt;D_E&lt;/math&gt;). The unit is Gray (Gy). ]]
To determine the OSL age of the sample, the [[Absorbed dose|dose rate]], (&lt;math&gt;D_R&lt;/math&gt;) and the equivalent  dose (&lt;math&gt;D_E&lt;/math&gt;). A [[Absorbed dose|dose]] is the quantity of natural radiation or energy absorbed by a mineral.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[dose rate]] is the effective radiation absorbed from naturally occurring [[Ionizing radiation|ionizing source]] per unit time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

The age is calculated by determining the ratio of equivalent dose (&lt;math&gt;D_E&lt;/math&gt;) and the dose rate (&lt;math&gt;D_R&lt;/math&gt;) using the equation below.

&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{D_E}{D_R}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the age (yr), &lt;math&gt;D_E&lt;/math&gt;is measured in Gray (Gy). Note that 1&amp;nbsp;Gy is equivalent to 1 J.kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (Joule per kilogram) and &lt;math&gt;D_R&lt;/math&gt; is Gy year&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Dose rate determination ====
For a single grain of mineral, the dose rate (&lt;math&gt;D_R&lt;/math&gt;) can be determined by measuring the concentrations of [[uranium]], [[potassium]] and [[thorium]] by direct [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] analysis of quartz or feldspar grains.'''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;''' Ge-Gamma, INAA, X-ray flourescnce and [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|ICP-MS]] or [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-OES]] are [[spectrometer]]s that can could be used.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Other methods for the determination the dose rate include: (1) overburden [[Cosmic ray|cosmic]] dose rate estimation, (2) water content attenuation method, and (3) disequilibrium dose rate correction method.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An average  dose rate is usually calculated as representative of the dose rate.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Equivalent dose determination ====
The equivalent dose  (&lt;math&gt;D_E&lt;/math&gt;) is also known as the dose response.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The single-aliquot regenerative (SAR) protocol is a commonly used method for the determination of the equivalent dose.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=A.S.|last2=Wintle|first2=A.G.|date=2003|title=The single aliquot regenerative dose protocol: potential for improvements in reliability|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1350-4487(03)00053-2|journal=Radiation Measurements|volume=37|issue=4-5|pages=377–381|doi=10.1016/s1350-4487(03)00053-2|issn=1350-4487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol involves series of laboratory measurement of  OSL signal (see Plot A), which is emitted by the [[aliquot]] after it has been optically stimulated at a known beta dose within a given time in seconds. The beta-source may be &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr/&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y in an automated Ris&lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;[https://www.earthsciences.hku.hk/research/research-group/facilities/thermoluminescence-tl-optically-stimulated-luminescence-osl-reader Thermal Luminescence Reader] . 

The first stage involves determination of the natural dose (see Plot B) preheating the aliquot to about 160 -130°C for 10&amp;nbsp;s when the natural [[luminescence]] signal (i.e. natural dose) is still intact. This is done to remove unstable signals in the mineral. After preheating, the aliquot is optically stimulated by [[Infrared]] [[Light-emitting diode|light emitting diode]] or Blue [[Light-emitting diode|light emitting diode]] depending on which mineral (see OSL detection system) for 40&amp;nbsp;s at 125°C and the natural OSL signal (N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured and recorded in the photomultiplier tube. For the second stage, the aliquot is [[Irradiation|irradiated]] with a fixed known test dose (beta dose).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The aliquot is preheated at temperature less than 160°C. The IRSL signal measurement is taken as a test dose IRSL response (N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) after it has been optically stimulated for 40&amp;nbsp;s at 125°C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallinga|first=Jakob|last2=Murray|first2=Andrew|last3=Duller|first3=Geoff|date=2000|title=Underestimation of equivalent dose in single-aliquot optical dating of feldspars caused by preheating|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1350-4487(00)00127-x|journal=Radiation Measurements|volume=32|issue=5-6|pages=691–695|doi=10.1016/s1350-4487(00)00127-x|issn=1350-4487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage the aliquot is completely bleached.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A regenerative test dose is then started after bleaching.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The same procedure as described above is followed but a range of regenerative dose is given at different temperature for sensitivity correction of OSL signal (See Plot B). For the regenerative dose measurement, the aliquot is [[Irradiation|irradiated]] with a known dose before preheating at 160-130°C for 10&amp;nbsp;s while the signal response (R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured. A fixed test dose is by irradiating the aliquot and a preheating of the aliquot is carried out at a temperature less than 160°C. The aliquot is optically stimulated at the same rate and the IRSL signal (R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured. The steps are repeated for range of different regenerative dose including zero test dose.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During each of the tests, all OSL signals are recorded in the [[photomultiplier tube]] and the OSL counts are plotted against the OSL exposure time in seconds as shown in the OSL signal curve (first graph).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For sensitivity correction, N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is plotted against N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; representing the natural OSL signal while the plot of R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; against R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; representing regenerative dose test (see Plot B). The natural dose is along the vertical axis because no laboratory dose is given at the stage. The regenerative dose measurement will vary with respect to the given dose at each stage. The equivalent dose (&lt;math&gt;D_E&lt;/math&gt;) is determined by drawing a line (red discontinuous line in Plot B) from the natural dose to intercept with the regenerative dose curve. The point of interception with the curve represent the equivalent dose by reading its value on the horizontal axis (See Plot B).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The corresponding dose value at the horizontal axis is recorded for the equivalent dose (&lt;math&gt;D_E&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Applications==
OSL finds application in all low-temperature (&lt;50°C) tectonic and sedimentary processes. These studies are mainly captured within the sub-Quaternary period including, but not limited to focused fluvial and/or [[glacial erosion]], [[rock exhumation]] and evolution of [[topography]] in active tectonic regions.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Other applications include glaciation deposits, [[lagoon deposit]]s, storm surge and tsunami deposits, [[lake deposit]]s including shoreline migration history, fluvial erosion deposits, [[loess]] deposit records.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[File:BlJo12.png|alt=|thumb|Schematic description of OSL ages estimated from samples collected along [[South Island|Whataroa-Perth]] catchment area in the [[Southern Alps]] of [[New Zealand]]. The [[Topography|topographic]] profile represents the line connecting all the sampling locations. The estimated OSL ages are plotted in blue circles. The variation in the OSL ages depicts rock cooling history to changes in the relief of the [[valley]] system of [[South Island|Whataroa-Perth]] catchment area.]]
In active tectonics regions, the application of OSL dating is very useful in tracking the thermal history and rate of rock exhumation towards the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The closer the cooling ages, the higher the rate of erosion and/or exhumation of the rock unit under investigation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; When the OSL age of quartz or feldspar is known, the obtained ages are coupled with the existing thermal-mechanical equations e.g. Pecube&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Jean|date=2003|title=Pecube: a new finite-element code to solve the 3D heat transport equation including the effects of a time-varying, finite amplitude surface topography|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0098300403000529|journal=Computers &amp; Geosciences|volume=29|issue=6|pages=787–794|doi=10.1016/s0098-3004(03)00052-9|issn=0098-3004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reconstruct the thermal-mechanical history. For example, the rate of slip on a normal faults plane can also be modelled, the rate of glacial or fluvial erosion of the earth surface can also be modelled as well as when sedimentary deposits are found within the sub-[[Quaternary]] period.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

The OSL ages (see diagram), cooling ages, elevation data are plotted against the horizontal distance where samples and elevation data were collected to interpret the exhumation rate of rock or the evolution of the relief system through time.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; For example, OSL dating has been applied in determined the cooling histories of some rapidly eroding active regions at sub-Quaternary time-scale (i.e. 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years). These examples are [[South Island|Whataroa-Perth]] catchment area in the [[Southern Alps]] of [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and Namche Barwa-Gyala Peri dome in eastern Himalaya.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; In the Namche Barwa-Gyala Peri dome, river erosion was prevalent&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; while glacial erosion was the main active process in the [[South Island|Whataroa-Perth]] catchment area&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. In both studies, the rate of exhumation and evolution of the relief systems were estimated by inversion of OSL thermochronological ages&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;.

The '''Platsis Symposium''' is a forum on Classical and Modern Greek Studies at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]]. Annual symposia discuss the Greek legacy from the [[Minoan civilization]] of Crete, [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and [[Hellenistic Greece]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] through the [[modern Greece|Modern Greek period]] beginning with [[Greek War of Independence|Greek independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1821, exploring the pursuit of excellence, moderation, idealism, self-knowledge, rationalism, curiosity, freedom, individual responsibility and personal responsibility to community.

The program ended in 2014.
==Funding==
The Platsis Symposium is sponsored by the Arthur and Mary Platsis Endowment&lt;ref name="endow"&gt;[http://lsa.umich.edu/classics/news/platsisendowment], [[University of Michigan]]. Retrieved 2010-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the C.P. Cavafy Professorship in [[Modern Greek]] and the [[University of Michigan]] Department of [[Classical Studies]].

==Endowment history==
George Platsis endowed $250,000 (USD) in remembrance of his parents, Arthur and Mary Platsis, both from [[Crete]]. After service with the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd Michigan Infantry]] in [[World War I]], Arthur Platsis was head chef at the [[American Legion Hospital]] in [[Battle Creek]], [[Michigan]] that cared for veterans recovering from poison gas attacks. Mary Platsis had volunteered  for the [[American Red Cross]] and founded a post-[[World War II]] group to ship clothes to [[Crete]] and the orphanages of [[Kandanos]] and [[Sougia]], her grandfather's village, under the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].&lt;ref name="endow" /&gt; In addition to funding the annual [[University of Michigan]] symposia, the Arthur and Mary Platsis Endowment awards prizes to graduate and undergraduate students for original work relating to Greek culture.

[[Image:Col roulé, porté plié.jpg|thumb|A man wearing a folded polo neck]]
A '''polo neck''', ''' roll-neck''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chilvers |first=Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/aug/23/man-trend-polo-neck |title=Man-trend: Roll-necks &amp;#124; Fashion &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[United Kingdom|UK]]), '''turtleneck''' ([[United States|US]], [[Canada]]), or '''skivvy''' ([[Australia]], [[New Zealand]]) is a garment&amp;mdash;usually a [[sweater]]&amp;mdash;with a close-fitting, round, and high part similar to a [[collar (clothing)|collar]] that folds over and covers the [[neck]].  It can also refer to the type of [[neckline]], the style of collar itself, or be used as an [[adjective]] ("polo necked").

The term ''polo neck'', common in British English, is thought to derive from garments with similar necklines worn by Lydia O'Callaghan.&lt;ref name="Ayto2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=John Ayto |title=20th century words |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p0h5AAAAIAAJ |accessdate=17 August 2012|year=2002 |publisher=外语教学与研究出版社|isbn=978-7-5600-2874-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simpler variant of the standard polo neck is the mock polo neck (or mock turtleneck), that resembles the polo neck with the soft fold at its top and the way it stands up around the neck, but both ends of the tube forming the collar are sewn to the neckline.  This is mainly used to achieve the appearance of a polo neck where the fabric would fray, roll, or otherwise behave badly unless sewn. The mock polo neck clings to the neck smoothly, is easy to manufacture, and works well with a zip closure.

==History==
[[Image:Col roulé, porté non plié.JPG|thumb|right|Woman in an unfolded polo neck.]]

===Europe===
Polo neck-like garments have been worn for hundreds of years, dating at least to the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

From the late 19th century on, polo necks were commonly worn by menial workers, athletes, sailors and naval officers. Since the middle of the 20th century [[black]] polo necks have been closely associated with radical [[academics]], [[philosopher]]s, [[artist]]s and [[intellectual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Frese Witt, The Humanities: The humanities and the modern world, 2000, pages 463-464&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Bair, Simone de Beauvoir:a biography, 1990, page 360&lt;/ref&gt; The polo neck jumper became an iconic symbol of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Michel Foucault |last=Eribon |first=Didier |authorlink=Didier Eribon |others=Betsy Wing (translator) |year=1992 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MAS. |isbn=978-0-571-14474-7 |page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polo necks also became a big fashion for young wealthy men after they were worn by European film stars [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Yves Montand]].&lt;ref&gt;Guido Vergani, Dizionario della moda, 2009, page 348 (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greta Garbo]] often wore polo necks and trousers privately, as later [[Audrey Hepburn]] would do in official photographs.

[[Vladimir Putin]]&lt;ref&gt;Zbigniew Brzezinski, Putin's choice, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Russia]] and [[Andreas Papandreou]]&lt;ref&gt;Theodore C. Kariotis, The Greek socialist experiment: Papandreou's Greece 1981–1989, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Greece]] are two examples of European statesmen fond of wearing polo necks.

===United States===
Their adoption by [[Noël Coward]] in the 1920s turned polo necks into a brief middle-class fashion trend, and [[feminism|feminists]] made them into a unisex item. Absorbed into mainstream American fashion by the mid 20th century, the polo neck came to be viewed as an anti-[[necktie|tie]], a smart form of dress for those who rejected [[formal wear]]. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], pianist/conductor [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], conductor [[Seiji Ozawa]], philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], singer [[Barry Manilow]], scientist [[Carl Sagan]], [[Oracle Corporation]] co-founder [[Larry Ellison]], and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] were among those often seen in polo necks.

Over time it became a fad among teenage girls, especially in a lightweight form that emphasised their figures. It was not long before [[Hollywood]] was also exploiting this image as part of the [[sweater girl]] look.

By the late 1950s the "tight turtleneck" had been adopted as part of the [[preppy]] style among students, a style emphasising neatness, tidiness and grooming. This would become an important aspect of the polo neck's image in the [[United States]]. The look would filter through to Britain and the rest of Europe in a watered-down version.

Very elegant polo necks of [[silk]] or nylon knit, especially made with French cuffs for formal dress affairs, have also seen success in American fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpxCUi_udBgC&amp;pg=PA219 |title=American Costume, 1915-1970: A Source Book for the Stage Costumer |publisher=Books.google.gr |date=1989-08-22 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an alternative to the necktie==
[[File:Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (522695099).jpg|thumb|Steve Jobs (left) wearing his signature mock polo neck by [[Issey Miyake]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/10/steve-jobs-explains-black-turtleneck-in-biography.html |title=Steve Jobs' black turtleneck reportedly explained in biography |first=Nathan |last=Olivarez-Giles |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=Technology (blog) |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Polo necks have historically (and controversially) acted as substitutes of the traditional and dominant shirt-and-[[necktie|tie]] look.&lt;ref name=fads&gt;{{cite book |title=Fashion &amp; Merchandising Fads |first=Frank W. |last=Hoffmann |author2=William G. Bailey |series=Haworth Popular Culture |location=Binghamton, N.Y. |publisher=The Haworth Press |pages=267–268 |year=1994 |isbn=9781560243762 |oclc=27225478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the fiercest conflicts regarding the polo neck's use took place in upscale [[restaurant]]s and in weddings, where polo necks have been used in violation of the shirt and tie.

[[John Berendt]] wrote in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''&lt;ref name=fads/&gt;

{{quote|the turtleneck was the boldest of all the affronts to the [[status quo]]. It was the picture of masculine poise and arrogance, redolent of athletes, sportsmen, even [[U-boat]] commanders. The simplicity of its design made neckties seem fussy and superfluous by comparison}}

and the designer [[Halston]] added&lt;ref name=fads/&gt;

{{quote|turtlenecks are the most comfortable garment you can wear. They move with the body, and they're flattering too, because they accentuate the face and elongate the figure. They make life so easy: you can wear a turtleneck to work and then afterwards throw on a jacket, and it becomes very dressy. You can go anywhere you like.}}

{{History of the Ottoman Empire|expanded=rise}}
The foundation and '''rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]]''' is a period of history that started with the emergence of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] principality in {{circa|1299}}, and ended with the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] on May 29, 1453. This period witnessed the foundation of a political entity ruled by the [[Ottoman Dynasty]] in the northwestern Anatolian region of [[Bithynia]], and its transformation from a small principality on the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier into an empire spanning the [[Balkans]] and [[Anatolia]]. For this reason, this period in the empire's history has been described as the Proto-Imperial Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphey |first=Rhoads |title=Exploring Ottoman Sovereignty: Tradition, Image, and Practice in the Ottoman Imperial Household, 1400-1800 |publisher=Continuum |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84725-220-3 |pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout most of this period, the Ottomans were merely one of many competing states in the region, and relied upon the support of local warlords and vassals to maintain control over their realm. By the middle of the fifteenth century the Ottoman sultans were able to accumulate enough personal power and authority to establish a centralized imperial state, a process which was brought to fruition by Sultan [[Mehmed II]] (r. 1451-1481).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphey |first=Rhoads |title=Exploring Ottoman Sovereignty: Tradition, Image, and Practice in the Ottoman Imperial Household, 1400-1800 |publisher=Continuum |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84725-220-3 |pages=41–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of Constantinople in 1453 is seen as the symbolic moment when the emerging Ottoman state shifted from a mere principality into an empire, marking a major turning point in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Atçıl |first=Abdurrahman |title=Scholars and Sultans in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire |pages=212 |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |quote=The conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453 can be taken as a watershed moment for Ottoman power, ideology, and governance that is usually characterized as a transition from principality to empire.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of Ottoman success cannot be attributed to any single factor, and they varied throughout the period as the Ottomans continually adapted to changing circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier part of this period, the fourteenth century, is particularly difficult for historians to study due to the scarcity of sources. Not a single written document survives from the reign of [[Osman I]], and very little survives from the rest of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=xii |quote=There is still not one authentic written document known from the time of ʿO&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;mān, and there are not many from the fourteenth century altogether. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans, furthermore, did not begin to record their own history until the fifteenth century, more than a hundred years after many of the events they describe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus a great challenge for historians to differentiate between fact and myth in analyzing the stories contained in these later chronicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Finkel |first=Caroline |title=Osman's Dream: The Story of the Ottoman Empire, 1300-1923 |page=6 |publisher=Basic Books |date=2005 |quote=Modern historians attempt to sift historical fact from the myths contained in the later stories in which the Ottoman chroniclers accounted for the origins of the dynasty |isbn=978-0-465-02396-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that one historian has even declared it impossible, describing the earliest period of Ottoman history as a "black hole."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Imber |first=Colin |editor=Elizabeth Zachariadou |title=The Ottoman Emirate (1300-1389) |page=75 |date=1991 |publisher=Crete University Press |place=Rethymnon |quote=Almost all the traditional tales about Osman Gazi are fictitious. The best thing a modern historian can do is to admit frankly that the earliest history of the Ottomans is a black hole. Any attempt to fill this hole will result simply in more fables.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatolia before the Ottomans==
[[File:Anatolian Beyliks in 1300.png|thumb|A rough map of Anatolian beyliks in c. 1300]]
At the beginning of the thirteenth century Anatolia was divided between two relatively powerful states: the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the west and the [[Sultanate of Rum|Anatolian Seljuks]] in the central plateau. Equilibrium between them was disrupted by the Mongol invasion and conquest of the Seljuks following the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243, and the reconquest of [[Constantinople]] by the Byzantine [[Palaeologos]] dynasty in 1261, which shifted Byzantine attention away from the Anatolian frontier. Mongol pressure pushed nomadic Turkish tribes to migrate westward, into the now poorly-defended Byzantine territory. From the 1260s onward Anatolia increasingly began to slip from Byzantine control, as [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] were established both in formerly Byzantine lands and in the territory of the fragmenting Seljuk Sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Imber |first=Colin |title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: The Structure of Power |edition=2 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=New York |date=2009 |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political authority in western Anatolia was thus extremely fragmented by the end of the thirteenth century, split between locally established rulers, tribal groups, holy figures, and warlords, with Byzantine and Seljuk authority ever present but rapidly weakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |pages=125–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragmentation of authority has led several historians to describe the political entities of thirteenth and fourteenth-century Anatolia as [[Taifa]]s, or "petty kings", a comparison with the history of late-medieval [[Muslim Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=A Rome of One's Own: Cultural Geography and Identity in the Lands of Rum |journal=Muqarnas |volume=24 |date=2007 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphey |first=Rhoads |title=Exploring Ottoman Sovereignty: Tradition, Image, and Practice in the Ottoman Imperial Household, 1400-1800 |publisher=Continuum |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84725-220-3 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of these groups was largely dependent upon their ability to attract military manpower. Western Anatolia was then a hotbed of raiding activity, with warriors switching allegiance at will to whichever chief seemed most able to provide them with opportunities for plunder and glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the Ottoman state==

The Ottoman dynasty is named after the first ruler of the Ottoman polity, [[Osman I]]. According to later Ottoman tradition, he was descended from a Turkic tribe which migrated out of [[Central Asia]] in the wake of the [[Mongol Conquests]]. As evidenced by coins minted during his reign, Osman's father was named [[Ertuğrul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but beyond this the details "are too mythological to be taken for granted."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=122 |quote=The Ottoman historical tradition maintains, with some exceptions, that the tribe that later represented the core of Osman's earliest base of power came to Asia Minor in his grandfather's generation in the wake of the Chingisid conquest in central Asia. This makes chronological and historical sense, but otherwise the details of their story, including the identity of the grandfather, are too mythological to be taken for granted. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the Ottoman dynasty thus remain obscure, shrouded in myth and legend, and the identity of Osman's tribe and ancestors is not known for certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=122 |quote=That they hailed from the Kayı branch of the Oğuz confederacy seems to be a creative "rediscovery" in the genealogical concoction of the fifteenth century. It is missing not only in Ahmedi but also, and more importantly, in the Yahşi Fakih-Aşıkpaşazade narrative, which gives its own version of an elaborate genealogical family tree going back to Noah. If there was a particularly significant claim to Kayı lineage, it is hard to imagine that Yahşi Fakih would not have heard of it. }}
* {{Cite book |last=Lindner |first=Rudi Paul |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |date=1983 |page=10 |quote=In fact, no matter how one were to try, the sources simply do not allow the recovery of a family tree linking the antecedents of Osman to the Kayı of the Oğuz tribe. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, nothing is known about how Osman first established his principality (''beylik'') as the sources, none of them contemporary, provide many different and conflicting origin stories. What is certain is that at some point in the late thirteenth century Osman emerged as the leader of a small principality centered on the town of [[Söğüt]] in the north-western Anatolian region of [[Bithynia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lindner |first=Rudi Paul |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |date=1983 |pages=20–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Osman's principality was initially supported by the tribal manpower of nomadic Turkish groups, whom he led in raids against the [[Byzantine]] territories of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lindner |first=Rudi Paul |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |date=1983 |pages=23–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Ottoman tribe was based not on blood-ties, but on political expedience. Thus it was inclusive of all who wished to join, including people of Byzantine origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lindner |first=Rudi Paul |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |date=1983 |page=33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman enterprise came to be led by several great warrior families, at least one of which was of Greek Christian origin, that of [[Köse Mihal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |date=2003 |pages=59 }}
* {{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Islam played a role in Ottoman self-identity from the very start, as evidenced by a land grant issued by Osman's son [[Orhan]] in 1324, describing him as "Champion of the Faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Finkel |first=Caroline |title=Osman's Dream: The Story of the Ottoman Empire, 1300-1923 |pages=9–10 |publisher=Basic Books |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaza and gazis in early Ottoman history===
{{main|Gaza Thesis}}
In 1938 the Austrian historian [[Paul Wittek]] published an influential work entitled ''The Rise of the Ottoman Empire'', in which he put forth the argument that the early Ottoman state was constructed upon an ideology of Islamic holy war against non-Muslims. Such a war was known as ''gaza'', and a warrior fighting in it was called a [[ghazi (warrior)|''gazi'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wittek |first=Paul |title=The Rise of the Ottoman Empire |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society |date=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittek's formulation, subsequently known as the "Gaza Thesis," was influential for much of the twentieth century, and led historians to portray the early Ottomans as zealous religious warriors dedicated to the spread of Islam. Beginning in the 1980s, historians increasingly began to criticize Wittek's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=xi-xii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars now recognize that the terms ''gaza'' and ''gazi'' did not have strictly religious connotations for the early Ottomans, and were often used in a secular sense to simply refer to raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Ghaza (gaza) |date=2009 |page=231 |quote=In recent times, the word ghaza has been understood in the West as meaning “Holy War against the infidels” and as referring to religiously inspired military actions taken by the early Ottomans against their Christian neighbors. Despite being commonly used in this way, however, the meaning of this term has come to be widely contested by scholars. The early Ottoman military activity described as ''ghaza'' is now thought to have been a much more fluid undertaking, sometimes referring to actions that were nothing more than raids, sometimes meaning a deliberate holy war, but most often combining a mixture of these elements. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the early Ottomans were neither strict orthodox Muslims nor were they unwilling to cooperate with non-Muslims, and several of the companions of the first Ottoman rulers were either non-Muslims or recent converts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Ghaza (gaza) |date=2009 |page=231 |quote=the closest comrades and fellow-fighters of the first two Ottoman rulers, Osman Ghazi (d. 1324) and Orhan I (r. 1324–62), included several Orthodox Christian Greeks and recent Christian converts to Islam. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of holy war existed during the fourteenth century, but it was only one out of many factors influencing Ottoman behavior. It was only later, in the fifteenth century, that Ottoman writers retroactively began to portray the early Ottomans as zealous Islamic warriors, in order to provide a noble origin for their dynasty which had by then constructed an intercontinental Islamic empire.&lt;ref name=gaza&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Ghaza (gaza) |date=2009 |pages=231–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
Anatolia and the Balkans were greatly impacted by the arrival of the [[Black Death]] after 1347. Urban centers and settled regions were devastated, while nomadic groups suffered less of an impact. The first Ottoman incursions into the Balkans began shortly thereafter. Depopulation resulting from the plague was thus almost certainly a major factor in the success of early Ottoman expansion into the Balkans, and contributed to the weakening of the Byzantine Empire and the depopulation of Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Yavari |editor-first=Neguin |editor2=Lawrence G.

Bulliet |place=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2004 |isbn=0-23113472-X |pages=270–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

During this early period, before the Ottomans were able to establish a centralized system of government in the middle of the fifteenth century, the rulers' powers were "far more circumscribed, and depended heavily upon coalitions of support and alliances reached" among various power-holders within the empire, including Turkic tribal leaders and Balkan allies and vassals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphey |first=Rhoads |title=Exploring Ottoman Sovereignty: Tradition, Image, and Practice in the Ottoman Imperial Household, 1400-1800 |publisher=Continuum |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84725-220-3 |pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Ottoman polity first emerged at the end of the thirteenth century under the leadership of [[Osman I]], it had a tribal organization without a complex administrative apparatus. As Ottoman territory expanded its rulers were faced with the challenge of administering an ever-larger population. Early on the Ottomans adopted the [[Seljuks of Rum]] as models, and by 1324 were able to produce [[Persian Language|Persian-language]] bureaucratic documents in the Seljuk style.&lt;ref name=Lowry72&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |date=2003 |pages=72–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Ottoman state's expansion was fueled by the military activity of frontier warriors ({{lang-tr|gazi}}), of whom the Ottoman ruler was initially merely ''[[primus inter pares]]''. Much of the state's centralization was carried out in opposition to these frontier warriors, who resented Ottoman efforts to control them. Ultimately, the Ottomans were successfully able to harness the military power of the ''gazi''s in order to conquer an empire, while increasingly subordinating those warriors to their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Ottomans were noteworthy for the low tax rates which their subjects were burdened with. This reflected both an ideological concern for the well-being of their subjects, and also a pragmatic need to earn the loyalty of newly conquered populations. As the Ottoman state centralized during the fifteenth century this relatively light tax burden was increased, prompting criticism from writers who saw such centralization in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |pages=131–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular importance for Ottoman success was their ability to keep the empire intact from generation to generation. While other Turkic groups frequently divided their realms between the sons of a deceased ruler, the Ottomans consistently kept the empire united under a single heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State centralization===

The process of centralization is closely connected with an influx of Muslim scholars from Central Anatolia, where a more urban and bureaucratic Turkish civilization had developed under the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuks of Rum]]. Particularly influential was the [[Çandarlı family]], which supplied several [[Grand Viziers]] to the early Ottomans and influenced their institutional development. Some time after 1376, [[Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Elder|Kara Halil]], the head of the Çandarlı family, encouraged [[Murad I]] to institute a tax of one-fifth on slaves taken in war, known as the ''pençik''. This gave the Ottoman rulers a source of manpower from which they could construct a new personal army, known as the [[Janissary|Janissaries]] (''yeniçeri''). Such measures frustrated the ''gazi''s which the Ottomans relied upon to sustain their military conquests, and created lasting tensions within the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |pages=111–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during the reign of Murad I that the office of military judge (''[[Kazasker]]'') was created, indicating an increasing level of social stratification between the emerging military-administrative class (''askeri'') and the rest of society.&lt;ref name=Kafadar142-3&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |pages=142–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murad I also instituted the practice of appointing particular frontier warriors as "Lords of the Frontier" (''uc begleri''). Such power of appointment indicated that the Ottoman rulers were no longer merely ''primus inter pares'' but sat at the top of a hierarchy of leadership. As a way of openly declaring this new status, Murad became the first Ottoman ruler to adopt the title of [[sultan]].&lt;ref name=Kafadar142-3/&gt;

Beginning at the latest by the 1430s, but most likely earlier, the Ottomans conducted regular [[cadastral survey]]s of the territory under their rule, producing record-books known as [[defter|''tahrir defter''s]]. These surveys enabled the Ottoman state to organize the distribution of agricultural taxation rights to the military class of [[timariots]], cavalrymen who collected revenue from the land in exchange for serving in the Ottoman army. Timariots came from diverse backgrounds. Some achieved their position as a reward for military service, while others were descended from the pre-Ottoman aristocracy and simply continued to collect revenue from their old lands, now serving in the Ottoman army as well. Of the latter, many were converts to Islam, while others remained Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |date=2003 |pages=90–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of great symbolic importance for Ottoman centralization was the practice whereby Ottoman rulers would customarily stand upon hearing the sound of martial music, indicating their willingness to participate in ''gaza''. Shortly after the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, [[Mehmed II]] discontinued this practice, indicating that the Ottoman ruler was no longer a simple frontier warrior, but the sovereign of an empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire's capital was shifted from [[Edirne]], the city symbolically connected with the frontier warrior ethos of ''gaza'', to [[Constantinople]], a city with deeply imperial connotations due to its long history as the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This was seen, both symbolically and practically, as the moment of the empire's definitive shift from a frontier principality into an empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==

Osman's army at the beginning of the fourteenth century consisted largely of mounted warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lindner |first=Rudi Paul |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |date=1983 |pages=29–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These he used in raids, ambushes, and hit-and-run attacks, allowing him to control the countryside of Bithynia. However, he initially lacked the means to conduct sieges. [[Bursa]], the first major town conquered by the Ottomans, surrendered under threat of starvation following a long blockade rather than from an assault. It was under [[Orhan]] (r. 1323/4-1362) and [[Murad I]] (r. 1362-1389) that the Ottomans mastered the techniques of siege warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Imber |first=Colin |title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: The Structure of Power |edition=2 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=New York |date=2009 |pages=262–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warriors in Osman's service came from diverse backgrounds. Known variously as ''gazi''s{{refn|group=nb|A term normally meaning "a warrior who fights in the name of Islam", but which had a variety of different meanings for the early Ottomans, not all of them strictly religious. On this see the above section, [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire#Gaza and gazis in early Ottoman history|"Gaza and gazis in early Ottoman history"]].}} and ''akıncı''s (raiders), they were attracted to his success and joined out of a desire to win plunder and glory. Most of Osman's early followers were Muslim Turks of tribal origin, while others were of Byzantine origin, either Christians or recent converts to Islam.&lt;ref name=gaza/&gt;

The Ottomans began employing gunpowder weapons from the 1380s at the latest. By the 1420s they were regularly using cannons in siege warfare. Cannons were also used for fortress defense, and shore batteries allowed the Ottomans to bypass a Crusader blockade of the [[Dardanelles]] in 1444. By that time handheld firearms had also come into use, and were adopted by some of the [[janissaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor |title=Firearms and Military Adaptation: The Ottomans and the European Military Revolution, 1450–1800 |journal=Journal of World History |volume=25 |date=2014 |pages=88–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and intellectual life==

By the early fifteenth century, the Ottoman court was actively fostering literary output, much of it borrowing from the longstanding literary tradition of other Islamic courts further east. The first extant account of Ottoman history ever written was produced by the poet Ahmedi, originally meant to be presented to Sultan [[Bayezid I]] but, following the latter's death in 1402, written for his son [[Süleyman Çelebi]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |pages=93–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work, entitled the ''İskendernāme,'' ("The Book of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]") was part of a genre known as "mirror for princes" ([[nasihatname|''naṣīḥatnāme'']]), meant to provide advice and guidance to the ruler with regard to statecraft. Thus rather than providing a factual account of the dynasty's history, Ahmedi's goal was to indirectly criticize the sultan by depicting his ancestors as model rulers, in contrast to the perceived deviance of Bayezid. Specifically, Ahmedi took issue with Bayezid's military campaigns against fellow Muslims in Anatolia, and thus depicted his ancestors as totally devoted to holy war against the Christian states of the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |date=2003 |pages=15–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political history==

Osman was adept at forging political and commercial relationships with nearby groups, Muslim as well as Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on he attracted several notable figures to his side, including Köse Mihal, a Byzantine village headman whose descendants (known as the Mihaloğulları) enjoyed primacy among the frontier warriors in Ottoman service. Köse Mihal was noteworthy for having been a Christian Greek; while he eventually converted to Islam, his prominent historical role indicates Osman's willingness to cooperate with non-Muslims and incorporate them into his political enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osman I strengthened his legitimacy by marrying the daughter of Sheikh Edebali, a prominent local religious leader who was said to have been at the head of a community of [[dervish]]es on the frontier. Later Ottoman writers embellished this event by depicting Osman as having experienced a dream while staying with Edebali, in which it was foretold that his descendants would rule over a vast empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orhan (1323/4–1362)===
:''See also: [[Battle of Pelekanon]], [[Siege of Nicaea (1331)|Siege of Nicaea]], [[Siege of Nicomedia]]''

Upon Osman's death his son Orhan succeeded him as leader of the Ottomans. Orhan oversaw the conquest of [[Bithynia]]'s major towns, as [[Bursa]] (Prusa) was conquered in 1326 and the rest of the region's towns fell shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Imber |first=Colin |title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: The Structure of Power |edition=2 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=New York |date=2009 |pages=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Already by 1324, the Ottomans were making use of Seljuk bureaucratic practices,&lt;ref name=Lowry72/&gt; and had developed the capacity to mint coins and utilize siege tactics. It was under Orhan that the Ottomans began to attract Islamic scholars from the east to act as administrators and judges, and the first [[medrese]] (University) was established in Iznik in 1331.&lt;ref name=Kafadar16&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to fighting with the Byzantines, Orhan also conquered the Turkish principality of [[Karesi]] in 1345-6, thus placing all potential crossing points to Europe in Ottoman hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Imber |first=Colin |title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: The Structure of Power |edition=2 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=New York |date=2009 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experienced Karesi warriors were incorporated into the Ottoman military, and were a valuable asset in subsequent campaigns into the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orhan married Theodora, the daughter of Byzantine prince [[John VI Cantacuzenus]]. In 1346 Orhan openly supported John VI in the overthrowing of the emperor [[John V Palaeologus]]. When John VI became co-emperor (1347–1354) he allowed Orhan to raid the peninsula of [[Gallipoli]] which gained the Ottomans their first stronghold in Europe. [[Orhan]] decided to pursue war against Europe, Anatolian Turks were settled in and around [[Gallipoli]] to secure it as a springboard for military operations in [[Thrace]] against the Byzantines and [[Bulgarians]]. Most of [[East Thrace|eastern Thrace]] was overrun by Ottoman forces within a decade and permanently brought under Orhan's control by means of heavy colonization. The initial Thracian conquests placed the Ottomans strategically astride all of the major overland communication routes linking Constantinople to the Balkans’ frontiers, facilitating their expanded military operations. ln addition, control of the highways in Thrace isolated Byzantium from direct overland contact with any of its potential allies in the Balkans or in Western Europe. Byzantine [[John V Palaiologos|Emperor John V]] was forced to sign an unfavorable treaty with Orhan in 1356 that recognized his Thracian losses.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In taking control over the passageways to Europe, the Ottomans gained a significant advantage over their rival Turkish principalities in Anatolia, as they now could gain immense prestige and booty from conquests carried out on the Balkan frontier.&lt;ref name=Kafadar16 /&gt;

===Murad I (1362–1389)===

Soon after Orhan's death in 1362, [[Murad I]] became the Sultan.

====Edirne, 1362====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
{{See also|Conquest of Adrianople}}
Murad's first major offensive was the [[Ottoman capture of Adrianople|conquest]] of the Byzantine city of Adrianople in 1362. He renamed it to [[Edirne]] and made it his new capital in 1363.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1363 the Ottoman capital moved from Bursa to Edirne, although Bursa retained its spiritual and economic importance." [http://www.kultur.gov.tr/–EN,33810/ottoman-capital-bursa.html ''Ottoman Capital Bursa'']. Official website of Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Turkey. Retrieved 19 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2016|reason=This is a government website, not something published by a professional historian.}} By transferring his capital from Bursa in [[Anatolia]] to that newly won city in [[Thrace]], Murad signaled his intentions to continue Ottoman expansion in Southeast Europe. Before the conquest of Edirne, most Christian Europeans regarded the Ottoman presence in Thrace as merely the latest unpleasant episode in a long string of chaotic events in the Balkans. After Murad I designated Edirne as his capital, they realized that the Ottomans intended to remain in Europe.

The Balkan states of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Second Bulgarian Kingdom|Bulgaria]], and [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]] were fearful of the Ottomans' conquests in Thrace, and were ill-prepared to deal with the threat. Byzantium's territory was fragmented mostly among the capital at Constantinople and its Thracian environs, the city of [[Thessaloniki]] and its immediate surroundings, and the Despotate of the Morea in the Peloponnese. Contact between Constantinople and the two other regions was possible only by means of a tenuous sea route through the [[Dardanelles]], kept open by the Italian maritime powers of Venice and Genoa. The weakened Byzantine Empire no longer possessed the resources to defeat Murad on its own, and concerted action on the part of the Byzantines, often divided by civil war, was impossible. The survival of Constantinople itself depended on its legendary defensive walls, the lack of an Ottoman navy, and the willingness of Murad to honor provisions in the 1356 treaty permitting the city to be provisioned.

Bulgaria under [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Tsar Ivan Aleksandar]] was expanding and prosperous. However, at the end of his rule the Bulgarian Tsar made the fatal mistake to divide the Second Bulgarian Empire into three appanages held by his sons. Bulgaria's cohesion was shattered further in the 1350s by a rivalry between the holder of [[Vidin]], [[Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria|Ivan Stratsimir]], Ivan Aleksandar's sole surviving son by his first wife, and [[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Ivan Shishman]], the product of Aleksandar's second marriage and the ''tsar's'' designated successor. In addition to internal problems, Bulgaria was further crippled by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] attack. In 1365 [[Louis I of Hungary|Hungarian King Louis I]] invaded and seized [[Vidin]] province, whose ruler [[Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria|Stratsimir]] was taken captive. Despite the concurrent loss of most Bulgarian Thracian holdings to Murad, Ivan Aleksandar became fixated on the Hungarians in Vidin. He formed a coalition against them with Dobrudja ruler Dobrotitsa and [[Vladislav I of Wallachia|Voievod Vladislav I Vlaicu of Wallachia]]. Although the Hungarians were repulsed and Stratsimir was restored to his throne, Bulgaria emerged more intensely divided than previously. Stratsimir proclaimed himself tsar of an "Empire" of Vidin in 1370, and Dobrotitsa received de facto recognition as independent despot in [[Dobrudzha]]. Bulgaria's efforts were squandered to little domestic purpose and against the wrong enemy.

Given Serbia's preeminence in the Balkans under [[Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Tsar Stefan Dušan]], its rapid dissolution following his death in 1355 was dramatic. The powerful regional Serb nobles demonstrated little respect for his successor, [[Stefan Uroš V of Serbia|Stefan Uroš V]]. Young, weak [[Stefan Uroš V of Serbia|Uroš]] was incapable of ruling as his father had. The separatist-minded ''bojars'' were quick to take advantage of the situation, and [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]] fragmented.

First to throw off Serbian control were the Greek provinces of [[Thessaly]] and [[Despotate of Epiros|Epiros]] as well as Dušan's former Albanian holdings. A series of small independent principalities arose in western and southern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], while the Hungarians encroached deeper into Serb lands in the north. Uros held only the core Serbian lands, whose nobles, although more powerful than their prince, generally remained loyal. These core lands consisted of: The western lands, including [[Montenegro]] ([[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]]); the southern lands, held by [[Jovan Uglješa]] in Serres, encompassing all of eastern Macedonia; and the central Serbian lands, stretching from the Danube south into central Macedonia, co-ruled by Uroš and the powerful noble Vukasin Mrnjavcevic, who held [[Prilep]] in Macedonia. Far from preserving Serb unity, Uroš's loosely amalgamated domains were wracked by constant civil war among the regional nobles, leaving Serbia vulnerable to the rising Ottoman threat.
Murad I did rise to the power of the Ottoman Empire in 1362.

====Gallipoli, 1366====
{{See also|Reconquest of Gallipoli}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
By 1370 Murad controlled most of [[Thrace]], bringing him into direct contact with [[Second Bulgarian Kingdom|Bulgaria]] and the southeastern Serbian lands ruled by Uglješa. Uglješa, the most powerful Serb regional ruler, unsuccessfully attempted to forge an anti-Ottoman alliance of Balkan states in 1371. Byzantium, vulnerable to the Turks because of its food supply situation, refused to cooperate. Bulgaria, following Ivan Aleksandur's death early that year, lay officially divided into the "Empire" of Vidin, ruled by Stratsimir (1370–96), and Aleksandur's direct successor [[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Tsar Ivan Shishman]] (1371–95), who ruled central Bulgaria from [[Turnovo]]. Young, his hold on the throne unsteady, threatened by Stratsimir, and probably pressured by the Turks, Shishman could not afford to participate in Uglješa's scheme. Of the regional Serb ''bojars'', only [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević|Vukašin]], protector of Uroš and Uglješa's brother, joined in the effort. The others either failed to recognize the Ottoman danger or refused to participate lest competitors attacked while they were in the field.

====Maritsa, 1371====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
{{See also|Battle of Maritsa}}
[[File:Bulgaria-1371.jpg|thumb|200px|The Ottoman advance after the Battle of Maritsa]]

The Battle of Maritsa took place at the [[Maritsa River]] near the village of [[Ormenio|Chernomen]] on September 26, 1371 with sultan Murad's lieutenant [[Lala Shahin Pasha]] and the Serbs numbering some 70,000 men under the command of the Serbian king of Prilep Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his brother despot Uglješa. Despot Uglješa wanted to make a surprise attack in their capital city, Edirne, while Murad I was in Asia Minor. The Ottoman army was much smaller, but due to superior tactics (night raid on the allied camp), Şâhin Paşa was able to defeat the Christian army and kill King Vukašin and despot Uglješa. Macedonia and parts of Greece fell under Ottoman power after this battle. Both Uglješa and Vukašin perished in the carnage. So overwhelming was the Ottoman victory that the Turks referred to the battle as the Rout (or Destruction) of the Serbs.

What little unity Serbia possessed collapsed after the catastrophe at Ormenion (Chernomen). Uroš died before the year was out, ending the [[Nemanjić dynasty]], and large areas of central Serbia broke away as independent principalities, reducing it to half of its former size. No future ruler ever again officially held the office of ''car'', and no single ''bojar'' enjoyed enough power or respect to gain recognition as a unifying leader. Vukasin's son Marko, who survived the slaughter, proclaimed himself Serbian "king" (''kralj'') but was unable to make good on his claim outside of his lands around [[Prilep]] in central Macedonia. Serbia slipped into accelerated fragmentation and internecine warfare among the proliferating regional princes.

In the aftermath of the Ormenion battle, Ottoman raids into Serbia and Bulgaria intensified. The enormity of the victory and the incessant raids into his lands convinced Turnovo Bulgarian Tsar Shishman of the necessity for coming to terms with the Ottomans. By 1376 at the latest, Shishman accepted vassal status under Murad and sent his sister as the sultan's "wife" to the harem at Edirne. The arrangement did not prevent Ottoman raiders from continuing to plunder inside of Shishman's borders. As for Byzantium, Emperor John V definitively accepted Ottoman vassalage soon after the battle, opening the door to Murad's direct interference in Byzantine domestic politics.

The Bulgarians and Serbs enjoyed a brief respite during the 1370s and into the 1380s when matters in Anatolia and increased meddling in Byzantium's political affairs kept Murad preoccupied. In Serbia, the lull permitted the northern Serb ‘’bojar’’ Prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanovic]] (1371-89), with the support of powerful Bulgarian and Montenegrin nobles and the backing of the Serbian Orthodox Patriarchate of Pec, to consolidate control over much of the core Serbian lands. Most of the Serb regional rulers in Macedonia, including Marko, accepted vassalage under Murad to preserve their positions, and many of them led Serb forces in the sultan's army operating in Anatolia against his Turkish rivals.

====Dubravnica, 1381====
{{See also|Battle of Dubravnica}}
By the mid-1380s Murad's attention once again focused on the Balkans. With his Bulgarian vassal Shishman preoccupied by a war with Wallachian Voievod [[Dan I of Wallachia]] (ca. 1383-86), in 1385 Murad took [[Sofia]], the last remaining Bulgarian possession south of the Balkan Mountains, opening the way toward strategically located [[Niš]], the northern terminus of the important [[Vardar]]-Morava highway.

====Saurian Field, 1385====
{{See also|Battle of Savra}}

Savra field battle was fought on 18 September 1385 between Ottoman and Serbian forces. The Ottomans were victorious and most of the local Serbian and Albanian lords became vassals.

====Plocnik, 1386====
{{See also|Battle of Plocnik}}
Murad captured Niš in 1386, perhaps forcing Lazar of Serbia to accept Ottoman vassalage soon afterward. While he pushed deeper into the north—central Balkans, Murad also had forces moving west along the ‘’Via Ingatia’’ into Macedonia, forcing vassal status on regional rulers who until that time had escaped that fate. One contingent reached the Albanian Adriatic coast in 1385. Another took and occupied Thessaloniki in 1387. The danger to the continued independence of the Balkan Christian states grew alarmingly apparent.

When Anatolian affairs forced Murad to leave the Balkans in 1387, his Serbian and Bulgarian vassals attempted to sever their ties to him. Lazar formed a coalition with Tvrtko I of Bosnia and Stratsimir of Vidin. After he refused an Ottoman demand that he live up to his vassal obligations, troops were dispatched against him. Lazar and Tvrtko met the Turks and defeated them at Plocnik, west of Niš. The victory by his fellow Christian princes encouraged Shishman to shed Ottoman vassalage and reassert Bulgarian independence.

====Bileća, 1388====
{{See also|Battle of Bileća}}
Murad returned from Anatolia in 1388 and launched a lightning campaign against the Bulgarian rulers Shishman and Stratsimir, who swiftly were forced into vassal submission. He then demanded that Lazar proclaim his vassalage and pay tribute. Confident because of the victory at Plocnik, the Serbian prince refused and turned to Tvrtko of Bosnia and Vuk Brankovic, his son-in-law and independent ruler of northern Macedonia and Kosovo, for aid against the certain Ottoman retaliatory offensive.

====Kosovo, 1389====
{{See also|Battle of Kosovo}}
[[File:Battle of Kosovo, Adam Stefanović, 1870.jpg|thumb|200px|Battle on Kosovo, by Adam Stefanovic, 1870]]
On [[Vidovdan|St. Vitus' Day]], June 15, 1389, the Ottoman army personally commanded by Sultan Murad fought the Serbian army led by [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian]] Prince [[Lazar of Serbia|Lazar Hrebeljanović]], which also included contingents led by [[Vuk Branković]], and a contingent sent from [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] by King [[Tvrtko I]], commanded by [[Vlatko Vuković]].&lt;ref name=Fine-1994-409-11&gt;Fine (1994), pp. 409–11&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary of how large the armies were, with the Ottomans having greater numbers (27,000–40,000) than the Orthodox army (12,000–30,000).&lt;!-- [[Battle of Kosovo#Notes]] --&gt; The bulk of both armies were wiped out in the battle; both Lazar and Murad lost their lives in it. Although Ottomans managed to annihilate the Serbian army, they also suffered high casualties which delayed their progress. Serbs were left with too few men to effectively defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Consequently, one after the other, the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals became so in the following years.&lt;ref name=Fine-1994-409-11/&gt; The result of the battle was a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Waley|author2=Peter Denley|title=Later Medieval Europe: 1250-1520|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qkuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-89018-8|page=255|quote=The outcome of the battle itself was inconclusive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle of Kosovo is particularly important to modern Serbian history, tradition, and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Isabelle Dierauer|title=Disequilibrium, Polarization, and Crisis Model: An International Relations Theory Explaining Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCuDsecLWmYC|date=16 May 2013|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-6106-5|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lazar's young and weak successor [[Stefan Lazarević]] (1389–1427) concluded a vassal agreement with Bayezid in 1390 to counter Hungarian moves into northern Serbia, while Vuk Branković, the last independent Serb prince, held out until 1392.

===Bayezid I (1389–1402)===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
{{Further2|the Sultan's personal information [[Bayezid I]]}}
[[Bayezid I]] (often given the epithet ''Yıldırım'', "the Thunderbolt") succeeded to the sultanship upon the assassination of his father Murad. In a rage over the attack, he ordered all Serbian captives killed; Beyazid became known as ''Yıldırım'', the lightning bolt, for his temperament.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Bayezid, "the Thunderbolt", lost little time in expanding Ottoman Balkan conquests. He followed up on his victory by raiding throughout Serbia and southern Albania, forcing most of the local princes into vassalage. Both to secure the southern stretch of the Vardar-Morava highway and to establish a firm base for permanent expansion westward to the Adriatic coast, Bayezid settled large numbers of ‘’yürüks’’ along the Vardar River valley in Macedonia.

The appearance of Turk raiders at Hungary's southern borders awakened Hungarian [[King Sigismund]] of Luxemburg (1387–1437) to the danger that the Ottomans posed to his kingdom, and he sought out Balkan allies for a new anti-Ottoman coalition.

By early 1393 Turnovo Bulgaria's Ivan Shishman, hoping to throw off his onerous vassalage, was in secret negotiations with Sigismund, along with Wallachian Voievod [[Mircea the Old]] (1386–1418) and, possibly, [[Vidin]]'s Ivan Stratsimir. Bayezid got wind of the talks and launched a devastating campaign against Shishman. Turnovo was captured after a lengthy siege, and Shishman fled to [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]]. After that town fell to Bayezid, Shishman was captured and beheaded. All of his lands were annexed outright by the sultan, and Stratsimir, whose Vidin holdings had escaped Bayezid's wrath, was forced to reaffirm his vassalage.

Having dealt harshly and effectively with his disloyal Bulgarian vassals, Bayezid then turned his attention south to Thessaly and the Morea, whose Greek lords had accepted Ottoman vassalage in the 1380s. Their incessant bickering among themselves, especially those of the Greek Morean magnates, required Bayezid's intervention. He summoned a meeting of all his Balkan vassals at [[Serres]] in 1394 to settle these and other outstanding matters. Among the sultan's attending vassals were the Thessalian and Morean nobles, Byzantine Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] (1391–1425), and Serbian Prince Lazarevic. At the meeting, Bayezid acquired possession of all disputed territories, and all of the attendees were required to reaffirm their vassal status.

When the Moreans later reneged on their Serres agreement with Bayezid, the angered Ottoman ruler blockaded the Morean despot's imperial brother Manuel II in Constantinople and then marched southward and annexed Thessaly. The [[Duchy of Athens]] accepted Ottoman overlordship when Turkish forces appeared on its border. Although a massive Ottoman punitive raid into the Peloponnese in 1395 netted much booty, events in the Balkans’ northeast saved Morea from further direct attack at the time.

While Bayezid was occupied in Greece, Mircea of Wallachia conducted a series of raids across the Danube into Ottoman territory. In retaliation, Bayezid's forces, which included Serb vassal troops led by Lazarevic and Kralj Marko, struck into Wallachia in 1395 but were defeated at [[Battle of Rovine|Rovine]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} where Marko was killed. The victory saved Wallachia from Turkish occupation, but Mircea accepted vassalage under Bayezid to avert further Ottoman intervention.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The sultan took consolation for his less than victorious efforts in annexing [[Dobrudzha]] and in supporting a pretender, Vlad I (1395–97), to the Wallachian throne. Two years of civil war ensued before Mircea regained complete control of the principality.

====Nicopolis====
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Nicopol final battle 1398.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Battle of Nicopolis]] (1396)]]

In 1396 Hungarian King Sigismund finally pulled together a crusade against the Ottomans. The crusader army was composed primarily of Hungarian and French knights, but included some Wallachian troops.  Though nominally led by Sigismund, it lacked command cohesion. The crusaders crossed the Danube, marched through Vidin, and arrived at Nikopol, where they met the Turks. The headstrong French knights refused to follow Sigismund's battle plans, resulting in their [[Battle of Nicopolis|crushing defeat]]. Because Stratsimir had permitted the crusaders to pass through Vidin, Bayezid invaded his lands, took him prisoner, and annexed his territories. With Vidin's fall, Bulgaria ceased to exist, becoming the first major Balkan Christian state to disappear completely by direct Ottoman conquest.

Following Nikopol, Bayezid contented himself with raiding Hungary, Wallachia, and Bosnia. He conquered most of Albania and forced the remaining northern Albanian lords into vassalage. A new, halfhearted siege of Constantinople was undertaken but lifted in 1397 after Emperor Manuel II, Bayezid's vassal, agreed that the sultan should confirm all future Byzantine emperors. Soon thereafter Bayezid was called back to Anatolia to deal with continuing problems with the Ottomans’ Turkish rivals and never returned to the Balkans.

====Ankara, 1402====
{{See also|Timur}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Chlebowski-Bajazyt w niewoli.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Painting by Stanisław Chlebowski, ''Sultan Bayezid prisoned by Timur'', 1878, depicting the capture of [[Bayezid I|Bayezid]] by Timur.]]
Bayezid took with him an army composed primarily of Balkan vassal troops, including Serbs led by Lazarevic. He soon faced an invasion of Anatolia by the Central Asian ruler Timur Lenk. Around 1400, Timur entered the Middle East. Timur Lenk pillaged a few villages in [[eastern Anatolia]] and commenced the conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In August, 1400, Timur and his horde burned the town of Sivas to the ground and advanced into the mainland. Their armies met outside of Ankara, at the [[Battle of Ankara]], in 1402. The Ottomans were routed and Bayezid was taken prisoner, later dying in captivity. A civil war, lasting from 1402 to 1413, broke out among Bayezid's surviving sons. Known in Ottoman history as the Interregnum, that struggle temporarily halted active Ottoman expansion in the Balkans.

===Ottoman Interregnum (1402–1413)===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
After the defeat at [[Ankara]] followed a time of total chaos in the Empire. Mongols roamed free in Anatolia and the political power of the sultan was broken. After Beyazid was captured, his remaining sons, Suleiman Çelebi, İsa Çelebi, Mehmed Çelebi, and [[Musa Çelebi]] fought each other in what became known as the [[Ottoman Interregnum]].

The [[Ottoman Interregnum]] brought a brief period of semi-independence to the vassal Christian Balkan states. Suleyman, one of the late sultan's sons, held the Ottoman capital at Edirne and proclaimed himself ruler, but his brothers refused to recognize him. He then concluded alliances with [[Byzantium]], to which [[Thessaloniki]] was returned, and with Venice in 1403 to bolster his position. Suleyman's imperious character, however, turned his Balkan vassals against him. In 1410 he was defeated and killed by his brother Musa, who won the Ottoman Balkans with the support of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II, Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarevic, Wallachian Voievod Mircea, and the two last Bulgarian rulers’ sons. Musa then was confronted for sole control of the Ottoman throne by his younger brother Mehmed, who had freed himself of [[Mongol]] vassalage and held Ottoman Anatolia.

Concerned over the growing independence of his Balkan Christian vassals, Musa turned on them. Unfortunately, he alienated the Islamic bureaucratic and commercial classes in his Balkan lands by continually favoring the lower social elements to gain wide popular support. Alarmed, the Balkan Christian vassal rulers turned to Mehmed, as did the chief Ottoman military, religious, and commercial leaders. In 1412 Mehmed invaded the Balkans, took Sofia and Nis, and joined forces with Lazarevicys Serbs. The following year Mehmed decisively defeated Musa outside of Sofia. Musa was killed, and [[Mehmed I]] (1413–21) emerged as the sole ruler of a reunited Ottoman state.

===Mehmed I (1413–1421)===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
When Mehmed Çelebi stood as victor in 1413 he crowned himself in [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) as [[Mehmed I]]. His was the duty to restore the Ottoman Empire to its former glory. The Empire had suffered hard from the interregnum; the Mongols were still at large in the east, even though [[Timur]] had died in 1405; many of the Christian kingdoms of the Balkans had broken free of Ottoman control; and the land, especially Anatolia, had suffered hard from the war.

Mehmed moved the capital from [[Bursa]] to Adrianople. He faced a delicate political situation in the Balkans. His [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]], [[Serbian Despotate|Serbian]], [[Wallachia]]n, and Byzantine vassals were virtually independent. The Albanian tribes were uniting into a single state, and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] remained completely independent, as did [[Moldavia]]. [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] retained territorial ambitions in the Balkans, and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] held numerous Balkan coastal possessions. Prior to Bayezid's death, Ottoman control of the Balkans appeared a certainty. At the end of the interregnum, that certainty seemed open to question.

Mehmed generally resorted to diplomacy rather than militancy in dealing with the situation. While he did conduct raiding expeditions into neighboring European lands, which returned much of [[History of Ottoman Albania|Albania]] to Ottoman control and forced Bosnian King-Ban [[Tvrtko II of Bosnia|Tvrtko II Kotromanić]] (1404–09, 1421–45), along with many Bosnian regional nobles, to accept formal Ottoman vassalage, Mehmed conducted only one actual war with the Europeans — a short and indecisive conflict with Venice.

The new sultan had grave domestic problems. Musa's former policies sparked discontent among the Ottoman Balkans’ lower classes. In 1416 a popular revolt of Muslims and Christians broke out in [[Dobruja]], led by Musa's former confidant, the scholar-mystic [[Şeyh Bedreddin]], and supported by Wallachian voivode [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]]. Bedreddin preached such concepts as merging Islam, Christianity, and Judaism into a single faith and the social betterment of free peasants and nomads at the expense of the Ottoman bureaucratic and professional classes. Mehmed crushed the revolt and Bedreddin died. Mircea then occupied Dobruja, but Mehmed wrested the region back in 1419, capturing the Danubian fort of Giurgiu and forcing [[Wallachia]] back into vassalage.

Mehmed spent the rest of his reign reorganizing Ottoman state structures disrupted by the interregnum. When Mehmed died in 1421, one of his sons, [[Murad II|Murad]], became sultan.

===Murad II  (1421–1451)===

[[Murad II]] spent his early years on the throne disposing of rivals and rebellions, most notably the revolts of the [[Serbs]]. He also had problems at home. He subdued the rebels of his uncle [[Mustafa Çelebi]] and brother [[Küçük Mustafa]].

====Constantinople, 1422====
{{See also|Siege of Constantinople (1422)}}
In 1422, Murad II laid siege to [[Constantinople]] for several months and lifted it only after forcing the Byzantine emperor, [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] to pay additional tribute.

In 1422 the first regular war against [[Venice]] began with the [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–30)]]. Byzantine involvement in the war ended with the transfer of the city to the [[Venetian Republic]] in 1423, which ended Murad's siege of Constantinople.  Thessalonica continued to be under siege until 1430, with the Turkish sack of the city.

====Thessalonika, 1430====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
{{See also|Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)}}
On the request of its inhabitants, Venetian troops took control of the city of Salonika ([[Thessaloniki]]). The Ottoman army that laid siege to the city knew nothing of the transfer of power, and a number of Venetian soldiers were killed by Ottoman troops, believing them to be Greeks. Murad II had been on peaceful terms with Venice, so the Venetians deemed the act unacceptable and declared full war.

Murad acted swiftly, besieging Constantinople and sending his armies to Salonika. The Venetians had gained reinforcements by sea but when the Ottomans stormed the city the outcome was forgone and the Venetians fled to their ships. But when the Turks entered and began plundering the city the Venetian fleet started bombarding the city from the sea-side. The Ottomans fled and the fleet was able to hold off the Ottomans until new Venetian reinforcements arrived to recapture the city. The outcome of the [[Battle of Salonika]] was a setback for Murad and [[Serbia]] and [[Hungary]] allied themselves with [[Venice]]. [[Pope Martin V]] encouraged other Christian states to join the war against the Ottomans, though only Austria ever sent any troops to the Balkans.

The war in the Balkans began as the Ottoman army moved to recapture [[Wallachia]], which the Ottomans had lost to [[Mircea I of Wallachia]] during the Interregnum and that now was a [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] vassal state. As the Ottoman army entered Wallachia, the [[Serbs]] started attacking [[Bulgaria]] and, at the same time, urged by the Pope, the Anatolian emirate [[Karamanid]] attacked the Empire from the back. Murad had to split his army. The main force went to defend [[Sofia]] and the reserves had to be called to [[Anatolia]]. The remaining troops in Wallachia were crushed by the Hungarian army that was now moving south into Bulgaria where the Serbian and Ottoman armies battled each other. The Serbs were defeated and the Ottomans turned to face the Hungarians who fled back into Wallachia when they realized they were unable to attack the Ottomans from the back. Murad fortified his borders against Serbia and Hungary but did not try to retake Wallachia, instead he sent his armies to Anatolia where they defeated Karaman in 1428.

In 1430 a large Ottoman fleet attacked Salonika by surprise. The Venetians signed a peace treaty in 1432. The treaty gave the Ottomans the city of Salonika and the surrounding land. The war between Serbia and Hungary and the Ottoman Empire had come to a standstill in 1441 when the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Poland, [[Albania]], and the [[Jandarid]] and [[Karamanid]] emirates (in violation of the peace treaty) intervened against the Ottomans. [[Niš]] and [[Sofia]] fell to the Christians in 1443 and the year after the Empire suffered a major defeat in the [[Battle of Jalowaz]]. July 12, 1444 Murad signed a treaty that officially gave Wallachia and the Bulgarian province of [[Varna]] to Hungary, western Bulgaria (including Sofia) to Serbia and forced Murad to abdicate in favor of his twelve-year-old son [[Mehmed II|Mehmed]]. Later the same year the Christians violated the peace treaty and attacked anew.

====Varna, 1444====
{{See also|Battle of Varna}}
On November 11, 1444, Murad defeated the [[Poland|Polish]]&amp;ndash;[[Hungary|Hungarian]] army of [[Władysław III of Poland|Wladislaus III of Poland]] led by [[Janos Hunyadi]] at the [[Battle of Varna]].

Murad was reinstated with the help of the [[Janissary|Janissaries]] in 1446. Another peace treaty was signed in 1448 giving the Empire [[Wallachia]] and [[Bulgaria]] and a part of [[Albania]]. After the Balkan front was secured, Murad turned east and defeated Timur Lenk's son, [[Shah Rokh]], and the emirates of Candar and [[Karaman Emirate|Karaman]] in Anatolia.

====Kosovo, 1448====
{{See also|Battle of Kosovo (1448)}}
At 1448, John Hunyadi saw the right moment to lead a campaign against the Ottoman Empire. After the Defeat of Varna (1444), he raised another army to attack the Ottomans. His strategy based on possible revolt of Balkan people and the surprise attack, also the assumption to destroy the main force of the Ottomans in a single battle. Hunyadi was totally immodest and led his forces without leaving any escort behind.

Murad died in the winter 1450–1451 in [[Edirne]]. Some have it that he was wounded in a battle against [[Skanderbeg]]'s Albanian guerillas.

===Mehmed II (1451–1481)===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
{{Further2|the Sultan's personal information [[Mehmed II]]}}
[[File:OttomanEmpire1451.png|thumb|left|300px|The Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the second reign of Mehmed II.]]
[[Mehmed II]] (called ''Fatih'', the Conqueror) again came to the Ottoman throne following Murad's death in 1451. But by conquering and annexing the emirate of [[Karamanid]] (May–June, 1451) and by renewing the peace treaties with [[Venice]] (September 10) and Hungary (November 20) [[Mehmed II]] proved his skills both on the military and the political front and was soon accepted by the noble class of the Ottoman court.

Older and a good deal wiser, he made capturing Constantinople his first priority, believing that it would solidify his power over the high military and administrative officials who had caused him such problems during his earlier reign. Good reasons underlay his decision. So long as Constantinople remained in Christian hands, his enemies could use it as either a potential base for splitting the empire at its center or as an excuse for the Christian West's continued military efforts. Constantinople's location also made it the natural "middleman" center for both land and sea trade between the eastern Mediterranean and central Asia, possession of which would ensure immense wealth. Just as important, Constantinople was a fabled imperial city, and its capture and possession would bestow untold prestige on its conqueror, who would be seen by Muslims as a hero and by Muslims and Christians alike as a great and powerful emperor.

Mehmed spent two years preparing for his attempt on the Byzantine capital. He built a navy to cut the city off from outside help by sea; he purchased an arsenal of large cannons from the Hungarian gunsmith Urban; he sealed the Bosphorus north of the city by erecting a powerful fortress on its European shore to prevent succor arriving from the Black Sea; and he meticulously concentrated in Thrace every available military unit in his lands. A trade agreement with Venice prevented the Venetians from intervening on behalf of the Byzantines, and the rest of Western Europe unwittingly cooperated with Mehmed's plans by being totally absorbed in internecine wars and political rivalries.

====Constantinople, 1453====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
{{See also|Fall of Constantinople}}
When in 1451 the bankrupt Byzantines asked [[Mehmed II|Mehmed]] to double the tribute for holding an Ottoman pretender for the throne, he used the request as a pretext for annulling all treaties with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Nevertheless, when he proposed in 1452 to siege [[Constantinople]] most of the [[divan]], and especially the [[Grand Vizier]], [[Çandarlı Halil Pasha]], was against it and criticized the Sultan for being too rash and overconfident in his abilities. On April 15, 1452, [[Mehmed II|Mehmed]] ordered preparations to be made for the [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]].

In April 1453, [[Mehmed II|Mehmed]] laid siege to [[Constantinople]]. Although the city's defenders, led by [[Giovanni Giustiniani]] under Emperor [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]]'s (1448–53) authority, put up a heroic defense, without the benefit of outside aid their efforts were doomed. The formerly impregnable land walls were breached after two months of constant pounding by Mehmed's heavy artillery. In the predawn hours of 29 May 1453, [[Mehmed II|Mehmed]] ordered an all-out assault on the battered ramparts. After a brief but vicious melee at the walls in which [[Giovanni Giustiniani|Giustiniani]] was severely injured coupled with Ottoman troops breaching the walls through a sally port door left open, the Ottoman troops were able to breach the walls and rout the defenders.  According to Christian sources, Emperor Constantine died bravely rushing into the oncoming Ottoman troops not to be seen again.  However, according to Ottoman sources such as Tursun Beg he threw off his mantle and attempted to flee before being cut down by an injured Ottoman soldier.  The [[Ottoman Army]] broke through and swept over the city. [[Constantinople]], for a millennium considered by many Europeans the divinely ordained capital of the Christian Roman Empire, fell to Mehmed and was transformed into what many Muslims considered the divinely ordained capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. The fabled city's imperial legacy lived on. After the conquest, the sultan had his grand vizier [[Çandarlı Halil Pasha]] killed. His following four granviziers were of [[devshirme]] origin. During the growth of the Empire Turks seldom were appointed to the high positions.

&lt;br /&gt;
Following the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed built the [[Topkapı Palace]] in 1462 and moved the Ottoman capital there from Adrianople. Mehmed had himself titled "[[Kaiser-i-Rum]]", or "Roman Caesar", and modelled the state after the old Byzantine Empire, thinking of himself as the successor to the Roman throne. Later, when he invaded [[Otranto]], his goal was to capture Rome and reunite the [[Roman Empire]] for the first time since 751. Justinian's cathedral of Hagia Sophia was converted into an imperial mosque, as eventually were numerous other churches and monasteries. The rights of non-Muslim inhabitants were protected to ensure continuity and stability for commercial activities. Never fully recovered from the sack of 1204, and suffering from Byzantium's two centuries of near poverty, Constantinople by the time of Mehmed's conquest was but a hollow shell of its former self. Its population had dwindled, and much property was either abandoned or in a state of disrepair. The sultan immediately began to repopulate the city. Civic and private properties were offered to the public to entice much-needed skilled artisans, craftsmen, and traders of all religions and ethnicities back to the city. Newly conquered Constantinople rapidly grew into a multiethnic, multicultured, and bustling economic, political, and cultural center for the Ottoman state, whose distant frontiers guaranteed it peace, security, and prosperity.

'''Salomon Munk''' (14 May 1803 &amp;ndash; 5 February 1867) was a German-born Jewish-French [[oriental studies|Orientalist]].

==Biography==
Munk was born in [[Głogów|Gross Glogau]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. He received his first instruction in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from his father, an official of the Jewish community; and on the latter's death he joined the [[Talmud]] class of R. [[Jacob Joseph Oettinger]]. At the age of fourteen he was able to officiate as "[[Baal keriah|ba'al ḳoreh]]" (reader of the Torah) in the synagogue of the Malbish 'Arummim society at [[Gross Glogau]].

In 1820 he went to Berlin, where he came into friendly relations with [[Leopold Zunz]] and with the philologist [[August Wilhelm Zumpt|A. W. Zumpt]], studying [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] with [[Eduard Gans|E. Gans]]. Two years later he entered the [[Joachimsthaler Gymnasium]], supporting himself at the same time by tutoring. In 1824 he entered the [[University of Berlin]], attending the lectures of [[Böckh]], [[Hegel]], and especially of [[Bopp]].

As no Jews were at that time eligible for government positions in Prussia, Munk left the university without taking a degree, deciding to go to France. However, he first spent one term at the [[University of Bonn]], studying Arabic with [[Georg Freytag|Freytag]] and Sanskrit with [[Christian Lassen|Lassen]]. On passing through [[Weimar]] he visited [[Goethe]], who notes that fact in his journal.

In 1828 he went to Paris with the assistance of the young poet [[Michael Beer (poet)|Michael Beer]], the brother of [[Meyerbeer]]. Here also, as in Berlin, he at first supported himself by tutoring, among his pupils being the young brothers [[Alphonse James de Rothschild|Alphonse]] and [[Gustave de Rothschild]]. In 1838 he was appointed cataloguer of [[Hebrew]], [[Chaldaic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Arabic]] manuscripts in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] de Paris.

Munk now devoted himself to the study of the [[Judæo-Arabic]] literature of the Middle Ages and to the works of [[Maimonides]], more especially the latter's ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nebukim]]''. He went direct to the Arabic original, supplementing the texts he found at the Bibliothèque from texts he had copied at Oxford. At the same time he made a thorough study of [[Aristotle]], who is constantly quoted by [[Maimonides]]. In this way he gathered the necessary material for his edition of the Arabic text of the ''Moreh'', with translation and annotations, which he published in three large volumes, long after he had become blind (1856, 1861, 1866). He had lost his eyesight in 1850 while in the course of cataloguing the [[Sanskrit]] and Hebrew manuscripts in the possession of the library.

==Journey to Egypt==

Munk accompanied [[Moses Montefiore|Montefiore]] and [[Adolphe Crémieux|Crémieux]] to [[Egypt]] in connection with the [[Damascus affair]]; and it was due to his knowledge of Arabic (although some claim that the credit is due to [[Louis Loewe]]) that the word "justice" was substituted for "mercy" in the ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]] which exculpated the accused from the charge of [[ritual murder]]. It was also largely due to his efforts that schools modeled on European methods of instruction were established by the [[Egyptian Jews]].

At [[Cairo]] he purchased a considerable number of Arabic and Hebrew manuscripts on behalf of the Bibliothèque Nationale. On his return Munk was elected secretary of the Consistoire Central des Israélites de France; on December 3, 1858, he was elected a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]; and a few years later he was appointed professor of Hebrew at the [[Collège de France]], in succession to [[Ernest Renan|Renan]]. He died in Paris.

[[File:Palestine, by S Munk, Vilna 1913.jpg|thumb|''Palestine'', 1913.]]
* 1845: ''Palestine, Description Géographique, Historique et Archéologique," in "L'Univers Pittoresque''&amp;nbsp;;&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the name ''Palestine'', we comprehend the small country formerly inhabited by the Israelites, and which is today part of Acre and Damascus pachalics. It stretched between 31 and 33° N. latitude and between 32 and 35° degrees E. longitude, an area of about 1300 {{lang-fr|lieues carrées}}. Some zealous writers, to give the land of the Hebrews some political importance, have exaggerated the extent of Palestine; but we have an authority for us that one can not reject. St. Jerome, who had long traveled in this country, said in his letter to Dardanus (ep. 129) that the northern boundary to that of the southern, was a distance of 160 Roman miles, which is about 55 {{lang-fr|lieues}}. He paid homage to the truth despite his fears, as he said himself, of availing the ''Promised Land'' to pagan mockery, "{{lang|la|Pudet dicere latitudinem terrae repromissionis, ne ethnicis occasionem blasphemandi dedisse uideamur}}".&lt;ref name="1845.Palestine.French"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munk|first=Salomon|authorlink=Salomon Munk|title=Palestine: Description géographique, historique et archéologique|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02EOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA2|year=1845|publisher=F. Didot|language=French|pages=2–3|quote=Sous le nom de ''Palestine'', nous comprenons le petit pays habité autrefois par les Israélites, et qui aujourd'hui fait partie des pachalics d'Acre et de Damas. Il s'étendait entre le 31 et 33° degré latitude N. et entre le 32 et 35° degré longitude E., sur une superficie d'environ 1300 lieues carrées. Quelques écrivains jaloux de donner au pays des Hébreux une certaine importance politique, ont exagéré l'étendue de la Palestine; mais nous avons pour nous une autorité que l'on ne saurait récuser. Saint Jérôme, qui avait longtemps voyagé dans cette contrée, dit dans sa lettre à Dardanus (ep. 129) que de la limite du nord jusqu'à celle du midi il n'y avait qu'une distance de 160 milles romains, ce qui fait environ 55 lieues. Il rend cet hommage à la vérité bien qu'il craigne, comme il le dit lui-même de livrer par la ''terre promise'' aux sarcasmes païens. (Pudet dicere latitudinem terrae repromissionis, ne ethnicis occasionem blasphemandi dedisse uideamur)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1871.Palestine.German"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munk|first1=Salomon|authorlink1=Salomon Munk|last2=Levy|first2=Moritz A.|title=Palästina: geographische, historische und archäologische Beschreibung dieses Landes und kurze Geschichte seiner hebräischen und jüdischen Bewohner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbRUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1871|publisher=Leiner|language=German|page=1|quote=Image of [https://books.google.com/books?id=cbRUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U2MLoMg8Yr_dKHuR8w6rCrj_KYTMg&amp;ci=35%2C114%2C914%2C1320&amp;edge=0  p.&amp;nbsp;1] at Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Works==
Munk's works, apart from his edition of the ''Moreh'', include the following:

*"Reflexions sur le Culte des Anciens Hébreux," in vol. iv. of the Bible of [[S. Cahen]]
*"Notice sur R. Saadia Gaon et sur une Version Persane d'Isaie" (ib. vol. ix)
*"Palestine, Description Géographique, Historique et Archéologique," in "L'Univers Pittoresque," 1845 (translated into German by M. A. Levy, 1871–72) (Volume 4 of "L'Univers pittoresque ou histoire et description de tous les peuples, de leurs religions, moeurs, coutumes, industries: Asie")&lt;ref name="1845.Palestine.French" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1871.Palestine.German" /&gt;
*"Mélanges de Philosophie Juive et Arabe," 1859
*"Notice sur Abul Walid Merwan ibn Djanah et d'Autres Grammairiens Hébreux du X. et du XI. Siècle," 1850-51 (crowned by the Institut with the "Prix Volney")
*"Rapport sur les Progrès des Etudes Sémitiques en France de 1840-1866," in the "Recueil de Rapports" of the Exposition of 1867.

Between 1834 and 1838 he contributed to the ''Temps'' articles on Biblical, Hebrew, and Sanskrit literature. Mention must also be made of his interpretations of Phoenician inscriptions at Marseilles and on the sarcophagus of [[Eshmun'azar]], King of Sidon, which he deciphered after losing his sight; of his discovery of the Arabic manuscript of [[Al-Biruni]]'s description of India, written in the first part of the eleventh century; and of his letter to [[F. Arago]], of the Academy of Sciences, relating to a question on the history of astronomy, which gave rise to a controversy between [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] and [[Louis-Pierre-Eugène Sédillot|Sédillot]].

'''Shalfak''' (originally ''Waf-Chastiu'', "subduing the foreign lands")&lt;ref&gt;[[Toby Wilkinson]], The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-679-60429-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an ancient Egyptian fortress once built up on the western shore of the Second 
Cataract of the [[Nile#In Sudan|Nile River]]  and now an island in the [[Lake Nubia]] in the north of [[Sudan]]. Set up in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] under [[Senusret III]], it is one of a chain of 17 forts which the pharaohs of the [[12th dynasty]] established to secure their southern frontier during a time where the Egyptian influence was sought out to be expanded. And that is why ''Shalfak'' along with the forts of [[Buhen]], [[Mirgissa]], [[Uronarti]], [[Askut]], [[Dabenarti]], [[Semna (Nubia)|Semna]], and [[Kumma (Nubia)|Kumma]] were established within signaling distance of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discoversudan.de/en/sudan/locations/shalfak|title=Shalfak {{!}} Discover Sudan! Archaeological and Cultural Tours|website=discoversudan.de|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fortress occupies a roughly triangular area of about 1800m sq adapted to the available ground. Its massive mudbrick wall still stands up to 6 metres high and 8 meters thick. Three spur walls, towards the north, west and east, complete the fortification system. The eastern wall protects a stairway leading down to the river to ensure access to a water supply in the case of siege.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce B. Williams, Nubian Forts (1999), in: Encyclopedia of Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, {{ISBN|0-203-98283-5}}, pp.747-753.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal structures are very well preserved including a command building, barracks, workshops, storerooms and a granary arranged in a grid plan.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Fattowich, Towns Planned, in: Encyclopedia of Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, {{ISBN|0-203-98283-5}}, pp. 1083-1084.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations were conducted in February and March 1931 by team of the [[Harvard University]] and the [[Museum of Fine Arts Boston]] under Noel F. Wheeler. Since 2017 a team under Claudia Näser from [[University College London]] is excavating again.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Näser: ''Shalfak: a Middle Kingdom fortress in Lake Nubia'', in ''Egyptian Archaeology'' 52, Spring 2018, pp. 4-9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Publius''' (or '''Gaius''') '''Cornelius Tacitus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|s|ɪ|t|ə|s}}; {{IPA-la|ˈtakɪtʊs|classical}}; {{circa| 56}} – {{circa| 120 AD}}) was a [[Roman Senate|senator]] and a [[historian]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. The surviving portions of his two major works—the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]''—examine the reigns of the [[Roman emperor|emperors]] [[Tiberius]], [[Claudius]], [[Nero]], and those who reigned in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69 AD). These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of [[Augustus]], in 14 AD, to the years of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], in 70 AD. There are substantial [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in the surviving texts, including a gap in the ''Annals'' that is four books long.

Tacitus' other writings discuss [[Public speaking|oratory]] (in [[dialogue]] format, see ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''), [[Germania]] (in ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]''), and the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], the general responsible for much of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] of [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], mainly focusing on his campaign in [[Britannia]] (''[[De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'').

Tacitus is considered to be one of the greatest Roman historians.&lt;ref name=Voorst39&gt;{{cite book |author=Van Voorst, Robert E |date=2000 |title=Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence |publisher=Eerdmans Publishing |isbn=0-8028-4368-9 |pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Backgrounds of Early Christianity |author=Ferguson, Everett |date=2003 |isbn=0-8028-2221-5 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in what has been called the [[Silver Age of Latin literature]], and is known for the brevity and compactness of his [[Latin language|Latin]] prose, as well as for his penetrating insights into the psychology of power politics.

== Life ==
Details about his personal life are scarce. What little is known comes from scattered hints throughout his work, the letters of his friend and admirer [[Pliny the Younger]], and an inscription found at [[Mylasa]] in [[Caria]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Orientis Graeci Inscriptionis Selectae|OGIS]]'' 487, first brought to light in ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', 1890, pp. 621–623&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus was born in 56 or 57 to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family;&lt;ref&gt;Since he was appointed to the quaestorship during Titus's short rule (see [[#note-quaestor|note]] below) and twenty-five was the minimum age for the position, the date of his birth can be fixed with some accuracy&lt;/ref&gt; like many Latin authors of both the [[Golden Age of Latin Literature|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of Latin literature|Silver Ages]], he was from the provinces, probably northern [[Italy]] or [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. The exact place and date of his birth are not known, and his [[praenomen]] (first name) is also unknown; in the letters of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] his name is ''Gaius'', but in the major surviving manuscript of his work his name is given as ''Publius''.&lt;ref&gt;See Oliver, 1951, for an analysis of the manuscript from which the name Publius is taken; see also Oliver, 1977, which examines the evidence for each suggested praenomen (the well-known ''Gaius'' and ''Publius'', the lesser-known suggestions of ''Sextus'' and ''Quintus'') before settling on ''Publius'' as the most likely.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar's suggestion of ''Sextus'' has gained no approval.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, 1977, cites an article by [[Harold Mattingly]] in ''Rivista storica dell'Antichità'', 2 (1972) 169–185&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family and early life ===
[[File:REmpire-04 Gallia Narbonensis.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Tacitus was probably born in [[Gallia Narbonensis]].]]
Most of the older [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families failed to survive the [[proscription]]s which took place at the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and Tacitus makes it clear that he owed his rank to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] emperors (''Hist.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]). The claim that he was descended from a [[freedman]] is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen (''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.27 13.27]), but this is generally disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, pp. 612–613; Gordon, 1936, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

His father may have been the Cornelius Tacitus who served as [[Promagistrate|procurator]] of [[Belgica]] and [[Germania]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions that Cornelius had a son who aged rapidly ([[Pliny's Natural History|NH]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/7*.html 7.76]), which implies an early death. There is no mention of Tacitus suffering such a condition, but it is possible that this refers to a brother—if Cornelius was indeed his father.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, p. 60, 613; Gordon, 1936, p. 149; Martin, 1981, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship between the younger Pliny and Tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of his birth remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest [[Gallia Belgica]], Gallia Narbonensis or [[Northern Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant in Introduction to Tacitus, ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', p. xvii; Herbert W. Benario in Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] in the ''Dialogus'' may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, pp. 614–616&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint that the two men had a common background.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, pp. 616–619&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he was asked if he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was asked if he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, p. 619; Gordon, 1936, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

His ancestry, his skill in oratory, and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted Roman rule (e.g., ''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.9 2.9]) have led some to suggest that he was a [[Celts|Celt]].  This belief stems from the fact that the Celts who had occupied Gaul prior to the Roman invasion were famous for their skill in oratory, and had been subjugated by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 1936, pp. 150–151; Syme, 1958, pp. 621–624&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public life, marriage, and literary career ===
As a young man, Tacitus studied [[rhetoric]] in Rome to prepare for a career in [[law]] and [[politics]]; like Pliny, he may have studied under [[Quintilian]]&lt;ref&gt;The fact that he studied rhetoric and law is known from the ''Dialogus'', ch. 2; see also Martin, 1981, p. 26; Syme, 1958, pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; ({{circa|35 AD}} – {{circa|100}}).&lt;!---The precedent is established in 1st paragraph, so BC/AD should be retained throughout---&gt; In 77 or 78, he married [[Julia Agricola]], daughter of the famous general Agricola.&lt;ref&gt;''Agricola'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+9 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of their domestic life, save that Tacitus loved [[hunting]] and the outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Letters'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny1.html#6 1.6], [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny9.html#10 9.10]; Benario, 1975, pp. 15, 17; Syme, 1958, pp. 541–542&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career (probably the ''[[latus clavus]]'', mark of the senator)&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 1958, p. 63; Martin, 1981, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Vespasian]]&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1])&lt;/ref&gt; (reigned 69–79), but entered political life as a [[quaestor]] in 81 or 82 under [[Titus]].&lt;ref name=quaestor&gt;He states his debt to Titus in his ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]); since Titus ruled only briefly, these are the only years possible.&lt;/ref&gt; He advanced steadily through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', becoming [[praetor]] in 88 and a [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]], a member of the priestly college in charge of the [[Sibylline Books]] and the [[Secular games]].&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+11.11 11.11]), he mentions that, as praetor, he assisted in the Secular Games held by Domitian, which can be precisely dated to 88. See Syme, 1958, p. 65; Martin, 1981, p. 27; Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained acclaim as a lawyer and as an [[orator]]; his skill in public speaking ironically counterpoints his ''[[cognomen]]'' ''Tacitus'' ("silent").

He served in the provinces from {{circa|89}} to {{circa|93}}, either in command of a [[Roman legion|legion]] or in a civilian post.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Agricola'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+45 45.5]) indicates that Tacitus and his wife were absent at the time of Julius Agricola's death in 93. For his occupation during this time see Syme, 1958, p. 68; Benario, 1975, p. 13; Dudley, 1968, pp. 15–16; Martin, 1981, p. 28; Mellor, 1993, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He and his property survived [[Domitian]]'s reign of terror (81–96), but the experience left him jaded and perhaps ashamed at his own complicity, giving him the hatred of [[tyranny]] evident in his works.&lt;ref&gt;For the effects on Tacitus of this experience see Dudley, 1968, p. 14; Mellor, 1993, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Agricola'', chs. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+44 44]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+45 45], is illustrative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Agricola was spared those later years during which Domitian, leaving now no interval or breathing space of time, but, as it were, with one continuous blow, drained the life-blood of the Commonwealth... It was not long before our hands dragged [[Helvidius Priscus|Helvidius]] to prison, before we gazed on the dying looks of [[Junius Mauricus|Mauricus]] and [[Arulenus Rusticus|Rusticus]], before we were steeped in [[Herennius Senecio|Senecio]]'s innocent blood. Even [[Nero]] turned his eyes away, and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered; with Domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen, to know that our sighs were being recorded...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From his seat in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], he became [[suffect consul]] in 97 during the reign of [[Nerva]], being the [[novus homo|first of his family]] to do so. During his tenure, he reached the height of his fame as an orator when he delivered the funeral oration for the famous veteran soldier [[Lucius Verginius Rufus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Letters'', [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/Pliny/Pliny02-01-L.html 2.1] [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/Pliny/Pliny02-01-E.html (English)];
Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, he wrote and published the ''Agricola'' and ''Germania'', foreshadowing the literary endeavors that would occupy him until his death.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Agricola'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+3 3]), he announces what was probably his first major project: the ''Histories''. See Dudley, 1968, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he absented himself from public life, but returned during [[Trajan]]'s reign (98–117). In 100, he and his friend Pliny the Younger prosecuted {{ill|Marius Priscus|la}} ([[proconsul]] of Africa) for corruption. Priscus was found guilty and sent into exile; Pliny wrote a few days later that Tacitus had spoken "with all the majesty which characterizes his usual style of oratory".&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Letters'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny2.html#11 2.11]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lengthy absence from politics and law followed while he wrote the ''Histories'' and the ''Annals''. In 112 to 113, he held the highest civilian governorship, that of the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|''Asia'']] in Western [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref name="Hazel 2002 p. 297"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hazel |first=J. |title=Who's who in the Roman World |publisher=Routledge |series=Routledge who's who series |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-415-29162-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfkd6fy_zb8C&amp;pg=PA297 |access-date=28 August 2018 |page=297 |quote=Seniority brought him the governorship of the province of Asia as proconsul in 112-13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in the inscription found at Mylasa mentioned above. A passage in the ''Annals'' fixes 116 as the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' of his death, which may have been as late as 125 or even 130. It seems that he survived both Pliny (died {{circa|113}}) and Trajan (died 117).&lt;ref&gt;Grant in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Annals'', p. xvii; Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germania'', p. 2. ''Annals'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.61 2.61], says that the Roman Empire "now extends to the [[Red Sea]]". If by ''mare rubrum'' he means the [[Persian Gulf]], the passage must have been written after Trajan's eastern conquests in 116, but before [[Hadrian]] abandoned the new territories in 117. But this may only indicate the date of publication for the first books of the ''Annals''; Tacitus could have lived well into Hadrian's reign, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not. See Dudley, 1968, p. 17; Mellor, 1993, p. 9; Mendell, 1957, p. 7; Syme, 1958, p. 473; against this traditional interpretation, e.g., Goodyear, 1981, pp. 387–393.&lt;/ref&gt;
It remains unknown whether Tacitus had any children. The ''[[Augustan History]]'' reports that Emperor [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] (reigned 275–276) claimed him for an ancestor and provided for the preservation of his works, but this story may be fraudulent, like much of the ''Augustan History''.&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tacitus*.html ''Tacitus'' X]. Scholarly opinion on this story is that it is either "a confused and worthless rumor" (Mendell, 1957, p. 4) or "pure fiction" (Syme, 1958, p. 796). [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] reports (''Letters'', 4.14; cited in Syme, 1958, p. 796) that [[Polemius]], a 5th-century [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, is descended from Tacitus—but this claim, says Syme (ibid.), is of little value.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
{{See also|List of persons mentioned in the works of Tacitus}}

[[File:Lipsius manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of [[Justus Lipsius]]'s 1598 edition of the complete works of Tacitus, bearing the stamps of the ''Bibliotheca Comunale'' in [[Empoli]], [[Italy]].]]

Five works ascribed to Tacitus have survived (albeit with lacunae), the most substantial of which are the ''Annals'' and the ''Histories''. This canon (with approximate dates) consists of:
* (98) ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita Iulii Agricolae]]'' (''The Life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]'')
* (98) ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' (''Germania'')
* (102) ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' (''Dialogue on Oratory'')
* (105) ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'' (''Histories'')
* (117) ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ab excessu divi Augusti]]'' (''Annals'')

=== History of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus ===
The ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', published separately, were meant to form a single edition of thirty books.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]]'s commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]] (14.1, 2; quoted in Mendell, 1957, p. 228) says that Tacitus's history was extant ''triginta voluminibus'', "in thirty volumes".&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Tacitus wrote the ''Histories'' before the ''Annals'', the events in the ''Annals'' precede the ''Histories''; together they form a continuous narrative from the death of [[Augustus]] (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the Annals survived in a single copy of a manuscript from [[Corvey Abbey]], and the second half from a single copy of a manuscript from [[Monte Cassino]], and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.

==== The ''Histories'' ====
{{Main|Histories (Tacitus)}}
In an early chapter of the ''Agricola'', Tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In the ''Histories'' the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] and end with the despotism of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavians]]. Only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book contains—as a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]—a short [[ethnography|ethnographic]] survey of the ancient [[Jew]]s, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.

==== The ''Annals'' ====
{{Main|Annals (Tacitus)}}
The ''Annals'', Tacitus' final work, covers the period from the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7–10 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of [[Tiberius]] and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the ''Histories''. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the [[Roman Empire]], with which he had planned to finish his work. The ''Annals'' is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention [[Christ]], which Tacitus does in connection with [[Nero#First persecutor|Nero's persecution of the Christians]].
[[File:MII.png|thumb|''Annals'' 15.44, in the second Medicean manuscript]]

=== Monographs ===
Tacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. ''Agricola'', a biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola; the ''Germania'', a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the ''Dialogus'', a dialogue on the art of rhetoric.

==== ''Germania'' ====
{{Main|Germania (book)}}

The ''Germania'' ([[Latin]] title: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum'') is an ethnographic work on the [[Germanic tribe]]s outside the Roman Empire. The ''Germania'' fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. The book begins (chapters 1–27) with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], such as the [[Fenni]]. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his ''Agricola'' (chapters 10––13).

==== ''Agricola'' (''De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae'') ====
{{Main|Agricola (book)}}
The ''Agricola'' (written {{circa|98}}) recounts the life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola, an eminent Roman general and Tacitus' father-in-law; it also covers, briefly, the geography and ethnography of ancient [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. As in the ''Germania'', Tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] with the tyranny and corruption of the Empire; the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of Rome, one of which, that Tacitus claims is from a speech by [[Calgacus]], ends by asserting that ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. —Oxford Revised Translation).

==== ''Dialogus'' ====

{{Main|Dialogus de oratoribus}}

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The style of the ''Dialogus'' follows Cicero's models for Latin rhetoric.]]
There is uncertainty about when Tacitus wrote ''Dialogus de oratoribus''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned. It is likely to be early work, indebted to the author's rhetorical training, since its style imitates that of the foremost Roman orator [[Cicero]]. It lacks (for example) the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works. The ''Dialogus'' is dedicated to Fabius Iustus, a consul in 102 AD.

== Sources ==
Tacitus makes use of the official sources of the Roman state: the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the sessions of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital). He also read collections of emperors' speeches, such as those of Tiberius and Claudius. He is generally seen{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources. The minor inaccuracies in the ''Annals'' may be due to Tacitus dying before he had finished (and therefore before he had proof-read) his work.

Tacitus cites some of his sources directly, among them [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Pliny the Elder, who had written ''Bella Germaniae'' and a historical work which was the continuation of that of [[Aufidius Bassus]]. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (''epistolarium''). He also took information from ''exitus illustrium virorum''. These were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the [[Stoicism |Stoic]] theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example [[Cremutius Cordus]]' speech in ''Ann.'' IV, 34–35.

== Literary style ==
Tacitus's writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as [[Plutarch]]. When he writes about a near-defeat of the Roman army in ''Ann.'' I, 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment.

In most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order, only seldom outlining the bigger picture, leaving the readers to construct that picture for themselves. Nonetheless, where he does use broad strokes, for example, in the opening paragraphs of the ''Annals'', he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story.

=== Approach to history ===
Tacitus's historical style owes some debt to [[Sallust]]. His historiography offers penetrating—often pessimistic—insights into the psychology of power politics, blending straightforward descriptions of events, moral lessons, and tightly focused dramatic accounts. Tacitus's own declaration regarding his approach to history (''Annals'' I,1) is well known:
:{|-
| "inde consilium mihi ... tradere ... sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo."
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''my purpose is to relate ... without either anger or zeal, motives from which I am far removed.''
|}
There has been much scholarly discussion about Tacitus' "neutrality". Throughout his writing, he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the Senate and the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]], and the increasing corruption of the governing [[social class|classes]] of Rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire. In Tacitus's view, Senators squandered their cultural inheritance—that of [[free speech]]—to placate their (rarely benign) emperor.

Tacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies. The Julio-Claudians eventually gave way to generals, who followed Julius Caesar (and Sulla and Pompey) in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in Rome.(''Hist.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.4 1.4])

&lt;blockquote&gt;Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tacitus's political career was largely lived out under the emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and [[decadence]] of that era (81–96) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. He draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the [[apathy]] and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire.

Nonetheless, the image he builds of Tiberius throughout the first six books of the ''Annals'' is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly ''positive'' in the first books, and predominantly ''negative'' after the intrigues of [[Sejanus]]. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the [[hypocrisy]] of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.

In general, Tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person, often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's hallmarks is refraining from ''conclusively'' taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see [[Tacitean studies]], ''Black'' vs. ''Red'' Tacitists).

=== Prose ===
His Latin style is highly praised.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Dudley. Introduction to: ''The Annals of Tacitus''. NY: Mentor Book, 1966. p. xiv: "No other writer of Latin prose—not even Cicero—deploys so effectively the full resources of the language."&lt;/ref&gt; His style, although it has a grandeur and eloquence (thanks to Tacitus's education in rhetoric), is extremely concise, even [[epigram]]matic—the sentences are rarely flowing or beautiful, but their point is always clear. The style has been both derided as "harsh, unpleasant, and thorny" and praised as "grave, concise, and pithily eloquent".

A passage of [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|''Annals'' 1.1]], where Tacitus laments the state of the historiography regarding the four last [[Roman Emperor (Principate)#Julio-Claudian dynasty|emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty]], illustrates his style: "The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred",&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_1&amp;oldid=3754977#1 The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1] Translation based on Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb (1876). [[Wikisource]], 15 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or in a word-by-word translation:
:{|-

Compared to the [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Golden Age|Ciceronian period]], where sentences were usually the length of a paragraph and artfully constructed with nested pairs of carefully matched sonorous phrases, this is short and to the point.  But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying ''and'' in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending "…-entibus …-is" are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions—which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;98–9 where the quoted example is used; Further quotes from the book: "…some writers—notably the perverse genius Tacitus—delighted in disappointing the expectations raised by periodic theory." – "this monkeying with hard-won stylistic norms…only makes sense if readers knew the rules that Tacitus was breaking."&lt;/ref&gt;

His historical works focus on the motives of the characters, often with penetrating insight—though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct, and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill.&lt;ref&gt;John Taylor. ''Tacitus and the Boudican Revolt''. Dublin: Camvlos, 1998. p. 1 ff&lt;/ref&gt; He is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and dissimulation; for example, he follows a narrative recounting Tiberius's refusal of the title ''pater patriae'' by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any "treasonous" speech or writings—and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted (''Annals'', 1.72). Elsewhere (''Annals'' 4.64–66) he compares Tiberius's public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun. Although this kind of insight has earned him praise, he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context.

Tacitus owes most, both in language and in method, to Sallust, and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style.

== Studies and reception history ==

From Pliny the Younger's [http://thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep7.html 7th Letter (to Tacitus)], §&amp;nbsp;33:

The historian was not much read in late antiquity, and even less in the Middle Ages. Only a third of his known work has survived; we depend on a single manuscript for books I–VI of the ''Annales'' and on another one for the other surviving half (books XI–XVI) and for the five books extant of the ''Historiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael, ''Latin Literature: an anthology'', Penguin Classics, London, 1978 p.378f&lt;/ref&gt; His antipathy towards the Jews and Christians of his time—he records with unemotional contempt the sufferings of the Christians at Rome during Nero's persecution—made him unpopular in the Middle Ages. He was rediscovered, however, by the Renaissance, whose writers were impressed with his dramatic presentation of the Imperial age.

Tacitus has been described as "the greatest historian that the Roman world produced."&lt;ref&gt;Mellor 2010, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] opines that he "ranks beyond dispute in the highest place among men of letters of all ages." His work has been read for its moral instruction, for its dramatic narrative, and for its prose style.&lt;ref name="Mellor1995pxvii"&gt;Mellor, 1995, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the field of history, Tacitus' influence is most prominent in the area of political theory.&lt;ref name="Mellor1995pxvii" /&gt; The political lessons taken from his work fall roughly into two camps, as identified by [[Giuseppe Toffanin]]: the "red Tacitists" use him to support [[republicanism|republican]] ideals, and the "black Tacitists" read him as a lesson in [[Machiavellian]] ''[[realpolitik]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, 1969, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his work is our most reliable source for the history of his era, its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned. The ''Annals'' are based in part on secondary sources, and there are some obvious mistakes, for instance the confusion of the two daughters of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]], who are both called [[Antonia (name)|Antonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius makes an occasional slip as well.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Histories'', however, are written from [[primary source|primary documents]] and intimate knowledge of the Flavian period, and are therefore thought to be more accurate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Thomas Messingham''' was an Irish [[hagiologist]], born in the [[Diocese of Meath]]. He studied in the [[Irish College, Paris]], proceeding to the degree of S.T.D. Among the [[Franciscan]] Manuscripts in Dublin is an interesting tract sent by [[David Rothe]], Vice-Primate of All Ireland, addressed to my "loving friend Mr. Thomas Messingham at his chambers in Paris", dated 1615. It is evident that at this date Messingham was one of the staff of the Irish College in that city, and was commencing his studies on Irish saints. 

In 1620 he published Offices of Saints Patrick, Brigid, Columba, and other Irish saints; and in the following year was appointed rector of the Irish College, Paris, in succession to his friend and diocesan, Thomas Dease, who was promoted to the Bishopric of Meath, on 5 May 1621. Messingham was honoured by the [[Holy See]], and was raised to the dignity of [[prothonotary]] Apostolic, and acted as agent for many of the Irish bishops. As well as seeking materials with a view to an ecclesiastical history of Ireland, Messingham was rector of the Irish College, and organized the course of studies with a view of sending forth capable missionaries to work in their native country. He got the college affiliated formally to the [[University of Paris]], and, in 1626, got the approbation of the [[Archbishop of Paris]] for the rules he had drawn up for the government of the Irish seminary. 

In 1624 he published, in Paris, his famous work on Irish saints, ''Florilegium Insulæ Sanctorum'', containing also a treatise on [[St Patrick's Purgatory|St. Patrick's Purgatory]], in [[Lough Derg (Ulster)|Lough Derg]]. In the same year he was appointed by the Holy See to the Deanery of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]], in succession to Henry Byrne, but this position was merely honorary, inasmuch as all the temporalities were enjoyed by the Protestant dean, by patent from the Crown. Messingham had a lengthy correspondence with Father [[Luke Wadding]], O.F.M., and was frequently consulted by the Roman authorities in the matter of selecting suitable ecclesiastics to fill the vacant Irish sees.  On 15 July 1630, he wrote to Wadding that he feared it was in vain to hope for any indulgences in religious disabilities from King Charles I. Between the years 1632 and 1638 he laboured for the Irish Church in various capacities, but his name disappears after the latter year, whence we may conclude that he either resigned or died in 1638.

'''Victorian architecture''' is a series of [[architectural style|architectural revival styles]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. ''Victorian'' refers to the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] (1837–1901), called the [[Victorian era]], during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction. However, many elements of what is typically termed "Victorian" architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria's reign. The styles often included interpretations and [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] revivals of historic styles. The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it followed [[Georgian architecture]] and later [[Regency architecture]], and was succeeded by [[Edwardian architecture]].

==Victorian architecture in the United Kingdom==

During the early 19th century, the romantic [[medieval]] [[Gothic revival]] style was developed as a reaction to the [[symmetry]] of [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]], and such buildings as [[Fonthill Abbey]] were built. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new [[technology]], construction was able to incorporate [[steel]] as a building component; one of the greatest exponents of this was [[Joseph Paxton]], architect of [[the Crystal Palace]]. Paxton also continued to build such houses as [[Mentmore Towers]], in the still popular [[English Renaissance]] styles. New methods of construction were developed in this era of prosperity, but ironically the architectural styles, as developed by such architects as [[Augustus Pugin]], were typically retrospective.

In [[Scotland]], the architect [[Alexander Thomson]] who practiced in [[Glasgow]] was a pioneer of the use of [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] for commercial buildings, blending neo-classical conventionality with Egyptian and oriental themes to produce many truly original structures. Other notable Scottish architects of this period are [[Archibald Simpson]] and [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] whose stylistically varied work can be seen in the [[architecture of Aberdeen]].

While Scottish architects pioneered this style it soon spread right across the United Kingdom and remained popular for another 40 years. Its architectural value in preserving and reinventing the past is significant. Its influences were diverse but the Scottish architects who practiced it were inspired by unique ways to blend architecture, purpose, and everyday life in a meaningful way.

===Other styles popularised during the period===

While not uniquely Victorian, and part of revivals that began before the era, these styles are strongly associated with the 19th century owing to the large number of examples that were erected during that period. Victorian architecture usually has many intricate window frames inspired by the famous architect Elliot Rae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howoldismyhouse.co.uk/windows.html|title=Old Windows|website=howoldismyhouse.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522151729/http://howoldismyhouse.co.uk/windows.html|archivedate=2016-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International spread of Victorian styles==
[[File:China Merchants Bank Building, Shanghai.JPG|thumb|The [[China Merchants Bank Building, Shanghai|China Merchants Bank Building]] is an example of Victorian architecture found in Shanghai, China]]
During the 18th century, a few English architects emigrated to the colonies, but as the [[British Empire]] became firmly established during the 19th century, many architects emigrated at the start of their careers. Some chose the United States, and others went to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Normally, they applied architectural styles that were fashionable when they left England. By the latter half of the century, however, improving transport and communications meant that even remote parts of the Empire had access to publications such as the magazine ''[[The Builder]]'', which helped colonial architects keep informed about current fashion. Thus, the influence of English architecture spread across the world. Several prominent architects produced English-derived designs around the world, including [[William Butterfield]] ([[St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide]]) and [[Jacob Wrey Mould]] (Chief Architect of Public Works in [[New York City]]).

The Victorian period flourished in Australia and is generally recognised as being from 1840 to 1890, which saw a [[gold rush]] and population boom during the 1880s in the state of Victoria. There were fifteen styles that predominated:{{sfn|Apperly|Irving|Reynolds|1994|pp=40-97}}

In the United States, 'Victorian' architecture generally describes styles that were most popular between 1860 and 1900. A list of these styles most commonly includes [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] (1855–85), [[Stick-Eastlake]] (1860–ca. 1890), [[Folk Victorian]] (1870-1910), [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] (1880–1910), [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] (1880–1900), and [[Shingle Style architecture|Shingle]] (1880–1900). As in the United Kingdom, examples of Gothic Revival and Italianate continued to be constructed during this period, and are therefore sometimes called Victorian. Some historians classify the later years of Gothic Revival as a distinctive Victorian style named High Victorian Gothic. [[Stick-Eastlake]], a manner of geometric, machine-cut decorating derived from Stick and Queen Anne, is sometimes considered a distinct style. On the other hand, terms such as "[[Painted Ladies]]" or "gingerbread" may be used to describe certain Victorian buildings, but do not constitute a specific style. The names of architectural styles (as well as their adaptations) varied between countries. Many homes combined the elements of several different styles and are not easily distinguishable as one particular style or another.

In the United States of America, notable cities which developed or were rebuilt largely during this era include [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Deal, New Jersey|Deal]], [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], the [[Brooklyn Heights]] and [[Victorian Flatbush]] sections of New York City, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Chicago]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Detroit]], [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Jersey City]]/[[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Atlanta]], [[Milwaukee]], [[New Orleans]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Midtown Sacramento|Midtown]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Angelino Heights, Los Angeles|Angelino Heights]] and [[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. San Francisco is well known for its extensive Victorian architecture, particularly in the [[Haight-Ashbury]], [[Lower Haight]], [[Alamo Square]], [[Noe Valley]], [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro]], [[Nob Hill]], and [[Pacific Heights]] neighborhoods.

The extent to which any one is the "largest surviving example" is debated, with numerous qualifications.

==Preservation==
Efforts to preserve landmarks of Victorian architecture are ongoing and are often led by the [[Victorian Society]]. A recent campaign the group has taken on is the preservation of Victorian [[Gas holder|gasometers]] after utility companies announced plans to demolish nearly 200 of the now-outdated structures.&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Hagan, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/14/gasometers-gas-holders-hold-on-for-a-new-life-repurposing Gasworks wonders…] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923084931/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/14/gasometers-gas-holders-hold-on-for-a-new-life-repurposing |date=2016-09-23 }}, The Guardian, 14 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002 he was elected [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Klaipėda University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://istorija.vdu.lt/lnik/klaipedosunivers/zulkus.htm|publisher=National Historical Committee of Lithuania|title=Vardas, pavardė :  Vladas Žulkus|accessdate=2010-03-01|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Žulkus started his career as an archaeologist in the Institute for Monument Preservation in [[Klaipėda]]. From 1969 till 1990 he was fellowship of the institute (from 1979 in position of head of archaeologists group) and investigated mainly the old town and the castle ruin in Klaipėda. In 1988, after studying in Institute of Archaeology of the [[USSR]] Academy of Sciences, he defended his doctoral thesis on Klaipėda and the region in the 11th - 17th centuries. In 1990 Žulkus became a director of the History Museum of [[Lithuania Minor]]. Two years later together with [[Alvydas Nikžentaitis]] he founded Centre of History of Western Lithuania and Prussia (from 2003 - [[BRIAI|Institute of Baltic Sea Region History and Archaeology]]) and Historical Department at Klaipėda University. In 1993-1997 and in 2001-2002 Žulkus was director of aforesaid Centre and worked in [[Klaipėda University]] as a lector, from 1995 - associated professor, and from 2001 - professor. He originated the [[underwater archaeology]] research in [[Lithuania]] and in 1999 defended his habilitated doctoral thesis on the role of [[Curonians]] in the culture and society of Western [[Balts]] in the [[Iron Age]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">'''Walter of Guisborough'''&lt;ref&gt;Walter of Gisburn, Walterus Gisburnensis. Previously known to scholars as '''Walter of Hemingburgh''' ([[John Bale]] seems to have been the first to call him that).&lt;br&gt;Sometimes known erroneously as Walter Hemingford, [[Latin]] chronicler of the 14th century.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[canon regular]] of the [[Augustinian]] [[Gisborough Priory]], [[Yorkshire]] and English chronicler of the fourteenth century.

==The Chronicle of Walter of Guisborough==
His chronicle, The Chronicle of Walter of Guisborough (previously edited as the Chronicle of Walter of Hemingford or Hemingburgh),&lt;ref name="chronicle of Walter of Guisborough 1957"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite book |author=Walter of Guisborough |year=1957 |origyear=circa 1312 |editor1-last=Rothwell |editor1-first=Harry |title=The chronicle of Walter of Guisborough (previously edited as the chronicle of Walter of Hemingford or Hemingburgh) |location=London, UK |publisher=[[Royal Historical Society|Offices of the (Royal Historical) Society]] |url=https://www.questia.com/library/100082702/the-chronicle-of-walter-of-guisborough-previously |lccn=58002258 |oclc=565894356 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; embraces the period of English history from [[Norman conquest|the Conquest]] (1066) to the nineteenth year of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], with the exception of the years 1316-1326. It ends with the title of a chapter in which it was proposed to describe the [[battle of Crécy]] (1346); but the chronicler seems to have died before the required information reached him. There is, however, some controversy as to whether the later portions which are lacking in some of the manuscripts are by him.

In compiling the first part, he apparently used the histories of [[Eadmer]], [[Roger of Hoveden]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[William of Newburgh]]; but the reigns of the three Edwards are original, composed from personal observation and information. There are several manuscripts of the history extant, the best perhaps being that presented to the [[College of Arms]] by the [[Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Hemingburgh, Walter of |volume=13 |page=258 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is correct and judicious, and written in a pleasing style. One of its special features is the preservation in its pages of copies of the great charters, and its versions have more than once supplied deficiencies and cleared up obscurities in copies from other sources.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The first three books were published by [[Thomas Gale]] in 1687, in his ''Historiae Anglicanae scriptores quinque'', and the remainder by [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]] in 1731. The first portion was again published in 1848 by the [[English Historical Society]], under the title ''Chronicon Walteri de Hemingburgh, vulgo Hemingford nuncupati, de gestis regum Angliae'', edited by H. C. Hamilton.

==Etymology==
'Wuhan' is derived from the [[pinyin|pinyin romanization]] of the [[Standard Mandarin]] pronunciation of the name of the city '{{zh|s={{linktext|武汉}} |labels=no}}' (Wǔhàn). The Chinese '{{lang|zh-hans|武汉}}' (Wuhan) is a portmanteau: The 'Wu' ({{zh|c={{linktext|武}} |labels=no}}) in 'Wuhan' is derived from the 'Wu' in ''''Wu'''chang' ({{lang|zh|武昌}}) (literally ''prospering military'', regarding its [[logistics]] role of the [[military base]]s established before the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]). Wuchang was the name given to the area in AD 221 when warlord [[Sun Quan]] moved the capital of [[Eastern Wu]] to [[È]] county (in present-day [[Ezhou]] City), and renamed È to Wuchang. The 'han' ({{zh|t={{linktext|漢}} |s={{linktext|汉}} |links=no |first=t}}) in 'Wuhan' comes from the 'Han' in ''''Han'''kou' ({{lang|zh-hant|漢口}}), which literally means "[[river mouth|Mouth]] of the Han", from its position at the confluence of the [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Han]] with the [[Yangtze River]]. In 1926, the [[Northern Expedition]] reached the Wuhan area and decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927,&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:武汉市历史沿革|url=http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/hb/15225.html|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=6 April 2018|website=行政区划网站xzqh.org|quote={{lang|zh-hans|1927年1月1日，中央临时联席会议宣布，国民政府在汉口开始办公。国民政府命令将武昌、汉口、汉阳三镇合为京兆区，定名“武汉”，作为临时首都。4月16日，武汉市政委员会成立，武昌市政厅撤销；三镇首次统一行政建制。}} |language=zh-hans|publisher=行政区划网站xzqh.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting city was proclaimed as '{{zh|t={{linktext|武漢}}|labels=no}}' (Wuhan), which was later [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]] as '{{lang|zh-hans|武汉}}' (Wuhan).&lt;ref name="历史沿革"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jianghan.gov.cn/zoujinjianghan/lsyg/201202/t20120214_41133.html|script-title=zh:历史沿革| accessdate=March 21, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625224752/http://www.jianghan.gov.cn/zoujinjianghan/lsyg/201202/t20120214_41133.html| archivedate=June 25, 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="江汉综述"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whfz.gov.cn:8080/pub/dqwx/qnj/jhnj07/content.htm |script-title=zh:江汉综述 | accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="“武汉”的由来"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whdaj.gov.cn/jcfm/zg-01.htm |script-title=zh:"武汉"的由来 | accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Wuhan}}
&lt;!--Eventually, the [[Timeline of Wuhan]] should be created and linked here with {{See also|Timeline of Wuhan}} --&gt;

===Antiquity===
&lt;!--A better picture related to Panlongcheng like an artifact would be nice--&gt;
[[File:Erligang map.svg|thumb|Panlongcheng, located in the southernmost area of the Erligang culture|left]]
With a 3,500-year-long history, Wuhan is one of the most ancient and populated metropolitan cities in China. [[Panlongcheng]], an archaeological site primarily associated with the [[Erligang culture]] (c. 1510 – c. 1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou period]]), is located in modern-day [[Huangpi District]]. During the [[Western Zhou]], the [[E (state)|State of E]] controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] for the rest of the Western Zhou and [[Eastern Zhou]] periods. &lt;!-- This claim needs documentation- I've seen it on a bunch of threads but I haven't seen good proof------After the [[State of Huang]] was conquered by State of Chu in the summer of 648 BC,&lt;ref&gt;《左传·僖公十二年》：“黄人恃诸侯之睦于齐也，不共楚职，曰：“自郢及我九百里，焉能害我？” 夏，楚灭黄。”&lt;/ref&gt; the people of Huang were moved into the area in and around present-day Wuhan. Local geographical terms including the name of Wuhan's Huangpi District were named after the State of Huang.--&gt;

===Early Imperial China===
During the [[Han dynasty]], Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The [[Battle of Xiakou]] in AD 203 and [[Battle of Jiangxia]] five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day [[Xinzhou District, Wuhan|Xinzhou District]] in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in [[Chinese history]] and a central event in the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''—the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]—took place in the vicinity of the cliffs near Wuhan.&lt;ref&gt;"The engagement at the Red Cliffs took place in the winter of the 13th year of Jian'an, probably about the end of 208."{{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the [[Yellow Crane Tower]], one of the [[Four Great Towers of China]], was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of [[Sun Quan]], leader of the [[Eastern Wu]]. The tower become a sacred site of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Images of the Immortal: The Cult of [[Lü Dongbin]] at the Palace of Eternal Joy by Paul R. Katz, University of Hawaii Press, 1999, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Xia Yong - Huang He Lou.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Yellow Crane Tower]] (Yuan dynasty)|left]]
Due to tensions between the [[Eastern Wu]] and [[Cao Wei]] states, in the autumn of 228,{{efn|name=fn1|Man Chong's biography in the ''Sanguozhi'' mentioned that these events took place in the 3rd year of the Taihe era (227–233) of Cao Rui's reign, i.e., the year 229. This is a mistake. It was actually in the 2nd year of the Taihe era, i.e., the year 228, according to the ''Zizhi Tongjian''.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Cao Rui]], grandson of [[Cao Cao]] and the second emperor of the state of [[Cao Wei]], ordered the general [[Man Chong]] to lead troops to Xiakou ({{lang|zh|夏口}}; in present-day Wuhan).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/06dat/geo.html#wuhan Hanyang was founded during the Sui dynasty (581-618); and Hankou, then known as Hsia-k'ou, during the Song (Sung) dynasty (960-1279).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(秋，使曹休從廬江南入合肥，令寵向夏口。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 279, [[Wang Jun (Jin dynasty)|Wang Jun]] and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as [[Xiling District|Xiling]] (in present-day [[Yichang]], Hubei), Xiakou ({{lang|zh|夏口}}; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang ({{lang|zh|武昌}}; present-day [[Ezhou]], Hubei).

In fall 550, [[Hou Jing]] sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si ({{lang|zh-hant|蕭嗣}}).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia ({{lang|zh|江夏}}, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire—believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne—and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned [[Wu Mingche]] as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang ({{lang|zh|淳于量}}). The opposing sides met at Dunkou ({{lang|zh|沌口}}, in modern Wuhan). 
[[File:Wuhan_Wuying_Ta_2012.11.21_10-44-59.jpg|thumb|[[Wuying Pagoda]], a Buddhist pagoda rebuilt in Wuchang during the [[Southern Song]] dynasty.]]
The city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies.[[Cui Hao (poet)|Cui Hao]], a celebrated poet of the [[Tang dynasty]], visited the building in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.&lt;ref name="Wan1"&gt;Wan: Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 877, [[Wang Xianzhi (rebel)|Wang Xianzhi]] captured E Prefecture ({{lang|zh|鄂州}}, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture ({{lang|zh|宋州}}, in modern [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]).  In winter 877, [[Huang Chao]] pillaged Qi and Huang ({{lang|zh-hant|黃州}}, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.

Before [[Kublai Khan]] arrived in 1259, word reached him that Möngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the [[Yangtze]]. While Kublai's force besieged [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]], Uryankhadai joined him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The present-day [[Wuying Pagoda]] was constructed at the end of the [[Song Dynasty]] between attacks by the Mongolian forces.  Under the [[Mongol]] rulers ([[Yuan dynasty]]) (after 1301), the Wuchang [[prefecture]], headquartered in the town, became the capital of [[Hubei]] province. Hankou, from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] to late [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], was under the administration of the local government in [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], although it was already one of the four major national markets ([[:zh:四大名镇]]) in Ming dynasty.

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:BudHall-wide-sight.jpg|thumb|Guiyuan Temple|left]]
Hanyang's [[Guiyuan Temple]] was built in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guiyuanchansi.com.cn/list.php?fid=82  归元禅寺位于武汉市汉阳区，东眺晴川阁、南滨鹦鹉洲、北邻古琴台，占地153亩，是湖北省重点文物保护单位。由浙江僧人白光、主峰于清顺治十五年（1658年）依王氏葵园而创建。&lt;/ref&gt; By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north-south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important [[transshipment]] point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a [[concession (territory)|concession]] in Hankou.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=USFD_d-d7FhgC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=french+Guangzhouwan&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;qa=french%20Guangzhouwan&amp;f=false ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'', Google Print, p. 83], Robert Aldrich, Palgrave Macmillan, 1996, {{ISBN|0-312-16000-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HuangHe_Tower2.jpg|thumb|The mid-19th century [[Yellow Crane Tower]] (1871)|left]]
During the [[Taiping Rebellion]], the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, [[Wuying Pagoda|Xingfu Temple]], [[Zhuodaoquan Temple]] and other buildings were destroyed. During the [[Second Opium War]] (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856–1860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the [[Treaties of Tianjin]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan. And in the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of {{convert|30.53|km2}} along the Yangtze River (from Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road today) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession. Thus, Hankou became an open trading port.

In 1889, [[Zhang Zhidong]] was transferred from [[Viceroy of Liangguang]] ([[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces) to [[Viceroy of Huguang]] ([[Hunan]] and [[Hubei]] provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of "Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application," known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China’s modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei. All of these laid a solid foundation for the modernization of Wuhan.

Originally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the [[Hanyang Arsenal]] was founded in 1891 by [[Qing]] official [[Zhang Zhidong]], who diverted funds from the [[Nanyang Fleet]] in [[Guangdong]] to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V682XHpDLXoC&amp;pg=PA414&amp;dq=new+chinese+rifle+factory+han+yang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dCeyTP6tO8H-8AaqstCtCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Chinese Recorder|author=Kathleen L Lodwick|year=2009|publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC|location=|page=414|isbn=1-115-48856-2|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some {{Convert|40|acre|m2}}, could start production of small-calibre cannons.

The [[Wuchang Uprising]] of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan.&lt;ref name="tonsi86"/&gt; Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion.&lt;ref name="Wangke"&gt;Wang, Ke-wen.

On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei [[New Army]].&lt;ref name="tonsi86"/&gt; They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution.&lt;ref name="spence"&gt;Spence, Jonathan D.

On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared.&lt;ref name="tonsi86"/&gt; Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended [[Li Yuanhong]], the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison Henrietta.

As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the [[Battle of Yangxia]] against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by [[Yuan Shikai]]. [[Huang Xing]] (黃興) would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army.&lt;ref name="Wangke"/&gt; After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of [[Sun Yat-sen]] from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912.&lt;ref name="Welland, Sasah Su-ling 2007 pg 87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergere"&gt;Bergere, Marie-Claire.

With the northern extension of the [[Northern Expedition]], the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the KMT Central Political Committee decided to [[Historical capitals of China|move the capital]] from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In middle December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called "Capital District". The national government was in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.&lt;ref name="Remaking the Chinese City"/&gt; In March 1927, [[Mao Zedong]] appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing [[Wang Jingwei]] leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the [[Nanjing]] faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan.{{sfn|Taylor|2009|page=68}} Members of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and re-elected [[Chen Duxiu]] (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jackson Alexander, ''International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement'' (Duke University Press, 1991) p206&lt;/ref&gt; The split was partially motivated by the [[Shanghai Massacre|purge of the Communists]] within the party, which marked the end of the [[First United Front]], and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.{{sfn|Taylor|2009|page=72}}

In June 1927, [[Stalin]] sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for mobilisation of an army of workers and peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''The Long March to Power'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The [[Wuhan coup]] was a political shift made on July 15, 1927 by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his [[Shanghai]]-based rival in the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT). The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927 and ended by August 19, 1927.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Anne Biller. Clark, Anne Bolling. Klein, Donald.

In the [[1931 China floods]], refugees had been arriving in the city of Wuhan since the late spring. When the city itself was inundated in the early summer and after a catastrophic dike failure at just before 6:00 AM on July 27,&lt;ref name=Graves&gt;{{cite book|author=William Graves|title=The Torrent of Life (Journey into China)|url=|year=1982|edition=5th|publisher=National Geographic Society|isbn=0-87044-437-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}} around 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months.&lt;ref name=Graves/&gt;{{rp|269–270}} Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases.&lt;ref name=Courtney&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Courtney|title=The Nature of Disaster in China: The 1931 Yangzi River Flood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DhFDwAAQBAJ|year=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-41777-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 "There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape- they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher." -Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency&lt;ref name=Graves/&gt;{{rp|270}}

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern [[monoplane]] bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the [[Chinese Air Force (disambiguation)|Chinese Air Force]], which included support from the [[Soviet Volunteer Group]] in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned.&lt;ref&gt;http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/sino-japanese-1938.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the [[Battle of Wuhan]]. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.
[[File:Chiang Kai-Shek in Wuhan University.jpg|left|thumb|Chiang Kai-Shek was having a parade before the Japanese Army invaded Wuhan]]
In early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT [[gunboat]] ''[[Chinese gunboat Chung Shan|Zhongshan]]'' came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the ''Zhongshan'' sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the ''Zhongshan'' has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban [[Jiangxia District]], which opened on September 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newscontent.cctv.com/news.jsp?fileId=117667|title=HOME-CCTVPLUS|website=newscontent.cctv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians.&lt;ref name="Fenby, Jonathan page 447"/&gt; "According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/16/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Changjiang Water Resources Commission]] was re-established in February 1950 with its headquarters seated in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the [[1954 Yangtze River floods|Yangtze River Floods]] were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.

Before construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.
[[File:Wuhan Changjiang Bridge in constrution.jpg|thumb|The First Yangtze River Bridge under construction]]
The project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing–Hankou Railway]] with the [[Guangdong–Hankou Railway]] into the [[Beijing–Guangzhou Railway]], making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' (九省通衢) in name and in fact.

After Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/688480117|title=Li Rui wen ji.|last=1917-|first=Li, Rui,|last2=1917-|first2=李锐,|date=2007|publisher=Xianggang she hui ke xue jiao yu chu ban you xian gong si|year=|isbn=9789889958114|location=[Xianggang]|pages=|oclc=688480117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
[[File:Wuhan 114.27328E 30.58114N.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Satellite image of Wuhan]]
[[File:Wuhan from Yellow Crane Tower.jpg|right|thumb|Looking west from the Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang. The First Bridge over the Yangtze, and the Tortoise Hill in Hanyang, with its TV tower, are in the background.]]
Wuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29° 58'–31° 22' N and longitude 113° 41'–115° 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] flowing into the [[Yangtze River]] at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.

The metropolitan area comprises three parts—[[Wuchang, Hubei|Wuchang]], [[Hankou District|Hankou]], and [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]]—commonly called the "Three Towns of Wuhan" (hence the name "Wuhan", combining "Wu" from the first city and "Han" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the "First Bridge".

* Wuchang lies South East of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.
* Hankou sits North of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is North of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.
* Hanyang lies West of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.

It is simple in terrain—low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The [[She River]] enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of {{convert|8494.41|km2}}, most of which is plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds, including [[East Lake (Wuhan)|East Lake]] and [[Tangxun Lake]], which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/武汉东湖风景区 |script-title=zh:武汉东湖风景区 |publisher=[[Baidu Baike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=November 2018}} Other well-known lakes include [[South Lake (Wuhan)|South Lake]] and [[Sand Lake (Wuhan)|Sand Lake]]. [[Liangzi Lake]], the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of [[Jiangxia District]]. At {{convert|709|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the highest point in Wuhan is the main peak of [[Yunwu Mountain, Wuhan|Yunwu Mountain]] ({{lang|zh-hans|云雾山}}) in northwestern Huangpi District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1565823570895013&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc |script-title=zh:在武汉——武汉最高峰云雾山 |quote={{lang|zh-hans|云雾山地处黄陂区西北部，{...}，主峰海拔709米，属武汉市最高峰。}} |website=Baidu Baijiahao |accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including [[Mount Luojia]] ({{lang|zh|珞珈山}}) in Wuchang District&lt;ref name="dzwww.com"/&gt; as well as [[Mount Hong]] ({{lang|zh|洪山}}) and [[Mount Yujia]] ({{lang|zh|喻家山/瑜珈山}}) in Hongshan District.&lt;ref&gt;http://wh.bendibao.com/tour/2013423/36646_3.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China Railway Wuhan Group]] manages the [[Wuhan Railway Hub]]. Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key [[railway hub]]s of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2005-03-18/07485392256s.shtml |script-title=zh:铁道部规划建设北京上海广州武汉四大铁路枢纽 |website=[[Sina Corp|Sina]] News |date=2005-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the [[Hankou Railway Station]] in [[Hankou District|Hankou]], the [[Wuchang Railway Station]] in [[Wuchang, Hubei|Wuchang]], and the [[Wuhan Railway Station]], located in a newly developed area east of the [[East Lake (Wuhan)|East Lake]] ([[Hongshan District, Wuhan|Hongshan District]]). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.

The (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the [[Jinghan Railway]] from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the [[Yuehan Railway]] to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the [[Jingguang Railway]], both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.

With the opening of the [[Hewu Passenger Railway|Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway]] on April 1, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2009-03/24/content_7610613.htm|title=Two high-speed rail links start April 1|website=www2.chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under 6 hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the [[Hankou Railway Station]].

[[File:Wuhan railway station 01.JPG|thumb|Wuhan Railway Station, completed in 2009|left]]
In 2006, construction began on the new [[Wuhan Railway Station]] with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its [[Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway|second high-speed train]] with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of {{convert|394|km/h|2|abbr=on}}. The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[Source: Beijing (AFP, Sat December 26, 7:54 am ET]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2011}}, the new [[Wuhan Railway Station]] is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.

Construction work is carried out on several lines of the new [[Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway]], which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of [[Xianning]], [[Huangshi]], [[Huanggang]], and [[Xiaogan]]. The first line of the system, [[Wuhan–Xianning Intercity Railway|the one to Xianning]], opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013.

The main freight railway station and [[marshalling yard]] of the Wuhan metropolitan area is the gigantic [[Wuhan North railway station]], with 112 tracks and over 650 switches. It is located in [[Hengdiang Subdistrict]] ([[:zh:横店街道|横店街道]]) of [[Huangpi District]], located {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the Wuhan Station and {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} from Hankou Station.

"No need to be particular about the recipes, all food have their own uses. [[Rice wine]] and [[tangyuan (food)|tangyuan]] are excellent midnight snacks, while fat bream and flowering Chinese cabbages are great delicacies."&lt;ref&gt;Hankou Zhuzhici (an ancient book recording stories about Wuhan) produced during the Daoguang Period of the [[Qing dynasty]]&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude expressed in ''Hankou Zhuzhici'' reflects indirectly the eating habits and a wide variety of distinctive snacks with a long history in Wuhan, such as Qingshuizong (a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves) in the Period of the Warring States, Chunbinbian in Northern &amp; Southern dynasties, mung bean jelly in the Sui dynasty, youguo (a deep-fried twisted dough stick) in the Song and Yuan dynasties, rice wine and mianwo in the Ming and Qing dynasties as well as three-delicacy stuffed skin of bean milk, tangbao (steamed dumpling filled with minced meat and gravy) and hot braised noodles (reganmian) in modern times.

''Guozao'' ({{linktext|過早}}) is a popular way to say 'having breakfast' in Wuhan.&lt;ref&gt;http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-free-197497-1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that Guangzhou is the paradise for eating and Shanghai for dressing, while Wuhan is a combination of both. Sitting favorably at the heart of China, Wuhan has gathered and mixed together various habits and customs from neighboring cities and provinces in all directions, which gives rise to a saying of concentrating diverse customs from different places. The most famous place to ''guozao'' (have breakfast) is the Hubu street (户部巷). This 150 meters long street is located in the most flourishing district of Wuhan, Simenkou (司门口)&lt;!--and is qualified as the "First street of Han breakfast"--&gt;. We can find there nearly all the traditional food of Wuhan, such as:

[[File:Wuhan-meets.jpg|thumb|''Doupi'' on the left and ''Re-gan mian'' on the right|left]]
* [[Re gan mian|Hot and Dry Noodles]], ''Re-gan mian'' ({{linktext|热干面}}) consists of long freshly boiled noodles mixed with sesame paste. The Chinese word ''re'' means hot and ''gan'' means dry. It is considered to be the most typical local food for breakfast.
* [[Wuhan duck|Duck's neck]]  or ''Ya Bozi'' (鸭脖子) is a local version of this popular Chinese dish, made of duck necks and spices.
* Bean skin or ''[[Doupi]]'' (豆皮) is a popular local dish with a filling of egg, rice, beef, mushrooms and beans cooked between two large round soybean skins and cut into pieces, structurally like a stuffed pizza without enclosing edges.
* [[Xiaolongbao#Related varieties|Soup dumpling]] or ''Xiaolongtangbao'' (小笼汤包) is a kind of dumpling with thin skin made of flour, steamed with very juicy meat inside, so that is why it is called Tang (soup) Bao (bun), because every time one takes a bite from it the soup inside spills out.
* A salty doughnut or ''[[Mianwo]]'' (面窝) is a kind of doughnut with a salty taste. It is much thinner than a common doughnut and is a typical Wuhan local food.

===Opera===
[[Han opera]], which is the local opera of Wuhan area, was one of China's oldest and most popular operas. During the late Qing dynasty, Han opera, blended with Hui opera, gave birth to Peking opera, the most popular opera in modern China. Therefore, Han opera is called "mother of Peking opera" in China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wuhanews.com/read/67.html 汉剧中的二黄唱调，是现代京剧唱腔的主要组成部分，所以汉剧又有“京剧唱腔之祖山”的美誉。 {...}1962年武汉市成立了武汉汉剧院&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;湖北省博物馆．楚腔汉调 : 汉剧文物图说：湖北人民，2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
[[File:Wuhan_Zall_Football_Club.jpg|thumb|Wuhan Zall Football Club]]
Wuhan has a professional football team [[Wuhan Zall F.C.]] that plays in [[China League One]]. Xinhua Road Sport Center, the home stadium of the team that has a capacity of 32,137, is located in the heart of the city next to Zhongshan Park. In 2013 season, Wuhan Zall was promoted to the top tier league of Chinese football--[[Chinese Super League]] and relocated its home to [[Wuhan Sports Center Stadium]], a modern stadium located in suburban of the city that has 54,357 seats. However, the team did not play well in the season and was demoted back to China League One as 2013 season ended. Due to financial and transportation reasons, the team moved back to Xinhua Road Sport Center in 2014.

The [[Wuhan Gators]] are a professional [[arena football]] team based in Wuhan. They are members of the [[China Arena Football League]] (CAFL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Super Six!

Wuhan Sports Center hosted [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] in 2007, including both group stage games and elimination phases. Wuhan is nicknamed the "fortune place" of Chinese football. Before the women's team lost the game to Brazil in 2007 Women's World Cup, Chinese national football teams, both men and women, had never lost any games in Wuhan.

The 13,000 seat [[Wuhan Gymnasium]] held [[2011 FIBA Asia Championship]] and will be one of the venues for the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup]].&lt;ref name="fiba.com"/&gt;

The city has been holding the women's tennis tournament [[Wuhan Open]], one of the [[WTA Tier I tournaments|WTA]] [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier 5 tournaments]], since 2014.

===Bridges===
[[File:YangtzeWuhanFirstBridge.jpg|right|upright=1.2|thumb|The ''First Bridge'' at Wuhan. This view is upstream, toward the distant [[Three Gorges]] and [[Chongqing]].]]
Wuhan has [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|seven bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River]]. The [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also called the ''First Bridge'', was built over the [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang) in 1957, carrying the railroad directly across the river between Snake Hill (on the left in the picture below) and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to [[train ferry|barge]] railcars across. Including its approaches, it is {{convert|5,511|ft|m}} long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above. It was built with the assistance of advisers from the [[Soviet Union]].

The [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Bridge]], a [[cable-stayed bridge]], built of pre-stressed concrete, has a central span of {{convert|400|m|abbr=off}}; it is {{convert|4,678|m|abbr=off}} in length (including {{convert|1,877|m|abbr=off}} of the main bridge) and {{convert|26.5|to|33.5|m|1|abbr=off}} in width. Its main bridgeheads are {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} high each, pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans, so that the central span of the bridge is well poised on the piers and the bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured. With six lanes on the deck, the bridge is designed to handle 50,000 motor vehicles passing every day.
The bridge was completed in 1995.

[[File:Yangzi Wuhan Second Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|''Second bridge'']]
The [[Third Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]] was completed in September 2000. Located {{convert|8.6|km|1|abbr=off}} southwest of the First Bridge, construction of Baishazhou Bridge started in 1997. With an investment of over 1.4 billion yuan (about 170 million U.S. dollars), the bridge, which is {{convert|3,586|m|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|26.5|m|1|abbr=off}} wide, has six lanes and has a capacity of 50,000 vehicles a day. The bridge is expected to serve as a major passage for the future Wuhan Ring Road, enormously easing the city's traffic and aiding local economic development.

The [[Yangluo Bridge]] carries [[Wuhan Ring Road|Wuhan's Ring Road]] across the Yangtze in the city's eastern suburbs (connecting the [[Hongshan District, Wuhan|Hongshan District]] with the [[Xinzhou District, Wuhan|Xinzhou District]]). It was opened on December 26, 2007.

The [[Wuhan Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge]] crosses the Yangtze in the northeastern part of the city, downstream of the Second bridge. Its name is due to the Tianxing Island (Tianxingzhou), above which it crosses the river. Built at the cost of 11 billion yuan, the 4,657-meter cable suspension bridge was opened on December 26, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cnhubei.com/2009-12/28/cms846940article.shtml Tianxingzhou highway-railway Bridge in Wuhan opens to traffic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330063819/http://english.cnhubei.com/2009-12/28/cms846940article.shtml |date=March 30, 2010 }}. english.cnhubei.com 2009-12-28&lt;/ref&gt; in time for the opening of the [[Wuhan Railway Station]]. It is a combined road and rail bridge, and carries the [[Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] across the river.

In Chinese mythology, the [[Baiji]] has many origin stories. In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin, and the general a porpoise.&lt;ref name=turvy&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Turvy|title=Witness to Extinction: How we Failed to Save the Yangtze River Dolphin|chapter=The Goddess of the Yangtze|pages=3–4|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-954947-4|id= {{ASIN|0199549486|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
