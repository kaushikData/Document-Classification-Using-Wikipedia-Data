'''{{mp|2018 BD}}''' is a small [[asteroid]] and [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|2|-|6|m|ft|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in diameter. It was first observed on 18 January 2018, by astronomers of the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]], Arizona, United States,&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; just hours before passing about 0.10 [[lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]]s of the Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''2018 BD'' is an [[Apollo asteroid]]. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.75–1.36&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 13 months (395 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.05&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.29 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 2[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The object has an exceptionally low [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of {{convert |0.000006019 |AU |km mi|abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}, or 0.002 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, {{mp|2018 BD}} measures between 2 and 6 meters in diameter, for an [[absolute magnitude]] of 30.154, and an assumed [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.05 and 0.20, which represent typical values for [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] and a bright [[E-type asteroid]]s, respectively.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt; As of 2018, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of this object has been obtained from [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations. The body's [[rotation period]], [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

A '''bathometer''' (also '''bathymeter''') is an [[Scientific instrument|instrument]] for measuring water depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bathometer Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.nv.gov/programs/planning/dictionary/wwords-B.pdf Water Words Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously used mainly in [[Oceanography|oceanographical]] studies, but is rarely employed nowadays. The term originates from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''βαθύς'' (''bathys''), "deep" and ''μέτρον'' (''métron''), "measure".

Camp Taliaferro had an  administration center near what is now the [[Will Rogers Memorial Center]] complex in Fort Worth's cultural area near University Drive and W Lancaster Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Morgan "Royal Flying Corps in Texas" in ''Aeroplane Monthly'', November and December issues, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, General [[John Pershing|John J. "Blackjack" Pershing]] invited the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) to establish training fields in the southern United States where the warmer weather would be more conducive for flying year-round. In June, the War Department inspected six sites around Fort Worth which had been offered by the Chamber of Commerce and by July, RFC representatives from Canada inspected five potential sites in Texas and Louisiana for use during the winter.

After looking at sites in Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, Austin, Wichita Falls, and Midland, in August the War Department signed leases with the RFC on three sites around Fort Worth.  Known as the Flying Triangle, these sites were [[Hicks Field]] (#1), [[Barron Field]] (#2), and [[Benbrook Field]] (#3) based on their locations; and construction began in late August and early September.

The Canadians named the training complex Camp Taliaferro after 1st Lieutenant [[Walter R. Taliaferro]], a U.S. Army aviator.  Taliaferro was killed in an accident at [San Diego], California, on 11 October 1915.&lt;ref&gt;San Diego Union newspaper of 12 October 1915 Location of U.S. Aviation Fields, The New York Times, 21 July 1918&lt;/ref&gt;  The Camp Taliaferro offices for the Air Service and RFC Canada were initially located in the basement of the Chamber of Commerce building in Fort Worth to handle pay, purchasing, and administrative services for their own personnel assigned at the three fields.

Work on constructing the airfield had to be done quickly.  Cattle were moved out, and construction crews worked feverishly at the site. US Air Service squadrons which had been training in Canada began arriving in October 1917, and the RFC squadrons began to arrive in early November.

The first winter of 1917-1918 was difficult.  Many men lived in tents in this snowy winter. RFC instructors trained about 6000 men there.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sullivan [https://archive.org/stream/aviationincanada00sullrich/aviationincanada00sullrich_djvu.txt Aviation in Canada, 1917-1918], Toronto, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; In six months, 1,960 pilots were trained, completing 67,000 flying hours on the [[Curtiss JN4]] Canuck&lt;!-- (also known as the "Jenny") --&gt;, a two-seater [[biplane]] weighing 2,100&amp;nbsp;lb (950&amp;nbsp;kg) with a maximum speed of 75&amp;nbsp;mph (120&amp;nbsp;km/h). About 69 ground officers and 4,150 others received training in ground trades and skills.   During the winter, eight deaths were due to influenza and 39 RFC personnel died as the result of aircraft accidents, influenza, or other illnesses.

Canadian cadets were at Benbrook and Everman Fields, while the US cadets and the Canadian aerial gunnery school went to Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Cox [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles//apj/apj04/win04/cox.html Aspects of Anglo-US Co-operation in the Air in the First World War] Air &amp; Space Power Journal - Winter 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The training was a major life experience, sufficiently so for veterans to keep memorabilia long afterwards. For example, the wife of Harry Kuhlmann from San Jose, California, ([[22d Aero Squadron]] 1917-9) died in 1974, still holding Camp Taliaferro Post Exchange Tickets.&lt;ref&gt;Lola Aguilar [http://www.roseville.ca.us/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=12576 Inventory of the Hazel McIntosh Kuhlman Collection 1878-1974] [[Roseville Public Library]] History Collection, Roseville, California, retrieved 4 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Cornell's ''Alumni News'', L.

[[Image:20050530 Guard at FW CWG Cemetery.JPG|thumb|A guard at the Fort Worth war graves cemetery, Memorial Day 2005, Greenwood Cemetery, Fort Worth, Texas]]
For those who survived the training, combat life expectancy was short. Only two US Air Service squadrons—the [[17th Aero Squadron|17th]] and [[148th Aero Squadron]]s—saw active service with the British, flying with them until November 1918, after which they were absorbed into the US Air Service. The obituary of one veteran may be typical: 
::ELLIOTT, Edward William. 1st Lieutenant. Son of Samuel A. and Myrtle Elliott; born September 9, 1895, Wapakoneta, OH. Living in Muncie, IN when he entered First Officers Training Camp, Ft. Harrison, IN, May 15, 1917. Commissioned 1st Lieutenant. Assigned to 27th Aero Squadron. Transferred to Toronto, Canada; then to Camp Taliaferro, TX. Overseas in March 1918. Killed in an air battle, Chateau-Thierry, France, July 2, 1918. Survived by widow, Reba Thorpe Elliott, Muncie, IN.&lt;ref&gt;The Gold Star Honor Roll, 1914-1918, in ''Indiana War Records'', published by the Indiana Historical Commission, 1921. (quoted [http://files.usgwarchives.org/oh/oh-footsteps/2000/aug/v00-247.txt here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219003535/http://files.usgwarchives.org/oh/oh-footsteps/2000/aug/v00-247.txt |date=2012-02-19 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Others survived the war, but to continue in aviation was almost as perilous:
::[[Edmund Pike Graves]]: born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, on March 13, 1891. Middlesex School, Class of 1907; Harvard, Class of 1913. Enlisted as a cadet, [[Royal Flying Corps Canada|Royal Flying Corps in Canada]] on July 9, 1917 to avoid a delay in getting into a U.S. flying program. Commissioned 2nd Lieutenant, R.F.C. on October 29, 1917. Assigned as instructor in aerial gunnery at Camp Taliaferro, Hicks Field, Fort Worth, Texas. One of the first pilots to do elaborate stunts in a [[Curtiss JN-4|Curtiss]]. Transferred to Officers' School of Special Flying at Armour Heights, North Toronto in early spring, 1918. Promoted to 1st Lieutenant in May, 1918. Posted overseas, arrived on November 5, 1918 - armistice signed prior to movement to France. Demobilized in July, 1919. Volunteered for Kosciuszko Squadron flying for the new state of Poland and flew Albatross aircraft in patrols over the front in the Lemberg (Lwow) area. Killed during the celebration of the [[Battle of Lwów (1918)|liberation of Lemberg]] from the Ukrainians when his aircraft lost its right wing during a double roll at 150 feet. Buried in Lemberg, with honors, by the Government of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Zolla [http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/great-war-people/brothers-arms/380-ten-middlesex.html Ten Men from Middlesex] The Western Front Association, 22 May 2008, retrieved 4 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-nine officers and cadets died in Texas. Eleven British, Canadians, and Americans remain there, reinterred in 1924 at a [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] cemetery plot in [[Greenwood Memorial Park, Fort Worth]]. The plot is in Section 5 of the cemetery, at 32-45-47, 97-21-48. Also interred there are one of their comrades who died in 1975, and the daughter of a Canadian instructor who died as a baby in 1918. A stone monument serves as a focal point on [[Memorial Day]] in May of odd-numbered years, when friends of the cemetery support a moving Remembrance Service, at which people from the three nations remember the sacrifice of those buried there.

Following the departure of the Royal Air Force in April 1918, Camp Taliaferro was closed and each of the 3 fields operated as separate sites.  When the RFC Canada arrived in Fort Worth in November 1917, they brought 254 Curtiss JN-4 (Can) license-built aircraft with them for training at the 3 fields around Fort Worth. When they returned to Canada in April 1918, they turned over 180 serviceable aircraft to the Army Air Service. By then, American and Canadian license-built JN-4s were keeping up with demand.

Besides molding men into lean, mean fighting machines, Camp Taliaferro also molded some long lasting friendships between the Canadians and Americans.  One of the most vivid memories of Hicks Field was the remarkable friendship that existed between the RFC pilots and the American flyers.  The townspeople of the surrounding communities opened their homes, their hearts and numerous facilities to the young aviators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10610">A '''carbon-to-nitrogen ratio''' ('''C/N ratio''' or '''C:N ratio''') is a ratio of the mass of [[carbon]] to the mass of [[nitrogen]] in a substance. It can, amongst other things, be used in analysing sediments and compost. A useful application for C/N ratios is as a proxy for [[paleoclimate]] research, having different uses whether the sediment cores are terrestrial-based or marine-based. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratios are an indicator for nitrogen limitation of plants and other organisms and can identify whether molecules found in the sediment under study come from land-based or algal plants.&lt;ref name=ishi&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ishiwatari, R.|author2=M. Uzaki|title=Diagenetic Changes of Lignin Compounds in a More Than 0.6 Million-Year-Old Lacustrine Sediment (Lake Biwa, Japan)|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=51|issue=2 |year=1987|pages=321–28|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(87)90244-4|bibcode=1987GeCoA..51..321I}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, they can distinguish between different land-based plants, depending on the type of photosynthesis they undergo. Therefore, the C/N ratio serves as a tool for understanding the sources of sedimentary organic matter, which can lead to information about the ecology, climate, and ocean circulation at different times in Earth’s history.&lt;ref name=ishi/&gt;

C/N ratios in the range 4-10:1 are usually from marine sources, whereas higher ratios are likely to come from a terrestrial source.&lt;ref&gt;Gray KR, Biddlestone AJ. 1973.

When [[composting]], microbial activity utilizes a C/N ratio of 30-35:1 and a higher ratio will result in slower composting rates.&lt;ref name=prah/&gt; However, this assumes that carbon is completely consumed, which is often not the case. Thus, for practical agricultural purposes, a compost should have an initial C/N ratio of 20-30:1.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlem. "Flux to the Seafloor", Group Report, eds. K.W. Bruland et al., pp. 210–213, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Example of devices that can be used to measure this ratio are the [[CHN analyzer]] and the continuous-flow isotope ratio [[mass spectrometer]] (CF-IRMS).&lt;ref&gt;Brenna, J. Thomas, et al. "High‐precision continuous‐flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry." Mass spectrometry reviews 16.5 (1997): 227-258.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for more practical applications, desired C/N ratios can be achieved by blending common used substrates of known C/N content, which are readily available and easy to use.

== Applications ==

=== Marine ===

Organic matter that is deposited in marine sediments contains a key indicator as to its source and the processes it underwent before reaching the floor as well as after deposition, its carbon to nitrogen ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper, J. P., and R. B. Gagosian. “The sources and deposition of organic matter in the Late Quaternary Pigmy Basin, Gulf of Mexico.” Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta 54, no. 4 (1990): 1117-1132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyers, P. A 1994"&gt;Meyers, P. A. "Preservation of Elemental and Isotopic Source Identification of Sedimentary Organic-Matter." Chemical Geology 114, no. 3-4 (Jun 1 1994): 289-302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prah/&gt; In the global oceans, freshly produced algae in the surface ocean typically have a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 4 to 10.&lt;ref name="Meyers, P. A 1994"/&gt; However, it has been observed that only 10% of this organic matter (algae) produced in the surface ocean sinks to the deep ocean without being degraded by bacteria in transit, and only about 1% is permanently buried in the sediment. An important process called sediment [[diagenesis]] accounts for the other 9% of organic carbon that sank to the deep ocean floor, but was not permanently buried, that is 9% of the total organic carbon produced is degraded in the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=emer&gt;Emerson, S., and J. Hedges. “Sediment Diagenesis and Benthic Flux.” Treatise on Geochemistry 6.11 (2003): 293-319.&lt;/ref&gt; The microbial communities utilizing the sinking organic carbon as an energy source are partial to nitrogen-rich compounds because much of these bacterium are nitrogen-limited and much prefer it over carbon. As a result, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of sinking organic carbon in the deep ocean is elevated compared to fresh surface ocean organic matter that had not been degraded. An exponential increase in C/N ratios is observed with increasing water depth—with C/N ratios reaching 10 at intermediate water depths of about 1000 meters, and up to 15 in the deep ocean (~ &gt;2500 meters) {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. This elevated C/N signature is preserved in the sediment, until another form of diagenesis, post-depositional diagenesis, alters its C/N signature once again.&lt;ref name="Müller, P. J 1977"/&gt; Post-depositional diagenesis occurs in organic-carbon-poor marine sediments where bacteria are able to oxidize organic matter in aerobic conditions as an energy source. The oxidation reaction proceeds as follows: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, with a standard free energy of –27.4 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (half reaction).&lt;ref name=emer/&gt; Once all of the oxygen is used up, bacteria are able to carry out an anoxic sequence of chemical reactions as an energy source, all with negative ∆G°r values, with the reaction becoming less favorable as the chain of reactions proceeds.&lt;ref name=emer/&gt;

The same principle described above explaining the preferential degradation of nitrogen-rich organic matter occurs within the sediments, as they are more labile and are in higher demand. This principle has been utilized in paleoceanographic studies in order to identify core sites that have not experienced much microbial activity, or contamination by terrestrial sources with much higher C/N ratios.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymo, M. E.]], et al. "Mid-Pliocene warmth: stronger greenhouse and stronger conveyor." Marine Micropaleontology 27.1 (1996): 313-326.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, it should be noted that ammonia, the product of the second reduction reaction, which reduces nitrate and produces nitrogen gas and ammonia, is easily adsorbed on clay mineral surfaces and protected from bacteria. This has been proposed as an explanation for lower than expected C/N signatures of organic carbon in sediments that have undergone post-depositional diagenesis.&lt;ref name="Müller, P. J 1977"/&gt;

[[Ammonium]] produced from the [[remineralisation]] of organic material, exists in elevated concentrations (1 - &gt;14μM) within cohesive shelf sea sediments found in the [[Celtic Sea]] (depth: 1–30&amp;nbsp;cm). The depth of sediment exceeds 1m and would be a suitable study site to carry out [[paleolimnology]] experiments with C:N.

=== Lacustrine ===

Unlike in marine sediments, diagenesis does not pose a large threat to the integrity of the C/N ratio in lacustrine sediments.&lt;ref name=ishi/&gt;&lt;ref name=meye&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meyers, Philip A., and Ryoshi Ishiwatari|title=Lacustrine organic geochemistry—an overview of indicators of organic matter sources and diagenesis in lake sediments|journal=Organic geochemistry|volume=20.7|year=1993|pages=867–900|doi=10.1016/0146-6380(93)90100-P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though wood from living trees around lakes have consistently higher C/N ratios than wood buried in sediment, the change in elemental composition is not large enough to remove the vascular versus non-vascular plant signals due to the refractory nature of terrestrial organic matter.&lt;ref name=ishi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, P. A. "Preservation of Elemental and Isotopic Source Identification of Sedimentary Organic-Matter."
Chemical Geology 114, no. 3-4 (Jun 1 1994): 289-302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meye/&gt; Abrupt shifts in the C/N ratio down-core can be interpreted as shifts in the organic source material.

For example, two separate studies on Mangrove Lake, Bermuda and Lake Yunoko, Japan show irregular, abrupt fluctuations between C/N around 11 to around 18. These fluctuations are attributed to shifts from mainly algal dominance to land-based vascular dominance.&lt;ref name=meye/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ishiwatari, R., N. Takamatsu, and T. Ishibashi. "Separation of autochthonous and allochthonous materials in lacustrine sediments by density differences."Japanese Journal of Limnology 38 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Results of studies that show abrupt shifts in algal dominance and vascular dominance often lead to conclusions about the state of the lake during these distinct periods of isotopic signatures. Times in which lakes are dominated by algal signals suggest the lake is a deep-water lake, while times in which lakes are dominated by vascular plant signals suggest the lake is shallow, dry, or marshy.&lt;ref name=meye/&gt; Using the C/N ratio in conjunction with other sediment observations, such as physical variations, D/H isotopic analyses of fatty acids and alkanes, and δ13C analyses on similar biomarkers can lead to further regional climate interpretations that describe the larger phenomena at play.

The '''Chivela Pass''' is a narrow [[mountain pass]] in the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca|Sierra Madre Mountains]] that funnels cooler, drier air from the North American continent, through southern [[Mexico]], into the [[Pacific]]. These northeasterly winds, specifically the [[Tehuano wind]], which periodically blows across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico, have important climatic effects, influencing the formation of [[hurricane]]s and [[typhoon]]s, as well as contributing to worldwide [[climatology|climatological]] events, such as ''[[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|El Nino]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In extreme circumstances during the winter, truly cold, dense, air occasionally flows from the [[Bay of Campeche]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] through the Chivela Pass into the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]] on the Pacific side. These winds can be strong enough to sandblast paint off ships at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''clay court''' is one of many different types of [[tennis court]]. Clay courts are made of crushed [[shale]], [[rock (geology)|stone]], [[brick]], or other unbound mineral aggregates. The [[French Open]] uses clay courts, making it unique among the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. Clay courts are more common in Continental Europe and Latin America than in North America, Asia or Britain. Two main types exist: [[#Red clay|red clay]], the more common variety, and [[#Green clay|green clay]], also known as "rubico", which is a harder surface. Although less expensive to construct than other types of tennis courts, the maintenance costs of clay are high as the surface must be rolled to preserve flatness.&lt;ref name="What is clay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltennisdesign.com/articles/clay_courts_p.htm|title=Clay Courts: What Are They Anyway?|first=Andrew R.|last=Lavallee|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
Clay courts favor the "full [[Grip (tennis)|western grip]]" for more [[topspin]]. "Clay-courters" generally play in a semicircle about {{convert|1.5|to|3|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} behind the baseline.

Clay courts are considered "slow" because the balls bounce relatively high and lose much of their initial speed when contacting the surface, making it more difficult for a player to deliver an unreturnable shot. [[point (tennis)|Points]] are usually longer as there are fewer [[winner (tennis)|winners]]. Therefore, clay courts heavily favor [[baseliner]]s who are consistent and have a strong defensive game, which has allowed players such as [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Björn Borg]], [[Chris Evert]], and [[Justine Henin]] to find success at the French Open.

Clay court players use topspins to throw off their opponents. Movement on gravel courts is very different from movement on any other surface. Playing on clay often involves the ability to slide into the ball during the stroke, as opposed to running and stopping like on a hard or grass court. Players who excel on clay courts but struggle to replicate the same form on fast courts are known as [[clay-court specialist]]s.

Clay courts are unique in that the ball bounce leaves an impression in the ground, which can help determine whether a shot was in or out. Critics of red clay courts point to the constant need to wet them down, problems renewing the surface if it dries out, and the damage caused to clothing and footwear through stains. All clay courts, not just red clay, tend to cause a build-up of clay on the bottom of the shoes of the players, needing constant removal.

==Variants==
===Red clay===
Almost all red clay courts are made not of natural clay but of crushed brick that is packed to make the court, with the top most layers consisting of finely crushed loose particles. Such courts are most common in Europe and Latin America.

''En tout cas'' (Fr. "in any case") is a version of red clay with a coarser top layer to improve drainage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.en-tout-cas.co.uk/ En-Tout-Cas Sports Surfaces home page&lt;/ref&gt; The coarser surface allows more water to run through the surface of the court drying the surface more quickly after rain.&lt;ref name="What is clay"/&gt; 

Natural clay courts are rare because this type of surface does not absorb water easily and takes two to three days to dry. A good example of natural red clay can be seen at the Frick Park Clay Courts in [[Pittsburgh]], a public facility of six red clay courts that has been in continual use since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.clayfricktennis.org/|title= Frick Park Clay Court Tennis Club |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green clay===

'''Green clay''', also called '''rubico''' and the brand name '''Har-Tru''', is similar to coarse red clay, but is made from crushed [[Amphibolite|metabasalt]] rather than brick,&lt;ref name="Har-Tru Green Clay"&gt;{{cite web|title=Har-Tru Classic Green Clay|url=https://hartru.com/pages/har-tru-green|website=Har-Tru|publisher=Har-Tru LLC|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the surface slightly harder and faster. Green clay is packed to make the subsurface. It is then covered with a topping. These courts are located primarily in the eastern and southern United States.

There is one [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournament played on green Har-Tru clay courts, the [[Volvo Car Open]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

[[Rafael Nadal]], winner of eleven French Open men's singles titles, is noted for his success on clay; since his debut in 2005, he has only lost twice at the tournament – in [[2009 French Open|2009]] and [[2015 French Open|2015]]. Nadal holds the record for the longest [[ATP World Tour records#Winning streaks|winning streak]] by any male player on a single surface since the [[tennis open era]] began in 1968: 81 clay court wins between April 2005 and May 2007. He also holds the record for most titles won on clay in the open era with 55 trophies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/barcelona-2018-final-nadal-tsitsipas|title=Rafa Romps To 11th Barcelona Title {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|work=ATP World Tour|access-date=29 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Thomas Muster]] is also considered a successful clay court player; although he only won the French Open once, 40 out of his 44 career singles titles were won on clay.

On the women's side, [[Justine Henin]] and [[Monica Seles]] hold the record for the number of consecutive [[List of French Open women's singles champions|French Open titles]] won at three (1990–1992 for Seles and 2005–2007 for Henin). In the pre-open era this feat was first achieved by [[Helen Wills Moody]] (1928–1930) and followed by [[Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling]] (1935–1937).

[[Chris Evert]] holds the record for longest winning streak on clay for either gender in the open era: from August 1973 to May 1979, she won 125 consecutive clay court matches. During this time Evert skipped three editions of the French Opens (1976–78), to participate in [[World Team Tennis]]. She also has the highest career win percentage on clay courts (94.28%) during the open era.

The most successful currently active female player on clay is [[Serena Williams]], who won the French Open thrice, in 2002, 2013 and 2015. In 2013, Williams went undefeated throughout the clay court season, winning five titles on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/06/10/serena-williams-confirms-greatness-with-french-open-win/ Serena Williams confirms greatness with French Open win], ''The Roar'', 10 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-22/serena-takes-out-swedish-open-title/4834556 Tennis: Serena Williams racks up 51st win to take Swedish Open title], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 22 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clay-court specialist===
[[File:Nadal vs Federer RG 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael Nadal]] is known as "The King of Clay."]]
A clay-court specialist is a tennis player who excels on clay courts.

Due in part to advances in racquet technology, current clay-court specialists are known for employing long, winding groundstrokes that generate heavy [[topspin]], strokes which are less effective when the surface is faster and the balls do not bounce as high. Clay-court specialists tend to slide more effectively on clay than other players. Many of them are also very adept at hitting the [[drop shot]], which can be effective because rallies on clay courts often leave players pushed far beyond the baseline. Additionally, the slow, long rallies require a great degree of mental focus and physical stamina from the players.

The definition of "clay-court specialist" has varied, with some placing players such as [[Thomas Muster]], [[Gustavo Kuerten]], and [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] in that category, even though these players have won tournaments (including Masters Series events) on other surfaces. However, since these players won major titles only at the [[French Open]], they are sometimes labeled as such. Other players, such as [[Sergi Bruguera]], [[Albert Costa]] and [[Gastón Gaudio]] were French Open champions who won all or very nearly all of their career titles on clay. Among female players, there have been very few whose best results were confined exclusively to clay. [[Virginia Ruzici]], [[Anastasia Myskina]], [[Iva Majoli]], [[Sue Barker]], [[Ana Ivanovic]], [[Francesca Schiavone]], [[Jeļena Ostapenko]] and [[Simona Halep]] are the only female players to have won major titles at only the French Open since the beginning of the open era.

Increasingly, clay courters have attempted to play better on other surfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ford | first = Bonnie D | title = Nadal the lead warrior in Spanish surge on grass | publisher = EPSN.com | date = 27 June 2008 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ford_bonnie_d&amp;id=3463241 | accessdate = 10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Van Sias|title=Clay-court specialists not so special anymore|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/story/2012-04-16/weekly-net-post-demise-of-the-clay-court-specialist/54319198/1|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrero reached the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] Final in [[2003 US Open – Men's Singles|2003]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Ferrero shatters Agassi hopes  | publisher = BBC  | date = 27 June 2008  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/us_open_2003/3087014.stm  | accessdate = 10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same year he won the [[2003 French Open – Men's Singles|French Open]], and also won several hardcourt tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Ferrero claims Madrid title  | publisher = BBC  | date = 19 October 2002  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/3205848.stm  | accessdate = 10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nadal was considered a clay court specialist until a string of successes on other surfaces, including completing a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Golden Slam|golden career grand slam]], led to a broadening of his reputation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/us-open-final-nadal-v-djokovic/4947782 US Open: Rafael Nadal beats Novak Djokovic in four-set final to win his second Open title], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 10 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; while [[2016 French Open – Women's Singles|2016 French Open]] winner [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] reached the [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2015 Wimbledon]] final and won the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2017 Wimbledon]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-07-09/magical_muguruza_into_first_major_final.html|title=Magical Muguruza into first major final|publisher=Wimbledon|first=Matt|last=Trollope|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional tournaments played on clay==
The professional clay court season comprises many more tournaments than the brief grass court season, but is still shorter than the hard court seasons. There are three distinct clay court seasons during the year.

The first is the men's winter clay season consisting of tournaments in South America. Played primarily in February between the [[Australian Open]] and the [[Indian Wells Masters]], the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] has four tournaments in this swing, although other ATP tournaments played on hardcourt occur the same weeks. The WTA discontinued its participation in Rio de Janeiro after 2016, so there are no clay court women's tournaments during this period.

The second is the long spring clay season that starts in the Americas and Morocco before moving to mainland Europe and finishing with the French Open. It is usually played over two months between April and June, after the [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]]. Unlike the other two clay seasons this swing does not share the majority of its time with simultaneous hard court tournaments.

The third is the brief summer clay season that takes place after Wimbledon. It is entirely in Europe, and usually takes place in July. Near the end of the swing, it overlaps with the beginning of the [[US Open Series]].

==Geography==
The gas crater is located near the village of [[Derweze]], also known as ''Darvaza''. It is in the middle of the [[Karakum Desert]], about {{Convert|260|km}} north of [[Ashgabat]], the capital of Turkmenistan. The gas reserve found here is one of the largest in the world. The name "Door to Hell" was given to the field by the locals, referring to the fire, boiling mud, and orange flames in the large crater, which has a diameter of {{convert|70|m}}.&lt;ref name="dailytimes.com.pk2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/infotainment/14-Sep-2012/what-a-hell-hole|title=What a ‘hell hole’!|last=|first=|date=2012-09-14|work=|publisher=''Pakistan Daily Times''|via=|accessdate=2012-10-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606231839/http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/infotainment/14-Sep-2012/what-a-hell-hole|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hot spots range over an area with a width of {{Convert|60|m}} and to a depth of about {{Convert|20|m}}.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/20/us-turkmenistan-crater-odd-idUSTRE63J4H120100420|title=Turkmen president wants to close "Hell's Gate"|first=Marat|date=2010-04-20|work=|publisher=Reuters|via=|last=Gurt|accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Derweze-Surroundings.JPG|thumb|right|The Darvaza gas crater and the surrounding area, including where the tents usually are pitched, a couple of hundred meters away to the south of the crater.]]
According to Turkmen geologist Anatoly Bushmakin, the site was identified by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] engineers in 1971.&lt;ref name="CTV News"/&gt; It was originally thought to be a substantial [[oil field]] site.&lt;ref name="Institute2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZhQAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=January 2010|publisher=American Geological Institute|last1=Press |first1=Frank |last2=Siever |first2= Raymond|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineers set up a drilling rig and operations to assess the quantity of oil available at the site. Soon after the preliminary survey found a natural gas pocket, the ground beneath the drilling rig and camp collapsed into a wide crater and was buried.&lt;ref name="CTV News"/&gt;

Expecting dangerous releases of poisonous gases from the cavern into nearby towns, the engineers thought it best to burn the gas off. It was estimated that the gas would burn out within a few weeks, but it has instead continued to burn for more than four decades.&lt;ref name="CTV News"/&gt; 

The early years of the crater's history are uncertain:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shearlaw|first=Maeve|title=Dropping in on Turkmenistan's 'door to hell' – in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-door-to-hell-turkmenistan-in-pictures|accessdate=2017-04-29|work=The Guardian|date=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; local geologists say the collapse into a crater happened in the 1960s, and the gases were not set on fire until the 1980s. There are, however, no records available of the Soviet or Turkmen version of events.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt;

In April 2010, the [[President of Turkmenistan]], [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]], visited the site and ordered that the hole should be closed. In 2013, he declared the part of the Karakum Desert with the crater a [[nature reserve]].&lt;ref name="CTV News"/&gt; 

The crater was featured in an episode of the short-lived (2014) [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] series ''Die Trying''. In the July 16, 2014 episode "Crater of Fire", explorer [[George Kourounis]] became the first person to ever set foot at the bottom, gathering samples of [[extremophile]] microorganisms.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/07/140716-door-to-hell-darvaza-crater-george-kourounis-expedition/|title=Q&amp;A: The First-Ever Expedition to Turkmenistan's "Door to Hell"|first=|date=2014-07-16|work=|publisher=National Geographic|access-date=2017-01-28|via=|author=Christina Nunez}}&lt;/ref&gt; An edited photograph of the crater was also released as publicity for the then-upcoming [[Godzilla (2014 film)|2014 ''Godzilla'' film]], with the image depicting MONARCH agents and vehicles investigating the site.

==Effects on future development of gas==
On President Berdimuhamedow's April 2010 visit, he recommended that measures be taken to limit the crater's influence on the development of other natural gas fields in the area.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; At that time, Turkmenistan announced plans to increase its production of natural gas, intending to increase its export of gas to many countries such as [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Russia]], and [[Western Europe]], from its then yearly production level to a new production level of {{convert|225|e9m3|e12cuft|abbr=off}} by 2030.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;

'''Directional-hemispherical reflectance''' is the [[reflectance]] of a surface under direct illumination (with no diffuse component). Directional-hemispherical reflectance is the integral of the [[BRDF]] over all viewing directions. It is sometimes called "black-sky [[albedo]]". See also: [[Bi-hemispherical reflectance]]

The word '''dopplergraph''' is a combination of the words [[Doppler effect|doppler]] and [[photograph]]. Dopplergraphs are two-dimensional records of variations in the [[doppler shift]] in light intensity. Dopplergraphs do not need to be a record of the shift of visible light, but of any radiated wave, which includes [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] and acoustic waves. Since the doppler shift is caused by the velocity of the radiating source towards or away from the viewer, a dopplergraph is a picture of the velocities associated with the sources being viewed.

'''Downsizer''' is a [[virtual community]], run on a not-for-profit basis, which describes itself as "a resource for people who want to live more sustainably".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downsizer.net/About_Us/Info/About_Us/ |title=About us |accessdate=2007-03-30 |work=Downsizer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its website includes articles on [[sustainable living]] and a popular forum with over 4,500 registered members.

==History==
The site was set up in October 2004 by the founder members. Its name came from a term used in present-day English to describe a person, whose aim it is to cut down on consumer goods and live a more self-reliant and sustainable lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=March 2007}} A year after Downsizer's establishment, the ''Essex Chronicle'' remarked on the site's growth, observing that it had "tapped into an increasing awareness and interest in the impact our lives have on the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Growing concern |format=[[LexisNexis]] reprint |work=Essex Chronicle |page=11 |date=2005-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has continued to grow, and has over 4,500 users registered on its forum as of July 2011.

==Content==
Downsizer.net is a not-for-profit online community, a resource for people who want to live more sustainably. Like-minded individuals can visit the forums to discuss matters of self-sufficiency and sustainability amongst other things. The website also includes many articles related to downsizing issues including the following:

* Growing fruit and vegetables
* Raising livestock
* Recipes, Preserving, Homebrewing / Winemaking
* Foraging for wild foods
* Energy Efficiency &amp; Construction
* Fishing Shooting &amp; Trapping
* Recycling Conservation &amp; Environment

==Reviews==
The website received a positive assessment from Alison Cork in ''[[The Observer]]'', who commented on the variety of topics discussed by members and concluded, "Whether you're an individual wanting to live a more sustainable lifestyle or a small business trying to get an appreciative market for your ethical product or service, you'd be hard pushed not to find something of interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Alison Cork |title=Alison Cork's finishing touches |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/cash/story/0,6903,1598377,00.html |work=The Observer |date=2005-10-23 |accessdate=2007-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more negative stance was taken by Steve Lowe and Alan McArthur, authors of ''[[Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Shit|Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Shit?]]'' (2005). In an article in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' to promote their book, they presented the interest of "burnt-out stockbrokers" in the advice provided by Downsizer as an instance of the "mediocrity" of contemporary [[United Kingdom|British]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Steve Lowe |author2=Alan McArthur |title=Is modern life going down the pan? |format=LexisNexis reprint |page=14 (features) |work=The Sunday Times |date=2005-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">The '''Eastern Canadian Shield taiga''' is an [[ecoregion]] of [[Canada]] as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) categorization system.

==Setting==
Located in northeastern Canada, this ecoregion covers a large part of northern [[Quebec]] and most of [[Labrador]], reaching from [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]] in the west, across to [[Ungava Bay]] and east to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] coast of Labrador. This is a taiga ecoregion and therefore stops at the treeline, beyond which is [[tundra]]. This is a rugged rocky landscape including an area [[fjord]]s on the Atlantic coast of Labrador. The hills and plateaus are dotted with many lakes and [[string bog]]s, and patches of [[tundra]] on the [[Mealy Mountains]] and elsewhere.

This is a cold part of the world with average annual temperatures ranging from -6°C in Hudson Bay to 1°C on the Labrador coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Eastern Canadian Shield taiga|id=na0606|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The dominant trees of the taiga are black spruce (''[[Picea mariana]]'') and tamarack (''[[Larix laricina]]''), mixed with smaller numbers of white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]''), [[dwarf birch]]es, [[willow]]s, [[Lauraceae|laurels]], and [[rhododendron]]s. The boglands are a habitat of [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and [[sphagnum]] moss.

==Fauna==
The ecoregion is home to wildlife including [[caribou]], [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), American black bear (''[[Ursus americanus]]''), grey wolf (''[[Canis lupus]]''), red fox (''[[Vulpes vulpes]]''), Arctic fox (''[[Alopex lagopus]]''), wolverine (''[[Gulo gulo]]''), snowshoe hare (''[[Lepus americanus]]'') and colonies of seals. Of particular interest are the inland (and therefore freshwater) [[harbor seal]]s of [[Lacs des Loups Marins]] and the world's largest herd of [[Migratory woodland caribou|caribou]], the [[George River (Quebec)|George River]] herd of up to 400,000 animals. Birds include [[grouse]], osprey (''[[Pandion haliaetus]]''), raven (''[[Corvus corax]]'') and many waterbirds. In particular the rocky coast is home to breeding colonies of seabirds, including the endangered eastern population of the [[harlequin duck]] and is also on the [[Atlantic Flyway]] migratory route for birds.

==Threats and preservation==
This ecoregion is almost entirely in its natural state, apart from some areas damaged by hydro-electric power generation projects and mining activities such as the [[Voisey's Bay Mine]]. There are no substantial protected areas although the proposed [[Mealy Mountains National Park Reserve]] will be the largest park in [[Atlantic Canada]] and other parks are proposed for [[Richmond Gulf]] and the [[Clearwater Lakes]] on Hudson Bay, and [[Atikonak Lake]] on the Quebec-Labrador border.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6578">'''Environmental magnetism''' is the study of [[magnetism]] as it relates to the effects of [[climate]], [[sediment transport]], [[pollution]] and other environmental influences on magnetic minerals. It makes use of techniques from [[rock magnetism]] and [[magnetic mineralogy]]. The magnetic properties of minerals are used as proxies for environmental change in applications such as [[paleoclimate]], [[paleoceanography]], studies of the [[provenance]] of sediments, [[pollution]] and [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dekkers|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantages of using magnetic measurements are that magnetic minerals are almost ubiquitous and magnetic measurements are quick and non-invasive.

== History ==
Environmental magnetism was first identified as a distinct field in 1978 and was introduced to a wider audience by the book ''Environmental Magnetism'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oldfield|Dearing|Thompson|Garret-Jones|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|Oldfield|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has grown rapidly, finding application in and making major contributions to a range of diverse fields, especially paleoclimate, sedimentology, paleoceanography, and studies of particulate pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maher|Thompson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|Heller|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
{{Main|rock magnetism}}
Environmental magnetism is built on two parts of [[rock magnetism]]: [[magnetic mineralogy]], which looks at how basic magnetic properties depend on composition; and [[magnetic hysteresis]], which can provide details on particle size and other physical properties that also affect the hysteresis. Several parameters such as [[magnetic susceptibility]] and various kinds of [[remanence]] have been developed to represent certain features of the hysteresis.&lt;ref name=Dunlop&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|Özdemir|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maher|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parameters are then used to estimate mineral size and composition. The main contributors to the magnetic properties of rocks are the [[iron oxides]], including [[magnetite]], [[maghemite]], [[hematite]]; and [[iron sulfide]]s (particularly [[greigite]] and [[pyrrhotite]]). These minerals are strongly magnetic because, at [[room temperature]], they are magnetically ordered (magnetite, maghemite and greigite are [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnets]] while hematite is a canted [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]]).

To relate magnetic measurements to the environment, environmental magnetists have identified a variety of processes that give rise to each magnetic mineral. These include [[erosion]], [[transport]], fossil fuel combustion, and bacterial formation. The latter includes extracellular precipitation and formation of [[magnetosomes]] by [[magnetotactic bacteria]].

== Applications ==

=== Paleoclimate ===

Magnetic measurements have been used to investigate past climate. A classic example is the study of [[loess]], which is windblown dust from the edges of glaciers and semiarid desert margins. In north-central China, blankets of loess that were deposited during [[glacial periods]] alternate with [[paleosols]] (fossil soils) that formed during warmer and wetter [[interglacials]]. The [[magnetic susceptibility]] profiles of these sediments have been dated using [[magnetostratigraphy]], which identifies [[geomagnetic reversal]]s, and correlated with climate indicators such as [[Marine isotope stage|oxygen isotope stages]]. Ultimately, this work allowed environmental magnetists to map out the variations in the [[monsoon]] cycle during the [[Quaternary]].&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Magnetic measurements of lacustrine sediments can also be used to reconstruct the upland surfical processes that were associated with past climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Yong-Xiang|last2=Yu|first2=Zicheng|last3=Kodama|first3=Kenneth P.|last4=Moeller|first4=Robert E.|year=2006|title=A 14,000-year environmental change history revealed by mineral-magnetic data from WhiteLake, northwestern New Jersey, USA|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2006.03.052|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=246|pages=27–40|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.03.052|via=|bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.246...27L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First Landing State Park''' (formerly '''Seashore State Park''') offers recreational opportunities at [[Cape Henry]] in the independent city of [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]].  As the first planned state park of Virginia, First Landing is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''Seashore State Park Historic District'''. A portion of the park is listed as a [[National Natural Landmark]] as part of the '''Seashore Natural Area'''.

The state park is near the site of the first landing on April 26, 1607 of [[Christopher Newport]] and the [[Virginia Company]] colonists before establishing themselves at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. The park includes cabins, areas for camping, fishing, and swimming, a public beach, and over {{convert|19|mi|km}} of trails for hiking and biking.  Virginia's most popular state park, it's visited by over a million people each year. Its main entrance is located on Shore Drive across from the beach camping entrance. First Landing State Park charges a fee for its camping facilities and for the overnight use of its cabins.

Originally built by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in the 1930s, First Landing State Park is located on the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The park, which is Virginia's most visited state park, is nestled in Virginia Beach. First Landing offers boating, swimming, nature and history programs, hiking, biking, picnicking, a boat launch, cabins and {{convert|19|mi|km}} of trails on {{convert|2888|acre|km2}}. It also has campsites that have water and electric hook-ups and nearby access to restrooms and showers. The park's name was changed in 1997 from Seashore State Park to First Landing State Park to reflect its heritage as the first place where members of the Virginia Company landed (though its former name is still commonly used by Tidewater locals).

==History==
[[File:First Landing Cross.jpg|thumb|left|Alt=|First Landing cross]]
Development of the Seashore State Park began in 1933 by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] on {{convert|1060|acre|km2}} of donated land. Most of the workers were [[African American]] men. The new park opened on June 15, 1936. Several additions of land and adjustments of the border with [[Joint Expeditionary Base East]] resulted in the current total area of the park of {{convert|2888|acre|km2}}.

The {{convert|3598|acre|km2|adj=on}} Seashore Natural Area, a portion of which is located within the park, was listed as a [[National Natural Landmark]] in 1965. The designation recognized the significance of the park's forested dunes and semitropical vegetation.&lt;ref name=NNL_SNA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nnlandmarks/site.htm?Site=SEAS-VA |title=Seashore Natural Area |website=National Natural Landmarks |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the park's name was changed from Seashore State Park to First Landing State Park to reflect its heritage as the first place where members of the [[Virginia Company]] landed.

[[File:First Landing Cross Sign.jpg|thumb|Alt=|First Landing cross placard]]
A cross was erected in the state park by the Daughters of the American Colonists on April 26, 1935 to mark the location of the first landing by English colonists at the site, along with a placard at the base of the cross with the dates of the landing and the settlement at Jamestown, Virginia.

The Seashore State Park Historic District is a {{convert|2889|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] (comprising the entire park) with significance dating to 1933 for its architecture/engineering.  It includes work by CEGG Assoc. LC, the [[National Park Service]], and others.  It includes eight [[contributing buildings]], six [[contributing sites]] and 10 [[contributing structures]].&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

The park was the first planned state park of the Virginia State Park system.  Its plan was designed and developed with extensive consultation of the National Park Service, which provided architectural drawings and plans, and which educated about traffic circulation and other aspects of already-designed U.S. national parks.  The work of actually building roads and buildings and other structures and features of the park was accomplished by [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] workers, who were housed in three camps of 200 men each.&lt;ref name=nrhpdocVAdhr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/VirginiaBeach/134-0099_SeashoreStatePark_2005_final_nomination.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Seashore State Park Historic District / Seashore State Park / First Landing State Park |author=Kimble A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24342">'''Flexible mechanisms''', also sometimes known as '''Flexibility Mechanisms''' or '''Kyoto Mechanisms'''), refers to [[Carbon emission trading|Emissions Trading]], the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] and [[Joint Implementation]]. These are mechanisms defined under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] intended to lower the overall costs of achieving its emissions targets. These mechanisms enable Parties to achieve emission reductions or to remove carbon from the atmosphere cost-effectively in other countries. While the cost of limiting emissions varies considerably from region to region, the benefit for the atmosphere is in principle the same, wherever the action is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/items/1673.php |title=Emissions Trading |publisher=UNFCCC |accessdate=2010-04-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the negotiations on the mechanisms has been concerned with ensuring their integrity. There was concern that the mechanisms do not confer a "right to emit" on [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex 1]] Parties or lead to exchanges of fictitious credits which would undermine the Protocol’s environmental goals. The negotiators of the Protocol and the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#2001 – COP 7, Marrakech, Morocco|Marrakesh Accords]] therefore sought to design a system that fulfilled the cost-effectiveness promise of the mechanisms, while addressing concerns about environmental integrity and equity.

To participate in the mechanisms, [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex 1]] Parties must meet the following eligibility requirements:

#They must have ratified the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. 
#They must have calculated their assigned amount, as referred to in Articles 3.7 and 3.8 and Annex B of the Protocol in terms of tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent]] emissions. 
#They must have in place a national system for estimating emissions and removals of [[greenhouse gas]]es within their territory. 
#They must have in place a national registry to record and track the creation and movement of [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s, [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s, [[Assigned amount units]] and [[Removal Units]] (RMU)s and must annually report such information to the secretariat. 
#They must annually report information on emissions and removals to the secretariat.

==Emissions trading (ET)==
{{main|Carbon emissions trading}}
The Emissions Trading-mechanism allows parties to the Kyoto Protocol to buy 'Kyoto units'(emission permits for [[greenhouse gas]]) from other countries to help meet their domestic emission reduction targets.

==Project-based mechanisms==

The Protocol defines two project-based mechanisms that allow Annex I countries to meet their GHG emission reduction commitments by acquiring GHG emission reductions "[[carbon credit|credits]]." The credits are acquired by an Annex I country financing projects that reduce emissions in non-Annex I countries or other Annex I countries, or by purchasing credits from Annex I countries with excess credits. The project-based mechanisms are the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI).

The project-based mechanisms allow Annex I countries with efficient, low GHG-emitting industries, and high prevailing [[environmental standard]]s to purchase carbon credits on the world market instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically. Annex I countries typically will want to acquire carbon credits as cheaply as possible,{{According to whom|date=March 2010}} while non-Annex I countries want to maximize the value of carbon credits generated from their domestic greenhouse gas reducing projects.

===Joint Implementation (JI)===

{{main|Joint Implementation}}

Through the Joint Implementation, any Annex I country can invest in emission reduction projects (referred to as "Joint Implementation Projects") in any other Annex I country as an alternative to reducing emissions domestically.

===Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)===

{{main|Clean Development Mechanism}}

Through the CDM, countries can meet their domestic emission reduction targets by buying greenhouse gas reduction units from (projects in) non [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I]] countries to the [[Kyoto protocol]] (mostly developing countries). Non-Annex I countries have no GHG emission restrictions, but have financial incentives to develop GHG emission reduction projects to receive [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s that can then be sold to Annex I countries, encouraging [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;Only CDM Executive Board-accredited Certified Emission Reductions (CER) can be bought and sold in this manner. Under the aegis of the UN, Kyoto established this [[Bonn|Bonn-based]] Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board to assess and approve projects ("CDM Projects") in non-Annex I countries prior to awarding CERs.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon market==

Kyoto provides for a 'cap and trade' system which imposes national caps on the emissions of annex I countries. On average, this cap requires countries to reduce their emissions by 5.2% below their 1990 baseline over the 2008 to 2012 period. Although these caps are national-level commitments, in practice, most countries will devolve their emissions targets to individual industrial entities, such as a power plant or paper factory. One example of a 'cap and trade' system is the '[[EU ETS]]'. Other schemes may follow suit in time.

The ultimate buyers of [[Carbon credit|credits]] are often individual companies that expect emissions to exceed their quota, their assigned allocation units, AAUs or 'allowances' for short. Typically, they will purchase credits directly from another party with excess allowances, from a broker, from a JI/CDM developer, or on an exchange.

National governments, some of whom may not have devolved responsibility for meeting Kyoto obligations to industry, and that have a net deficit of allowances, will buy credits for their own account, mainly from JI/CDM developers. These deals are occasionally done directly through a national fund or agency, as in the case of the Dutch government's ERUPT programme, or via collective funds such as the World Bank’s [[Prototype Carbon Fund]] (PCF). The PCF, for example, represents a consortium of six governments and 17 major utility and energy companies on whose behalf it purchases credits.

Since allowances and carbon credits are tradeable instruments with a transparent price, financial investors can buy them on the [[spot market]] for speculation purposes, or link them to [[futures contracts]]. A high volume of trading in this secondary market helps [[price discovery]] and liquidity, and in this way helps to keep down costs and set a clear price signal in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which helps businesses to plan investments. This market has grown substantially, with banks, brokers, funds, arbitrageurs and private traders now participating in a market valued at about $60 billion in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointcarbon.com/ Point Carbon] Market news&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions Trading PLC, for example, was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s AIM market in 2005 with the specific remit of investing in emissions instruments.

Although Kyoto created a framework and a set of rules for a global carbon market, there are in practice several distinct schemes or markets in operation today, with varying degrees of linkages among them.

Kyoto enables a group of several annex I countries to create a market-within-a-market together. The EU elected to be treated as such a group, and created the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme|EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (ETS). The EU ETS uses EAUs (EU Allowance Units), each equivalent to a Kyoto AAU. The scheme went into operation on 1 January 2005, although a forward market has existed since 2003.

The UK established its own learning-by-doing voluntary scheme, the UK ETS, which ran from 2002 through 2006. This market existed alongside the EU's scheme, and participants in the UK scheme have the option of applying to opt out of the first phase of the EU ETS, which lasts through 2007{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

The sources of Kyoto credits are the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) and [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) projects. The CDM allows the creation of new carbon credits by developing emission reduction projects in non-annex I countries, while JI allows project-specific credits to be converted from existing credits within annex I countries. CDM projects produce Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), and JI projects produce Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), each equivalent to one AAU. Kyoto CERs are also accepted for meeting EU ETS obligations, and ERUs will become similarly valid from 2008 for meeting ETS obligations (although individual countries may choose to limit the number and source of CER/JIs they will allow for compliance purposes starting from 2008). CERs/ERUs are overwhelmingly bought from project developers by funds or individual entities, rather than being exchange-traded like allowances.

Since the creation of Kyoto is subject to a lengthy process of registration and certification by the [[UNFCCC]], and the projects themselves require several years to develop, this market is at this point largely a forward market where purchases are made at a discount to their equivalent currency, the EUA, and are almost always subject to certification and delivery (although up-front payments are sometimes made). According to IETA, the market value of CDM/JI credits transacted in 2004 was EUR 245&amp;nbsp;m; it is estimated that more than EUR 620&amp;nbsp;m worth of credits were transacted in 2005.

Several non-Kyoto carbon markets are in existence or being planned, and these are likely to grow in importance and numbers in the coming years. These include the [[New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme]], the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] and [[Western Climate Initiative]] in the United States and Canada, the [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] and the State of California’s [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006|recent initiative]] to reduce emissions.

These initiatives taken together may create a series of partly linked markets, rather than a single carbon market. The common theme is the adoption of market-based mechanisms centered on carbon credits that represent a reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. The fact that some of these initiatives have similar approaches to certifying their credits makes it possible that carbon credits in one market may in the long run be tradeable in other schemes. The scheme would broaden the current carbon market far more than the current focus on the CDM/JI and EU ETS domains. An obvious precondition, however, is a realignment of penalties and fines to similar levels,since these create an effective ceiling for each market.

==Views on the flexibility mechanisms==

{{See also|Views on the Kyoto Protocol}}

As stated in the [[flexible mechanisms|lede]], one of the main arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that of cost-effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;
Toth ''et al.'' summarize the arguments for and against flexibility: {{citation
 | at=[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/441.htm Sec 10.4.4. Where Should the Response Take Place? The Relationship between Domestic Mitigation and the Use of International Mechanisms]
 | chapter=Ch 10: Decision-making Frameworks
 | author=Toth, F.L.
|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC TAR WG3|2001}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of cost-effectiveness is included in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ([[UNFCCC]]).&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation

 | chapter=Ch 1: Setting the Stage: Climate Change and Sustainable Development
 | author=Banuri, T.
|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC TAR WG3|2001}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The economic basis of costs being reduced through flexibility is discussed in [[emissions trading#Applying the economic theory]] and [[economics of climate change mitigation#Flexibility]].

A number of concerns were raised about flexibility in the lead-up to negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
 | at=Sec 3.5.7 Joint implementation by industrialized and developing countries
 | chapter=Ch 3: Equity and Social Considerations
 | author=Banuri, T.
|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996|pp=111–112}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of issues raised were that of domestic emissions reductions in the developed countries, and the issue of developed countries effectively taking up all the low-cost emissions reductions in developing countries.&lt;ref name="banuri joint implementation"&gt;
{{citation
 | at=Sec 3.5.7.1 Allocation issues
 | chapter=Ch 3: Equity and Social Considerations
 | author=Banuri, T.
|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996|p=111}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the first view was that most emissions reductions should occur first in the developed countries - this would encourage the development of low-carbon energy technologies which could then be taken up later on by developing counties.&lt;ref name="banuri joint implementation"/&gt; The second idea was that all of the low-cost emissions reductions in developing countries would, in effect, be stolen by the developed countries.&lt;ref name="banuri joint implementation"/&gt; Thus, when it came time for developing countries to take on their own commitments to reduce emissions, it would be more costly for them to do so.&lt;ref name="banuri joint implementation"/&gt;

Differing views on flexibility were summarized in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s (IPCC) [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
 | at=Sec 1.5.5 Carbon taxes and tradable permits
 | chapter=Ch 1: Introduction: Scope of the Assessment
 | author=Goldemberg, J.
|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996|pp=37–39}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The basic economic argument in favour of flexibility was that, in principle at least, issues to do with fairness ("[[equity (economics)|equity]]" in the language of economics) could be separated from efficiency (i.e., reducing emissions most cheaply).&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
 | at=Sec 1.3.4.2 Paying for an international public good
 | chapter=Ch 1: Introduction: Scope of the Assessment
 | author=Goldemberg, J.
|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996|p=29}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From this viewpoint, flexibility through [[emissions trading]] could promote efficiency, while arguments of equity could be partially addressed through, for example, the allocations of emissions rights between different countries.&lt;ref&gt;
Halsnæs ''et al.'' (2007) highlight some of the flaws in this argument: {{citation
 | at=[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch2s2-6-5.html Sec 2.6.5 Economic efficiency and eventual trade-offs with equity]
 | chapter=Ch 2: Framing Issues
 | author=Halsnæs, K.
|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG3|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Spash|2010}} also contains a critique of carbon trading.
&lt;/ref&gt;

During negotiations, the US was a supporter of flexibility,&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; while several other negotiating parties were in favour of uniform emissions cuts (e.g., the [[Alliance of Small Island States]], ASIS).&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, flexibility was incorporated into Kyoto's design, but the treaty still places an emphasis on developed countries achieving the bulk of their emissions reductions domestically, rather than in developing countries (i.e., by using the [[Clean Development Mechanism]], CDM).&lt;ref name="spash domestic v international"&gt;
{{harvnb|Spash|2010|p=184}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The balance between domestic emissions reductions in developed countries and reductions through the CDM is not, however, quantified.&lt;ref name="spash domestic v international"/&gt;

===Issues raised since implementation===

Since the implementation of the flexibility mechanisms, a number of other concerns have been raised. There have been various criticisms of the CDM (see [[Clean Development Mechanism]] for details). These include excess profits generated by CDM projects designed to reduce emissions of industrial gases,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms have also been made of the various emissions trading schemes set-up by developed countries to meet their first-round Kyoto targets.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Newbery (2009) was critical of the EU Emissions Trading System, which, in its first-phase, generated [[windfall profit]]s for [[Electric utility|electric utilities]]: {{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are discussed in the individual articles on these trading schemes: see [[Kyoto Protocol#International Emissions Trading]] for a list of these trading schemes. For example, the [[environmental organization]] [[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)]] has called for the EU Emissions Trading System ([[EU ETS]]) to be scrapped, and be replaced by other policies (e.g., [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] [[standardization|standards]]), which they argue would be more effective than the EU ETS at reducing emissions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Future==
The second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends in 2020. Due to this, negotiations are underway to have the role of Flexible Mechanisms continue in some form under the [[Paris_Agreement]]. All though not yet worked out (at the moment of writing; november 2016), This should be possible as both article 5 and 6 call for a similar mechanism to be created. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gret.org/2016/05/what-role-do-carbon-markets-play-in-the-paris-agreement/?lang=en Flexible mechanisms under Paris Climate Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fossil Fuel Beta '''('''FFß''') measures the percent change in excess (market-adjusted) stock returns for every 1 percent increase in fossil fuel prices. 
For example, if a company (or industry) has an FFß of –0.20, then a 1 percent increase in fossil fuel prices should produce, on average, a 0.2% decline in the firm’s stock price over and above the impact arising from fossil fuel price swing on the stock market as a whole. (Conversely, a 1 percent decrease in fossil fuel prices should produce, on average, an equivalent increase in stock price.) 

Converting the FFß into a hypothetical ‘[[Earnings per share]]-equivalent’ based on a fixed percent change in fossil fuel prices, it is possible to compare earnings-at-risk for individual companies with their competitors, or even industries with each other.

==Rationale==

Three common fossil fuels — coal, petroleum and natural gas — produce more than four-fifths of all carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions. Achieving meaningful reductions in [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions requires abating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the dominant greenhouse gas globally, accounting for over 75% of GHG emissions (IPCC [2007]). Nearly 95% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in the US is generated by fossil fuel combustion (Metcalf [2009]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries such as the US, companies are the largest emitters of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (2009), in 2007, electricity, transportation, industry, and commercial sectors – all primarily populated by companies – accounted for nearly 90% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in the US. Agriculture and residential sectors accounted for the remaining.&lt;/ref&gt; By linking earnings-per-share (EPS) to fossil fuel price volatility, FFß highlights a potential economic payoff for reducing or hedging the use of fossil fuels, and hence CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. FFß can also underscore adverse economic consequences to companies that fail to manage carbon footprints.

==History==

The FFß was created by [http://faculty.tuck.dartmouth.edu/anant-sundaram/ Professor Anant Sundaram] of the [[Tuck School of Business]] at [[Dartmouth College]], with support from the [http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/initiative/index.html Allwin Initiative for Corporate Citizenship]. 

''CFO Magazine'' (a division of the ''Economist'') published the first FFß scorecard in its [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/12667500/c_12671474 December 2008 issue]. The scorecard was computed for 135 [[S&amp;P 500]] firms in ten industries, using a simple market model in which a firm's [[excess returns]] are calculated by subtracting aggregate market returns from the firm's returns. A slightly more sophisticated analysis calculates the firm’s excess returns by subtracting returns predicted by an asset pricing model such as the [[Capital Asset Pricing Model]], or CAPM. This latter analysis, for all the firms in the S&amp;P500 can be found [http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/anant.sundaram/pdf/CAPM-Adjusted_2008_SP500_FFB.pdf here].

==Calculation==

Calculating market value and EPS impact of fossil fuel price changes uses publicly available data on stock returns, analyst earnings estimates, and fossil fuel producer prices. Steps are:

* Calculate excess stock market returns for the company. Excess returns are defined as raw returns minus the returns predicted by an asset pricing model such as the market model or the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]];
* Calculate FFß. This is the coefficient in a statistical [[regression analysis]] in which the company’s excess returns is the [[dependent variable]] and percentage change in fossil fuel prices (call it ∆FF Price) is the [[independent variable]]. The regression equation is Excess Return = α + FFß×(∆FF Price) + ε
* Calculate the change in market value (∆Market Val) associated with, say, a 10% increase in fossil fuel prices. ∆Market Val = (Market Val)×(FFß)×(10)
* Calculate the impact on forecasted EPS for the forthcoming year (∆EPS) as &lt;br /&gt;   ∆EPS = (∆Market Val) ÷ ((# Shares Outstanding) × ([[PE Ratio]])) where the PE Ratio is from consensus analyst estimates.

==Implications for climate change==

If we expect that fossil fuel prices will rise over time and that there will be a meaningful price on GHG emissions from a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system, energy-consuming businesses will generally want to reduce their dependence on GHG-producing fossil fuels. In that context, a firm that is focused on its underlying product-market and competitive strategy (rather than extraneous variables such as energy prices) might attempt to decouple itself from cash flow and return effects of fossil fuel price changes. Over the long run, such a firm would seek to gravitate to a zero FFß. Actions it might take include implementing operational strategies such as achieving greater fuel efficiency and shifting to renewable energy sources, or financial strategies such as hedging fossil fuel purchases.

Success in decoupling stock returns from fossil fuel price changes will have implications for [[statistical significance]] of the coefficient in the regression to calculate the FFß: the regression coefficient will not be significantly different from zero for companies that have successfully gravitated to a zero-FFß. (Of course, the normal tests of statistical significance of difference from zero will apply for betas that are inferred to be positive or negative).

==FFßs for energy consumers vs. energy producers==
{{or section|date=August 2018}}
===Energy consumers===

Energy-consuming companies should generally have neutral-to-negative FFßs.
Energy is not only an input cost, but higher energy prices also increase the price of other raw materials. If a company cannot pass through in its pricing the effects of energy and raw material price increases, its profit margin will decline. There is also a [[substitution effect]]. Because consumers pay more for energy use when fossil fuel prices rise, they have less to spend on the firm’s products, thus negatively impacting profits and margins. The combination of these two effects for energy-consuming firms produces a decline in stock price when energy prices rise. 

Some energy-consuming firms could be insulated from these impacts, and may have neutral (or even positive) FFßs. They may have hedged their cash flow exposure to price increases via financial hedges or by operational hedges to reduce dependence on fossil fuel use. Their market power might be higher, or the price elasticity of demand for their products might be so low as to enable them to pass on the effect of cost increases. It is also possible that a company’s business model benefits from the macroeconomic effects of an energy price increase: for instance, a company with lower-priced product offerings might find demand increasing in harder economic times as consumers switch from higher-priced alternatives.

===Energy producers===

Energy-producing companies, on the other hand, should generally have neutral-to-positive betas. If the fossil fuel price increase is the result of an increase in demand for energy, higher prices will lead to higher profits. [[Price elasticity of demand]] may be lower than average in energy-producing industries since it is a widely used (and essential) good with no short-term substitutes. 

Some energy producers, e.g., electric utilities, may have margins protected by regulation that allows them to price on a ‘cost-plus’ basis. Such factors allow energy producers to pass on cost increases to consumers. Energy-producing industries also generally tend to be capital intensive. This capital-intensity could create entry barriers, giving them greater [[pricing power]]. For all these reasons, the net impact of fossil fuel price increases on energy producers is to maintain or increase margins, and thereby, their stock prices. Finally, many energy producers own fossil fuel reserves. Higher fossil fuel prices will have a direct positive impact  on their share prices by increasing the market value of reserve assets.

==FFß scorecard example==

Here is an example showing two companies in the retailing sector as it appeared in the [http://www.cfo.com/media/pdf/0812FFBetaCharts.pdf ''CFO scorecard'']. It shows the hypothetical EPS impact of a 10% increase in fossil fuel prices.

Given likely high dependence on fossil fuels because of reliance on transportation and storage, as well as heating or cooling commercial buildings, firms in the retailing sector would be expected to have a negative FFß, on average. Yet, there is considerable variance within the industry. Some firms in the industry – e.g., Wal-mart – even have non-negative FFßs.

As the [http://www.cfo.com/media/pdf/0812FFBetaCharts.pdf scorecard] shows, petroleum producers and electric utilities have generally positive FFßs. On the other hand, heavy energy-consuming industries such as heavy manufacturing, retailing, aerospace/defense, and airlines have negative FFßs, while industries such as food/beverages and drugs with their neutral FFßs, seem relatively immune to fossil fuel price changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">'''Hard inheritance''' was a model of [[heredity]] that explicitly excludes any acquired characteristics, such as of [[Lamarckism]]. It is the exact opposite of [[soft inheritance]], coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] to contrast ideas about [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]].

Hard inheritance states that characteristics of an organism's offspring (passed on through [[DNA]]) will not be affected by the actions that the [[parental]] [[organism]] performs during its lifetime. For example: a medieval [[blacksmith]] who uses only his right arm to [[forge]] [[steel]] will not sire a son with a stronger right arm than left because the blacksmith's actions do not alter his genetic code. Inheritance due to usage and non-usage is excluded. Inheritance works as described in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis of evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1980). Provine, William B.; Mayr, Ernst. ed.

The existence of inherited [[epigenetics|epigenetic variants]] has led to renewed interest in soft inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. J. (May 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3791">'''Kautsky effect''' (also named, ''fluorescence transient'', ''fluorescence induction'' or ''fluorescence decay'') is a phenomenon consisting on a typical variation on the behavior of a plant fluorescence when is exposed to light. It was discovered in 1931 by H. Kautsky and A. Hirsch.

When dark-adapted photosynthesising cells are illuminated with continuous light, [[chlorophyll fluorescence]] displays characteristic changes in intensity accompanying the induction of photosynthetic activity.

==Application of Kautsky effect==
The quantum yield of photosynthesis, which is also the photochemical quenching of fluorescence, is calculated through the following equation:

Φ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = (F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;

F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the low fluorescence intensity, which is measured by a short light flash that is not strong enough to cause photochemistry, and thus induces fluorescence. F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum fluorescence that can be obtained from a sample by measuring the highest intensity of fluorescence after a saturating flash. The difference between the measured values is the variable fluorescence F&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;.

When a sample (leaf or algal suspension) is illuminated, the fluorescence intensity increases with a time constant in the microsecond or millisecond range. After a few seconds the intensity decreases and reaches a steady-state level. The initial rise of the fluorescence intensity is attributed to the progressive saturation of the [[reaction center]]s of [[photosystem 2]] (PSII). Therefore, [[photochemical quenching]] increases with the time of illumination, with a corresponding increase of the fluorescence intensity. The slow decrease of the fluorescence intensity at later times is caused, in addition to other processes, by [[non-photochemical quenching]]. Non-photochemical quenching is a protection mechanism in photosynthetic organisms as they have to avoid the adverse effect of excess light. Which components contribute and in which quantities remains an active but controversial area of research. It is known that [[carotenoids]] and the [[special pigment pairs]] (e.g. [[P700]]) have functions in [[photoprotection]].

The '''Kitadani Formation''' is a [[Geological formation|unit]] of [[Lower Cretaceous]] sedimentary rock which crops out near the city of [[Katsuyama,_Fukui|Katsuyama]] in the [[Fukui Prefecture]] of [[Japan]], and it is the primary source of [[Cretaceous]]-aged [[Terrestrial animal|non-marine]] vertebrate fossils in Japan. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation, but it also preserves a diverse assemblage of plants, invertebrates, and other vertebrates.&lt;ref name="cretaceousdistribution"&gt;Weishampel, D.B.; et al. (2004). "Dinosaur distribution (Early Cretaceous, Asia)." In: Weishampel, D.B.; Dodson, P.; and Osmólska, H. (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 563-570. {{ISBN|0-520-24209-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most, if not all, of the fossil specimens collected from the Kitadani Formation are reposited at the [[Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dinosaur.pref.fukui.jp/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kitadani Formation is a unit within the Akaiwa Subgroup of the Tetori Group, a major sequence of [[Mesozoic]]-aged rocks which is distributed across the Fukui, [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], and [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]] [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] of western-central [[Honshu]], Japan. The Tetori Group exhibits marked lateral variation, and the Kitadani Formation is only present in the Fukui Prefecture.&lt;ref name="”kusuhashietal2002”" /&gt; The Kitadani Formation comprises interbedded [[Tuff|tuffs]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], and [[Shale|shales]] and reaches a maximum thickness of approximately 100 m (~328 feet).&lt;ref name="”kusuhashietal2002”" /&gt; It conformably overlies the Akaiwa Formation and is unconformably overlain by the Omichidani Formation.&lt;ref name=tsubamotoetal2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsubamoto|first=T.|last2=Rougier|first2=G.W.|last3=Isaji|first3=S.|last4=Manabe|first4=M.|last5=Forasiepi|first5=A.M.|year=2004|title=New Early Cretaceous spalacotheriid “symmetrodont” mammal from Japan|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica|volume=49|issue=3|pages=329-346}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kitadani Formation is significant because it is the major source of dinosaur fossils in Japan and because of Japan's unique position along the northeastern margin of [[Eurasia]] during the Early Cretaceous.

==Geology==

The '''Kitadani Formation''' is a unit within the '''Tetori Group''', a [[Middle Jurassic]] to [[Lower Cretaceous]] sequence of predominantly sedimentary rock which crops out in the [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], and [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]] [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] of west-central [[Honshu]], Japan in the region surrounding [[Mount Haku]].&lt;ref name="”kusuhashietal2002”" /&gt; The Tetori Group comprises, in ascending stratigraphic order:

* [[Middle Jurassic|Middle]] to [[Upper Jurassic]] '''Kuzuryū Subgroup'''
* [[Upper Jurassic]] to [[Lower Cretaceous]] '''Itoshiro Subgroup'''
* [[Lower Cretaceous]] '''Akaiwa Subgroup'''

The formations present within the Akaiwa Subgroup vary laterally, and the Kitadani Formation crops out only in the [[Kuzuryū River]] district of the Fukui Prefecture. In this region, the Akaiwa Subgroup comprises, in ascending stratigraphic order, the '''[[Akaiwa Formation]]''' and Kitadani Formation.&lt;ref name="”kusuhashietal2002”" /&gt; Here, the Kitadani Formation comprises alternating horizons of red-brown [[Tuff|tuffs]], blackish [[shale|shales]] and [[sandstone|sandstones]], and thin [[coal]] beds. The sandstones within the Kitadani Formation are light gray and green and range in [[clast]] size from fine to coarse. The type section of the Kitadani Formation occurs along the Nakanomatadani branch of the Takinami River&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:%E6%BB%9D%E6%B3%A2%E5%B7%9D]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=July 2018}} near the city of [[Katsuyama,_Fukui|Katsuyama]], where it is approximately 100 m (~328 feet) in thickness. The Kitadani Formation conformably overlies the Akaiwa Formation and is unconformably overlain by the '''Omichidani Formation'''.&lt;ref name="”kusuhashietal2002”" /&gt;

The Kitadani Formation has had varying nomenclature throughout the history of its study.&lt;ref name="”kusuhashietal2002”" /&gt; In the early stratigraphic literature on the Tetori Group, the Kitadani Formation was variably referred to as the "Lower part of the Omichidani Formation"&lt;ref name=”maeda1953”&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maeda|first=S.|year=1953|title=The Mesozoic in north of Katsuyama, Fukui Prefecture|journal=Journal of the Geological Society of Japan|volume=59|pages=323-324}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the "Chinaboradani Alternation of Tuff, Shale, and Sandstone"&lt;ref name=”maeda1957”&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maeda|first=S.|year=1957|title=Stratigraphy and geological structure of the Tetori Group along the Uchinami and Itoshiro rivers|journal=Journal of the Geological Society of Japan|volume=63|pages=357-365}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the "Kitadani Alternation of Sandstone, Shale, and Tuff"&lt;ref name=”maeda1958”&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maeda|first=S.|year=1958|title=Stratigraphy and geological structure of the Tetori Group in the Hakusan district (Part 1. Stratigrphy)|journal=Journal of the Geological Society of Japan|volume=64|pages=583-594}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and simply the "Kitadani Alternation"&lt;ref name=”maeda1961”&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maeda|first=S.|year=1961|title=On the geological history of the Mesozoic Tetori Group in Japan|journal=Journal of College of Arts and Sciences, Chiba University|volume=3|pages=396-426}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to its designation as a formation.&lt;ref name="”kusuhashietal2002”" /&gt;

==Age==

The Kitadani Formation was biostratigraphically dated to the late [[Barremian]] and early [[Aptian]] ages of the [[Early Cretaceous|Early Cretaceous Epoch]] in 2002 based upon the presence of the freshwater [[bivalve]] ''Nippononaia ryosekiana''.&lt;ref name=”kozaietal2002”&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozai|first=T.|last2=Ishida|first2=K.|last3=Park|first3=S.O.|last4=Chang|first4=K.H.|year=2002|title=Early Cretaceous non-marine bivalves from Korea and Japan|journal=Abstracts of the 2002 Meeting of the Palaeontological Society of Japan|pages=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, part of the Kitadani Formation was biostratigraphically dated to the [[Barremian|Barremian Age]] based upon the occurrence of the [[charophyte]] gyrogonite ''Clavator harrisii reyi'' in association with other charophytes.&lt;ref name=”Kubota2005”&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kubota|first=K.|year=2005|title=Charophyte gyrogonites from the Lower Cretaceous Kitadani Formation of the Tetori Group in the Takinamigawa area, Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture, central Japan|journal=Paleontological Research|volume=9|issue=2|pages=203-213}}&lt;/ref&gt; These biostratigraphic age assignments are supported by [[Fission track dating|zircon fission track]] radioisotopic ages of [[tuff]], which date the Kitadani Formation the 127-115 Ma.&lt;ref name=”Fujita2003”&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fujita|first=M.|year=2003|title=Geological age of the vertebrate-bearing horizons in the Tetori Group|journal=Memoirs of the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum|volume=2|pages=3-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossil Assemblage==

The Kitadani Formation preserves a diverse assemblage of plant fossils; invertebrate fossils; and vertebrate body and trace fossils, including [[Mammalia|mammals]], [[Testudines|turtles]], [[Neosuchia|neosuchian reptiles]], and [[Dinosauria|dinosaurs]]. Many vertebrate specimens from the Kitadani Formation are incomplete and poorly preserved, so taxonomic diversity is likely higher than it seems.

===Plant Fossils===
The plant fossil assemblage of the Kitadani Formation is characterized by a rarity of [[ferns]] and an abundance of [[cycadales]] and [[conifers]] represented mostly by cones and shoots.&lt;ref&gt; Yabe, A., Terada, K. and Sekido, S., 2003: The Tetori-type flora, revisited: a review. ''Memoir of the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum'', 2:23–42.&lt;/ref&gt; A palynological study in 2013 resulted in the identification of greater than 40 species of spores, pollen grains, and plant fragments from the Kitadani Formation representing gymnosperms, freshwater algae, and epiphyllous fungus; however, no angiosperm pollen was identified.&lt;ref&gt;Legrand, J., Pons, D., Terada, K., Yabe, A. and Nishida, H., 2013: Lower Cretaceous (Upper Barremian-Lower Aptian?) palynoflora from the Kitadani Formation (Tetori Group, Inner Zone of Central Japan). ''Paleontological Research'', vol. 17, p. 201–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Branches of the conifer [[Brachyphyllum|''Brachyphyllum obesum'']] have been recovered, which was interpreted to represent the warming and possible drying of the climate toward the upper Tetori Group.&lt;ref&gt;Yabe, A. and Kubota, K., 2004: Brachyphyllum obesum, newly discovered thermophilic conifer branch from the Lower Cretaceous Kitadani Formation of the Tetori Group, central Japan. ''Memoir of the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum'' 3:23–29.  &lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is supported by the lack of plants from lower in the Tetori Group, such as [[ginkgo|ginkgos]], in the Kitadani Formation.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, S. Shibata, M., Azuma, Y., Yukawa, H., Sekiya, T. and Masaoka, Y., 2015, Sedimentary environment of dinosaur fossil bearing successions of the Lower Cretaceous Kitadani Formation, Tetori Group, Katsuyama City, Fukui, Japan. ''Memoir of the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum'' 14:1-9. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Invertebrate Fossils===
The invertebrate fossil assemblage of the Kitadani Formation mostly comprises [[freshwater]] and [[brackish]] water [[bivalve]] and [[gastropod]] [[mollusks]].&lt;ref&gt;Azuma Y. 2003. Early Cretaceous vertebrate remains from Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture, Japan. Mem Fukui Prefect Dinosaur Mus. 2:17–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertebrate Fossils===
====Mammalia====
At least three mammalian taxa have been recovered from the Kitadani Formation, represented by rare teeth and partial jaws. In 2004, the [[spalacotheriid]] "[[symmetrodont]]" ''Symmetrolestes parvus'' was reported based upon a fragmentary right [[mandible]] with the first incisor and five postcanine teeth preserved.&lt;ref&gt;T. Tsubamoto, G. W. Rougier, S. Isaji, M. Manabe, and A. M. Forasiepi. 2004. New Early Cretaceous spalacotheriid "symmetrodont" mammal from Japan. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 49(3):329-346&lt;/ref&gt; Two non-therian mammal specimens were reported in 2015, including an [[Eobaataridae| eobaatarid]] [[multituberculate]] and a [[Triconodontidae|triconodontid]] [[eutriconodontan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazunori Miyata, Yoichi Azuma &amp; Masateru Shibata (2015) New mammalian specimens from the Lower Cretaceous Kitadani Formation, Tetori Group, Fukui, Japan, Historical Biology, 28:1-2, 139-150, DOI: 10.1080/08912963.2015.1012509
&lt;/ref&gt;. These specimens were noted as possessing non-tribosphenic dentition, and were interpreted being taxonomically distinct to closely related taxa from elsewhere in the Tetori Group, but neither specimen was named. The eobaatarid is represented only by a damaged left [[premolar]].  The triconodontid is represented by a partial right dentary possessing a faint [[Meckelian groove]].

====Testudines====
Turtles are represented mostly by shell fragments within the Kitadani Formation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonoda T, Azuma Y, Hirayama R, Ando H. (2015) New trionychoid specimens and turtle fauna from the Lower Cretaceous Kitadani Formation of the Tetori Group in central Japan. PeerJ PrePrints 3:e949v1 https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.949v1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirayama, R. (2002) Preliminary report of the fossil turtles from the Kitadani Formation (Early
Cretaceous) of the Tetori Group of Katsuyama, Fukui Prefecture, Central Japan. Memoirs of the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum. 1: 29-40.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a preliminary evaluation of fragmentary specimens resulted in the identification of the taxa ''[[Adocus]]'', ''[[Basilemys]]'', and [[Trionychidae]]. A more recent evaluation of all 700+ turtle specimens from the Kitadani Formation was conducted in 2015. In that study, the authors concluded that the turtle assemblage of the Kitadani Formation consists of four trionychoid taxa and two other [[Eucryptodira|eucryptodires]]. In addition to the genera reported in 2002, ''Perochelys'', ''Gobiapalone'', ''Apalonina'', and an unnamed nanhsiungchelyid were identified.

====Eusuchia====
A nearly complete skeleton of a [[goniopholidid]] eusuchian has been noted from the Kitadani Formation, but this material remains formally unpublished and unnamed.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Y. 1998. A new goniopholid from the Early Cretaceous Kitadani Formation, Fukui Prefecture, Japan. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 18 (3): 56A.&lt;/ref&gt; This specimen was discovered in 1982, and it was hypothesized to be closely related to ''[[Sunosuchus]]'', ''[[Goniopholis]]'', and ''[[Eutretauranosuchus]]'' based on a preliminary phylogenetic analysis.

====Dinosauria====
Dinosaurs are among the most well-known vertebrate taxa from the Kitadani Formation. Taxa from all three majors dinosaurian clades have been recovered, including [[theropods]], [[sauropodomorphs]], and [[ornithischians]].&lt;ref name="cretaceousdistribution"/&gt; 

Among theropods, two taxa have been named, and other indeterminate dromaeosaurid and other theropod material is preserved. ''[[Fukuiraptor|Fukuiraptor kitadanensis]]'' was reported in 2000 based upon a partial skull and associated partial postcranium.&lt;ref&gt;Currie, P.J.; Azuma, Y. (2006). "New specimens, including a growth series, of Fukuiraptor (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous Kitadani Quarry of Japan". J. Paleont. Soc. Korea. 22 (1): 173–193&lt;/ref&gt; The phylogenetic relationships of ''Fukuiraptor'' are poorly resolved. It was originally assigned the [[wastebasket taxon]] [[Megaraptora]], but subsequent phylogenetic analyses have suggested that it and all other "megaraptorans" may be [[allosauroids]] or non-[[Tyrannosauroidea|tyrannosaurian]] [[coelurosaurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Apesteguía, Sebastián; Smith, Nathan D.; Valieri, Rubén Juárez; Makovicky, Peter J. (2016-07-13). "An Unusual New Theropod with a Didactyl Manus from the Upper Cretaceous of Patagonia, Argentina". PLOS ONE. 11 (7): e0157793.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fukuivenator|Fukuivenator paradoxus]]'' was reported in 2016, and it is interpreted to be an early-diverging [[maniraptoran]].&lt;ref&gt;Azuma, Y., Xu X., Shibata, M., Kawabe, S., Miyata, K., and Imai, T. 2016. "A bizarre theropod from the Early Cretaceous of Japan highlighting mosaic evolution among coelurosaurians."

The process of a [[Laminar flow|laminar]] flow becoming [[turbulent]] is known as '''laminar–turbulent transition'''. This is an extraordinarily complicated process, which at present is not fully understood. However, as the result of many decades of intensive research, certain features have become gradually clear, and it is known that the process proceeds through a series of stages.  "Transitional flow" can refer to transition in either direction, that is laminar–turbulent transitional or turbulent–laminar transitional flow.

While the process applies to any fluid flow, it is most often used in the context of [[boundary layer]]s due to their ubiquity in real fluid flows and their importance in many fluid-dynamic processes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==History==
[[File:Reynolds fluid turbulence experiment 1883.jpg|thumb|Reynolds’ 1883 experiment on fluid dynamics in pipes]]
[[File:Reynolds observations turbulence 1883.svg|thumb|Reynolds’ 1883 observations of the nature of the flow in his experiments]]
In 1883 [[Osborne Reynolds]] demonstrated the transition to turbulent flow in a classic experiment in which he examined the behaviour of water flow under different flow rates using a small jet of dyed water introduced into the centre of flow in a larger pipe.

The larger pipe was glass, so the behaviour of the layer of dyed flow could be observed, and at the end of this pipe was a flow-control valve used to vary the water velocity inside the tube.  When the velocity was low, the dyed layer remained distinct through the entire length of the large tube. When the velocity was increased, the layer broke up at a given point and diffused throughout the fluid's cross-section. The point at which this happened was the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow. Reynolds identified the governing parameter for the onset of this effect, which was a dimensionless constant later called the [[Reynolds number]].

Reynolds found that the transition occurred between Re&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2000 and 13000, depending on the smoothness of the entry conditions. When extreme care is taken, the transition can even happen with Re as high as 40000. On the other hand, Re&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2000 appears to be about the lowest value obtained at a rough entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|place=New York (USA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds' publications in fluid dynamics began in the early 1870s. His final theoretical model published in the mid-1890s is still the standard mathematical framework used today. Examples of titles from his more groundbreaking reports are:
:''Improvements in Apparatus for Obtaining Motive Power from Fluids and also for Raising or Forcing Fluids'' (1875)
:''An experimental investigation of the circumstances which determine whether the motion of water in parallel channels shall be direct or sinuous and of the law of resistance in parallel channels'' (1883)
:''On the dynamical theory of incompressible viscous fluids and the determination of the criterion'' (1895)

==Transition stages in a boundary layer==
[[File:Path to transition.png|thumb|alt=Morkovin's path to transition|The path from receptivity to laminar-turbulent transition as illustrated by Morkovin, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Morkovin M. V., Reshotko E., Herbert T. 1994. "Transition in open flow systems—a reassessment". ''Bull. Am. Phys. Soc.'' 39:1882.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A boundary layer can transition to turbulence through a number of paths. Which path is realized physically depends on the initial conditions such as initial disturbance amplitude and surface roughness. The level of understanding of each phase varies greatly, from near complete understanding of primary mode growth to a near-complete lack of understanding of [[Bypass Transition|bypass mechanisms]].

===Receptivity===
The initial stage of the natural transition process is known as the Receptivity phase and consists of the transformation of environmental disturbances – both acoustic (sound) and [[Vorticity|vortical]] (turbulence) – into small perturbations within the boundary layer. The mechanisms by which these disturbances arise are varied and include freestream sound and/or turbulence interacting with surface curvature, shape discontinuities and surface roughness. These initial conditions are small, often unmeasurable perturbations to the basic state flow. From here, the growth (or decay) of these disturbances depends on the nature of the disturbance and the nature of the basic state. Acoustic disturbances tend to excite two-dimensional instabilities such as [[Tollmien–Schlichting wave]]s (T-S waves), while vortical disturbances tend to lead to the growth of three-dimensional phenomena such as the [[crossflow instability]].&lt;ref&gt;Saric W. S., Reed H. L., Kerschen E. J. 2002. "Boundary-layer receptivity to freestream disturbances". ''Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech.'' 34:291–319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous experiments in recent decades have revealed that the extent of the amplification region, and hence the location of the transition point on the body surface, is strongly dependent not only upon the amplitude and/or the spectrum of external disturbances but also on their physical nature. Some of the disturbances easily penetrate into the boundary layer whilst others do not. Consequently, the concept of boundary layer transition is a complex one and still lacks a complete theoretical exposition.

===Primary mode growth===
If the initial, environmentally-generated disturbance is small enough, the next stage of the transition process is that of primary mode growth. In this stage, the initial disturbances grow (or decay) in a manner described by [[hydrodynamic stability|linear stability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack L. M. 1984. "Boundary-layer linear stability theory". ''AGARD Rep. No. 709''.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific instabilities that are exhibited in reality depend on the geometry of the problem and the nature and amplitude of initial disturbances. Across a range of [[Reynolds number]]s in a given flow configuration, the most amplified modes can and often do vary.

There are several major types of instability which commonly occur in boundary layers. In subsonic and early supersonic flows, the dominant two-dimensional instabilities are T-S waves. For flows in which a three-dimensional boundary layer develops such as a swept wing, the [[crossflow instability]] becomes important. For flows navigating concave surface curvature, [[Görtler vortices]] may become the dominant instability. Each instability has its own physical origins and its own set of control strategies - some of which are contraindicated by other instabilities – adding to the difficulty in controlling laminar-turbulent transition.

====Simple harmonic boundary layer sound in the physics of transition to turbulence====

Simple harmonic sound as a precipitating factor in the sudden transition from laminar to turbulent flow might be attributed to Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Her poem, Aurora Leigh (1856), revealed how musical notes (the pealing of a particular church bell), triggered wavering turbulence in the previously steady laminar-flow flames of street gaslights (“...gaslights tremble in the streets and squares”: Hair 2016). Her instantly acclaimed poem might have alerted scientists (e.g., Leconte 1859) to the influence of simple harmonic (SH) sound as a cause of turbulence. A contemporary flurry of scientific interest in this effect culminated in Sir John Tyndall (1867) deducing that specific SH sounds, directed perpendicular to the flow had waves that blended with similar SH waves created by friction along the boundaries of tubes, amplifying them and triggering the phenomenon of high-resistance turbulent flow.  His interpretation re-surfaced over 100 years later (Hamilton 2015).

Tollmien (1931) and Schlichting (1929) proposed that friction (viscosity) along a smooth flat boundary, created SH boundary layer (BL) oscillations that gradually increased in amplitude until turbulence erupted. Although contemporary wind tunnels failed to confirm the theory, Schubauer and Skramstad (1943) created a refined wind tunnel that deadened the vibrations and sounds that might impinge on the wind tunnel flat plate flow studies. They confirmed the development of SH long-crested BL oscillations, the dynamic shear waves of transition to turbulence. They showed that specific SH fluttering vibrations induced electromagnetically into a BL ferromagnetic ribbon could amplify similar flow-induced SH BL flutter (BLF) waves, precipitating turbulence at much lower flow rates. Furthermore, certain other specific frequencies interfered with the development of the SH BLF waves, preserving laminar flow to higher flow rates.

An oscillation of a mass in a fluid is a vibration that creates a sound wave. SH BLF oscillations in boundary layer fluid along a flat plate must produce SH sound that reflects off the boundary perpendicular to the fluid laminae. In late transition, Schubauer and Skramstad found foci of amplification of BL oscillations, associated with bursts of noise (“turbulent spots”). Focal amplification of the transverse sound in late transition was associated with BL vortex formation.

The focal amplified sound of turbulent spots along a flat plate with high energy oscillation of molecules perpendicularly through the laminae, might suddenly cause localized freezing of laminar slip. The sudden braking of “frozen” spots of fluid would transfer resistance to the high resistance at the boundary, and might explain the head-over-heels BL vortices of late transition. Osborne Reynolds described similar turbulent spots during transition in water flow in cylinders (“flashes of turbulence,” 1883).

When many random vortices erupt as turbulence onsets, the generalized freezing of laminar slip (laminar interlocking) is associated with noise and a dramatic increase in resistance to flow. This might also explain the parabolic isovelocity profile of laminar flow abruptly changing to the flattened profile of turbulent flow – as laminar slip is replaced by laminar interlocking as turbulence erupts (Hamilton 2015).

===Secondary instabilities===
The primary modes themselves don't actually lead directly to breakdown, but instead lead to the formation of secondary instability mechanisms. As the primary modes grow and distort the mean flow, they begin to exhibit nonlinearities and linear theory no longer applies. Complicating the matter is the growing distortion of the mean flow, which can lead to inflection points in the velocity profile a situation shown by [[Lord Rayleigh]] to indicate absolute instability in a boundary layer. These secondary instabilities lead rapidly to breakdown. These secondary instabilities are often much higher in frequency than their linear precursors.

[[File:PGE linemen at work.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Linemen repairing [[electricity distribution]] lines that supply power to homes]]
A '''lineworker''' ('''lineman''' (American English), '''linesman''' (British English), '''powerline technician''' ('''PLT'''), or '''powerline worker''') is a [[tradesman|tradesperson]] who constructs and maintains [[electric power transmission]], telecommunications lines (cable, internet and phone) and [[electricity distribution|distribution]] lines. 

A lineworker generally does outdoor installation and maintenance jobs. Those who install and maintain electrical wiring inside buildings are [[electrician]]s.

==History==
The occupation began with the widespread use of the telegraph in the 1840s. Telegraph lines could be strung on trees, but wooden poles were quickly adopted as the method of choice. The term 'lineman' was used for those who set wooden poles and strung the wire. The term continued in use with the invention of the telephone in the 1870s and the beginnings of [[electrification]] in the 1890s.

This new electrical power work was more hazardous than telegraph or telephone work because of the risk of [[electrocution]]. Between the 1890s and the 1930s, line work was considered one of the most hazardous jobs. This led to the formation of labor organizations to represent the workers and advocate for their safety. This also led to the establishment of [[apprenticeship]] programs and the establishment of more stringent safety standards, starting in the late 1930s. The union movement in the United States was led by lineman Henry Miller, who in 1890 was elected president of the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|Electrical Wiremen and Linemen's Union, No. 5221]] of the American Federation of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibew.org/articles/01daily/0107/010711.htm|publisher=International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, CLC |title=Henry Miller:&amp;nbsp;IBEW's Founder Kindled a Legacy |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[rural electrification]] drive during the [[New Deal]] led to a wide expansion in the number of jobs in the electric power industry. Many power linemen during that period traveled around the country following jobs as they became available in tower construction, [[electrical substation|substation]] construction, and wire stringing. They often lived in temporary camps set up near the project they were working on, or in boarding houses if the work was in a town or city, and relocating every few weeks or months. The occupation was lucrative at the time,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} but the hazards and the extensive travel limited its appeal.

A brief drive to electrify some [[railroad]]s on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] of the US led to the development of specialization of linemen who installed and maintained [[catenary (railways)|catenary]] [[overhead lines]]. Growth in this branch of line work declined after most railroads favored [[Diesel engine|diesel]] over electric engines for replacement to steam engines.

The occupation evolved during the 1940s and 1950s with expansion of residential electrification. This led to an increase in the number of linemen needed to maintain power distribution circuits and provide emergency repairs. Maintenance linemen mostly stayed in one place, although sometimes they were called to travel to assist repairs.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} During the 1950s, some electric lines began to be installed in underground tunnels, expanding the scope of the work.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Duties==
{{See also|Hot stick|Live-line working}}
[[File:Lineman changing transformer.jpg|thumb|Lineman replacing a [[transformer]], wearing protective gear, including rubber gloves and sleeves]]
Power linemen work on electrically energized (live) and de-energized (dead) power lines. They may perform a number of tasks associated with power lines, including installation or replacement of distribution equipment such as [[capacitor]] banks, distribution transformers on poles, [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s and [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s. These duties include the use of ropes, knots, and lifting equipment. These tasks may have to be performed with primitive manual tools where accessibility is limited. Such conditions are common in rural or mountainous areas that are inaccessible to trucks.

High voltage transmission lines can be worked live with proper setups. The lineman must be isolated from the ground. The lineman wears special conductive clothing that is connected to the live power line, at which point the line and the lineman are at the same [[electric potential|potential]], allowing the lineman to handle the wire. The lineman may still be electrocuted if he completes an electrical circuit, for example by handling both ends of a broken conductor. Such work is often done by [[helicopter]] by specially trained linemen.&lt;ref name=vert2015-04&gt;{{cite news |first=Elan |last=Head |url=http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/82.html |title=High-value cargo |pages=80–87 |work=Vertical Magazine |date=April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419023320/http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/82.html |archivedate=19 April 2015 |df= }} [http://www.verticalmag.com/features/features_article/HighValueCargo Weblink]&lt;/ref&gt;  Isolated line work is only used for transmission-level voltages and sometimes for the higher distribution voltages. Live wire work is common on low voltage distribution systems within the UK and Australia as all linesmen are trained to work 'live'. Live wire work on high voltage distribution systems within the UK and Australia is carried out by specialist teams.

Work on outdoor tower construction or wire installation are not performed exclusively by linemen. A crew of linemen will include several helpers. Helpers assist with on-the-ground tasks needed to support the linemen, but may {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} work above ground or on electrical circuits. 

==Training==
Becoming a lineworker usually involves starting as an apprentice and a four-year training program before becoming a "Journey Lineworker". Apprentice linemen are trained in all types of work from operating equipment and climbing to proper techniques and safety standards. Schools throughout the United States offer a pre-apprentice lineman training program such as [[Southeast Lineman Training Center]] and [[Northwest Lineman College]].

==Safety==
[[File:Lineman Rescue.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ameren]] lineman practicing a utility pole rescue]]
Lineworkers, especially those who deal with live electrical apparatus, use [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) as protection against inadvertent contact. This includes rubber gloves, rubber sleeves, bucket liners and protective blankets.

When working with energized power lines, linemen must use protection to eliminate any contact with the energized line. The requirements for PPEs and associated permissible voltage depends on applicable regulations in jurisdiction as well as company policy. Voltages higher than those that can be worked using gloves are worked with special sticks known as hot-line tools or [[hot stick]]s, with which power lines can be safely handled from a distance. Linemen must also wear special rubber insulating gear when working with live wires to protect against any accidental contact with the wire. The buckets linemen sometimes work from are also insulated with [[fiberglass]].

De-energized power lines can be hazardous as they can still be energized from another source such as interconnection or interaction with another circuit even when they appear shut off. For example: A higher-voltage distribution level circuit may feed several lower-voltage distribution circuits through transformers. If the higher voltage circuit is de-energized, but if lower-voltage circuits connected remain energized, the higher voltage circuit will remain energized. Another problem can arise when de-energized wires become energized through [[Electrostatic induction|electrostatic]] or [[electromagnetic induction]] from energized wires in close proximity.

All live line work PPE must be kept clean from contaminants and regularly tested for di-electric integrity. This is done by the use of high voltage electrical testing equipment.

Other general items of PPE such as helmets are usually replaced at regular intervals.

This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Washington State''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   

These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of May 1, 2010, there were 48 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen others have been cleaned up and removed from the list; no sites are currently proposed for addition.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19731">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Wisconsin''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of March 26, 2010, there were 38 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One additional site has been proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Six sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

||WID980610604||[[Refuse Hideaway Landfill]]||[[Dane County, WI|Dane]] ||Soils and onsite and offsite groundwater, including private wells southwest of the site, are contaminated with various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including perchloroethene, trichloroethene, and vinyl chloride. || || || || ||
|-
||WID980610190||[[Ripon City Landfill]]||[[Fond du Lac County, WI|Fond du Lac]] ||The remedial investigation determined that groundwater beneath and near the site was contaminated with various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including vinyl chloride, tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, and benzene at low levels. The discovery in 2001 that vinyl chloride was at unacceptable levels in wells at two homes about 1500 ft downgradient (south-southwest) of the landfill has resulted in an ongoing investigation of the extent of the contamination. || || || || ||
|-
||WID980610141||[[Sauk County Landfill]]||[[Sauk County, WI|Sauk]] ||Soil and groundwater was contaminated with VOCs. Arsenic, beryllium and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected at elevated levels in on-site soils. || || || || ||

|-
||WID046536785||[[Scrap Processing Co., Inc.]]||[[Taylor County, WI|Taylor]] ||Soils and sediments are contaminated with heavy metals, including lead, barium, copper, and zinc. Elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were also found in soil samples. || || || || ||
|-
||WID980996367||[[Sheboygan River#Water quality|Sheboygan Harbor &amp; River]]||[[Sheboygan County|Sheboygan]]||Sediments are contaminated with PCBs and a wide variety of heavy metals. Soils and surface water are contaminated with PCBs and heavy metals, including arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc. || || || || ||
|-
||WID980902969||[[Spickler Landfill]]||[[Marathon County, WI|Marathon]]||During the remedial investigation of the Spickler Landfill site that took place in the late 1980s, some [[landfill gas]] was detected onsite, and asbestos was confirmed to be present in a landfill cover soil sample.  In addition, leachate samples from the mercury brine pit contained elevated levels of calcium (3,340,000 ppb), magnesium (2,180,000 ppb), mercury (666 ppb), and nine organic compounds.  Groundwater samples from monitoring wells sampled during the remedial investigation showed exceedences of maximum contaminant level (MCL) drinking water standards for the following chemicals: benzene (8 ppb), vinyl chloride (39 ppb), barium (4,690 ppb), copper (2,250 ppb), iron (4,280 ppb), and manganese (54 ppb).  || || || || ||
|-
||WID980901219||[[Stoughton City Landfill]]||[[Dane County, WI|Dane]] ||The groundwater is contaminated with organic chemicals, including [[tetrahydrofuran]] and freon. Methane has been detected in the landfill. || || || || ||

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17658">This is a '''list of supernova candidates''', or [[star]]s that [[astronomer]]s have suggested are [[supernova]] progenitors. [[Type II supernova]] progenitors include stars with at least 10 [[solar mass]]es that are in the final stages of their evolution. Prominent examples of stars in this mass range include [[Antares]], [[Spica]],&lt;ref name="chandra_snr" /&gt; [[Gamma Velorum]],&lt;ref name=kaler/&gt; [[Mu Cephei]], and members of the [[Quintuplet Cluster]].&lt;ref name=lloyd2006/&gt; [[Type Ia supernova]] progenitors are [[white dwarf]] stars that are close to the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of about 1.44 solar masses and are accreting matter from a binary companion star. The list includes massive [[Wolf–Rayet star]]s, which may become [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|Type Ib/Ic supernovae]].

[[File:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Polar bears]] on the sea ice of the [[Arctic Ocean]], near the [[north pole]].]]
Conservation biologists have designed a variety of objective means to  measure [[biodiversity]] [[empirical]]ly. Each measure of biodiversity relates to a particular use of the data. For practical [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s, measurements should include {{clarify|text=a quantification of values that are commonly shared among locally affected organisms, including humans|date=July 2014}}. For others, a more economically defensible definition should allow the ensuring of continued possibilities for both adaptation and future use by humans, assuring  environmental [[sustainability]].

As a consequence, biologists argue that this measure is likely to be associated with the variety of genes. Since it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove beneficial, the best choice{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} for [[conservation ethic|conservation]] is to assure the persistence of as many genes as possible. For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it prohibits [[ecological succession]].

== Taxonomic Diversity ==
Biodiversity is usually plotted as taxonomic richness of a geographic area, with some reference to a temporal scale. [[Robert Whittaker|Whittaker]]&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, R.H., ''Evolution and measurement of species diversity'', Taxon, 21, 213–251 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; described three common metrics used to measure species-level biodiversity, encompassing attention to [[species richness]] or [[species evenness]]:
* [[Species richness]] - the simplest of the indices available.
* [[Simpson index]]
* [[Shannon-Wiener index]]

Recently, another new index has been invented called the [[Mean Species Abundance Index]] (MSA); this index calculates the trend in population size of a cross section of the
species. It does this in line with the CBD 2010 indicator for species [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080510063151/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/GLOBIO/PDF/Flyer_%20IB_Project_LR.pdf MSA Index (page 4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Measures of Diversity ==
Alternatively, other types of diversity may be plotted against a temporal timescale:
* [[species diversity]]
* [[ecological diversity]]
* [[morphological diversity]]
* [[genetic diversity]]

These different types of diversity may not be independent. There is, for example, a close link between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors tried to organize the measurements of biodiversity in the following way:&lt;ref&gt;Cianciaruso, M.V., Silva, I.A. &amp; Batalha, M.A. Diversidades filogenética e funcional: novas abordagens para a Ecologia de comunidades. Biota Neotrop. 9(3): [http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v9n3/pt/abstract?article+bn01309032009].&lt;/ref&gt;
* traditional diversity measures
** species density, take into account the number of species in an area
** [[species richness]], take into account the number of species per individuals (usually [species]/[individuals x area])
** [[Diversity index|diversity indices]], take into account the number of species (the [[species richness|richness]]) and their relative contribution (the [[species evenness|evenness]]); e.g.:
*** [[Simpson index]]
*** [[Shannon-Wiener index]]
* [[phylogenetic diversity]] measures, include information on phylogenetic relationships among species
** phylogenetic diversity (PD) index; Faith (1992)
** topology based measures
*** taxonomic distinctiveness; Vane-Wright et al. (1991)
*** taxonomic diversity; Warwick &amp; Clarke (1995)
*** taxonomic distinctness; Clarke &amp; Warwick (1998)
* [[Functional diversity (ecology)|functional diversity]] measures, include information on functional traits among species 
** categoric measures
*** functional group richness (FGR); e.g., Tilman et al. (1997)
** continuous measures
*** with only one functional trait; e.g., Mason et al. (2003)
*** multivariate measures, with many functional traits
**** functional attribute diversity (FAD); Walker et al. (1999) 
**** convex hull volume; Cornwell et al. (2006)
**** functional diversity (FD); Petchey &amp; Gaston (2002)

== Scale ==
Diversity may be measured at different scales. These are three indices used by ecologists: 
* [[Alpha diversity]] refers to diversity within a particular area, community or ecosystem, and is measured by counting the number of taxa within the ecosystem (usually species)&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Beta diversity]] is species diversity between ecosystems; this involves comparing the number of taxa that are [[Endemic (ecology)|unique to each of the ecosystems]].
* [[Gamma diversity]] is a measurement of the overall diversity for different ecosystems within a region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3651">'''Michael Harwood''' (1934, Boston – 24 November 1989, San Diego) was a naturalist, environmentalist, and author.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite web|author=Howe, Marvine|date=26 November 1989|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/obituaries/michael-harwood-55-naturalist.html|title=Michael Harwood, 55, Naturalist|publisher=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harwood received his secondary education from [[The Putney School]] in Vermont and graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1956. He became the third husband of the author Mary B. Durant in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Death in slow motion: a memoir of a daughter, her mother, and the beast called Alzheimer's|author=Cooney, Eleanor|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2004|postscript=; pbk|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Death_in_Slow_Motion.html?id=98QyhyBc4fAC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a co-winner of the 1981 [[John Burroughs Medal]] for ''On the Road With John James Audubon'', which he co-authored with his wife Mary Durant. The book is organized as a travel journal which recounts how the two authors spent more than a year camping along the various North American itineraries recorded in Audubon's journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Review of ''On the Road with John James Audubon'' by Mary Durant and Michael Harwood|date=11 August 1980|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|author=Hancock, Wade|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0811/081119.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fink, Louis|title=Review of ''On the Road with John James Audubon'' by Mary Durant and Michael Harwood|journal=The Chat|date=Spring 1981|volume=45|issue=2|pages=55–56|url=https://www.carolinabirdclub.org/chat/issues/1981/v45n2reviews.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harwood attended the 1974 foundational meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HMANA History|website=HMANA|url=http://www.hmana.org/hmana-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a president of the Hawk Migration Association of North America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29782">'''Modernization theory''' is used to explain the process of modernization within societies. Modernization refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or '[[Traditional society|traditional]]' to a 'modern' society. Modernization theory originated from the ideas of German sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920), which provided the basis for the modernization paradigm developed by Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979). The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that with assistance, "traditional" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have been. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, then went into a deep eclipse.  It made a comeback after 1991 but remains a controversial model.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Knobl, "Theories That Won’t Pass Away: The Never-ending Story." in  Gerard Delanty, Engin F. Isin, eds. ''Handbook of Historical Sociology'' (2003): 96–107 esp p. 97 [http://193.231.20.29/seminarii/locuire/Upload/syllabus09/C09b.%20Knobl%20(2003).pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Modernization theory both attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to [[social progress]] and development of societies and seeks to explain the process of [[social evolution]]. Modernization theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, [[world-systems theory|world-systems]] theorists, [[globalization]] theorists and [[dependency theory|dependency]] theorists among others. Modernization theory stresses not only the process of change but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies.
Modernization theory maintains that traditional societies will develop as they adopt more modern practices. Proponents of modernization theory claim that modern states are wealthier and more powerful and that their citizens are freer to enjoy a higher standard of living. Developments such as new data technology and the need to update traditional methods in transport, communication and production, it is argued, make modernization necessary or at least preferable to the status quo. That view makes critique of modern difficult since it implies that such developments control the limits of human interaction, not vice versa. It also implies that human agency controls the speed and severity of modernization. Supposedly, instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at forms of governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits, according to the theory, usually become less important as modernization takes hold.&lt;ref name="HttpwwwbritannicacomEBcheckedtopicmodernization"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387301/modernization modernization Encyclopædia Britannica]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians link modernization to the processes of [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] and the spread of education. As Kendall (2007) notes, "Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization."&lt;ref&gt;Diana Kendall, ''Sociology in Our Times'' (2007) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociological]] [[critical theory]], modernization is linked to an overarching process of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]]. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes increasingly important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society.

==Origins==
Sociological theories of the late 19th century such as [[Social Darwinism]] provided a basis for asking what were the laws of evolution of human society.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Henry. "Modernization theory and the sociological study of development" ''Journal of Development Studies'' 7#2 (1971): 141–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The current modernization theory originated with the ideas  of German sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) regarding the role of rationality and irrationality in the transition from traditional to modern society. Weber's approach provided the basis for the modernization paradigm as popularized by Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979), who translated Weber's works into English in the 1930s and provided his own interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremiah I. Dibua|title=Modernization and the Crisis of Development in Africa: The Nigerian Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eRLBjz2pWQMC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate|pages=20–22|isbn=9780754642282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon H. Mayhew, ed., ''Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution: selected writings'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945 the Parsonian version became widely used in sociology and other social sciences.  By the late 1960s opposition developed because the theory was too general and did not fit all societies in quite the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Dean C. Tipps, "Modernization theory and the comparative study of national societies: A critical perspective." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 15#2 (1973): 199–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization and modernization ==
[[Globalization]] can be defined as the integration of economic, political and social cultures. It is argued that globalization is related to the spreading of modernization across borders.

Global trade has grown continuously since the European discovery of new continents in the [[Early modern period]]; it increased particularly as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the mid-20th century adoption of the [[shipping container]].

Annual trans-border tourist arrivals rose to 456 million by 1990 and almost tripled since, reaching a total of over 1.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;(Knowles, 1994: FT,7 January 1997: V11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.unwto.org/press-release/2017-01-17/sustained-growth-international-tourism-despite-challenges|title=Sustained growth in international tourism despite challenges {{!}} World Tourism Organization UNWTO|website=www2.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication is another major area that has grown due to modernization. Communication industries have enabled capitalism to spread throughout the world. Telephony, television broadcasts, news services and online service providers have played a crucial part in globalization. Former U.S president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was a supporter of the modernization theory and believed that television had potential to provide educational tools in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindo-Fuentes|first=Héctor|date=2009|title=Educational Television in El Salvador and Modernisation Theory|jstor=27744205|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=41|issue=4|pages=757–792|doi=10.2307/27744205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the many apparent positive attributes to globalization there are also negative consequences. The dominant, neoliberal model of globalization often increases disparities between a society's rich and its poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/feminism-globalization/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Parekh|first=Serena|last2=Wilcox|first2=Shelley|date=2014-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} In major cities of developing countries there exist pockets where technologies of the modernised world, computers, cell phones and satellite television, exist alongside stark poverty. Globalists are globalization modernization theorists and argue that globalization is positive for everyone, as its benefits must eventually extend to all members of society, including vulnerable groups such as women and children.

== Democratization and modernization ==
The relationship between modernization and democracy is one of the most researched studies in comparative politics. There is academic debate over the drivers of democracy because there are theories that support economic growth as both a cause and effect of the institution of democracy. “Lipset’s observation that democracy is related to economic development, first advanced in 1959, has generated the largest body of research on any topic in comparative politics,” (Przeworski and Limongi, 1997).

Larry Diamond and Juan Linz, who worked with Lipset in the book, ''Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America'', argue that economic performance affects the development of democracy in at least three ways. First, they argue that economic growth is more important for democracy than given levels of socioeconomic development. Second, socioeconomic development generates social changes that can potentially facilitate democratization. Third, socioeconomic development promotes other changes, like organization of the middle class, which is conducive to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;(Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America, pp 44-46)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Seymour Martin Lipset put it, "All the various aspects of economic development — industrialization, urbanization, wealth and education — are so closely interrelated as to form one major factor which has the political correlate of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Political Man'' (1963), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument also appears in Walt W. Rostow, ''Politics and the Stages of Growth'' (1971); A. F. K. Organski, ''The Stages of Political Development'' (1965); and David Apter, ''The Politics of Modernization'' (1965). In the 1960s, some critics argued that the link between modernization and democracy was based too much on the example of European history and neglected the [[Third World]].&lt;ref&gt;Andre Gunder Frank, ''Latin America: Underdevelopment or Revolution'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent demonstrations of the emergence of democracy in [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[South Africa]] have been cited as support for Lipset's thesis.

One historical problem with that argument has always been [[German Empire|Germany]] whose economic modernization in the 19th century came long before the democratization after 1918. Berman, however, concludes that a process of democratization was underway in Imperial Germany, for "during these years Germans developed many of the habits and mores that are now thought by political scientists to augur healthy political development".&lt;ref&gt;Sheri E. Berman, "Modernization in Historical Perspective: The Case of Imperial Germany,"  ''World Politics'' v.53#3 (2001) 431–62 quote at p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] (2009) contend that the realization of democracy is not based solely on an expressed desire for that form of government, but democracies are born as a result of the admixture of certain social and cultural factors. They argue the ideal social and cultural conditions for the foundation of a democracy are born of significant modernization and economic development that result in mass political participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]], "How Development Leads to Democracy," ''Foreign Affairs'' Mar/Apr2009, Vol. 88 Issue 2, pp. 33–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Peerenboom (2008) explores the relationships among democracy, the rule of law and their relationship to wealth by pointing to examples of Asian countries, such as Taiwan and South Korea, which have successfully democratized only after economic growth reached relatively high levels and to examples of countries such as the [[Philippines]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]] and [[India]], which sought to democratize at lower levels of wealth but have not done as well.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Peerenboom, ''China Modernizes: Threat to the West or Model for the Rest?'' (2008) p, 63. He suggests [[China]] will grant democratic rights when it is as modern and as rich as the West per capita.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Przeworski]] and others have challenged Lipset's argument. They say political regimes do not transition to democracy as per capita incomes rise. Rather, democratic transitions occur randomly, but once there, countries with higher levels of gross domestic product per capita remain democratic. Epstein et al. (2006) retest the modernization hypothesis using new data, new techniques, and a three-way, rather than dichotomous, classification of regimes. Contrary to Przeworski, this study finds that the modernization hypothesis stands up well. Partial democracies emerge as among the most important and least understood regime types.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Epstein, et al., "Democratic Transitions," ''American Journal of Political Science'' 2006 50(3): 551–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Highly contentious is the idea that modernization implies more human rights, with China in the 21st century being a major test case.

==Technology==
New [[technology]] is a major source of social change. (Social change refers to any significant alteration over time in behavior patterns and cultural values and norms.) Since modernization entails the social transformation from agrarian societies to industrial ones, it is important to look at the technological viewpoint; however, new technologies do not change societies by itself. Rather, it is the ''response'' to technology that causes change. Frequently, technology is recognized but not put to use for a very long time such as the ability to extract metal from rock.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Although that initially went unused, it later had profound implications for the developmental course of societies. Technology makes it possible for a more innovated society and broad social change. That dramatic change through the centuries that has evolved socially, industrially, and economically, can be summed up by the term modernization. Cell phones, for example, have changed the lives of millions throughout the world. That is especially true in [[Africa]] and other parts of the [[Middle East]], where there is a low cost communication infrastructure. With cell phone technology, widely dispersed populations are connected, which facilitates business-to-business communication and provides internet access to remoter areas, with a consequential rise in literacy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Development and modernization==
Development, like modernization, has become the orienting principle of modern times. Countries that are seen as modern are also seen as developed, which means that they are generally more respected by institutions such as the [[United Nations]] and even as possible trade partners for other countries. The extent to which a country has modernized or developed dictates its power and importance on the international level.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Modernization of the health sector of developing nations recognizes that transitioning from '[[traditional]]' to 'modern' is not merely the advancement in technology and the introduction of Western practices; implementing modern healthcare requires the reorganization of political agenda and, in turn, an increase in funding by feeders and resources towards public health. However, rather than replicating the stages of developed nations, whose roots of modernization are found with the context of [[industrialization]] or [[colonialism]], underdeveloped nations should apply proximal interventions to target rural communities and focus on prevention strategies rather than curative solutions. That has been successfully exhibited by the Christian Medical Commission and in China through '[[barefoot doctors]]'. Additionally, a strong advocate of the DE-emphasis of medical institutions was [[Halfdan T. Mahler]], the [[WHO]] General Director from 1973 to 1988. Related ideas have been proposed at international conferences such as [[Alma Alta Declaration|Alma-Ats]] and the "Health and Population in Development" conference, sponsored by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in [[Italy]] in 1979, and selective primary healthcare and [[GOBI-FFF|GOBI]] were discussed (although they have both been strongly criticized by supporters of comprehensive healthcare). Overall, however, this is not to say that the nations of the Global South can function independently from Western states; significant funding is received from well-intention programs, foundations, and charities that target epidemics such as [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]] that have substantially improved the lives of millions of people and impeded future development.&lt;ref&gt;Cueto, Marcos. 2004. The ORIGINS of Primary Health Care and SELECTIVE Primary Health Care. Am J Public Health 94 (11):1864–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization theorists often saw traditions as obstacles to economic growth. According to Seymour Martin Lipset, economic conditions are heavily determined by the cultural, social values present in that given society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elites in Latin America|last=Lipset|first=Seymour Martin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=New York|page=3|chapter=Chapter 1: Values, Education, and Entrepreneurship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while modernization might deliver violent, radical change for [[traditional society|traditional societies]], it was thought worth the price. Critics insist that traditional societies were often destroyed without ever gaining the promised advantages if, among other things, the economic gap between advanced societies and such societies actually increased. The net effect of modernization for some societies was therefore the replacement of traditional poverty by a more modern form of [[wikt:misery|misery]], according to these critics.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema, ''Quand la misère chasse la pauvreté'', Arles: Actes Sud 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to improvements in living standards, physical infrastructure, education and economic opportunity to refute such criticisms.

==Criticism==
From the 1960s, modernization theory has been criticized by numerous scholars, including  [[Andre Gunder Frank]] (1929 – 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Sing Chew and Pat Lauderdale, eds. ''Theory and methodology of world development: The writings of Andre Gunder Frank'' (Springer, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (born 1930).&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol, "Wallerstein's world capitalist system: a theoretical and historical critique." ''American Journal of Sociology'' (1977) 82#5 pp. 1075–90 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2777814 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the modernization of a society required the destruction of the indigenous culture and its replacement by a more Westernized one. By one definition, ''modern'' simply refers to the present, and any society still in existence is therefore modern. Proponents of modernization typically view only Western society as being truly modern and argue that others are primitive or unevolved by comparison. That view sees unmodernized societies as inferior even if they have the same standard of living as western societies. Opponents argue that modernity is independent of culture and can be adapted to any society. Japan is cited as an example by both sides. Some see it as proof that a thoroughly modern way of life can exist in a non western society. Others argue that [[Japan]] has become distinctly more western as a result of its modernization.

As Tipps has argued, by conflating modernization with other processes, with which theorists use interchangeably (democratization, liberalization, development), the term becomes imprecise and therefore difficult to disprove.&lt;ref&gt;Dean C. Tipps, "Modernization theory and the comparative study of national societies: A critical perspective." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 15#2 (1973): 199–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has also been criticised empirically, as modernization theorists ignore external sources of change in societies. The binary between traditional and modern is unhelpful, as the two are linked and often interdependent, and 'modernization' does not come as a whole.

Modernization theory has also been accused of being [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], as modernization began in Europe, with the [[Industrial Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Revolutions of 1848]] (Macionis 953) and has long been regarded as reaching its most advanced stage in Europe. Anthropologists typically make their criticism one step further and say that the view is ethnocentric and is specific to [[Western culture]].

===Dependency theory===
One alternative model on the left is [[Dependency theory]]. It emerged in the 1950s and argues that the underdevelopment of poor nations in the Third World derived from systematic imperial and neo-colonial exploitation of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Abhijeet Paul, "Dependency theory." in John Mackenzie, ed.   ''The Encyclopedia of Empire'' (2016) {{doi|10.1002/9781118455074.wbeoe242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its proponents argue that resources typically flow from a "periphery" of poor and [[Developing country|underdeveloped states]] to a "core" of [[Developed country|wealthy states]], enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theorists such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]] that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[world system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, and Barry K. Gills, eds. ''Andre Gunder Frank and global development: visions, remembrances, and explorations'' (Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency models arose from a growing association of southern hemisphere nationalists (from Latin America and Africa) and Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Smith,  "The underdevelopment of development literature: the case of dependency theory." ''World Politics'' 31#2 (1979): 247–88.&lt;/ref&gt; It was their reaction against modernization theory, which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Newschool, [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm "Economic Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714063027/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm |date=2009-07-14 }}, retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natrocarbonatite''' is a rare [[carbonatite]] [[lava]] which erupts from the [[Ol Doinyo Lengai]] [[volcano]] in [[Tanzania]] within the [[East African Rift]] of eastern [[Africa]].

== Composition ==
Whereas most lavas are rich in [[silicate minerals]], the natrocarbonatite lavas of Ol Doinyo Lengai are rich in the rare sodium and potassium [[carbonate mineral]]s, [[nyerereite]] and [[gregoryite]]. 

Due to this unusual composition, the lava is erupted at relatively low temperatures (approximately 500-600 °C). This temperature is so low that the molten lava appears black in sunlight, rather than having the red glow common to most lavas. It is also much more fluid than silicate lavas.

== Impact ==
The sodium and potassium carbonate minerals of the lavas erupted at Ol Doinyo Lengai are unstable at the Earth's surface and susceptible to rapid [[weathering]], the minerals are [[anhydrous]] and when they come into contact with the moisture of the atmosphere, they begin to react extremely quickly. 

The black or dark brown lava and ash erupted begins to turn white within a few hours. The resulting volcanic landscape is different from any other in the world.

{{Geological era}}
'''Paleoproterozoic Era''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|p|æ|l|i|oʊ|ˌ|p|r|oʊ|t|ər|ə|ˈ|z|oʊ|ɪ|k|-}};{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-20|palaeo-}} {{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-20|Proterozoic}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Proterozoic}}}}), spanning the time period from {{Ma|Paleoproterozoic|Mesoproterozoic}} (2.5–1.6&amp;nbsp;[[Year|Ga]]), is the first of the three sub-divisions ([[era (geology)|eras]]) of the [[Proterozoic]] Eon. The Paleoproterozoic is also the longest era of the [[Earth]]'s geological history. It was during this era that the continents first stabilized.

Paleontological evidence suggests that the Earth's rotational rate during this era resulted in 20-hour days ~1.8 billion years ago, implying a total of ~450 days per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pannella | first1 = Giorgio | year = 1972 | title = Paleontological evidence on the Earth's rotational history since early precambrian | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u4pl7170jr5427t6/ | journal = [[Astrophysics and Space Science]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2| page = 212 | doi=10.1007/BF00642735 | bibcode=1972Ap&amp;SS..16..212P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paleoatmosphere ==
Before the [[Great Oxygenation Event|enormous increase in atmospheric oxygen]], almost all existing lifeforms were [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]], i.e., their [[metabolism]] was based upon a form of [[cellular respiration]] that did not require oxygen. Indeed, free oxygen in large amounts is toxic to most [[anaerobic organism]]s. Consequently, the majority of the anaerobic lifeforms on Earth died when the atmospheric free-oxygen levels soared. The only lifeforms that survived were either those resistant to the oxidizing and poisonous effects of oxygen, or those sequestered in oxygen-free environments. The sudden increase of atmospheric free oxygen and the ensuing extinction of the vulnerable lifeforms (an event called, among numerous other similarly suggestive titles, the Oxygen Holocaust or Oxygen Catastrophe) is widely considered to be the first of the most significant mass extinctions in the history of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eo_sMMRxgAUC&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;ots=oWKooBsh1G&amp;dq=oxygen%20holocaust&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=oxygen%20holocaust&amp;f=false|title=Microcosmos: Four Billion Years of Microbial Evolution|last=Margulis|first=Lynn|last2=Sagan|first2=Dorion|date=1997-05-29|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520210646|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this era, the earliest global-scale continent-continent collision belts developed.

These continent and mountain building events are represented by the 2.1–2.0&amp;nbsp;Ga Trans-Amazonian and [[Eburnean orogeny|Eburnean]] [[Orogeny|orogens]] in South America and West Africa; the ~2.0&amp;nbsp;Ga [[Limpopo Belt]] in southern Africa; the 1.9–1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga [[Trans-Hudson orogeny|Trans-Hudson]], [[Penokean orogeny|Penokean]], [[Taltson–Thelon orogeny|Taltson–Thelon]], [[Wopmay orogen|Wopmay]], [[Ungava magmatic event|Ungava]] and [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat orogens]] in North America, the 1.9–1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga [[Nagssugtoqidain Orogen]] in Greenland; the 1.9–1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga Kola–Karelia, [[Svecofennian orogeny|Svecofennian]], Volhyn-Central Russian, and [[Pachelma orogen]]s in Baltica (Eastern Europe); the 1.9–1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga [[Akitkan Orogen]] in Siberia; the ~1.95&amp;nbsp;Ga [[Khondalite Belt]] and ~1.85&amp;nbsp;Ga Trans-North China Orogen in North China.

These continental collision belts are interpreted as having resulted from one or more 2.0–1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga global-scale collision events that then led to the assembly of a Proterozoic supercontinent named [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] or [[Nuna (supercontinent)|Nuna]].&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Zhao|first1=Guochun|last2=Cawood|first2=Peter A|last3=Wilde|first3=Simon A|last4=Sun|first4=Min|year=2002|title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |pages=125–162|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9|bibcode = 2002ESRv...59..125Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |author2=Sun, M. |author3=Wilde, Simon A. |author4= Li, S.Z.  |year=2004|title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |pages=91–123|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003|bibcode = 2004ESRv...67...91Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phaeolus schweinitzii''''', commonly known as '''velvet-top fungus''', '''dyer's polypore''', or '''dyer's mazegill''', is a [[fungus|fungal]] [[plant pathogen]] that causes [[butt rot]] on [[conifer]]s such as [[Pseudotsuga|Douglas-fir]], [[Picea|spruce]], [[Abies|fir]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[Pinus|pine]], and [[Larix|larch]].&lt;ref name=fidl/&gt;  ''P. schweinitzii'' is a [[polypore]], although unlike [[bracket fungi]] the [[Basidiocarp|fruiting body]] may appear terrestrial when growing from the roots or base of the host tree.  The fruiting bodies, appearing in late summer or fall, commonly incorporate blades of grass, twigs, or fallen pine needles as they grow.  As these fruiting bodies age, the pore surface turns from yellow to greenish yellow, the top becomes darker, and the flesh becomes harder and more wood-like.&lt;ref name=volk/&gt;

The effect, impact and significance of infection by this fungus is rooted in the fact that it causes brown rot, which degrades the cellulose.  Thus there is a loss of tensile strength which often leads to brittle fracture near the stem base, even at a fairly early stage of decay.  Decay initiated above ground can lead to branch snap or breakout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson |first1=Guy |last2=Green |first2=Ted|title=Fungi on Trees|date=2011|publisher=The Arboricultural Association|location=Gloucestershire, England|isbn=978-0-900978-55-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P. schweinitzii'' is native to [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]],&lt;ref name=fidl&gt;{{cite journal| title=Schweinitzii Root and Butt Rot of Western Conifers| first=Susan K. | last=Hagle| first2=Gregory M.| last2=Filip| journal=Forest Insect &amp; Disease Leaflet |issue=177 |date=March 2010 |publisher=USDA Forest Service | url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/nr/fid/fidls/fidl-177.pdf| format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been identified as an exotic species in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=scion&gt;{{cite journal| title=Exotic Wood Decay Fungus on Pine |journal=Forest Health News| issue=126 |date=February 2003 |publisher=Scion |url=http://www.nzffa.org.nz/images/design/diseases/Phaeolus-schweinitzii/Phaeolus-schweinitziiFHnews126.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its common name suggests, the dyer's polypore is an excellent natural source of green, yellow, gold, or brown [[natural dye|dye]], depending on the material dyed and the [[mordant]] used.&lt;ref name=volk&gt;{{cite web| url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/nov2007.html |title=''Phaeolus schweinitzii'', the dye polypore or velvet-top fungus |first=Tom |last=Volk | first2=Debby| last2=Hanmer| work=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month |date=November 2007 |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mushroom-collecting.com/mushroomdyeing.html | publisher=Mushroom-Collecting.com | title=Dyeing with Mushrooms | accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P. schweinitzii'' is named after [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]], a [[Pennsylvania]]-born [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] minister and important early [[United States|American]] [[mycology|mycologist]].

[[Electrical substation|Substation]] automation refers to using data from [[Intelligent electronic device]]s (IED), control and automation capabilities within the substation, and control commands from remote users to control power-system devices.

Since full substation automation relies on substation integration, the terms are often used interchangeably. Power-system automation includes processes associated with generation and delivery of power. Monitoring and control of power delivery systems in the substation and on the pole reduce the occurrence of outages and shorten the duration of outages that do occur. The [[Intelligent electronic device|IED]]s, communications protocols, and communications methods, work together as a system to perform power-system automation.
The term “power system” describes the collection of devices that make up the physical systems that generate, transmit, and distribute power. The term “instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) system” refers to the collection of devices that monitor, control, and protect the power system.

==Automation tasks==
Power-system automation is composed of several tasks. 
;Data acquisition: Data acquisition refers to acquiring, or collecting, data. This data is collected in the form of measured analog current or voltage values or the open or closed status of contact points. Acquired data can be used locally within the device collecting it, sent to another device in a substation, or sent from the substation to one or several databases for use by operators, engineers, planners, and administration.
;Supervision: Computer processes and personnel supervise, or monitor, the conditions and status of the power system using this acquired data. Operators and engineers monitor the information remotely on computer displays and graphical wall displays or locally, at the device, on front-panel displays and laptop computers.
;Control: Control refers to sending command messages to a device to operate the I&amp;C and power-system devices. Traditional supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems rely on operators to supervise the system and initiate commands from an operator console on the master computer. Field personnel can also control devices using front-panel push buttons or a laptop computer.
In addition, another task is power-system integration,  which is the act of communicating data to, from, or among IEDs in the I&amp;C system and remote users. Substation integration refers to combining data from the IED’s local to a substation so that there is a single point of contact in the substation for all of the I&amp;C data.

Power-system automation processes rely on data acquisition; power-system supervision and power-system control all working together in a coordinated automatic fashion. The commands are generated automatically and then transmitted  in the same fashion as operator initiated commands.

==Hardware structure of the power-system automation==

===Data acquisition system===
The instrument transformers with protective relays are used to sense the power-system voltage and current. They are physically connected to power-system apparatus and convert the actual power-system signals. The transducers convert the analog output of an instrument transformer from one magnitude to another or from one value type to another, such as from an ac current to dc voltage. Also the input data is taken from the auxiliary contacts of switch gears and power-system control equipment.

===Main processing instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) device===
The I&amp;C devices built using microprocessors are commonly referred to as intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). Microprocessors are single chip computers that allow the devices into which they are built to process data, accept commands, and communicate information like a computer. Automatic processes can be run in the IEDs. Some IEDs used in power-system automation are:
;[[Remote Terminal Unit]] (RTU): A remote terminal unit is an IED that can be installed in a remote location, and acts as a termination point for field contacts. A dedicated pair of copper conductors is used to sense every contact and transducer value. These conductors originate at the power-system device, are installed in trenches or overhead cable trays, and are then terminated on panels within the RTU. The RTU can transfer collected data to other devices and receive data and control commands from other devices. User programmable RTUs are referred to as “smart RTUs.”
;Meter: A [[Smart meter|meter]] is an IED that is used to create accurate measurements of power-system   current, voltage, and power values. Metering values such as demand and peak are saved within the meter to create historical information about the activity of the power system.
;Digital fault recorder: A digital fault recorder (DFR) is an IED that records information about power-system disturbances. It is capable of storing data in a digital format when triggered by conditions detected on the power system. Harmonics, frequency, and voltage are examples of data captured by DFRs.
;Programmable logic controller (PLC): A [[Programmable logic controller|Programmable Logic Controller]]  can be programmed to perform logical control. As with the RTU, a dedicated pair of copper conductors for each contact and transducer value is terminated on panels within the PLC.It is like a work-horse which work upon the command given by their master.
;[[Protective relay]]: A protective relay is an IED designed to sense power-system disturbances and automatically perform control actions on the I&amp;C system and the power system to protect personnel and equipment. The relay has local termination so that the copper conductors for each contact do not have to be routed to a central termination panel associated with RTU

=== Controlling (output) devices===
;Load [[Tap (transformer)|tap]] changer (LTC): Load tap changers are devices used to change the tap position on transformers. These devices work automatically or can be controlled via another local IED or from a remote operator or process.
;[[Autorecloser|Recloser]] controller: Recloser controllers remotely control the operation of automated reclosers and switches. These devices monitor and store power-system conditions and determine when to perform control actions. They also accept commands from a remote operator or process.

=== Communications devices ===
;Communications processor: A communications processor is a substation controller that incorporates the functions of many other I&amp;C devices into one IED. It has many communications ports to support multiple simultaneous communications links. The communications processor performs data acquisition and control of the other substation IEDs and also concentrates the data it acquires for transmission to one or many masters inside and outside the substation.

==Applications==

===Overcurrent protection===
All lines and all electrical equipment must be protected against prolonged [[overcurrent]]. If the cause of the overcurrent is nearby then automatically that current is interrupted immediately. But if the cause of the overcurrent is outside the local area then a [[backup]] provision automatically disconnects all affected [[Electrical network|circuit]]s after a suitable time delay.

Note that disconnection can, unfortunately, have a [[Cascading failure|cascade]] effect, leading to overcurrent in other circuits that then also must therefore disconnect automatically.

Also note that [[Electric generator|generator]]s that suddenly have lost their load because of such a protection operation will have to shut down automatically immediately, and it may take many hours to restore a proper balance between [[Supply and demand|demand and supply]] in the system, partly because there must be proper [[synchronization]] before any two parts of the system can be reconnected.

Reclosing operations of [[circuit breakers]] usually are attempted automatically, and often are successful during thunderstorms, for example.

===Supervisory control and data acquisition===
{{main|SCADA}}
A ''supervisory control and data acquisition system'' ([[SCADA]]) transmits and receives logic or data from events of controls, metering, measuring, safety and monitoring of process devices such as Electrical equipment, Instrumentation devices, telecommunication on industrial applications. Power system elements ranging from pole-mounted switches to entire power plants can be controlled remotely over long distance communication links. Remote switching, telemetering of [[electrical grid|grid]]s (showing voltage, current, power, direction, consumption in [[kWh]],  etc.), even automatic synchronization is used in some power systems.

==Optical fibers==
Power utility companies protect high voltage lines by monitoring them constantly. This [[SCADA|supervision]] requires the transmission of information between the [[Electrical substation|power substations]] in order to ensure correct operation while controlling every alarm and failure. Legacy telecom networks were interconnected with metallic wires, but the [[Electrical substation|substation]] environment is characterized by a high level of electromagnetic fields that may disturb copper wires.

Authorities use a tele-protection scheme to enable substations to communicate with one another to selectively isolate faults on [[Electric power transmission|high voltage lines]], [[transformer]]s, [[Inductor#Applications|reactors]] and other important elements of the electrical plants. This functionality requires the continuous exchange of critical data in order to assure correct operation. In order to warranty the operation the telecom network should always be in perfect conditions in terms of availability, performance, quality and delays.

Initially these networks were made of metallic conductive media, however the vulnerability of the 56–64 kbit/s channels to [[electromagnetic interference]], signal [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]], and [[Earth potential rise|ground potential rise]] made them too unreliable for the power industry. Strong electromagnetic fields caused by the high voltages and currents in [[Electric power transmission|power lines]] occur regularly in electric substations.

Moreover, during fault conditions electromagnetic perturbations may rise significantly and disturb those communications channels based on copper wires. The reliability of the communications link interconnecting the protection relays is critical and therefore must be resistant to effects encountered in high voltage areas, such as high frequency induction and ground potential rise.

Consequently, the power industry moved to [[optical fiber]]s to interconnect the different items installed in substations. Fiber optics need not be [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] and are immune to the interferences caused by electrical noise, eliminating many of the errors commonly seen with electrical connections. The use of fully optical links from power relays to multiplexers as described by IEEE C37.94 became standard.

A more sophisticated architecture for the protection scheme emphasizes the notion of [[Fault tolerance|fault tolerant]] networks. Instead of using a direct relay connection and dedicated fibers, redundant connections make the protection process more reliable by increasing the availability of critical data interchanges.

==C37.94==
[[File:C37.94 protection architecture.gif|thumb|C37.94 protection architecture]]
'''IEEE C37.94''' , full title ''IEEE Standard for N Times 64 Kilobit Per Second Optical Fiber Interfaces Between Teleprotection and Multiplexer Equipment'', is an [[IEEE]] standard, published in 2002, that defines the rules to interconnect tele-protection and multiplexer devices of power utility companies. The standard defines a data frame format for optical interconnection, and references standards for the physical connector for [[multi-mode optical fiber]]. Furthermore, it defines behavior of connected equipment on failure of the link, and the timing and optical [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] characteristics.

Teleprotection systems must isolate [[Fault (power engineering)|faults]] very quickly to prevent damage to the network and power outages. The IEEE committee defined C37.94 as a programmable n x 64 kbit/s (n=1...12) multimode optical fiber interface to provide transparent communications between teleprotection relays and multiplexers for distances of up to 2&amp;nbsp;km. To reach longer distances, the power industry later adopted a [[Single-mode optical fiber|single mode optical fiber]] interface as well.

The standard defines the protection and communications equipment inside a substation using optical fibers, the method for clock recovery, the jitter tolerances allowed in the signals, the physical connection method, and the actions the protection equipment must follow when any kind of network anomalies and faults occur. C37.94 was already implemented by many protection relay manufacturers such as ABB, SEL, RFL, and RAD. Teleprotection equipment once offered a choice of transmission interfaces, such as the IEEE C37.94 compliant optical fiber interface for transmission over fiber pairs, and [[G.703]], 64kbit/s co-directional and [[E-carrier|E1]] interfaces.

'''Rodinia''' (from the [[Russian language|Russian]] родить, ''rodít'', meaning "to beget, to give birth",&lt;ref name="mcmenamin"&gt;{{Harvnb|McMenamin|McMenamin|1990|loc=chapter: The Rifting of Rodinia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or родина, ''ródina'', meaning "motherland, birthplace")&lt;ref name="RodinaMeaning"&gt;{{Harvnb|Redfern|2001|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taube, Aleksandr M., R. S. Daglish, and M. A. Cantab. Russko-angliiskii Slovar' =: Russian-english Dictionary. Moskva: Russkii iazyk, 1993. Print. {{ISBN|5200018838}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Neoproterozoic]] [[supercontinent]] that was assembled 1.1–0.9 billion years ago and broke up 750–633 million years ago.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Bogdanova|Collins|Davidson|2008|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Valentine|Moores|1970}} were probably the first to recognise a [[Precambrian]] supercontinent, which they named 'Pangaea I'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It was renamed 'Rodinia' by {{Harvnb|McMenamin|McMenamin|1990}} who also were the first to produce a [[plate reconstruction|reconstruction]] and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent.&lt;ref name="Meert 2012"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|2012|loc=Supercontinents in Earth history, p. 998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 [[Gigaannus|Ga]] by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]], assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 Ga collisional events.&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhao|Cawood|Wilde|Sun|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Zhao|Sun|Wilde|Li|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form [[Pannotia]] 633–573 million years ago. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known yet about the exact configuration and [[geodynamics|geodynamic]] history of Rodinia. [[paleomagnetism|Paleomagnetic evidence]] provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the [[Earth's crust]], but not to their [[longitude]], which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed.

The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 million years ago (the so-called [[Snowball Earth]] of the [[Cryogenian]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]) and the rapid [[evolution]] of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and [[Cambrian]] periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;

===Paleogeographic reconstructions===
The idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that [[orogen]]s of this age exist on virtually all [[craton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dewey|Burke|1973}}; the name 'Rodinia' was first used in {{Harvnb|McMenamin|McMenamin|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2016|reason="supercontinent" not mentioned in Dewey &amp; Burke 1973}} Examples are the [[Grenville orogeny]] in North America and the [[Dalslandian orogeny]] in Europe.

Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the correlation between the North American Grenville and European Dalslandian orogenies in {{Harvnb|Ziegler|1990|p=14}}; for the correlation between the Australian [[Musgrave orogeny]] and the Grenville orogeny see {{Harvnb|Wingate|Pisarevsky|Evans|2002|loc=Implications for Rodinia reconstructions, pp. 124–126; fig. 5, p. 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data.

Most reconstructions show Rodinia's core formed by the [[North American craton]] (the later [[paleocontinent]] of [[Laurentia]]), surrounded in the southeast with the [[East European craton]] (the later paleocontinent of [[Baltica]]), the [[Amazonian craton]] ("Amazonia") and the [[West African craton]]; in the south with the [[Río de la Plata Craton|Río de la Plata]] and [[São Francisco craton]]s; in the southwest with the [[Congo craton|Congo]] and [[Kalahari craton]]s; and in the northeast with [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and eastern [[Antarctica]]. The positions of [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and [[North China craton|North]] and [[South China (continent)|South China]] north of the North American craton differ strongly depending on the reconstruction:&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison of the SWEAT, AUSWUS, AUSMEX, and Missing-link reconstructions see {{Harvnb|Li|Bogdanova|Collins|Davidson|2008||loc=Fig. 2, p. 182}}.

Little is known about the paleogeography before the formation of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic and geologic data are only definite enough to form reconstructions from the breakup of Rodinia&lt;ref name="Others"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Other Reconstructions for Rodinia based on sources for Mojavia
 | publisher = Department of Geological Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder | date = May 2002

Rodinia is considered to have formed between 1.3 and 1.23 billion years ago and broke up again before 750 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Torsvik2003"&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|2003|p=1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodinia was surrounded by the [[superocean]] geologists are calling [[Mirovia]] (from [[Russian language|Russian]] мировой, ''mirovoy'', meaning "global").

According to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of [[Precambrian]] times. The other is [[Paleopangea]], Piper's own concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Piper|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the latter part of [[Proterozoic]] times and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent "[[Paleopangaea]]" supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 million years ago and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 million years.&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;{{Harvnb|Piper|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the [[Ediacaran]] Period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between Precambrian and [[Phanerozoic]] times.

===Break up===
In 2009 UNESCO's [[International Geoscience Programme|IGCP]] project 440, named 'Rodinia Assembly and Breakup', concluded that Rodinia broke up in four stages between 825–550 Ma:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bogdanova|Pisarevsky|Li|2009|loc=Breakup of Rodinia (825–700 Ma), pp. 266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The break up was initiated by a [[superplume]] around 825–800 Ma whose influence—such as crustal arching, intense bimodal magmatism, and accumulation of thick rift-type sedimentary successions—have been recorded in South Australia, South China, Tarim, Kalahari, India, and the Arabian-Nubian Craton.
* Rifting progressed in the same cratons 800–750 Ma and spread into Laurentia and perhaps Siberia.  India (including Madagascar) and the Congo-Säo Francisco Craton were either detached from Rodinia during this period or simply never were part of the supercontinent.
* As the central part of Rodinia reached the Equator around 750–700 Ma, a new pulse of magmatism and rifting continued the disassembly in western Kalahari, West Australia, South China, Tarim, and most margins of Laurentia.
* 650–550 Ma several events coincided: the opening of the Iapetus Ocean; the closure of the Braziliano, Adamastor, and Mozambique oceans; and the Pan-African orogeny.  The result was the formation of Gondwana.

The Rodinia hypothesis assumes that [[rift]]ing did not start everywhere simultaneously. Extensive lava flows and volcanic eruptions of Neoproterozoic age are found on most continents, evidence for large scale rifting about 750 million years ago.&lt;ref name="mcmenamin" /&gt; As early as 850 and 800 million years ago,&lt;ref name="Torsvik2003" /&gt; a rift developed between the continental masses of present-day Australia, East Antarctica, India and the Congo and Kalahari cratons on one side and later Laurentia, Baltica, [[Amazonian Craton|Amazonia]] and the West African and Rio de la Plata cratons on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|2003|loc=Fig. 'Rodinia old and new', p. 1380}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rift developed into the [[Adamastor Ocean]] during the Ediacaran.

Around 550 million years ago, on the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian, the first group of cratons eventually fused again with Amazonia, West Africa and the Rio de la Plata cratons.&lt;ref&gt;See for example reconstructions in {{Harvnb|Pisarevsky|Murphy|Cawood|Collins|2008|loc=Fig. 4, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[tectonic phase]] is called the [[Pan-African orogeny]]. It created a configuration of continents that would remain stable for hundreds of millions of years in the form of the continent [[Gondwana]].

In a separate rifting event about 610 million years ago (halfway in the Ediacaran period), the [[Iapetus Ocean]] formed. The eastern part of this ocean formed between Baltica and Laurentia, the western part between Amazonia and Laurentia. Because the exact moments of this separation and the partially contemporaneous Pan-African orogeny are hard to correlate, it might be that all continental mass was again joined in one supercontinent between roughly 600 and 550 million years ago. This hypothetical supercontinent is called [[Pannotia]].

==Influence on paleoclimate and life==
Unlike later supercontinents, Rodinia would have been entirely barren. Rodinia existed before [[complex life]] colonized dry land. Based on sedimentary rock analysis Rodinia's formation happened when the [[ozone layer]] was not as extensive as it is today. Ultraviolet light discouraged organisms from inhabiting its interior. Nevertheless, its existence did significantly influence the marine life of its time.

In the [[Cryogenian period]] the Earth experienced large [[glaciation]]s, and temperatures were at least as cool as today. Substantial areas of Rodinia may have been covered by [[glacier]]s or the southern [[polar ice cap]].

Low temperatures may have been exaggerated during the early stages of continental rifting. [[Geothermal heating]] peaks in crust about to be rifted; and since warmer rocks are less [[Density|dense]], the crustal rocks rise up relative to their surroundings. This rising creates areas of higher altitude, where the air is cooler and ice is less likely to melt with changes in season, and it may explain the evidence of abundant glaciation in the [[Ediacaran]] period.&lt;ref name="mcmenamin"/&gt;

The eventual rifting of the continents created new oceans and [[seafloor spreading]], which produces warmer, less dense [[oceanic lithosphere]]. Due to its lower density, hot oceanic lithosphere will not lie as deep as old, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, the ocean floors come up, causing the [[eustacy|eustatic]] sea level to rise. The result was a greater number of shallower seas.

The increased [[evaporation]] from the larger water area of the oceans may have increased rainfall, which, in turn, increased the weathering of exposed rock. By inputting data  on [[Δ18O|the ratio of stable isotopes &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O]]{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}} into computer models, it has been shown that, in conjunction with quick weathering of [[volcanic rock]], this increased rainfall may have reduced [[greenhouse gas]] levels to below the threshold required to trigger the period of extreme glaciation known as [[Snowball Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Donnadieu|Goddéris|Ramstein|Nédélec|2004|loc=}}{{Page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased volcanic activity also introduced into the marine environment biologically active nutrients, which may have played an important role in the development of the earliest animals.

The '''Sahara pump theory''' is a hypothesis that explains how [[Floristic province|flora]] and [[fauna]] migrated between [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]] via a land bridge in the [[Levant]] region.

==Mechanism==
During periods of a wet or ''[[Green Sahara]]'', the Sahara and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] become a [[savanna]] grassland and African flora and fauna become common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/orbit/gilf-kebir.html |title=Gilf Kebir |last=Walker |first=Stephen |date=8 October 2013 |website=Orbit: Earth's Extraordinary Journey |accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source? |date=December 2013 |reason=The cited website may be a copyright violation and may not be authoritative. See description of the BBC programme at http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xztbr.}} Following inter-pluvial arid periods, the Sahara area then reverts to desert conditions, usually as a result of the retreat of the [[West African Monsoon]] southwards. Evaporation exceeds precipitation, the level of water in lakes like [[Lake Chad]] falls, and rivers become dry [[wadi]]s. Flora and fauna previously widespread as a result retreat northwards to the [[Atlas Mountains]], southwards into [[West Africa]], or eastwards into the [[Nile Valley]] and thence either southeast to the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] and [[Kenya]] or northeast across the [[Sinai]] into [[Asia]]. This separates [[population]]s of some of the species in areas with different [[climate]]s, forcing them to [[adaptation|adapt]], possibly giving rise to [[allopatric speciation]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The [[Plio-Pleistocene]] migrations to Africa included the [[Caprinae]] in two waves at 3.2 Ma and 2.7–2.5 Ma; ''[[Nyctereutes]]'' at 2.5 Ma, and ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'' at 2.3 Ma. ''[[Hippotragus]]'' migrated at 2.6 Ma from Africa to the [[Siwaliks]] of the Himalayas. Asian [[bovid]]s moved to Europe and to and from Africa.

==185,000–20,000 years ago==
Between about 133 and 122 thousand years ago (kya), the southern parts of the Saharan-Arabian Desert experienced the start of the [[Abbassia Pluvial]], a wet period with increased monsoonal precipitation, around 200–100&amp;nbsp;mm/year.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of [[speleothems]] (which requires rainwater) was detected in Hol-Zakh, Ashalim, Even-Sid, Ma'ale-ha-Meyshar, Ktora Cracks, Nagev Tzavoa Cave. In Qafzeh and Es Skuhl caves, where at that time precipitation was 600–1000&amp;nbsp;mm/year, the remains of [[Qafzeh|Qafzeh-Skhul]] type [[anatomically modern humans]] are dated from this period, but human occupation seems to end in the later arid period.

The [[Red Sea]] coastal route was extremely arid before 140 and after 115 kya. Slightly wetter conditions appear at 90–87 kya, but it still was just one tenth the rainfall around 125 kya. [[Speleothem]]s are detected only in Even-Sid-2.&lt;ref name=Vaks2007/&gt;

In the southern [[Negev Desert]] speleothems did not grow between 185–140 kya ([[Marine isotope stage|MIS]] 6), 110–90 (MIS 5.4–5.2), nor after 85 kya nor during most of the interglacial period (MIS 5.1), the glacial period and [[Holocene]]. This suggests that the southern Negev was arid to hyper-arid in these periods.&lt;ref name=Vaks2007/&gt;

The coastal route around the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] may have been open at times during the last glacial; speleothems grew in Hol-Zakh and in Nagev Tzavoa Caves. Comparison of speleothem formation with calcite horizons suggests that the wet periods were limited to only tens or hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Vaks2007/&gt;

==Last Glacial Maximum==

An example of the Saharan pump has occurred after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM).  During the Last Glacial Maximum the Sahara desert was more extensive than it is now with the extent of the tropical forests being greatly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAFRICA.html |title=Africa during the last 150,000 years |first=Jonathan |last=Adams |publisher=Environmental Sciences Division, [[ORNL]] Oak Ridge National Laboratory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501225402/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAFRICA.html |archivedate=2006-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, the lower temperatures reduced the strength of the [[Hadley Cell]] whereby rising tropical air of the [[Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) brings rain to the tropics, while dry descending air, at about [[20th parallel north|20 degrees north]], flows back to the equator and brings desert conditions to this region. This phase is associated with high rates of wind-blown mineral dust, found in marine cores that come from the north tropical Atlantic.

Around 12,500 BC, the amount of dust in the cores in the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bølling]]/[[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] phase suddenly plummets and shows a period of much wetter conditions in the Sahara, indicating a [[Dansgaard-Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger]] (DO) event (a sudden warming followed by a slower cooling of the climate).  The moister Saharan conditions had begun about 12,500 BC, with the extension of the ITCZ northward in the northern hemisphere summer, bringing moist wet conditions and a savanna climate to the Sahara, which (apart from a short dry spell associated with the [[Younger Dryas]]) peaked during the [[Holocene thermal maximum]] climatic phase at 4000 BC when mid-latitude temperatures seem to have been between 2 and 3 degrees warmer than in the recent past.  Analysis of [[Nile River]] deposited sediments in the delta also shows this period had a higher proportion of sediments coming from the [[Blue Nile]], suggesting higher rainfall also in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]].  This was caused principally by a stronger [[monsoon]]al circulation throughout the sub-tropical regions, affecting India, Arabia and the Sahara.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Lake Victoria]] only recently became the source of the [[White Nile]] and dried out almost completely around 15 kya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The sudden subsequent movement of the ITCZ southwards with a [[Heinrich event]] (a sudden cooling followed by a slower warming), linked to changes with the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] cycle, led to a rapid drying out of the Saharan and Arabian regions, which quickly became desert. This is linked to a marked decline in the scale of the Nile floods between 2700 and 2100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, William J. (2007) "Climate Change in Prehistory: the end of the reign of chaos" (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory proposed that humans accelerated the drying out period from 6,000–2,500 BC by pastoralists overgrazing available grassland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-really-turned-sahara-desert-green-oasis-wasteland-180962668/|title=What Really Turned the Sahara Desert From a Green Oasis Into a Wasteland?|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|date=2017-03-24|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|subtropical coniferous forest]] [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] range from the southwest USA region to the western part of [[Mexico]]. They are home to a large number of endemic plants and important habitat for wildlife.

==Setting==
The Sierra Madre Occidental run north to south in western Mexico from the center of the country towards the United States border. Coordinates of a latitude of &lt;math&gt;25^\circ&lt;/math&gt;N and longitude of &lt;math&gt;107^\circ&lt;/math&gt; W. Where the northern extent of the ecoregion consists of patches of forest on the [[Madrean Sky Islands]] sticking up out of the desert of [[Sonora|Sonora, Mexico]] and in the US in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]]. A Landscape of steep mountain valleys with rivers flowing through the canyons. This is a dramatic landscape of steep mountains cut through with canyons including [[Copper Canyon]], the deepest in North America.

The ecoregion consists of a complex of high elevation pine-oak forest enclaves surrounded at lower elevations by [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] and [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forests]] at lower elevations, including the [[Sonoran Desert]] to the northwest, the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] to the northeast and east in Arizona, the [[Meseta Central matorral]] and [[Central Mexican matorral]] to the southeast, and the [[Sinaloan dry forests]] to the west and southwest. The Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests are one of the [[Madrean pine-oak forests]] ecoregions, which are found throughout the Sierra Madre ranges of Mexico and the US Southwest.

An interesting fact about Mexico and its pine trees is that, this country has more pine species than any other country its size. The Sierra Madre Occidental being the largest mountain range in Mexico, is the home to a huge diversity of pine trees species. There are 24 different pine species in this mountain range and most are located in the highland forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental.

==Flora==
The original habitats of the Sierra Madre Occidental included forest of [[pine]]s and [[Douglas-fir]]s at the higher elevations with [[oak]]-wooded grassland on the lower slopes. The vegetation of the pine-oak forest differs between zones of lower temperatures and higher elevations. Some of the Pine trees flourish in higher elevation where more rainfall tends to occur during the summer seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/programs/alamos_vegetation.php|title=Alamos Vegetation|website=www.desertmuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pines and oaks are especially important as there are so many different species of each including a number of endemics.
Predominant conifers among the 27 species found here include [[Apache pine]] (''Pinus engelmannii''), [[Chihuahua pine]] (''Pinus leiophylla''), [[Mexican pinyon]] (''Pinus cembroides''), [[Lumholtz's pine]] (''Pinus lumholtzii''), [[Yécora pine]] (''Pinus yecorensis''), [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' subsp. ''glauca''), and [[Mexican Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga lindleyana'').

Oaks (''Quercus'') are the dominant broadleaf trees, with 21 different species found including ''[[Quercus albocincta]]'', [[Arizona oak]] (''Q. arizonica'') ''[[Quercus carmenensis|Q. carmenensis]]'', ''[[Quercus chihuahuensis|Q. chihuahuensis]]'', ''[[Quercus cordifolia|Q. cordifolia]]'', ''[[Quercus durifolia|Q. durifolia]]'', Emory oak (''[[Quercus emoryi|Q. emoryi]]''), ''[[Quercus grisea|Q. grisea]]'', Mexican blue oak (''[[Quercus oblongifolia|Q. oblongifolia]]''), ''[[Quercus santaclarensis|Q. santaclarensis]]'', and ''[[Quercus tarahumara|Q. tarahumara]]''. Madroño (''[[Arbutus xalapensis]]'' and ''[[Arbutus arizonica|A. arizonica]]'') is found in association with oaks. ''[[Quercus carmenensis|Q. carmenensis]]'' and ''[[Quercus deliquescens|Q. deliquescens]]'' are two oaks endemic to the sky islands portion of the ecoregion.

==Fauna==
The forests are home to more than 300 species of birds including [[golden eagle]], [[thick-billed parrot]] (which is now endangered having been trapped for collections), [[military macaw]] and [[tufted jay]], and were once home to the [[imperial woodpecker]] which is now thought to be extinct.

Mammals include the [[American black bear]] and [[jaguar]]. The rare [[Mexican wolf]] was once common in the mountains but is now not found in the wild while the [[Mexican grizzly bear]] is now thought to be extinct.

The many reptiles include the rock rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus lepidus]]''), twin-spotted rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus pricei]]''), ridgenose rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus willardi]]'') and some [[spiny lizard]]s (''Sceloporus clarki'', ''S. jarrovi'', ''S. scalaris'' and ''S. virgatus'').

Finally the mountains are important stage in the migration route of [[monarch butterflies]].

==Conservation and threats==
The pine forests have been cleared by the logging and paper industries since the 1800s and only a very small percentage of original forest remains. This removal of habitat has resulted in the presumed extinction of the imperial woodpecker, once the largest woodpecker on earth. Areas prioritised for conservation include [[Bavispe]]/[[Sierra del Tigre]] and Copper Canyon, while the only protected area is [[La Michilía]]. There are a number of protected areas of Madrean sky islands in Arizona which are part of the ecoregion although not the Sierra Madre Occidental themselves, including [[Chiricahua National Monument]], [[Galiuro Wilderness]], the Rincon Mountain district of [[Saguaro National Park]], the [[Huachuca Mountains]], [[Pusch Ridge Wilderness Area]], the [[Santa Teresa Mountains]] and the [[Pajarito Mountains, Arizona|Pajarito Mountains]].&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=na0302 |name=Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests|accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase of global warming is expected to have some devastating effects on the pine trees located in the Sierra Madre Occidental. The predicted outcome of global warming in this subtropical region, is the reduction of plant/animal productivity and growth. Another effect would be that the increase of climate warming would also lead to tree mortality affecting not only the pine trees located in the Sierra Madre Occidental but also other pine trees in the surrounding areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4261">'''Stanton Davis Kirkham''' (December 7, 1868&amp;nbsp;– January 6, 1944) was a [[naturalist]], [[philosopher]], [[ornithologist]] and [[author]]. Although widely travelled, he resided primarily in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]], Ontario County, [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was born in [[Nice]], [[Alpes-Maritimes]], [[France]], the only child of [[Major]] Murray S. Davis (Commander, 8th Cavalry, Troop A, Camp Winfield Scott, Nevada, 1867) and Julia Edith Kirkham Davis, daughter of Gen. Ralph Wilson Kirkham, [[Union Army]] [[general]], who adopted Kirkham and brought him to the [[United States of America|United States]]. He was named after Secretary of War [[Edwin M. Stanton]], whom his father had served as an aide.  He attended public schools in [[California]] and later graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

==Biography==
Kirkham was the author of ''As Nature Whispers'' (1902), ''The Ministry of Beauty'' (1907), ''Where Dwells the Soul Serene'' (1907), ''In The Open: Intimate Studies and Appreciations of Nature'' (1908), ''The Philosophy of Self-Help: An Application of Practical Psychology to Daily Life'', (1909), ''Mexican Trails: A Record of Travel in Mexico, 1904-7, and a Glimpse at the Life of the Mexican Indian'' (1909), ''Resources: An Interpretation of the Well-Rounded Life'' (1910), ''East and West: Comparative Studies of Nature in Eastern and Western States'' (1911), ''Outdoor Philosophy: The Meditations of a Naturalist'' (1912), ''North and South: Notes on the Natural History of a Summer Camp and a Winter Home'' (1913), ''Half-True Stories: For Little Folks of Just the Right Age'' (1916), ''After Thirty Years'' (1923), ''Animal Nature and Other Stories'' (1926), ''Cruising Around the World and the Seven Seas'' (1927) and ''Shut-In'' (1936).

He married Mary Clark Williams (1869 - 1911), granddaughter of [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Governor]] [[Myron H. Clark]], on May 16, 1907. They had two children, a son, Paul Kirkham, and a daughter, Mary Clark Kirkham (1908-2000).  He was quoted in Chapter 6 of ''[[As a Man Thinketh]]'' by [[James Allen (author)|James Allen]]. He died in [[New York City]] at the age of 75. An illness he contracted during a horseback journey across [[South America]] in 1914 rendered him an invalid for the latter part of his life. His philosophy, as stated in ''The Ministry of Beauty'' and other works, could be said to fall within the category of [[Transcendentalism]]. He is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Canandaigua, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]].

"'''The war to end war'''" (sometimes called "'''The war to end all wars'''")&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/world_war_i/198172.stm The war to end all wars] ''BBC News'' 10 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt; was a term for the [[First World War]] of 1914–1918. Originally idealistic, it is now used mainly [[sardonically]].&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite book |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |last=Safire |first=William |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=978-0-19-534334-2 |pages=792–3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC&amp;pg=PA792&amp;dq |accessdate=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
During August 1914, immediately after the outbreak of the war, British author and social commentator [[H. G. Wells]] published a number of articles in London newspapers that subsequently appeared as a book entitled ''The War That Will End War''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=H.G. Wells: Traversing Time |last=Wagar |first=W. Warren |year=2004 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8195-6725-3 |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HExGaHDhVbUC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq |accessdate=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells blamed the [[Central Powers]] for the coming of the war and argued that only the defeat of German militarism could bring about an end to war.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell |editor-last=Rempel |editor-first=Richard A. |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-415-10463-0 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9vF8W1dW48C&amp;pg=PA10 |accessdate=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells used the shorter form of the phrase, "the war to end war", in ''In the Fourth Year'' (1918), in which he noted that the phrase had "got into circulation" in the second half of 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Short Works of Herbert George Wells |last=Wells |first=H. G. |authorlink=H. G. Wells |year=2008 |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |location= |isbn=978-1-4375-2652-3 |pages=13–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MkguSdsC3xYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp; |accessdate=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it had become one of the most common [[catchphrase]]s of the First World War.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt;

In later years, the term became associated with [[Woodrow Wilson]], despite the fact that Wilson used the phrase only once.&lt;ref name="Jamieson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eloquence in an Electronic Age: The Transformation of Political Speechmaking |last=Jamieson |first=Kathleen Hall |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |location= |isbn=978-0-19-506317-2 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdFFtM1pvzcC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the phrase "make the world safe for democracy", it embodied Wilson's conviction that [[American entry into World War I|U.S. entry into the war]] was necessary to preserve human freedom.&lt;ref name="Jamieson"/&gt;

==Later use==
Even during World War I, the phrase met with some degree of skepticism; the British politician [[David Lloyd George]] is reputed to have said, "This war, like the next war, is a war to end war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Book about American Politics |last=Stimpson |first=George William |year=1952 |publisher=Harper |location= |isbn= |page=365 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eQ5AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22like+the+next%22+%22war+to+end+war%22+lloyd+george&amp;dq=%22like+the+next%22+%22war+to+end+war%22+lloyd+george&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s6tzTK2JOsWjOJf3zc0I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA |accessdate=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As it became apparent that the war had not succeeded in ending war, the phrase took on a more cynical tone. The British staff officer [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], a future [[field marshal]] and [[viceroy of India]], said despondently of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], "After the 'war to end war', they seem to have been in Paris at making the 'Peace to end Peace'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Worlds at War: The 2,500-year Struggle between East and West |last=Pagden |first=Anthony |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |location= |isbn=978-0-19-923743-2 |page=407 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m80kwkt8YW4C&amp;pg=PA407&amp;d |accessdate=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells himself used the phrase in an ironic way in the novel ''[[The Bulpington of Blup]]'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''The Bulpington of Blup |last=Wells |first=H. G. |year=1932 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=161, 163, 173 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtPlMpq6YkkC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=|accessdate=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Lippmann]] wrote in ''[[Newsweek]]'' in 1967, "The delusion is that whatever war we are fighting is the war to end war", while U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], in his "Silent Majority" speech, said, "I do not tell you that the war in Vietnam is the war to end wars".&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Transnational organization''' is a term used in scholarly literature. It refers to [[international organization]]s (usually, [[international nongovernmental organization]]s) that "transcend" the idea of a [[nation-state]].

The distinction between an international and a '''transnational organization''' is unclear and has been criticized by some scholars (ex. Colás, 2002).

Transnational relations have been defined as “contacts, coalitions, and interactions across state boundaries that are not controlled by the central foreign policy organs of governments.”  Examples of transnational entities are “multinational business enterprises and revolutionary movements; trade unions and scientific networks; international air transport cartels and communications activities in outer space.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nye, Jr.|first=Joseph S.|author2=Robert O. Keohane|title=Transnational Relations and World Politics: An Introduction|journal=International Organization|year=1971|volume=25|issue=3|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/sdrelint/ficheros_materiales/materiales016.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2011|page=331|doi=10.1017/s0020818300026187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transnational social movements are “the broad tendencies that often manifest themselves in particular [[International non-governmental organization|International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs)]].”  Examples of transnational social movements include human rights, women’s, peace, labor, green, or student movements manifested in [[Amnesty International]], the [[Peace Brigades International]], the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Robin|title=Transnational social movements: an assessment|url=http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/working%20papers/cohen.pdf|publisher=Department of Sociology, University of Warwick|accessdate=27 November 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further definition: “An organization is "transnational" rather than "national" if it carries on significant centrally-directed operations in the territory of two or more nation-states. Similarly, an organization will be called "international" rather than "national" only if the control of the organization is explicitly shared among representatives of two or more nationalities. And an organization is "multinational" rather than "national" only if people from two or more nationalities participate significantly in its operation.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=336|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Transnational organizations are designed to facilitate the pursuit of a single interest within many national units.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=338|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Ministerial posts in the Yeltsin Presidency===
In 1998, Viktor Khristenko was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister for Economy and Finance in [[Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet]]. Described as a "little-known reformist", his appointment drew quite some attention as it was seen as a sign towards economic reform under the [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin Presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/03/98/russian_crisis/85669.stm|title=Viktor Khristenko: the third reformer|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 April 1998|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He however didn't survive the government reshuffling under the following Prime Minister [[Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet|Primakov]]. From 1999 until early 2000, he was however appointed to [[Vladimir Putin's First Cabinet]] serving as [[First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia|First Deputy Prime Minister]].

===Ministerial posts in the Putin Presidency===
In February 2004, Khristenko briefly served as the acting [[Prime Minister of Russia]],&lt;ref name=TERM&gt;[http://www.rulers.org/rulqr.html Russia from 1991: Prime Ministers] Rulers&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Russian President|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] fired Prime Minister [[Mikhail Kasyanov]] on 24 February 2004.

Khristenko was described as a "broadly reformist technocrat," who had shown "loyalty mixed with extreme caution," unlike the outgoing prime minister who had "openly disagreed with Mr Putin several times, criticizing the criminal investigations into the owners of [[Yukos]].&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 25 February 2004, cited via Ian Jeffries: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1fisAgAAQBAJ Political Developments in Contemporary Russia]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called Kasyanov "the most powerful ally of big business remaining in the Russian government." Khristenko, 46 at the time, was promoted from deputy prime minister to acting prime minister.&lt;ref name=SURPRISE/&gt; Putin commented that Kasyanov's ousting was not related to the results of the government's activities, which he characterized as positive, but rather was caused by a necessity to once again confirm his position, which would guide the development of the country after 14 March 2004.&lt;ref name=Regnum&gt;"[http://lenta.ru/russia/2004/02/24/start1/ Виктор Христенко приступил к исполнению обязанностей главы правительства] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216155718/http://lenta.ru/russia/2004/02/24/start1/ |date=16 February 2005 }}" (''Viktor Khristenko Becomes Acting Prime-Minister''), Lenta, 24 February  2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks ahead of the [[Russian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Putin however nominated [[Mikhail Fradkov]] to become the next prime minister, four days later to be confirmed by the [[State Duma]].&lt;ref name=FRADKOV&gt;[http://www.rulers.org/2004-03.html March 2004, Russia] Rulers&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 March 2004, Kristenko was appointed [[Ministry of Industry and Trade (Russia)|Minister of Industry and Trade]] instead, a post which he held until 31 January 2012.

===Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission===
Khristenko became the first [[Eurasian Economic Commission|Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission]], which started operations in February 2012. He resigned on February 1, 2016.

==Personal life==
Khristenko's second wife, [[Tatyana Golikova]], was Minister of Health and Social Development from 2007 to 2012.  They married in 2003.

The '''War Industries Board''' (WIB) was a [[United States]] government agency established on July 28, 1917, during [[World War I]], to coordinate the purchase of war supplies between the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] (Department of the Army) and the Navy Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=War Purchase Board of Three proposed |date=July 11, 1917 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[United States Department of Defense]] ([[The Pentagon]]) would only come into existence in 1947, this was an ad hoc construction to promote cooperation between the Army and the Navy (with regard to procurement), it was founded by the [[Council of National Defense]] (which on its turn came into existence by the [[appropriation bill]] of August 1916). The ''War Industries Board'' was preceded by the General Munitions Board —which didn't have the authority it needed and was later strengthened and transformed into the WIB.&lt;ref&gt;Risch, Erna (1989). Quartermaster Support of the Army: a history of the Corps, 1775-1939. Washington, DC. Center of Military History, United States Army. p.604.&lt;/ref&gt;

The board was led initially by Frank A. Scott, who had previously been head of the General Munitions Board.  He was replaced in November by [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] president [[Daniel Willard]].  Finally, in January 1918, the board was reorganized under the leadership of financier [[Bernard M. Baruch]].

The organization encouraged companies to use [[mass-production]] techniques to increase efficiency and urged them to eliminate waste by standardizing products. The board set production quotas and allocated raw materials. It also conducted psychological testing to help people find the right jobs.

The WIB dealt with labor-management disputes resulting from increased demand for products during World War I. The government could not negotiate prices and could not handle worker strikes, so the War Industries Board regulated the two to decrease tensions by stopping strikes with wage increases to prevent a shortage of supplies going to the war in Europe.

Under the War Industries Board, industrial production in the U.S. increased 20 percent, however, the vast majority of the war material was produced too late to do any good.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur. ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II,'' pp. 12-16, 77, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6964-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The War Industries Board was decommissioned by an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] on January 1, 1919.

With the war mobilization conducted under the supervision of the War Industries Board, unprecedented fortunes fell upon war producers and certain holders of raw materials and patents. Hearings in 1934 by the [[Nye Committee]] led by U.S. Senator [[Gerald Nye]] were intended to hold war profiteers to account.

Despite its relatively brief existence, the WIB was a major step in the development of national planning and government-business cooperation in the United States, and its precedents —like the [[National Recovery Administration]]— were influential during the [[New Deal]] and World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/war_industries_board war industries board]. 1914-1918-online.

'''Wireless power transfer''' ('''WPT'''), '''wireless power transmission''', '''wireless energy transmission''' ('''WET'''), or [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] power transfer is the transmission of [[electrical energy]]  without [[wire]]s as a physical link. In a wireless power transmission system, a transmitter device, driven by electric power from a [[electric power source|power source]], generates a time-varying [[electromagnetic field]], which transmits power across space to a receiver device, which extracts power from the field and supplies it to an [[electrical load]]. The technology of the wireless power transmission can eliminate the use of the wires and batteries, thus it increases the mobility of the electronic devices, more convenient and safer for all users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=F.N.|last2=Jamail|first2=N.A.M.|last3=Othman|first3=N.A.|date=2016|title=Development of wireless electricity transmission through resonant coupling|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cp.2016.1290|journal=4th IET Clean Energy and Technology Conference (CEAT 2016)|publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology|doi=10.1049/cp.2016.1290|isbn=9781785612381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wireless power transfer is useful to power electrical devices where interconnecting wires are inconvenient, hazardous, or are not possible.

Wireless power techniques mainly fall into two categories, [[Near and far field|near field]] and [[Near and far field|far-field]].  In ''[[Near and far field|near field]]'' or ''non-radiative''  techniques, power is transferred over short distances by [[magnetic field]]s using [[inductive coupling]] between [[electromagnetic coil|coils of wire]], or by [[electric field]]s using [[capacitive coupling]] between metal [[electrode]]s.&lt;ref name="ECN2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trancutaneous Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capacitive Elements for Wireless Power Transfer to biomedical implants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer to biomedical implants"/&gt;  Inductive coupling is the most widely used wireless technology; its applications include charging handheld devices like phones and [[electric toothbrush]]es, [[RFID]] tags, and wirelessly charging or continuous wireless power transfer in implantable medical devices like [[artificial cardiac pacemaker]]s, or [[electric vehicles]].

In ''[[Near and far field|far-field]]'' or ''radiative'' techniques, also called ''power beaming'', power is transferred by beams of [[electromagnetic radiation]], like [[microwave]]s or [[laser]] beams.  These techniques can transport energy longer distances but must be aimed at the receiver.  Proposed applications for this type are [[solar power satellite]]s, and wireless powered [[drone aircraft]].&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bush|first1=Stephen F.|title=Smart Grid: Communication-Enabled Intelligence for the Electric Power Grid|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2014|page=118|language=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUSMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118|isbn=978-1118820230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCMag"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wireless energy transfer|website=Encyclopedia of terms|publisher=PC Magazine Ziff-Davis|date=2014|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/57396/wireless-energy-transfer|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129534.900-wireless-charging-for-electric-vehicles-hits-the-road.html New Scientist:Wireless charging for electric vehicles hits the road]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wireless power transfer is a generic term for a number of different technologies for transmitting energy by means of [[electromagnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name="Shinohara1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shinohara|first1=Naoki|title=Wireless Power Transfer via Radiowaves|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2014|location=|pages=ix–xiii|language=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwegAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9|isbn=978-1118862964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gopinath"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gopinath |first1=Ashwin |title=All About Transferring Power Wirelessly |journal=Electronics for You E-zine |pages=52–56 |date=August 2013 |url=http://www.efymagonline.com/pdf/52_Wireless%20Power%20Transfer_EFY%20August%202013.pdf |accessdate=16 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119044123/http://www.efymagonline.com/pdf/52_Wireless%20Power%20Transfer_EFY%20August%202013.pdf |archivedate=19 January 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="X.

In general a wireless power system consists of a "transmitter" device connected to a source of power such as a [[mains power]] line, which converts the power to a time-varying electromagnetic field, and one or more "receiver" devices which receive the power and convert it back to DC or AC electric current which is used by an [[electrical load]].&lt;ref name="Shinohara1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt;  At the transmitter the input power is converted to an oscillating [[electromagnetic field]] by some type of "[[antenna (radio)|antenna]]" device.  The word "antenna" is used loosely here; it may be a coil of wire which generates a [[magnetic field]], a metal plate which generates an [[electric field]], an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] which radiates radio waves, or a [[laser]] which generates light.  A similar antenna or [[Coupling (electronics)|coupling]] device at the receiver converts the oscillating fields to an electric current.  An important parameter that determines the type of waves is the [[frequency]], which determines the wavelength.

Wireless power uses the same fields and waves as [[wireless communication]] devices like [[radio]],&lt;ref name="Sazonov"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sazonov|first1=Edward|last2=Neuman|first2=Michael R.|title=Wearable Sensors: Fundamentals, Implementation and Applications|publisher=Elsevier|date=2014|pages=253–255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGJzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0124186668}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinohara2" &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TwegAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP27 Shinohara 2014 ''Wireless Power Transfer via Radiowaves'', p. 27]&lt;/ref&gt; another familiar technology that involves electrical energy transmitted without wires by electromagnetic fields, used in [[cellphone]]s, [[radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[television broadcasting]], and [[WiFi]].  In [[radio communication]] the goal is the transmission of information, so the amount of power reaching the receiver is not so important, as long as it is sufficient that the information can be received intelligibly.&lt;ref name="Gopinath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sazonov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinohara2" /&gt;  In wireless communication technologies only tiny amounts of power reach the receiver.  In contrast, with wireless power transfer the amount of energy received is the important thing, so the [[efficiency]] (fraction of transmitted energy that is received) is the more significant parameter.&lt;ref name="Gopinath" /&gt;  For this reason, wireless power technologies are likely to be more limited by distance than wireless communication technologies.

Wireless power transfer may be used to power up wireless information transmitters or receivers. This type of communication is known as wireless powered communication (WPC). When the harvested power is used to supply the power of wireless information transmitters, the network is known as Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT);&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis Krikidis, Stelios Timotheou, Symeon Nikolaou, Gan Zheng, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Robert Schober (Aug 2014), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0261 "Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Modern Communication Systems"]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas when it is used to supply the power of wireless information receivers, it is known as a Wireless Powered Communication Network (WPCN).&lt;ref&gt;Suzhi Bi, Yong Zeng, and Rui Zhang (May 2016) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06366 "Wireless powered communication networks: an overview"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arman Ahmadian, Hyuncheol Park (Jul 2018), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05543 "Maximizing Ergodic Throughput in Wireless Powered Communication Networks"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzhi Bi,  Chin Keong Ho, and Rui Zhang (April 2016), [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7081084/ "Wireless powered communication: opportunities and challenges"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) provided its first certification for a wireless transmission charging system in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/26/fcc-approves-first-wireless-power-at-a-distance-charging-syste/|title=FCC approves first wireless 'power-at-a-distance' charging system|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field regions==
[[electric field|Electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s are created by [[charged particle]]s in matter such as [[electron]]s.  A stationary charge creates an [[electrostatic field]] in the space around it.  A steady [[electric current|current]] of charges ([[direct current]], DC) creates a static [[magnetic field]] around it.  The above fields contain [[energy]], but cannot carry [[Electric power|power]] because they are static.  However time-varying fields can carry power.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accelerating electric charges, such as are found in an [[alternating current]] (AC) of electrons in a wire, create time-varying electric and magnetic fields in the space around them.  These fields can exert oscillating forces on the electrons in a receiving "antenna", causing them to move back and forth.  These represent alternating current which can be used to power a load.

The oscillating electric and magnetic fields surrounding moving electric charges in an antenna device can be divided into two regions, depending on distance  '''''D''&lt;sub&gt;range&lt;/sub&gt;''' from the antenna.&lt;ref name="Shinohara1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sazonov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valtchev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rajakaruna"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rajakaruna|first1=Sumedha|last2=Shahnia|first2=Farhad|last3=Ghosh|first3=Arindam|title=Plug In Electric Vehicles in Smart Grids: Integration Techniques|publisher=Springer|date=2014|pages=34–36|language=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYWhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|isbn=978-9812872999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agbinya"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agbinya|first1=Johnson I.|title=Wireless Power Transfer|publisher=River Publishers|date=2012|location=|pages=1–2|language=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDPqqBJ76ZAC&amp;pg=PA1|isbn=978-8792329233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, if far apart, doubling the distance between the two antennas causes the power received to decrease by a factor of 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 64. As a result, inductive and [[capacitive coupling]] can only be used for short-range power transfer, within a few times the diameter of the antenna device '''''D''&lt;sub&gt;ant&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  Unlike in a radiative system where the maximum radiation occurs when the dipole antennas are oriented transverse to the direction of propagation, with dipole fields the maximum coupling occurs when the dipoles are oriented longitudinally.

An [[alternating current]] (AC) through the transmitter coil ''(L1)'' creates an oscillating [[magnetic field]] ''(B)'' by [[Ampere's circuital law|Ampere's law]].  The magnetic field  passes through the receiving coil ''(L2)'', where it induces an alternating [[electromotive force|EMF]] ([[voltage]]) by [[Faraday's law of induction]], which creates an alternating current in the receiver.&lt;ref name="Gopinath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;  The induced alternating current may either drive the load directly, or be [[rectifier|rectified]] to [[direct current]] (DC) by a [[rectifier]] in the receiver, which drives the load.  A few systems, such as electric toothbrush charging stands, work at  50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz so AC [[Mains power|mains current]] is applied directly to the transmitter coil, but in most systems an [[electronic oscillator]] generates a higher frequency AC current which drives the coil, because transmission efficiency improves with [[frequency]].&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

The power transferred increases with frequency&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; and the [[mutual inductance]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; between the coils,&lt;ref name="Gopinath" /&gt; which depends on their geometry and the distance &lt;math&gt;D_\text{range}&lt;/math&gt; between them.

If the two coils are on the same axis and close together so all the magnetic flux from &lt;math&gt;L1&lt;/math&gt; passes through &lt;math&gt;L2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt; and the link efficiency approaches 100%.  The greater the separation between the coils, the more of the magnetic field from the first coil misses the second, and the lower &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the link efficiency are, approaching zero at large separations.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;  The link efficiency and power transferred is roughly proportional to &lt;math&gt;k^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;  In order to achieve high efficiency, the coils must be very close together, a fraction of the coil diameter &lt;math&gt;D_\text{ant}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; usually within centimeters,&lt;ref name="Tan" /&gt; with the coils' axes aligned.

Ordinary inductive coupling can only achieve high efficiency when the coils are very close together, usually adjacent.  In most modern inductive systems [[resonant inductive coupling]] ''(described below)'' is used, in which the efficiency is increased by using [[resonant circuit]]s.&lt;ref name="Agbinya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinohara" /&gt;  This can achieve high efficiencies at greater distances than nonresonant inductive coupling.

[[File:Wireless power - resonant inductive coupling.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Diagram of the resonant inductive wireless power system demonstrated by [[Marin Soljačić]]'s MIT team in 2007. The [[resonant circuit]]s were coils of copper wire which resonated with their internal capacitance (dotted capacitors) at 10 MHz.  Power was coupled into the transmitter resonator, and out of the receiver resonator into the rectifier, by small coils which also served for [[impedance matching]].]]

[[Resonant inductive coupling]] (''electrodynamic coupling'',&lt;ref name="Valtchev" /&gt; ''strongly coupled magnetic resonance''&lt;ref name="Karalis" /&gt;) is a form of inductive coupling in which power is transferred by magnetic fields ''(B, green)'' between two [[resonant circuit]]s (tuned circuits), one in the transmitter and one in the receiver ''(see diagram, right)''.&lt;ref name="Sazonov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valtchev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agbinya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinohara" /&gt;  Each resonant circuit consists of a coil of wire connected to a [[capacitor]], or a [[self-resonant frequency|self-resonant]] coil or other [[resonator]] with internal capacitance.  The two are tuned to resonate at the same [[resonant frequency]].  The resonance between the coils can greatly increase coupling and power transfer, analogously to the way a vibrating [[tuning fork]] can induce [[sympathetic vibration]] in a distant fork tuned to the same pitch.

The concept behind resonant inductive coupling systems is that high [[Q factor]] [[resonator]]s exchange energy at a much higher rate than they lose energy due to internal [[damping]].&lt;ref name="Karalis" /&gt;  Therefore, by using resonance, the same amount of power can be transferred at greater distances, using the much weaker magnetic fields out in the peripheral regions ("tails") of the near fields (these are sometimes called [[Evanescent field#Evanescent-wave coupling|evanescent fields]]&lt;ref name="Karalis" /&gt;).  Resonant inductive coupling can achieve high efficiency at ranges of 4 to 10 times the coil diameter ('''''D''&lt;sub&gt;ant&lt;/sub&gt;''').&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baarman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agbinya3" /&gt; This is considered "mid-range" transfer,&lt;ref name="Baarman" /&gt; in contrast to the "short range" of nonresonant inductive transfer, which can achieve similar efficiencies only when the coils are adjacent.  Another advantage is that resonant circuits interact with each other so much more strongly than they do with nonresonant objects that power losses due to absorption in stray nearby objects are negligible.&lt;ref name="Agbinya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karalis" /&gt;

A drawback of resonant coupling theory is that at close ranges when the two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, the resonant frequency of the system is no longer constant but "splits" into two resonant peaks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/8/1229/htm Frequency Splitting Analysis and Compensation Method for Inductive Wireless Powering of Implantable Biosensors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/4/498/htm Combined Conformal Strongly-Coupled Magnetic Resonance for Efficient Wireless Power Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lessmiths.com/~kjsmith/crystal/resonance.shtml A graphical look at Resonance]&lt;/ref&gt; so the maximum power transfer no longer occurs at the original resonant frequency and the oscillator frequency must be tuned to the new resonance peak.&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neo"&gt;[http://blog.livedoor.jp/neotesla/archives/51508967.html Reconsideration of Wireless Power Transfer principle which presented by MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;

Resonant technology is currently being widely incorporated in modern inductive wireless power systems.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;  One of the possibilities envisioned for this technology is area wireless power coverage.  A coil in the wall or ceiling of a room might be able to wirelessly power lights and mobile devices anywhere in the room, with reasonable efficiency.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;  An environmental and economic benefit of wirelessly powering small devices such as clocks, radios, music players and [[remote control]]s is that it could drastically reduce the 6 billion [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] disposed of each year, a large source of [[toxic waste]] and groundwater contamination.&lt;ref name="Tan" /&gt;

===Capacitive coupling===
{{Main|Capacitive coupling}}
[[Capacitive coupling]] also referred to as electric coupling, makes use of electric fields for the transmission of power between two [[Electrode|electrodes]] (an [[anode]] and [[cathode]]) forming a [[capacitance]] for the transfer of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wipo-wirelesspower.com/technology/resonant-capacitive-coupling|title=Resonant Capacitive Coupling|last=Webmaster|website=www.wipo-wirelesspower.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[capacitive coupling]] ([[electrostatic induction]]), the conjugate of [[inductive coupling]], energy is transmitted by electric fields&lt;ref name="ECN2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gopinath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trancutaneous Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer to biomedical implants"/&gt; between [[electrode]]s&lt;ref name="Capacitive Elements for Wireless Power Transfer to biomedical implants"/&gt; such as metal plates.

The amount of power transferred increases with the [[frequency]]&lt;ref name="Huschens" /&gt; the square of the voltage, and the [[capacitance]] between the plates, which is proportional to the area of the smaller plate and (for short distances) inversely proportional to the separation.&lt;ref name="Gopinath" /&gt;

Capacitive coupling has only been used practically in a few low power applications, because the very high voltages on the electrodes required to transmit significant power can be hazardous,&lt;ref name="Sazonov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valtchev" /&gt; and can cause unpleasant side effects such as noxious [[ozone]] production. In addition, in contrast to magnetic fields,&lt;ref name="Karalis" /&gt; electric fields interact strongly with most materials, including the human body, due to [[dielectric polarization]].&lt;ref name="Puers" /&gt;  Intervening materials between or near the electrodes can absorb the energy, in the case of humans possibly causing excessive electromagnetic field exposure.&lt;ref name="Sazonov" /&gt;  However capacitive coupling has a few advantages over inductive coupling.  The field is largely confined between the capacitor plates, reducing interference, which in inductive coupling requires heavy ferrite "flux confinement" cores.&lt;ref name="Gopinath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Puers" /&gt;  Also, alignment requirements between the transmitter and receiver are less critical.&lt;ref name="Gopinath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sazonov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huschens" /&gt; Capacitive coupling has recently been applied to charging battery powered portable devices&lt;ref name="ECN2011"/&gt; as well as charging or continuous wireless power transfer in biomedical implants,&lt;ref name="Trancutaneous Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capacitive Elements for Wireless Power Transfer to biomedical implants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer to biomedical implants"/&gt; and is being considered as a means of transferring power between substrate layers in integrated circuits.&lt;ref name="Meindl"&gt;{{cite book | last1  = Meindl | first1 = James D. | title  = Integrated Interconnect Technologies for 3D Nanoelectronic Systems | publisher = Artech House | date   = 2008 | location = | pages  = 475–477 | language = | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=OtY-66XCMuYC&amp;pg=PA475&amp;lpg=PA475&amp;dq=%22wireless+power%22+%22capacitive+coupling%22 | doi = | id  = | isbn   = 978-1596932470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each transmitter plate is coupled to a receiver plate. The transmitter [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] drives the transmitter plates in opposite phase (180° phase difference) by a high alternating voltage, and the load is connected between the two receiver plates.  The alternating electric fields induce opposite phase alternating potentials in the receiver plates, and this "push-pull" action causes current to flow back and forth between the plates through the load.  A disadvantage of this configuration for wireless charging is that the two plates in the receiving device must be aligned face to face with the charger plates for the device to work.&lt;ref name="X.

====Resonant capacitive coupling====
Resonance can also be used with capacitive coupling to extend the range.  At the turn of the 20th century, [[Nikola Tesla]] did the first experiments with both resonant inductive and capacitive coupling.

===Magnetodynamic coupling&lt;!-- "Magnetodynamic coupling" doesn't appear to be fundamentally discernible from resonant inductive coupling. Section is poorly sourced. --&gt;===
In this method, power is transmitted between two rotating [[armature (electrical engineering)|armatures]], one in the transmitter and one in the receiver, which rotate synchronously, coupled together by a [[magnetic field]] generated by [[permanent magnet]]s on the armatures.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;  The transmitter armature is turned either by or as the rotor of an [[electric motor]], and its magnetic field exerts [[torque]] on the receiver armature, turning it.  The magnetic field acts like a mechanical coupling between the armatures.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;  The receiver armature produces power to drive the load, either by turning a separate [[electric generator]] or by using the receiver armature itself as the rotor in a generator.

This device has been proposed as an alternative to inductive power transfer for noncontact charging of [[electric vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;  A rotating armature embedded in a garage floor or curb would turn a receiver armature in the underside of the vehicle to charge its batteries.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;  It is claimed that this technique can transfer power over distances of 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;cm (4 to 6 inches) with high efficiency, over 90%.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shahan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shahan|first1=Zach|title=ELIX Wireless Rolls Out A 10kW Wireless EV Charger With 92% Efficiency|url=http://evobsession.com/elix-wireless-rolls-out-a-10kw-wireless-ev-charger-with-92-efficiency/|website=EVObsession.com|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the low frequency stray magnetic fields produced by the rotating magnets produce less [[electromagnetic interference]] to nearby electronic devices than the high frequency magnetic fields produced by inductive coupling systems.  A prototype system charging electric vehicles has been in operation at [[University of British Columbia]] since 2012.  Other researchers, however, claim that the two energy conversions (electrical to mechanical to electrical again) make the system less efficient than electrical systems like inductive coupling.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;

{{anchor|radiative_far_field}}

==Far-field (radiative) techniques==
[[Near and far field|Far field]] methods achieve longer ranges, often multiple kilometer ranges, where the distance is much greater than the diameter of the device(s). High-[[directivity]] antennas or well-collimated laser light produce a beam of energy that can be made to match the shape of the receiving area. The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by [[diffraction]].

In general, [[light beam|visible light]] (from lasers) and [[microwave radiation|microwaves]] (from purpose-designed antennas) are the forms of electromagnetic radiation best suited to energy transfer.

The dimensions of the components may be dictated by the distance from [[transmitter]] to [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], the [[wavelength]] and the [[Rayleigh criterion]] or [[diffraction]] limit, used in standard [[radio frequency]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] design, which also applies to lasers. [[Airy disc|Airy's diffraction limit]] is also frequently used to determine an approximate spot size at an arbitrary distance from the [[aperture]]. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies); so, for example, a blue laser is diffracted less than a red one.

The [[Rayleigh criterion]] dictates that any radio wave, microwave or laser beam will spread and become weaker and [[diffusion|diffuse]] over distance; the larger the transmitter antenna or laser aperture compared to the [[wavelength]] of radiation, the tighter the beam and the less it will spread as a function of distance (and vice versa). Smaller antennae also suffer from excessive losses due to [[side lobe]]s. However, the concept of [[Numerical aperture#Laser physics|laser aperture]] considerably differs from an antenna. Typically, a laser aperture much larger than the wavelength induces [[Transverse mode#Laser modes|multi-moded]] radiation and mostly [[Collimating lens|collimators]] are used before emitted radiation couples into a fiber or into space.

Ultimately, [[beamwidth]] is physically determined by diffraction due to the dish size in relation to the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation used to make the beam.

Microwave power beaming can be more efficient than lasers, and is less prone to atmospheric [[attenuation]] caused by dust or [[water vapor]].

Here, the power levels are calculated by combining the above parameters together, and adding in the [[Antenna gain|gains]] and [[Attenuation|losses]] due to the antenna characteristics and the [[Transparency (optics)|transparency]] and [[Dispersion relation|dispersion]] of the medium through which the radiation passes. That process is known as calculating a [[Link Budget|link budget]].

===Microwaves===
{{Main|Microwave power transmission}}
[[File:Suntower.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's depiction of a [[solar satellite]] that could send electric energy by microwaves to a space vessel or planetary surface.]]
Power transmission via radio waves can be made more directional, allowing longer-distance power beaming, with shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, typically in the [[Microwave power transmission|microwave]] range.&lt;ref name="Massa2013"&gt;{{cite journal |first= A.

Power beaming by microwaves has the difficulty that, for most space applications, the required aperture sizes are very large due to [[diffraction]] limiting antenna directionality. For example, the 1978 [[NASA]] study of solar power satellites required a {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=mid|-diameter}} transmitting antenna and a {{convert|10|km|mi|adj=mid|-diameter}} receiving rectenna for a microwave beam at [[ISM band|2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although short wavelengths may have difficulties with atmospheric absorption and beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the "[[thinned-array curse]]", it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites.

For earthbound applications, a large-area 10&amp;nbsp;km diameter receiving array allows large total power levels to be used while operating at the low power density suggested for human electromagnetic exposure safety. A human safe power density of 1&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; distributed across a 10&amp;nbsp;km diameter area corresponds to 750 megawatts total power level. This is the power level found in many modern electric power plants.

Following World War II, which saw the development of high-power microwave emitters known as [[magnetron|cavity magnetrons]], the idea of using microwaves to transfer power was researched. By 1964, a miniature helicopter propelled by microwave power had been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0474925 Experimental Airborne Microwave Supported Platform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302204238/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0474925 |date=2 March 2010 }} Descriptive Note : Final rept.

Japanese researcher [[Hidetsugu Yagi]] also investigated wireless energy transmission using a directional array antenna that he designed. In February 1926, Yagi and his colleague [[Shintaro Uda]] published their first paper on the tuned high-gain directional array now known as the [[Yagi antenna]]. While it did not prove to be particularly useful for power transmission, this beam antenna has been widely adopted throughout the broadcasting and wireless telecommunications industries due to its excellent performance characteristics.&lt;ref name="Yagi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net/reiman/05_2004.htm |title=Scanning the Past: A History of Electrical Engineering from the Past, Hidetsugu Yagi |publisher=Ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net |accessdate=4 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611154616/http://ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net/reiman/05_2004.htm |archivedate=11 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatina – University of La Réunion – Faculty of Science and Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; These methods achieve distances on the order of a kilometer.

Under experimental conditions, microwave conversion efficiency was measured to be around 54% across one meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=W.C.|author2=Eves, E.E. |title=Beamed microwave power transmission and its application to space|journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques|date=June 1992|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1239–1250|doi=10.1109/22.141357|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3118068|bibcode = 1992ITMTT..40.1239B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A change to 24&amp;nbsp;GHz has been suggested as microwave emitters similar to LEDs have been made with very high quantum efficiencies using negative resistance, i.e., Gunn or IMPATT diodes, and this would be viable for short range links.

===Lasers===
[[File:Laser-powered model airplane.jpg|thumb|A laser beam centered on a panel of photovoltaic cells provides enough power to a lightweight model airplane for it to fly.]]

In the case of electromagnetic radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum (tens of [[micrometers]] to tens of [[nanometers]]), power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a [[laser]] beam that is then pointed at a photovoltaic cell.&lt;ref name="FraunhoferISE"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/business-areas/iii-v-and-concentrator-photovoltaics/research-topics/power-by-light|title=Power-by-Light|website=Fraunhofer ISE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OpticalWPT"&gt;{{Cite book |first= A.| last= Sahai.| title= Optical wireless power transmission at long wavelengths | journal=IEEE International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS), 2011, Santa Monica, CA | date=2 June 2011 | issue=Print |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5783662 |doi= 10.1109/ICSOS.2011.5783662 |pages= 164–170 |last2= Graham |first2= David |isbn= 978-1-4244-9686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism is generally known as 'power beaming' because the power is beamed at a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy.

* [[Collimated]] monochromatic [[wavefront]] propagation allows narrow beam cross-section area for transmission over large distances.
* Compact size: [[solid state laser]]s fit into small products.
* No [[radio-frequency]] interference to existing radio communication such as [[Wi-Fi]] and cell phones.
* Access control: only receivers hit by the laser receive power.

Drawbacks include:
* Laser radiation is hazardous. Low power levels can blind humans and other animals. High power levels can kill through localized spot heating.
* Conversion between electricity and light is limited. Photovoltaic cells achieve 40%–50% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laserfocusworld.com/display_article/245124/12/ARCHI/none/Feat/PHOTONIC-FRONTIERS:-Photonic-power-delivery:-Photonic-power-conversion-delivers-power-via-laser-beam |title=power transmission via lasers |publisher=Laserfocusworld.com |accessdate=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The conversion efficiency of laser light into electricity is much higher than that of sun light into electricity).
* Atmospheric absorption, and absorption and scattering by clouds, fog, rain, etc., causes up to 100% losses.
* Requires a direct line of sight with the target. (Instead of being beamed directly onto the receiver, the laser light can also be guided by an optical fiber. Then one speaks of [[power-over-fiber]] technology.)

===19th century developments and dead ends===
The 19th century saw many developments of theories, and counter-theories on how electrical energy might be transmitted. In 1826 [[André-Marie Ampère]] found [[Ampère's circuital law]] showing that electric current produces a magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/316/lectures/node75.html

Transmission of electrical energy without wires was  observed by many inventors and experimenters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Luigi Galvani]] (1791), Peter Samuel Munk (1835), [[Joseph Henry]] (1842), Samuel Alfred Varley (1852), [[Edwin Houston]], [[Elihu Thomson]], [[Thomas Edison]] (1875) and [[David Edward Hughes]] (1878)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmitting power long distance directly into homes and factories. Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis,&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page H-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc J. Seifer, Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla : Biography of a Genius, Citadel Press - 1996, page 107&lt;/ref&gt; proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend transmitting and receiving electrodes in the air above {{convert|30,000|feet}} in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Uth, Tesla, Master of Lightning, Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing - 1999, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_colspr.html PBS, Tesla - Life and Legacy - Colorado Springs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.

The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allow alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth with very little power loss.&lt;ref&gt;W.

===Near-field and non-radiative technologies===
Inductive power transfer between nearby wire coils was the earliest wireless power technology to be developed, existing since the [[transformer]] was developed in the 1800s.  [[Induction heating]] has been used since the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Induction Heating|edition=Second |isbn=978-1351643764 |last1=Rudnev |first1=Valery |last2=Loveless |first2=Don |last3=Cook |first3=Raymond L |date=2017-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of [[cordless]] devices, induction charging stands have been developed for appliances used in wet environments, like [[electric toothbrush]]es and [[electric razor]]s, to eliminate the hazard of electric shock.  One of the earliest proposed applications of inductive transfer was to power electric locomotives.  In 1892 Maurice Hutin and Maurice Leblanc patented a wireless method of powering railroad trains using resonant coils inductively coupled to a track wire at 3&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Patent527857A"&gt;US Patent No. 527857A, Maurice Hutin, Maurice Leblanc, ''[https://www.google.com/patents/US527857 Transformer system for electric railways]'', filed 16 November 1892; granted 23 October 1894&lt;/ref&gt;  The first passive [[RFID]] (Radio Frequency Identification) technologies were invented by Mario Cardullo&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;US Patent No. 3713148A, Mario W.

The proliferation of portable wireless communication devices such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablet]], and [[laptop computer]]s in recent decades is currently driving the development of mid-range wireless powering and charging technology to eliminate the need for these devices to be tethered to wall plugs during charging.&lt;ref name="Sayer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayer |first1=Peter |title=Wireless Power Consortium to Unleash Electronic Gadgets |journal=PCWorld |date=19 December 2008 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/155766/article.html |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wireless Power Consortium]] was established in 2008 to develop interoperable standards across manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Sayer" /&gt;  Its [[Qi (inductive power standard)|Qi]] inductive power standard published in August 2009 enables high efficiency charging and powering of portable devices of up to 5 watts over distances of 4&amp;nbsp;cm (1.6 inches).&lt;ref name="Qi"&gt;{{Cite news  | title = Global Qi Standard Powers Up Wireless Charging  | newspaper = PRNewswire  | publisher = UBM plc | date = 2 September 2009 | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-qi-standard-powers-up-wireless-charging-102043348.html | accessdate = 8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wireless device is placed on a flat charger plate (which can be embedded in table tops at cafes, for example) and power is transferred from a flat coil in the charger to a similar one in the device.

In 2007, a team led by Marin Soljačić at MIT used a dual resonance transmitter with a 25&amp;nbsp;cm diameter secondary tuned to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz to transfer 60 W of power to a similar dual resonance receiver over a distance of {{convert|2|meters|feet}} (eight times the transmitter coil diameter) at around 40% efficiency.&lt;ref name="LeeZhongHui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurs" /&gt; In 2008 the team of Greg Leyh and Mike Kennan of Nevada Lightning Lab used a grounded dual resonance transmitter with a 57&amp;nbsp;cm diameter secondary tuned to 60&amp;nbsp;kHz and a similar grounded dual resonance receiver to transfer power through coupled electric fields with an earth return circuit over a distance of {{convert|12|meters|feet}}.&lt;ref name="Leyh-Kennan_2008'''"&gt;{{cite conference|first1=G.

For power transmission, efficient transmission required [[transmitter]]s that could generate higher-frequency [[microwaves]], which can be focused in narrow beams towards a receiver.&lt;ref name="Tomar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinohara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curty"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Curty | first1 = Jari-Pascal | last2 = Declercq | first2 = Michel | last3  = Dehollain | first3 = Catherine | last4 = Joehl | first4 = Norbert | title  = Design and Optimization of Passive UHF RFID Systems | publisher = Springer | date = 2006 | location = | page=4 | language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uFjpH3Cl7z8C&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0387447100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[microwave]] technology during World War 2, such as the [[klystron]] and [[magnetron]] tubes and [[parabolic antenna]]s&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  made radiative ([[Near and far field|far-field]]) methods practical for the first time, and the first long-distance wireless power transmission was achieved in the 1960s by [[William C. Brown]].&lt;ref name="Tomar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinohara" /&gt;  In 1964 Brown invented the [[rectenna]] which could efficiently convert microwaves to DC power, and in 1964 demonstrated it with the first wireless-powered aircraft, a model helicopter powered by microwaves beamed from the ground.&lt;ref name="Tomar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  A major motivation for microwave research in the 1970s and 80s was to develop a [[solar power satellite]].&lt;ref name="Shinohara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  Conceived in 1968 by [[Peter Glaser]], this would harvest energy from sunlight using [[solar cell]]s and beam it down to Earth as [[microwave]]s to huge rectennas, which would convert it to electrical energy on the [[electric power grid]].&lt;ref name="Tomar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glaser"&gt;{{cite journal

In recent years a focus of research has been the development of wireless-powered drone aircraft, which began in 1959 with the Dept. of Defense's RAMP (Raytheon Airborne Microwave Platform) project&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; which sponsored Brown's research.  In 1987 Canada's Communications Research Center developed a small prototype airplane called [[Stationary High Altitude Relay Platform]] (SHARP) to relay telecommunication data between points on earth similar to a [[communication satellite]].  Powered by a rectenna, it could fly at 13 miles (21&amp;nbsp;km) altitude and stay aloft for months. In 1992 a team at Kyoto University built a more advanced craft called MILAX (MIcrowave Lifted Airplane eXperiment).

In 2003 NASA flew the first laser powered aircraft.  The small model plane's motor was powered by electricity generated by [[photocell]]s from a beam of infrared light from a ground-based laser, while a control system kept the laser pointed at the plane.
