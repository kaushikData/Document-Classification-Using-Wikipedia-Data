'''Algherese''' ([[Catalan language|Standard Catalan]]: ''Alguerès'', {{IPA-ca|əlɣəˈɾɛs|pron}}; Algherese: ''Alguerés'' {{IPA-ca|alɣaˈɾes|}}) is the variant of the [[Catalan language]] spoken in the city of [[Alghero]] (''L'Alguer'' in Catalan), in the northwest of [[Sardinia]], Italy. Catalan-speaking colonists repopulated the town and expelled the [[Sardinians|native population]] in 1372, after several revolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://prosodia.upf.edu/coalgueres/en/algueres.html |title=L'Alguer and Alguerese Catalan - Oral Corpus of Alguerese|website=prosodia.upf.edu |access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalan was replaced as the official language by [[Spanish language|Spanish]], then by [[Italian language|Italian]] in the mid 18th century, but its use remained widespread until at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Minder |first1=Raphael |title=Italy's Last Bastion of Catalan Language Struggles to Keep It Alive |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/world/europe/catalan-italy-alghero.html |work=nytimes.com |date=21 November 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it has semi-official status alongside Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciutatdelalguer.it/comune_alghero.htm Alghero official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on additional linguistic studies, there are approximately 20,000 to 30,000 native speakers of the language worldwide. In communities where Algherese is spoken, [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] are often used as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Catalan language}}
Algherese is a regional dialect spoken by anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 individuals, most of which reside in the town of [[Alghero]], located in the northwest of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://endangeredlanguages.com/lang/944|title=Did you know Algherese Catalan is vulnerable?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language, though secular, is initially derived from, and thus considered a variant of, the [[Catalan language]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The origins of the language can be traced back to 1372, when Catalan invaders repopulated the city of [[Alghero]] after exiling the indigenous populations in [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The language has roots in several [[Romance languages]], including [[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance]], [[Italo-Western languages|Italo-Western Romance]], and [[Italo-Western languages|Italo Western.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/algh1238 |title=Glottolog 2.7 - Algherese |website=glottolog.org |language=en |access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
In the northwest region of [[Sardinia]], it is estimated that [[Italian language|Italian]] is now the first language of close to 60% of individuals, Algherese approximately 22%.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prosodia.upf.edu/coalgueres/en/algueres.html|title=Corpus Oral de l'Alguerès|website=prosodia.upf.edu|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the dialect in schools and media, to name a few, is sparse. Prior to 1997, teaching of the dialect in school was rare. However, in an attempt to reverse the trend, the Regional Council of Sardinia has officially recognized "Algherese Catalan" as a separate language in order to promote its use and circulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of a 2008 study, Algherese is used by approximately 14% of the population for daily interactions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The dialect is mostly a local language, often used to supplement [[Italian language|Italian]] or [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] in small circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Argenter |first=Joan A. |year=2008 |title=L'Alguer (Alghero), a Catalan linguistic enclave in Sardinia |url=https://www.academia.edu/5492085/LAlguer_Alghero_a_Catalan_linguistic_enclave_in_Sardinia |journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language |language=en |volume=2008 |issue=193/194 |doi=10.1515/ijsl.2008.056 |issn=0165-2516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official status ==
In the northwest region of [[Sardinia]], where this language is spoken, [[Italian language|Italian]] is the primary language. Algherese Catalan acts as a secondary language or dialect in the overall region.

In 1999, Catalan was among several minority languages officially recognized as "historical language minorities" by the Italian State under law no. 482/1999.&lt;ref&gt;Law no. 482 of 15 December 1999. "Rules on the protection of historical linguistic minorities". Article 2. Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 297. 20 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the Regional Council of Sardinia had passed the regional law n. 26 of 15 October 1997 which, aside from promoting the equality in dignity of the Sardinian language with the Italian language throughout the island, provides that the other languages of smaller scope be afforded the same treatment as the aforementioned languages, among which Catalan is cited, in the city of Alghero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/86?v=9&amp;c=72&amp;file=1997026 Regional Law no. 26 of 15 October 1997. "Promozione e valorizzazione della culture e della lingua della Sardegna"]. Articles 2.1 and 2.4 . Consiglio Regionale della Sardegna&lt;/ref&gt; The city council, for its part, promulgated its protection and standardization in its city statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciutatdelalguer.it/statuto.pdf Communal Statute]. Article 9. City of Alghero.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The following figures were obtained from the "Enquesta d’usos lingüístics a l’Alguer (Survey of linguistic usage in Alghero, EULAL)" of 2004, a study conducted in the town of Alghero that showed the general use of Algherese in several media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |authors= |date=2004 |title=Enquesta d’usos lingüístics a l’Alguer |trans-title=Survey of linguistic usage in Alghero |language=Catalan |url=http://llengua.gencat.cat/web/.content/documents/dadesestudis/altres/arxius/eula2004.pdf |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |page= |docket= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Els usos lingüístics a l’Alguer" of 2015 (EULA 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |authors= |date=2017 |title=Els usos lingüístics a l’Alguer, 2015 |trans-title=Linguistic usage in Alghero, 2015 |language=Catalan |url=http://llengua.gencat.cat/web/.content/documents/publicacions/btpl/arxius/20_Usos_linguistics_Alguer_2015.pdf |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |page= |docket= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{see also|Catalan phonology}}
*Like in other languages of Sardinia {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} as well as {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} may merge into [[mid vowel]]s {{IPAblink|e̞}} and {{IPAblink|o̞}}, respectively.
*Coalescing of unstressed vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} to {{IPAblink|ä|a}} (unlike the rest of [[Eastern Catalan]], which uses {{IPAblink|ə}}).
*Algherese preserves {{IPA|/v/}} as a distinct phoneme from {{IPA|/b/}}, like [[Balearic dialect|Balearic]] and most of [[Valencian]].
*Mutation of intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/l/}} to {{IPAblink|r}}: 'Barceloneta' (little Barcelona): Eastern Standard {{IPA|[bərsəɫuˈnɛtə]}}, Algherese {{IPA|[balsaruˈne̞ta]}}; and ''vila'' ('town') and ''vida'' ('life') are homophones in Algherese {{IPA|[ˈvira]}}.
*Mutation of syllable final {{IPA|/r/}} to lateral {{IPAblink|l}}, and the possible resulting group {{IPA|/r/}} + [[consonant]] is further simplified to {{IPAblink|l}}: ''forn'' ('furnace, oven'): Standard {{IPA|[ˈfo̞rn]}}, Algherese {{IPA|[ˈfo̞l]}}.
*Depalatalization of syllable final sonorants: lateral {{IPA|/ʎ/}} to {{IPAblink|l}}, nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}} to {{IPAblink|n}}; e.g. ''any'' ('year'): Standard {{IPA|[ˈaɲ]}}, Algherese {{IPA|[ˈan]}}.
*Unlike most Catalan dialects, {{IPA|/l/}} is never [[dark l|velarized]] in Algherese: ''sol'' ('sun'): Standard {{IPA|[ˈsɔɫ]}}, Algherese {{IPA|[ˈso̞l]}}.

== Morphology ==
*The simple past is replaced by the present perfect (present of ''haver'' "to have" + past participle), possibly by Italian influence.
*The imperfect past preserves etymological -v- in all conjugations: 1st -''ava'', 2nd -''iva'', 3rd -''iva'' (unlike modern Eastern and Western Standard Catalan, which use 1st -''ava'', 2nd -''ia'', 3rd -''ia'', a feature shared with the [[Ribagorçan dialect]].
*Large-scale lexical borrowing and [[calque]]s from [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]: nearly half of the vocabulary is not from Catalan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Caracterització del lèxic alguerès |last=Corbera Pou |first=Jaume |publisher=University of the Balearic Islands |year=2000 |location=Palma (Balears) |oclc=807849256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from Standard Catalan==
The Algherese variant is [[Eastern Catalan]], but it has many differences from [[Central Catalan]], with some of the most obvious ones as follows:

===Vocabulary===
The following abbreviations are used: m (masculine), f (feminine), pl (plural), fpl (feminine plural), inf (informal), f (formal).

The following phrases were gathered from a Catalan translation set, but the common phrases in Algherese are similar:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/catalan.php|title=Useful Catalan phrases|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unitat de la llengua Alghero.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to the ''unitat de la llengua'' in Alghero]]
The ''Premi Rafael Sari'', organised by the ''Obra Cultural de l'Alguer'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.obracultural.cat/qui-sem/ |title=Qui sem - Obra Cultural de l'Alguer |website=Obra Cultural de l'Alguer |language=ca-ES |access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a series of prizes awarded in September each year to the best literary works of poetry and prose written in Alguerese Catalan.

Notable poets include [[Rafael Sari]], [[Pasquale Scanu]] and [[Maria Chessa Lai]]. There is also a long tradition of writing and performing songs in Alguerese Catalan and the ''Premio Pino Piras''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://notizie.alguer.it/n?id=20324 |title=Al Civico di Alghero il "Premio Pino Piras" |date=23 October 2008 |website=Alguer.it Notizie |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; is awarded for new songs written in the language. Notable singer-songwriters include [[Pino Piras]] and [[Franca Masu]].

In 2015 [[Carla Valentino]] published an Algherese translation of [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Little Prince nr. PP-3547 / Catalan Algherese |url=http://www.petit-prince-collection.com/lang/show_livre.php?lang=en&amp;id=3547 |website=www.petit-prince-collection.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architecture]], a '''bay''' is the space between architectural elements, or a recess or compartment. ''Bay'' comes from  [[Old French]] ''baee'', meaning an opening or hole.&lt;ref&gt;"Bay" ''Online Etymology Dictionary''. http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=bay&amp;searchmode=none accessed 3/10/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
# The spaces between [[Post (structural)|posts]], [[column]]s, or [[buttress]]es in the length of a building, the division in the widths being called [[aisle]]s. This meaning also applies to overhead vaults (between ribs), in a building using a vaulted structural system. For example, the [[Gothic architecture]] period's [[Chartres Cathedral]] has a [[nave]] (main interior space) that is '' "seven bays long." '' Similarly in [[timber framing]] a bay is the space between posts in the transverse direction of the building and aisles run longitudinally.&lt;ref name="OED" &gt;"Bay", n.3. def. 1-6 and "Bay", n.5 def 2. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# The openings for [[window]]s in a wall. For example, in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]], at [[Mulberry Fields]], the building is described as a '' "5 bay by 2 bay facade," '' meaning a '' "5 windows by 2 windows" '' exterior.
# A recess in a wall, such as a [[bay window]].&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;
# A division of space such as an [[animal stall]], [[sick bay]], or [[bay platform]].&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;
# The space between [[joist]]s or [[rafter]]s, a ''joist bay'' or ''rafter bay''.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

==East Asia==
The [[Japanese units|Japanese]] ''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'' and [[Korean units|Korean]] ''kan'' are both bays themselves and measurements based upon their number and standard placement. Under the [[Joseon]], Koreans were allocated a set number of bays in their residential architecture based upon their class.

'''Brickwork''' is [[masonry]] produced by a [[bricklayer]], using [[brick]]s and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Typically, rows of bricks—called ''[[Course (architecture)|courses]]''—&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Moxon. Mechanick Exercises: Or, The Doctrine of Handy-Works. Applied to the Arts of Smithing, Joinery, Carpentry, Turning, Bricklaying. Printed for Daniel Midwinter and Thomas Leigh. 1703. London. Page&amp;nbsp;129. "Three or four or five courses of Bricks to be laid."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nicholson|Nicholson]]. "By a ''Course'', in walling, is meant the bricks contained between two planes parallel to the horizon, and terminated by the faces of the wall. The thickness is that of one brick with mortar. The mass formed by bricks laid in concentric order, for arches or vaults, is also denominated a ''Course''."&lt;/ref&gt; are laid on top of one another to build up a structure such as a brick [[wall]].

Brick may be differentiated from a block on the ground of mainly in variation in size. For example in UK brick is defined as a unit dimensions less than 337.5x225x112.5mm and a bock is defined as a unit having one or more dimensions greater than largest possible brick&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleming |first1=Eric |title=Construction Technology |date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=UK |isbn=1-4051-0210-1 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brick is a popular medium for constructing buildings, and examples of brickwork are found through history as far back as the [[Bronze Age]]. The fired-brick faces of the [[ziggurat]] of ancient [[Dur-Kurigalzu]] in Iraq date from around 1400 BC, and the brick buildings of ancient [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan were built around 2600 BC. Much older examples of brickwork made with dried (but not fired) bricks may be found in such ancient locations as [[Jericho]] in Judea, [[Çatalhöyük|Çatal Hüyük]] in Anatolia, and [[Mehrgarh]] in Pakistan. These structures have survived from the [[Stone Age]] to the present day.
[[File:Coordinating dimensions.jpg|thumb|right|Co-ordination dimensions of a brick in a wall]]
[[File:Brick laying 2.jpg|thumb|right|Working dimensions of a brick in a wall]]
Brick dimensions are expressed in construction or technical documents in two ways as co-ordinating dimensions and working dimensions.
* Coordination dimensions are the actual physical dimensions of the brick with the mortar required on one header face, one stretcher face and one bed.
* Working dimensions is the size of a manufactured brick. It is also called the nominal size of a brick.
Brick size may be slightly different due to shrinkage or distortion due to firing etc.

An example of a co-ordinating metric commonly used for bricks in the UK is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brunskill|Brunskill]], p. 39. "British Standard 3921 of 1969, gave dimensions of 215 mm by 102.5 mm by 65 mm [...]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Standards Institution. Specification for Masonry Units. Part&amp;nbsp;1: Clay Masonry Units. BSI, London, 2003, BS&amp;nbsp;EN 771.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Compressive Strength of Modern Earth Masonry, Andrew Heath, Mike Lawrence, Peter Walker and Clyde Fourie. BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials, University of Bath and Natural Building Technologies (NBT). Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Non-conventional Materials and Technologies (NOCMAT 2009). 6–9 September 2009, Bath, UK. "All earth masonry units were intended to be 'standard' brick size (215x102.5x65mm) if they were fired, but because they did not have additional shrinkage from firing, the average size was 223x106x67mm."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bricks of dimensions 215&amp;nbsp;mm × 102.5&amp;nbsp;mm × 65&amp;nbsp;mm;
* Mortar beds and perpends of a uniform 10&amp;nbsp;mm.

In this case the co-ordinating metric works because the length of a single brick (215&amp;nbsp;mm) is equal to the total of the width of a brick (102.5&amp;nbsp;mm) plus a perpend (10&amp;nbsp;mm) plus the width of a second brick (102.5&amp;nbsp;mm).

There are many other brick sizes worldwide, and many of them use this same co-ordinating principle.

==Terminology==
[[File:Faces of brick.jpg|thumb|right|Faces of brick]]
As the most common bricks are cuboids, six surfaces are named as followed:
* Top and bottom surfaces are called Beds
* Ends or narrow surfaces are called Headers or header faces
* Sides or wider surfaces are called Stretchers or stretcher faces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleming |first1=Eric |title=Construction Technology |date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=UK |isbn=1-4051-0210-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brick terminology.jpg|thumb|right|Mortar terminology- showing perpends and bed.]]
Mortar placed between bricks is also given separate names with respect to their position. Mortar placed horizontally below or top of a brick is called a bed, and mortar Placed vertically between bricks is called a perpend.
[[File:Single brick.jpg|thumb|Solid brick]]
[[File:Single frogged brick.jpg|thumb|Single frogged brick]]
[[File:Double frogged.jpg|thumb|Double frogged brick]]
[[File:Cellular brick.jpg|thumb|Cellular brick]]
[[File:Perforated brick 2.jpg|thumb|Perforated brick]]
Brick made with just rectilinear dimensions is called a solid brick. Bricks might have depression on both beds or single bed these are called frogged bricks an the depression is called frog. Frogs can be deep or shallow but should never exceed 20% of the total value of the brick. Cellular bricks have depressions exceeding 20% of the volume of the brick.  Perforated bricks have holes through the bed to bed cutting it all the way. Most of the building standards and good construction practices recommend the volume of holes should not exceeding 20% of the total volume of the brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleming |first1=Eric |title=Construction Technology |date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=UK |isbn=1-4051-0210-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Parts of brickwork include ''bricks'', ''beds'' and ''[[perpend]]s''. The bed is the mortar upon which a brick is laid.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nicholson|Nicholson]], p. 166. "BED.—The under-surface of bricks when laid in any kind of work."&lt;/ref&gt; A perpend is a vertical joint between any two bricks and is usually—but not always—filled with mortar.&lt;ref&gt;Reports of artisans selected by a committee appointed by the council of the Society of Arts to visit the Paris Universal exhibition, 1867. Published for the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. Published by Bell and Daldy, York Street, Covent Garden, London. Printed by W.&amp;nbsp; Trounce, Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, London. 1867. Part&amp;nbsp;1. Bricklaying by George Howell. Page&amp;nbsp;194. "The beauty of brickwork will very much depend upon the 'perpends' being perfectly kept, that is, the perfect regularity of the perpendicular joints right up the building."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientation==
[[File:Brickpositions.PNG|thumb|350px|Six positions]]
A brick is given a classification based on how it is laid, and how the exposed face is oriented relative to the face of the finished wall.

; Stretcher &lt;span style="font-weight: lighter;"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; stretching brick: A brick laid flat with its long narrow side exposed.&lt;ref name="John Houghton 1693"&gt;John Houghton. A Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and Trade. 1693. Issue&amp;nbsp;74. Published by Randal Taylor near Stationers-Hall. London. "A Brick-wall of a Foot and half thick is commonly made by ''Stretchers'' and ''Headers'', that is, by laying on the out-side one Brick, so as to have the narrowest side of it to be seen longways, and the next to have only the end seen, and the Brick lying on the broad side, and so on, a Stretcher and a Header."&lt;/ref&gt;
; Header &lt;span style="font-weight: lighter;"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; heading brick: A brick laid flat with its width exposed.&lt;ref name="John Houghton 1693"/&gt;
; Soldier: A brick laid vertically with its long narrow side exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney Clark Huntington. Building Construction. Types of Construction, Materials, and Cost Estimating. New York: Wiley. London: Chapman &amp; Hall. 1929. Page&amp;nbsp;130. "Belt courses and flat arches may be formed of brick[s] set on end with the narrow side exposed. Such bricks are called soldiers."&lt;/ref&gt;
; Sailor: A brick laid vertically with the broad face of the brick exposed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sovinski|Sovinski]], p. 43. "Those brick positions oriented in a horizontal alignment are called ''stretcher'', ''header'', ''rowlock stretcher'', and ''rowlock''. A rowlock stretcher is sometimes called a ''shiner''. The two corresponding vertical orientations are the ''soldier'' and ''sailor'' positions."&lt;/ref&gt;
; Rowlock: A brick laid on the long narrow side with the short end of the brick exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Y. Harris. Building Pathology. Wiley. New York. 2001. Page&amp;nbsp;212. "The short face, or the end laid horizontally, is a header; laid vertically, a rowlock."&lt;/ref&gt;
; Shiner &lt;span style="font-weight: lighter;"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; rowlock stretcher: A brick laid on the long narrow side with the broad face of the brick exposed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sovinski|Sovinski]], p. 43. "Those brick positions oriented in a horizontal alignment are called ''stretcher'', ''header'', ''rowlock stretcher'', and ''rowlock''. A rowlock stretcher is sometimes called a ''shiner''."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cut==
The practice of laying uncut full-sized bricks wherever possible gives brickwork its maximum possible strength. In the diagrams below, such uncut full-sized bricks are coloured as follows:

; {{legend-inline|#dc905c|outline=#f6c2a7|Stretcher}}
; {{legend-inline|#a87d5d|outline=#cba390|Header}}

Occasionally though a brick must be cut to fit a given space, or to be the right shape for fulfilling some particular purpose such as generating an offset—called a ''lap''—at the beginning of a  [[Course (architecture)|course]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles F.Mitchell. Building Construction. Part&amp;nbsp;1. First Stage or Elementary Course. Second Edition—Revised. Published by B.T. Batsford, 52 High Holborn. 1889. Page&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases these special shapes or sizes are manufactured.  In the diagrams below, some of the cuts most commonly used for generating a lap are coloured as follows:

; {{legend-inline|#86bc40|outline=#9bbf5e|Three-quarter bat, stretching}}: A brick cut to three-quarters of its length, and laid flat with its long, narrow side exposed.
; {{legend-inline|#69903e|outline=#aec894|Three-quarter bat, heading}}: A brick cut to three-quarters of its length, and laid flat with its short side exposed.
; {{legend-inline|#cb6666|outline=#b9917d|Half bat}}: A brick cut in half across its length, and laid flat.
; {{legend-inline|#bd9da2|outline=#efd9dd|Queen closer}}: A brick cut in half down its width, and laid with its smallest face exposed and standing vertically. A queen closer is often used for the purpose of creating a lap.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. 1911. '''BRICKWORK'''. "[...] portions of a brick [...] a half header in width, [...] are called queen closers[.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Less frequently used cuts are all coloured as follows:

; {{legend-inline|#f7e78b|outline=#fdf6ca|Quarter bat}}: A brick cut to a quarter of its length.
; {{legend-inline|#f7e78b|outline=#fdf6ca|Three-quarter queen closer}}: A queen closer cut to three-quarters of its length.
; {{legend-inline|#f7e78b|outline=#fdf6ca|King closer}}: A brick with one corner cut away, leaving one header face at half its standard width.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F.Mitchell. Building Construction. Part&amp;nbsp;1. First Stage or Elementary Course. Second Edition—Revised. Published by B.T. Batsford, 52 High Holborn. 1889. Page&amp;nbsp;18. "King Closers are bricks cut so that one end is half the width of a brick, and [are] used in positions where the greater width at back would add strength to the bond[...]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonding==
A nearly universal rule in brickwork is that perpends should not be contiguous across  [[Course (architecture)|courses]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nicholson|Nicholson]], p. 167. "[...] an arrangement, or combination of bricks when laid upon each other, [such] that the perpendicular joint formed by any two adjacent bricks may, at all times, be covered by the centre (or nearly so) of one laid immediately over the joint, by which means the nearest approximation to solidity will be attained that such materials are capable of producing."&lt;/ref&gt;

Walls, running linearly and extending upwards, can be of varying depth or thickness. Typically, the bricks are laid also running linearly and extending upwards, forming ''[[wythe]]s'' or ''leafs''. It is as important as with the perpends to bond these leaves together. Historically, the dominant method for consolidating the leaves together was to lay bricks across them, rather than running linearly.{{clarification needed|The last two clauses of this sentence are unclear as to what they depict|date=November 2018}}

Brickwork observing either or both of these two conventions is described as being laid in one or another ''bond''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nicholson|Nicholson]], p. 347. "BRICKS ARE LAID in a varied, but regular, form of connection, or ''Bond'', as exhibited in ''Plate'' LXXXV."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nicholson|Nicholson]], p. 329. "BOND.—That regular connection, in lapping the stones upon one another, when carrying up the work, which forms an inseparable mass of building."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thickness (and leaves)==
A leaf is as thick as the width of one brick, but a wall is said to be one brick thick if it as wide as the length of a brick. Accordingly, a single-leaf wall is a half brick thickness; a wall with the simplest possible masonry transverse bond is said to be one brick thick, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;CITB&lt;br&gt;CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TRAINING BOARD&lt;br&gt;Training Workbook&lt;br&gt;Setting Out Brickwork&lt;br&gt;Positioning Ranging Lines, Gauge, Dry Bonding, Broken Bonding&lt;br&gt;WB&amp;nbsp;272&lt;br&gt;
Construction Industry Training Board, Bircham Newton, Kings Lynn, Norfolk PE31&amp;nbsp;6RH. 1994. {{ISBN|185751095X}}. Page&amp;nbsp;35–37. "Wall thickness terms relate to a '''stretcher''' dimension of a brick. Wall (A) [''pictured''] is termed a '''half brick wall'''. Wall (B) [''pictured''] is termed a '''one brick wall''' [...]. This wall is a '''half brick''' thick wall [...]. This wall is a one brick thick wall [...]."&lt;/ref&gt;

The thickness specified for a wall is determined by such factors as damp proofing considerations, whether or not the wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working.&lt;ref&gt;Bricks and Brickwork. Cecil C. Handisyde and Barry A. Haseltine. The Brick Development Association. 19&amp;nbsp;Grafton Street, London, W1X&amp;nbsp;3LE. 1974. Page&amp;nbsp;68. "Old buildings of solid wall construction were accepted as 'waterproof', often when brickwork was only 9 inches thick. Now it is generally agreed that solid walls of less than [one and a half] brick thickness are inadequate. Code of Practice 121 still includes unrendered one brick thick walls as acceptable for sheltered positions but this seems a questionable recommendation. Walling of [one and a half] brick thickness should be satisfactory for sheltered positions and may be adequate for moderate exposure."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Emmitt|Emmitt]], p. 206. "In exposed positions such as high ground and near the coast, a wall 2B thick may be needed to resist penetration to inside faces [...]. In positions of very severe exposure to wind-driven rain, as on high open ground facing the prevailing wind and on the coast facing open sea, it is necessary to protect both solid and cavity walls with an external cladding."&lt;/ref&gt; Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The [[Monadnock Building]] in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Chicago Tribune, December&amp;nbsp;7, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.

===Cavity walls and ties===
The advent during the mid twentieth century of the [[cavity wall]] saw the popularisation and development of another method of strengthening brickwork—the wall tie. A cavity wall comprises two totally discrete walls, separated by an air gap, which serves both as barrier to moisture and heat.&lt;ref&gt;Denzil Nield. Walls &amp;&amp;nbsp;Wall Facings. Spon, London. 1949. Page&amp;nbsp;145. "Cavity walls... are being increasingly built with hollow blocks or other material in place of bricks for the internal leaf."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Civil Engineer. Oct 3rd, 1991. Thomas Telford Ltd. London. Advertisement. "Single leaf wall with vertical and lateral load."&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the main loads taken by the foundations are carried there by the inner leaf, and the major functions of the external leaf are to protect the whole from weather, and to provide a fitting aesthetic finish.

Despite there being no masonry connection between the leaves, their transverse rigidity still needs to be guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Emmitt|Emmitt]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The device used to satisfy this need is the insertion at regular intervals of [[tie (cavity wall)|wall ties]] into the cavity wall's mortar beds.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Emmitt|Emmitt]], pp. 232, 233. "Early cavity walls were constructed with bonding bricks laid across the cavity at internals to tie the two leaves together. [...] Later, iron ties were used to tie the two leaves together."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Yeomans. Construction Since 1900: Materials. BT Batsford Ltd, 583 Fulham Road, London, SW6&amp;nbsp;5BY. 1997. {{ISBN|0713466847}}. Page&amp;nbsp;60. "In 1974, a large section of the outer leaf of a wall of a comprehensive school at Newnham collapsed revealing a complete absence of ties over a considerable area [and] in 1983, a much larger section of a wall at Plymouth Polytechnic collapsed due to corrosion of the cavity ties."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flemish bond====
[[File:Brickwork in Flemish Bond.jpg|thumb|300px|Brickwork in Flemish Bond]]
This bond has '''one''' stretcher between headers, with the headers centred over the stretchers in the  [[Course (architecture)|courses]] below.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smeaton|Smeaton]], pp. 29–30. "The two principal methods of bricklaying are severally called English and Flemish bond. [...] Flemish bond consists in placing a header and a stretcher alternately throughout every course."&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a course begins with a [[Quoin (architecture)|quoin]] stretcher, the course will ordinarily terminate with a quoin stretcher at the other end. The next course up will begin with a quoin header. For the course's second brick, a queen closer is laid, generating the lap of the bond. The third brick along is a stretcher, and is—on account of the lap—centred above the header below. This second course then resumes its paired run of stretcher and header, until the final pair is reached, whereupon a second and final queen closer is inserted as the penultimate brick, mirroring the arrangement at the beginning of the course, and duly closing the bond.

Some examples of Flemish bond incorporate stretchers of one colour and headers of another. This effect is commonly a product of treating the header face of the heading bricks while the bricks are being baked as part of the manufacturing process. Some of the header faces are exposed to wood smoke, generating a grey-blue colour, while other simply vitrified until they reach a deeper blue colour. Some headers have a glazed face, caused by using salt in the firing. Sometimes [[Staffordshire blue brick|Staffordshire Blue bricks]] are used for the heading bricks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brunskill|Brunskill]], pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Arch. Review|Arch. Review]]'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brickwork that appears as Flemish bond from both the front and the rear is ''double Flemish bond'', so called on account of the front and rear duplication of the pattern. If the wall is arranged such that the bricks at the rear do not have this pattern, then the brickwork is said to be ''single Flemish bond''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brunskill|Brunskill]], p. 91. "SINGLE FLEMISH BOND: gives the appearance of Flemish Bond on the outside face only of a wall more than 9 inches thick. The same appearance on both inner and outer faces is given by DOUBLE FLEMISH BOND."&lt;/ref&gt;

Flemish bond brickwork with a thickness of one brick is the repeating pattern of a stretcher laid immediately to the rear of the face stretcher, and then next along the course, a header. A lap (correct overlap) is generated by a queen closer on every alternate course:

&lt;div class="center" style="width:auto; margin:2em auto;"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

A simple way to add some width to the wall would be to add stretching bricks at the rear, making a Single Flemish bond one and a half bricks thick:

&lt;div class="center" style="width:auto; margin:2em auto;"&gt;
'''Overhead sections of alternate (odd and even) courses of single Flemish bond of one and a half bricks' thickness'''

&lt;/div&gt;

For a double Flemish bond of one and a half bricks' thickness, facing bricks and the bricks behind the facing bricks may be laid in groups of four bricks and a half-bat. The half-bat sits at the centre of the group and the four bricks are placed about the half-bat, in a square formation. These groups are laid next to each other for the length of a course, making brickwork one and a half bricks thick.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nicholson|Nicholson]], p. 102. "[...] the bricks are disposed alike on both sides of the wall, the tail of the headers being placed contiguous to each other, so as to form square spaces in the core of the wall for half-bricks."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles F.Mitchell. Building Construction. Part&amp;nbsp;1. First Stage or Elementary Course. Second Edition—Revised. Published by B.T. Batsford, 52 High Holborn. 1889. Page&amp;nbsp;25, figures 37 &amp; 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve the bond, it is necessary to lay a three-quarter bat instead of a header following a quoin stretcher at the corner of the wall.  This fact has no bearing on the appearance of the wall; the choice of brick appears to the spectator like any ordinary header:

&lt;div class="center" style="width:auto; margin:2em auto;"&gt;

The colour-coded [[Floor plan|plans]] highlight facing bricks in the east-west wall. An [[Elevation (view)#Elevation|elevation]] for this east-west wall is shown to the right.&lt;/div&gt;

For a more substantial wall, a header may be laid directly behind the face header, a further two headers laid at 90° behind the face stretcher, and then finally a stretcher laid to the rear of these two headers. This pattern generates brickwork a full two bricks thick:

&lt;div class="center" style="width:auto; margin:2em auto;"&gt;

For a still more substantial wall, ''two'' headers may be laid directly behind the face header, a further two ''pairs'' of headers laid at 90° behind the face stretcher, and then finally a stretcher laid to the rear of these four headers. This pattern generates brickwork a full three bricks thick:

This bond has '''two''' stretchers between every header with the headers centred over the perpend between the two stretchers in the course below in the bond's most symmetric form.&lt;ref name="Art. Grove 1996. Page 769"&gt;The Dictionary of Art. Grove. Volume Four, Biardeau TO Brüggemann. Edited by Jane Turner. Macmillan Publishers Limited. 1996. {{ISBN|1884446000}}. Page&amp;nbsp;769.&lt;/ref&gt;

The great variety of monk bond patterns allow for many possible layouts at the quoins, and many possible arrangements for generating a lap. A quoin brick may be a stretcher, a three-quarter bat, or a header. Queen closers may be used next to the quoins, but the practice is not mandatory.

=====Raking monk bonds=====
Monk bond may however take any of a number of arrangements for course staggering. The disposal of bricks in these often highly irregular raking patterns can be a challenging task for the bricklayer to correctly maintain while constructing a wall whose courses are partially obscured by scaffold, and interrupted by door or window openings, or other bond-disrupting obstacles. If the bricklayer frequently stops to check that bricks are correctly arranged, then masonry in a raking monk bond can be expensive to build.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Arch. Review|Arch. Review]]'', p. 242. THE BONDING OF BRICKWORK. P.M. Stratton. "An extra cost over Flemish has to be met for labour on Monk bond and its derivatives, because the process is not so straightforward as Flemish, and the bricklayers have to stop and think more frequently."&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, brickwork in such a raking monk bond may contain minor errors of header and stretcher alignment some of which may have been silently corrected by incorporating a compensating irregularity into the brickwork in a course further up the wall. In spite of these complexities and their associated costs, the bond has proven a common choice for constructing brickwork in the north of Europe.

Raking courses in monk bond may—for instance—be staggered in such a way as to generate the appearance of diagonal lines of stretchers. One method of achieving this effect relies on the use of a repeating sequence of courses with back-and-forth header staggering. In this grouping, a header appears at a given point in the group's first course. In the next course up, a header is offset one and a half stretcher lengths to the left of the header in the course below, and then in the third course, a header is offset one stretcher length to the right of the header in the middle course. This accented swing of headers, one and a half to the left, and one to the right, generates the appearance of lines of stretchers running from the upper left hand side of the wall down to the lower right. Such an example of a raking monk bond layout is shown in the New Malden Library, [[Kingston upon Thames]], Greater London.

Elsewhere, raking courses in monk bond may be staggered in such a way as to generate a subtle appearance of indented pyramid-like diagonals. Such an arrangement appears in the picture here from the building in [[Solna, Sweden]].

Many other particular adjustments of course alignment exist in monk bond, generating a variety of visual effects which differ in detail, but often having the effect of directing a viewing eye diagonally down the wall.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Arch. Review|Arch. Review]]'', p. 241. THE BONDING OF BRICKWORK. P.M. Stratton. "Monk bond [...] is popular in the North of Europe. Two stretchers are followed by one header in every course, the headers being so disposed that verticality of their axial lines is little apparent, and a striking result is obtained of diagonal lines of stretchers, which look like a series of corbels or cantilevers embedded in the wall."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sussex bond====
This bond has '''three''' stretchers between every header, with the headers centred above the midpoint of three stretchers in the course below.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 440. "FLEMISH GARDEN WALL or SUSSEX BOND. Three stretchers, then one header in every course."&lt;/ref&gt;

The bond's horizontally extended proportion suits long stretches of masonry such as garden walls or the run of brickwork over a ribbon window; conversely, the bond is less suitable for a surface occupied by many features, such as a Georgian façade. The relatively infrequent use of headers serves to make Sussex bond one of the less expensive bonds in which to build a wall, as it allows for the bricklayer to proceed rapidly with run after run of three stretchers at a time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Arch. Review|Arch. Review]]'', p. 241. THE BONDING OF BRICKWORK. P.M. Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the two kinds of course in this family of bonds is called a ''stretching course'', and this typically comprises nothing but stretchers at the face from quoin to quoin. The other kind of course is the ''heading course'', and this usually consists of headers, with two queen closers—one by the quoin header at either end—to generate the bond.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F.Mitchell. Building Construction. Part&amp;nbsp;1. First Stage or Elementary Course. Second Edition—Revised. Published by B.T. Batsford, 52 High Holborn. 1889. Page&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

====English bond====
This bond has alternating stretching and heading  [[Course (architecture)|courses]], with the headers centred over the midpoint of the stretchers, and perpends in each alternate course aligned. Queen closers appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smeaton|Smeaton]], pp. 29–30. "The two principal methods of bricklaying are severally called English and Flemish bond&amp;nbsp;.... English bond consists of alternating courses of headers and stretchers; thus, one course is formed with headers, that is, with bricks crossing the wall; the next with stretchers, that is, with bricks having their length in the same direction as that of the wall[.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles F.Mitchell. Building Construction. Part&amp;nbsp;1. First Stage or Elementary Course. Second Edition—Revised. Published by B.T. Batsford, 52 High Holborn. 1889. Page&amp;nbsp;21, figures 28 &amp; 29.&lt;/ref&gt; A muted colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in English bond to lend a subtle texture to the brickwork. Examples of such schemes include blue-grey headers among otherwise red bricks—seen in the south of England—and light brown headers in a dark brown wall, more often found in parts of the north of England.&lt;ref name="The Architectural Review 1936.

An ancient example of alternating courses of headers and stretchers, is found on Malta.

====English cross bond====
[[File:Dutch Bond.jpg|thumb|Dutch Bond, Linacre College, Oxford.]]
This bond also has alternating stretching and heading  [[Course (architecture)|courses]].  However, whilst the heading courses are identical with those found in the standard English bond, the stretching courses alternate between a course composed entirely of stretchers, and a course composed of stretchers half off-set relative to the stretchers two courses above or below, by reason of a header placed just before the quoins at either end.&lt;ref name='Ching'&gt;{{cite book | last = Ching| first = Francis | title = A Visual Dictionary of Architecture | publisher = Wiley | year = 1995  | ISBN = 0-471-28451-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 440.

The second brick of alternate stretching courses is a header."&lt;/ref&gt; The bond is widely found in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brunskill|Brunskill]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large areas of English cross bond can appear to have a [[twill]] like characteristic, an effect caused by the unbroken series of perpends moving diagonally down the bond.

====Dutch bond====
This bond is exactly like English cross bond except in the generating of the lap at the quoins. In Dutch bond, all quoins are three-quarter bats—placed in alternately stretching and heading orientation with successive courses—and no use whatever is made of queen closers.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F.Mitchell.

====English garden wall bond====
This bond has three  [[Course (architecture)|courses]] of stretchers between every course of headers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 440. "ENGLISH GARDEN WALL BOND. Three stretching courses to each heading course."&lt;/ref&gt;

For the standard English garden wall bond, headers are used as quoins for the middle stretching course in order to generate the lap, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses. A more complex set of quoins and queen closers is necessary to achieve the lap for a raking English garden wall bond.

The heading course in English garden wall bond sometimes features bricks of a different colour to its surrounding stretchers. In English chalk districts, flint is substituted for the stretchers, and the headers constitute a lacing course.&lt;ref name="The Architectural Review 1936. Page 242"/&gt;

====Scottish bond====
This bond has five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.

The lap is generated by the use of headers as quoins for the even numbered stretching courses, counting up from the previous heading course, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses.

{{anchor|American common bond}}

====American, or common bond====
[[File:NY-american bond.jpg|thumb|American bond, 5th Ave, [[Harlem, New York]]]]
This bond may have between three and nine  [[Course (architecture)|courses]] of stretchers between each course of headers.

Headers are used as quoins for the even numbered stretching courses, counting up from the previous heading course, in order to achieve the necessary off-set in a standard American bond, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses.

The brick [[Clarke-Palmore House]] in Henrico County, Virginia, has a lower level built in 1819 described as being American bond of three to five stretching courses between each heading course, and an upper level built in 1855 with American bond of six to seven stretching courses between each heading course.&lt;ref name="vaNRHPnom"&gt;{{cite web |author=Susan Reed Smither |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Clarke-Palmore House / Clarke Home |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Henrico/043-0085_Clarke-Palmore_2004_Final_Nomination.pdf |date=January 29, 2004 |accessdate=2010-05-08 |publisher=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607215144/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Henrico/043-0085_Clarke-Palmore_2004_Final_Nomination.pdf |archivedate=June 7, 2010 |df= }} and [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Henrico/Clarke-Palmore_photo.htm ''Accompanying four photos at Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission, undated''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528025454/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Henrico/Clarke-Palmore_photo.htm |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Header bond====
All bricks in this bond are headers, but for the lap-generating quoin three-quarter bat which offsets each successive [[Course (architecture)|courses]] by half a header.

Header bond is often used on curving walls with a small radius of curvature. In [[Lewes]], Sussex, England UK many small buildings are constructed in this bond, using blue coloured bricks and vitrified surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 440. "HEADING BOND.

===={{anchor|Stretcher bond}}Stretcher, or running bond====
All bricks in this bond are stretchers, with the bricks in each successive  [[Course (architecture)|course]] staggered by half a stretcher. Headers are used as quoins on alternating stretching courses in order to achieve the necessary off-set.

It is the simplest repeating pattern, and will create a wall only one-half brick thick. Such a thin wall is not stable enough to stand alone, and must be tied to a supporting structure. This practice is common in modern buildings, where stretcher bonded brickwork may be the outer face of a [[cavity wall]], or the facing to a timber or steel-framed structure.&lt;ref name="Campbell and Pryce pp304-305 and 313"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=James W.

Flemish stretcher bond separates courses of alternately laid stretchers and headers, with a number of courses of stretchers alone. Brickwork in this bond may have between one and four courses of stretchers to one course after the Flemish manner.&lt;ref name="Art. Grove 1996. Page 769"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brunskill|Brunskill]], p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The courses of stretchers are often but not always staggered in a raking pattern.

A row of double basket weave bond comprises pairs of shiners laid atop one another, alternating with pairs of sailors laid side-by-side.

The [[herringbone pattern]] (opus spicatum) made by placing soldiers next to stretchers or vice versa (i.e. headers perpendicular) making 'L' shapes, nesting each L in the same order of laying. Thin bricks are more common. The pattern is usually rotated by 45° to create a completely vertical (plumb) succession of 'V' shapes.

Brickwork formed into a diamond pattern is called [[diapering]].

===Flemish diagonal bond===
Flemish diagonal bond comprises a complex pattern of stretcher [[Course (architecture)|courses]] alternating with courses of one or two stretchers between headers, at various offsets such that over ten courses a diamond-shaped pattern appears.

==Damp-proof courses==
{{main article|Damp (structural)#Rising damp|l1=Rising damp}}
Moisture may ascend into a building from the foundation of a wall or gain ingress into a building from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a solid wall. The manifest result of this process is called [[Damp (structural)|damp]]. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low [[Course (architecture)|courses]] of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method of damp proofing appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. It is only partially effective, as in spite of the lower courses of brick being more moisture resistant the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks remain permeable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Emmitt|Emmitt]], p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cable length''' or ''' length of cable''' is a [[nautical]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of measure equal to one tenth of a [[nautical mile]] or approximately 100 [[fathoms]]. Due to anachronisms and varying techniques of measurement, a cable can be anywhere from 169 to 220 [[metres]], depending on the standard used. The unit is named after the length of a ship's [[anchor]] cable in the [[Age of Sail]]. 

The definition varies:

* International: 185.2 [[metre|m]], equivalent to {{frac|10}} [[nautical mile]]
* [[Imperial units|Imperial]] ([[Admiralty]]): 185.32 m, or {{frac|10}} [[Nautical mile|Admiralty mile]], about 101 [[fathom]]s
** The traditional British fathom varied from 5½ feet to 7 feet in the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]], making the "historical" cable 169 m to 215.5 m.
* [[United States customary units|U.S. customary]] ([[US Navy]]): 219.5 metres, 120 fathoms (720 feet)

[[File:Keppler - Hayes.jpg|thumb|"Torpedoes in His Path: Can he, with that load, get through without exploding them?"
U.S. President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] carries a cabinet on his back, containing Vice President [[William A. Wheeler|William Wheeler]], Secretary of the Treasury [[John Sherman]], and Secretary of the Interior [[Carl Schurz]]. In the background are [[James G. Blaine]], [[John A. Logan|John Logan]], [[Abram Hewitt]] and others. Published in ''[[Puck Magazine]]'': Centerfold; Vol. 1 No. 1, March 14, 1877]]

The '''centerfold''' or '''centrefold''' of a magazine refers to a [[gatefold]]ed [[Spread (typography)|spread]], usually a [[portrait]] such as a [[pin-up]] or a [[Nudity|nude]], inserted in the middle of the publication, or to the model featured in the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/centerfold |title=Centerfold |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[saddle-stitch]]ed magazines (as opposed to those that are [[perfect binding|perfect-bound]]), the centerfold does not have any blank space cutting through the image.

The term was coined by [[Hugh Hefner]], founder of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/hefner/profile.html |title=Hugh Hefner Profile |work=People in the News |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the first issue of ''Playboy'' has been attributed in large part to its centerfold: a nude of [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/firstissue.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607073029/http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/firstissue.html |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |title=The Playboy FAQ: The First Issue |work=World of Playboy |publisher=Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of monthly centerfolds gave the pin-up a new respectability, and helped to sanitize the notion of "sexiness".&lt;ref name=Slade/&gt; Being featured as a centerfold could lead to film roles for models, and still occasionally does today.&lt;ref name=Slade&gt;{{cite book|title=Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|author=Slade, Joseph W. |year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGTZySRzeYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0-313-31520-5|pages=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Hefner required ''Playboy'' centerfolds to be portrayed in a very specific way, telling photographers in a 1956 memo that the "model must be in a natural setting engaged in some activity 'like reading, writing, mixing a drink'...[and]... should have a 'healthy, intelligent, American look—a young lady that looks like she might be a very efficient secretary or an undergrad at [[Vassar College|Vassar]].'"&lt;ref name="nplus1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nplusonemag.com/playboy-hugh-hefner-story| title=Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story|work=[[n+1]]|date=January 13, 2009| accessdate=January 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hefner later said that the ideal centerfold is one in which "a situation is suggested, the presence of someone not in the picture"; the goal was to transform "a straight [[pinup]] into an intimate interlude, something personal and special."&lt;ref name="nplus1"/&gt;

Some magazines later adopted the practice of having a trifold or quatrefold centerfold, using a longer sheet of paper at that spot and folding the extra length into the magazine. Racier adult magazines used this space to showcase more explicit imagery: "In order to represent breasts, genitals, anus, and face all within the tri-fold frame of the centerfold, models were propped up, legs spread, raised, and then jack- knifed against their bodies, arms plunged between them to spread the labia."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Dennis, ''Art/porn: a history of seeing and touching'', Page 97, 2009, {{ISBN|1847880673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the term has become linked in the public consciousness with erotic material or models, many other magazines such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' have published fold-out spreads on other subjects.

==Centerfold titles==
Some magazines will refer to their centerfold models with a specific name, which may be connected to the magazine's brand or theme.&lt;br /&gt;
When obtained from one of the more prestigious publications in the field, it can become a semi-formal personal title used in news articles and introductions long after the model's centerfold appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.chicagonow.com/candid-candace/2015/04/playboys-hugh-hefner-turns-89-a-grateful-playmate-reminisces/#image/1 | title =Playboy's Hugh Hefner turns 89: A Grateful Playmate Reminisces | last =Jordan | first =Candace | date =April 10, 2015 | website =chicagonow.com | publisher =Chicago Tribune Media Group | access-date =March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cheung |first=Kevin |date=October 6, 2000 |title=Fresh Digital |magazine=The Age |location=Melbourne, Australia |publisher=Fairfax Media |page=95 |quote =Based on the comic book series by Ninja Turtles creators Laird and Eastman (and starring Penthouse Pet Julie Strain), Heavy Metal FAKK 2 is an adventure that offers enough high-tech violence and brazen sexual innuendo to put Lara Croft to shame.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chagossian creole''' (also ''créole îlois'', ''kreol Ilwa'', or just ''Ilwa'') is a [[French-based creole languages|French-based creole]] that was still spoken in 1994 by the 1,800 or so [[Ilois|Chagossians]], the former inhabitants of the [[Chagos Archipelago]] evicted in the early 1970s. It is currently spoken mainly in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]].  There is also a small minority community speaking the language in the [[United Kingdom]].

{{History of the Armenian language}}
[[File:Epitafium Minasowiczów kościół św. Jacka w Warszawie.JPG|thumb|Epitaph in Classical Armenian for Jakub and Marianna Minasowicz at [[St. Hyacinth's Church, Warsaw|St. Hyacinth's Church]] in [[Warsaw]]]]
'''Classical Armenian''' ({{Lang-hy|գրաբար}}, ''grabar'', [[Western Armenian]] ''krapar'', meaning "literary [language]"; also '''Old Armenian''' or '''Liturgical Armenian''') is the oldest attested form of the [[Armenian language]]. It was first written down at the beginning of the 5th century, and all Armenian literature from then through the 18th century is in Classical Armenian. Many ancient manuscripts originally written in [[Ancient Greek]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Latin]] survive only in Armenian translation.

Classical Armenian continues to be the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] and is often learned by [[Bible|Biblical]], [[Intertestamental period|Intertestamental]], and [[Patristics|Patristic]] scholars dedicated to textual studies. Classical Armenian is also important for the reconstruction of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]].

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
There are seven [[monophthongs]]: 
* {{IPA|/a/}} (ա), {{IPA|/i/}} (ի), {{IPA|/ə/}} or [[schwa]] (ը), {{IPA|/ɛ/}} or open ''e'' (ե), {{IPA|/e/}} or closed ''e'' (է), {{IPA|/o/}} (ո), and {{IPA|/u/}} (ու) (transcribed as ''a'', ''i'', ''ə'', ''e'', ''ē'', ''o'', and ''u'' respectively). The vowel transcribed ''u'' is spelled using the Armenian letters for ''ow'' (ու) but it is not actually a [[diphthong]].

There are also traditionally six diphthongs:
* ''ay'' (այ), ''aw'' (աւ, later օ), ''ea'' (եա), ''ew'' (եւ), ''iw'' (իւ), ''oy'' (ոյ).

===Consonants===
In the following table is the Classical Armenian consonantal system. The [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate consonant]]s have, in addition to the more common [[voice (phonetics)|voiced and unvoiced]] series, also a separate [[aspirated consonant|aspirated series]], transcribed with the notation used for Ancient Greek [[rough breathing]] after the letter: ''p῾'', ''t῾'', ''c῾'', ''č῾'', ''k῾''. Each phoneme has three symbols in the table. The leftmost indicates the pronunciation in [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA); in the middle is the corresponding symbol in the [[Armenian alphabet]] and the rightmost is its [[transliteration]] in the [[Latin alphabet]] (following the 1996 [[Romanization of Armenian#ISO 9985 (1996)|ISO 9985]] standard).

In [[telecommunication]], a '''common battery''' is a single electrical [[Electric power|power]] source used to energize more than one [[Telecommunication circuit|circuit]], [[electronic component]], equipment, or [[system]].  

A common battery is usually a string of [[electrolytic cell]]s and is usually centrally located to the equipment that it serves. In many telecommunications applications, the common battery is at a nominal −48 VDC. A [[telephone exchange|central office]] common battery in the [[battery room]] supplies power to operate all directly connected instruments.  ''Common battery'' may include one or more power conversion devices to transform commercial power to direct current, with a [[rechargeable battery]] floating across the output. Common battery operation largely replaced local batteries in each telephone in the early 20th century. It consists of two ends that emit opposing positive and negative charges

{{refimprove|date=December 2012}}
In [[Indic scripts]], the '''danda''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दण्ड ''{{IAST|daṇḍa}}'' "stick") is a [[punctuation]] [[character (computing)|character]]. The [[glyph]] consists of a single vertical stroke. The character can be found at [[character encoding|code point]] U+0964 ({{script|Deva|&amp;#x0964;}}) in [[Unicode]]. The "double danda" is at  U+0965 ({{script|Deva|&amp;#x0965;}}). [[ISCII]] encodes danda at 0xEA.

The danda marks the end of a sentence or period, comparable to a [[full stop]] (period) as commonly used in the [[Latin alphabet]], and is used alternate with Western punctuation in most modern [[Languages of India|Indic]] languages. In metrical texts, a double danda is used to delimit verses, and a single danda to delimit a [[pada (foot)|pada]] or semi-verse.

An '''empyema''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐμπύημα, "abscess") is a collection or gathering of [[pus]] within a naturally existing anatomical cavity. For example, [[pleural empyema]] is empyema of the [[pleural cavity]]. It must be differentiated from an [[abscess]], which is a collection of pus in a newly formed cavity.
&lt;!--
This article is about empyema in general. Please DO NOT insert detailed descriptions of pleural empyema here, they belong into the Article [[Pleural empyema]]. Thank you.  
--&gt;

== Classification ==
In human medicine, empyema occurs in:
* the [[pleural cavity]] ([[pleural empyema]] also known as pyothorax)
* the [[thoracic cavity]] 
* the [[uterus]] ([[pyometra]]) 
* the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] ([[appendicitis]])
* the [[meninges]] ([[subdural empyema]])
* the [[joint]]s ([[septic arthritis]])
* the [[gallbladder]]

In [[meta-ethics]], '''expressivism''' is a theory about the meaning of [[morality|moral language]].  According to expressivism, sentences that employ moral terms – for example, "It is wrong to torture an innocent human being" – are not descriptive or fact-stating; moral terms such as "wrong", "good", or "just" do not refer to real, in-the-world properties.  The primary function of moral sentences, according to expressivism, is not to assert any matter of fact, but rather to express an evaluative attitude toward an object of evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Horgan &amp; Timmons (2006c), pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the function of moral language is non-descriptive, moral sentences do not have any [[truth condition]]s.&lt;ref name="Horgan &amp; Timmons 2006b, p. 86"&gt;Horgan &amp; Timmons (2006b), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, expressivists either do not allow that moral sentences have [[truth value]], or rely on a notion of [[truth]] that does not appeal to any descriptive truth conditions being met for moral sentences.

==Overview==
Expressivism is a form of moral anti-realism or nonfactualism: the view that there are no moral facts that moral sentences describe or represent, and no moral properties or relations to which moral terms refer.  Expressivists deny constructivist accounts of moral facts – e.g. [[Kantianism]] – as well as realist accounts – e.g. [[ethical intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Horgan &amp; Timmons (2006b), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  

Because expressivism claims that the function of moral language is not descriptive, it allows the irrealist to avoid an [[error theory]]: the view that ordinary moral thought and discourse is committed to deep and pervasive error, and that all moral statements make false ontological claims.&lt;ref&gt;Timmons (1999), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from descriptivist subjectivism==
Expressivism does not hold that the function of moral sentences as used in ordinary discourse is to describe the speaker's moral attitudes.  Expressivists are united in rejecting [[ethical subjectivism]]: the descriptivist view that utterances of the type "X is good/bad" mean "I approve/disapprove of X".  Subjectivism is a descriptivist theory, not an expressivist one, because it maintains that moral sentences are used to represent facts – namely, facts about the subject's psychological states.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn (1998), pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early versions of expressivism arose during the early twentieth century in association with [[logical positivism]].  These early views are typically called "[[non-cognitivism|noncognitivist]]".  [[A. J. Ayer]]'s [[emotivism]] is a well-known example.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to emotivism, the act of uttering a moral sentence of the type "X is good (bad)" is closely akin to the expression of a positive (or negative) emotional attitude toward X, and such an utterance can be paraphrased by "Hurrah for X!" or "Boo, X!"&lt;ref&gt;van Roojen (2005), § 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Stevenson|C. L. Stevenson]] also advanced an important version of emotivism.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the middle of the twentieth century, [[R. M. Hare]] was an important advocate of expressivism / noncognitivism.&lt;ref&gt;Hare (1952)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hare's view is called [[Universal prescriptivism|prescriptivism]] because he analyzed moral sentences as universal, overriding prescriptions or imperatives.  A prescriptivist might paraphrase "X is good" as "Do X!".&lt;ref&gt;van Roojen (2005), § 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent versions of expressivism, such as [[Simon Blackburn|Simon Blackburn's]] "[[quasi-realism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn (1984, 1993, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allan Gibbard|Allan Gibbard's]] "norm-expressivism",&lt;ref&gt;Gibbard (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Timmons' and Terence Horgan's "cognitivist expressivism" tend to distance themselves from the "noncognitivist" label applied to Ayer, Stevenson, and Hare.&lt;ref&gt;Horgan &amp; Timmons (2006a, 2006b, 2006c)&lt;/ref&gt;  What distinguishes these "new wave" expressivists is that they resist [[reduction (philosophy)|reductive analyses]] of moral sentences or their corresponding psychological states, moral judgments,&lt;ref&gt;Horgan &amp; Timmons (2006b), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and they allow for moral sentences/judgments to have truth value.&lt;ref name="Horgan &amp; Timmons 2006b, p. 86"/&gt;  

Horgan and Timmons' label "cognitivist expressivism" in particular captures the philosophical commitment they share with Blackburn and Gibbard to regard moral judgments as cognitive psychological states, i.e. [[belief]]s, and moral sentences as vehicles for genuine assertions or truth-claims.  Much of the current expressivist project is occupied with defending a theory of the truth of moral sentences that is consistent with expressivism but can resist the Frege-Geach objection (see below).  Expressivists tend to rely on a minimalist or deflationary [[truth|theory of truth]] to provide an irrealist account for the truth of moral sentences.

==Arguments for==
{{See also|Non-cognitivism}}

===Open question argument===
{{Main|Open question argument}}

According to the open question [[argument]] (originally articulated by [[ethical intuitionism|intuitionist]] and [[ethical non-naturalism|non-naturalist]] [[G. E. Moore]]), for any proposed definition of a moral term, e.g. " 'good' = 'the object of desire' ", a competent speaker of English who understands the meaning of the terms involved in the statement of the definition could still hold that the question, "Is the object of desire good?" remains unanswered.

The upshot of this argument is that normative or moral terms cannot be analytically reduced to "natural" or non-moral terms.  Expressivists argue that the best explanation of this irreducibility is that moral terms are not used to describe objects, but rather to evaluate them.  Many philosophers regard expressivists or noncognitivists as "the real historical beneficiar[ies] of the open question argument."&lt;ref&gt;Darwall, Gibbard, and Railton (1997), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[moral realism|moral realists]] maintain that a ''synthetic'' reduction of moral terms to natural terms is possible.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}  Other realists (including Moore himself) have concluded that moral terms refer to non-natural, [[sui generis]] properties or relations;{{Fact|date=October 2007}} but non-naturalism is vulnerable to the argument from queerness (see below).

===Argument from moral disagreement===
Persons may disagree in their moral evaluations of the same object, while possessing all the same information about the "natural" or descriptive facts about the object of evaluation.  Expressivists argue that such deep moral disagreement is evidence that moral judgment is not a species of descriptive or factual judgment.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

===Argument from queerness===
{{Main|Argument from queerness}}

==Objections==
===The Frege–Geach problem&lt;!--'Frege–Geach problem' redirects here--&gt;===
The '''Frege–Geach problem'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; – named for [[Peter Geach]], who developed it from the writings of [[Gottlob Frege]] – claims that by subscribing to expressivism one necessarily accepts that the meaning of "It is wrong to tell lies" is different from the meaning of the "it is wrong to tell lies" part of the conditional "If it is wrong to tell lies, then it is wrong to get your little brother to lie", and that therefore expressivism is an inadequate explanation for moral language.

Frege–Geach contends that "It is wrong to get your little brother to tell lies" can be deduced from the two premises by ''[[modus ponens]]'' as follows:

*It is wrong to tell lies.
*If it is wrong to tell lies, then it is wrong to get your little brother to tell lies.
*Therefore, it is wrong to get your little brother to tell lies.

In the second statement the expressivist account appears to fail, in that the speaker asserting the hypothetical premise is expressing no moral position towards lying, condemnatory or otherwise. The expressivist thus cannot account for the meaning of moral language in this kind of unasserted context. This problem assumes that logic only applies to real truth values.

===Illocutionary act-intention argument===
{{See|Illocutionary act}}

Terence Cuneo argues against expressivism by means of the following premise:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is false that, in ordinary optimal conditions, when an agent performs the sentential act of sincerely uttering a moral sentence, that agent does not thereby intend to assert a moral proposition, but intends to express an attitude toward a non-moral state of affairs or object.&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo (2006), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of expressivism are concerned to preserve the participants in ordinary moral thought and discourse from charges of deep error.  But, Cuneo argues, there is evidence that many such participants do intend to represent a factual moral reality when they make moral judgments.  Hence, if the expressivists are correct and moral language is not properly used to make factual, descriptive assertions, many participants in ordinary moral discourse are frustrated in their [[illocutionary act]] intentions.  On these grounds it is argued that we should give up expressivism, unless the expressivists are to give up on their claim that expressivism is not an essentially revisionist view of moral thought and discourse.

'''Fipa''' ('''Fipa''': ''Ichifipa'') is a [[Bantu language]] of [[Tanzania]]. It is spoken by the [[Fipa people]], who live on the [[Ufipa plateau]] in the [[Rukwa Region]] of South West [[Tanzania]] between [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Rukwa]]. The ethnic group of the [[Fipa people]] is larger than the group of '''Fipa''' language speakers. On the Tanzanian side, people who speak [[Mambwe-Lungu language|Mambwe-Lungu]] may identify as Fipa and consider their language to be a dialect of Fipa. [[Lungu language|Lungu]] and [[Mambwe language|Mambwe]] are also spoken in Zambia where they are considered languages and their speakers are considered to be ethnic groups in their own right, although linguists consider Lungu and Mambwe to be dialects of a single language. There are three dialects: Milanzi (also referred to as IchiSukuuma), Kwa (Ichikwa) and Nkansi.

Maho (2009) classifies M.131 Kulwe (Kuulwe, no ISO code) as closest to Fipa. Otherwise the dialects are Milanzi (Fipa-Sukuma, ''Icisukuuma''), South Fipa, Kandaasi (''Icikandaasi''), Siiwa (''Icisiiwa''), Nkwaamba (''Icinkwaamba''), Kwa (''Icikwa''), Kwaafi (''Icikwaafi''), Ntile (''Icintile,'' Cile), Peemba (''Icipeemba'').

Since [[Herodotus]], the ancient travellers had been struck by this strange country, which "is nothing like the others", and the ancient Egyptians preserved the dead body in as life-like a manner as possible. Thanks to the testimonies of the Arabs, the West has always known that ancient Egypt was a country of mummies. Today, we know most of the process of mummification, desiccation of bodies obtained through the dry climate of Egypt, the removal of viscera, the use of natron and bandages. Similarly, we know what kind of rituals accompanied the preparation of the corpse, who were responsible for the mummification process. As for why the mummification, it is related to the Egyptian religion, for which it is the guarantee of immortality, the possibility of a new life (life after death).

Based on recent radiographic and genetic analyses of bodies, Françoise Dunand and Roger Lichtenberg take stock of the historical knowledge of mummies, and add a scientific dimension in this small colourful book—{{lang|fr|Les momies : Un voyage dans l'éternité}} (lit. "The Mummies: A Journey into Eternity"; US edition – ''Mummies: A Voyage Through Eternity''; UK edition – ''Mummies: A Journey Through Eternity'')—published by [[Éditions Gallimard]] in the {{lang|fr|Archéologie}} series of their {{lang|fr|[[Découvertes Gallimard|Découvertes]]}} [[Collection (publishing)|collection]]. According to standards of the collection, the book is richly documented with more than 200 illustrations—drawings, paintings, sculptures, X-ray photographs of mummies, etc., which illustrate the [[Body text|body copy]] as the pages are pretty equally shared between images and texts—and printed on glossy paper.

This book is an archaeological and anthropological study on [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|funeral practices in ancient Egypt]]. It opens with full-page head shots of nine mummies from the necropolis at Duch excavated by Dunand's [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale|IFAO]] team. Images from the excavation at the Duch necropolis are also some of the book's highlights. The authors approach the subject from different angles: the discoveries of mummies by the Western world (chap. Ⅰ, "Mummies Come to Light"), such as the writings of [[Herodotus]] and curiosity of [[Egyptomania]] in the 19th century, up to the scientific research of the 20th century with the contribution of radiology techniques (chap. Ⅴ, "Under Expert Analysis"). The second chapter—"Making a Better Mummy"—deals with how the ancient Egyptians mummified a body, while the third chapter, "Toward Immortality", illustrated with ancient paintings explaining the rites and beliefs. Chapter Ⅳ, "From Eternal Life to Harsh Reality" tells the valuable offerings which the ancient Egyptians furnished with their dead, and the direct consequence of this: the pillaging of tombs. In the last chapter (chap. Ⅴ), the scientists give anthropological results.

In its second part—the "Documents" section—the book provides a compilation of excerpts taken from some ancient documents and texts by 19th-century investigators, which is divided into five parts: 1, Funeral Rites; 2, Mummification According to Herodotus; 3, An Unpeaceful End; 4, Two Sensational Discoveries; 5, Looking into Mummies. The book closes with a chronology, map, further reading, list of illustrations and an index. It has been translated into [[American English|American]] and [[British English]], Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]].

{{Unsolved|mathematics|Are all trees graceful?}}
In [[graph theory]], a '''graceful labeling''' of a graph with ''m'' edges is a [[graph labeling|labeling]] of its vertices with some subset of the [[integer]]s between 0 and ''m'' inclusive, such that no two vertices share a label, and each edge is uniquely identified by the [[absolute difference]] between its endpoints, such that this magnitude lies between ''1'' and ''m'' inclusive. &lt;ref name="Vas2001"&gt;[[Virginia Vassilevska Williams|Virginia Vassilevska]],  "Coding and Graceful Labeling of trees." SURF 2001. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~virgi/final1.ps PostScript]&lt;/ref&gt; A graph which admits a graceful labeling is called a '''graceful graph'''.

The name "graceful labeling" is due to [[Solomon W. Golomb]]; this class of labelings was originally given the name '''β-labelings''' by Alexander Rosa in a 1967 paper on graph labelings.&lt;ref name="Ros1967"&gt;{{citation

A major [[Unsolved problems in mathematics|unproven conjecture]] in graph theory is the '''Graceful Tree conjecture''' or '''Ringel–Kotzig conjecture''', named after [[Gerhard Ringel]] and [[Anton Kotzig]], which hypothesizes that all [[tree (graph)|tree]]s are graceful. The Ringel–Kotzig conjecture is also known as the "graceful labeling conjecture". Kotzig once called the effort to prove the conjecture a "disease".&lt;ref name="Hua1982"&gt;{{citation

 | title = Further results on tree labellings

Another weaker version of graceful labelling is the '''near''' graceful labeling, in which the vertices can be labeled using some subset of the [[integer]]s between ''0'' and ''m+1'' inclusive, such that no two vertices share a label, and each edge is uniquely identified by the [[absolute difference]] between its endpoints, such that this magnitude lies between ''1'' and ''m+1'' inclusive.

Another conjecture in graph theory is the '''Rosa's Conjecture''', named after '''Alexander Rosa''', which says that all triangular [[Cactus_graph |cacti]] are graceful or nearly-graceful&lt;ref name="Rosa1988"&gt;{{citation
 | last = Rosa | first = A.

'''Greenlandic''' is an [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut language]] spoken by about 56,000 [[Greenlandic Inuit]] in [[Greenland]]. It is closely related to the [[Inuit languages]] in [[Canada]] such as [[Inuktitut]]. The main variety, [[Kalaallisut]] or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009; this is a move by the [[Naalakkersuisut]] (government of Greenland) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language, [[Danish language|Danish]]. The second variety is [[Tunumiit language|Tunumiit oraasiat]] or East Greenlandic.  The Thule Inuit of Greenland, [[Inuktun]] or Polar Eskimo, is a recent arrival and a dialect of [[Inuktitut]].

Greenlandic is a [[polysynthetic language]] that allows the creation of long words by stringing together [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] and [[suffix]]es. Its [[morphosyntactic alignment]] is [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative]], meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb.

Nouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight [[Grammatical mood|moods]] and for the [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Grammatical person|person]] of its [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]]. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] [[clause]]s is [[subject–object–verb]]. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables [[switch-reference]] between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of [[grammatical tense]], as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as "yesterday" or "now" or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] meanings with the semantic [[Lexical aspect|aktionsart]] of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has [[Incorporation (linguistics)|noun incorporation]], or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.

When adopting new concepts or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and [[English language|English]]. The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by [[Samuel Kleinschmidt]] in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now among the highest in the world.

== History ==
The Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the [[Thule people]] in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier [[Saqqaq culture|Saqqaq]] and [[Dorset culture]]s in Greenland.

The first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary [[Paul Egede]] wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;

[[File:Inuktitut dialect map.svg|upright=1.6|right|thumb|Illustration 1: Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.]]
From the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at strengthening Danish. 
Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.&lt;ref name="SocEd" /&gt;

From 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and in the years following it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.&lt;ref name="SocEd"&gt;Goldbach &amp; Winther-Jensen (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of "greenlandization" of Greenlandic society which began with the homerule agreement of 1979. This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education. The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish-speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic.&lt;ref&gt;Iutzi-Mitchell &amp; [[Nelson H. H. Graburn]] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media: the Greenlandic National Radio, [[Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa]], which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic.  The newspaper [[Sermitsiaq (newspaper)|Sermitsiaq]], has been published since 1958, and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper ''[[Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten]]'', which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jones, Kenneth Olwig. 2008.

Before June 2009, Greenlandic shared its status as the official language in Greenland with Danish.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to the Namminersornerullutik Oqartussat / Grønlands Hjemmestyres (Greenlands Home, official website): « ''Language. The official languages are Greenlandic and Danish... Greenlandic is the language [that is] used in schools and [that] dominates in most towns and settlements'' ». {{cite web |url=http://uk.nanoq.gl/Emner/About/Culture.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227033842/http://uk.nanoq.gl/Emner/About/Culture.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Greenlandic has become the sole official language.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt; This has made Greenlandic a unique example of an [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous language of the Americas]] that is recognized by law as the only official language of a semi-independent country. Nevertheless, it is still considered to be in a "vulnerable" state by the UNESCO [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Red Book of Language Endangerment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222090430/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=2009-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has a 100% literacy rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html|title= Greenland|work= CIA World Factbook|date= 2008-06-19|access-date= 2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Western Greenlandic standard has become dominant, a [[UNESCO]] report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the Eastern Greenlandic dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Classification ==
[[Kalaallisut]] and the other Greenlandic dialects belong to the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut family]] and are closely related to the [[Inuit languages]] of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]]. Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different Eskimoan languages, among them the three main dialects of Greenlandic.

The most prominent Greenlandic dialect is '''West Greenlandic''' ''(Kalaallisut),'' which is the official language of Greenland. The name ''Kalaallisut'' is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, ''[[Inuktun]] (Avanersuarmiutut),'' spoken in the vicinity of the city of [[Qaanaaq]] (Thule), is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The eastern dialect ''([[Tunumiit language|Tunumiit oraasiat]])'', spoken in the vicinity of [[Ammassalik Island]] and [[Ittoqqortoormiit]], is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilated]] [[consonant cluster]]s and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic.&lt;ref name="MahieuTersis" /&gt; Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects. One that is spoken around [[Upernavik]] has certain similarities to East Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland. A second dialect is spoken in the region of [[Uummannaq]] and the [[Disko Bay]]. The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in [[Sisimiut]] in the north, around [[Nuuk]] and as far south as [[Maniitsoq]]. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around [[Narsaq]] and [[Qaqortoq]] in the south.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;Rischel, Jørgen.

It can be seen that Inuktun is the most conservative, maintaining the "gh" which has been elided in Kalaallisut, and Tunumiisut is the most innovative, having further simplified the structure by eliding the {{IPA|/n/}}.

=== Vowels ===
[[File:West Greenlandic vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Ranges of West Greenlandic monophthongs on a [[vowel chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fortescue|first=Michael|editor-last=Collins|editor-first=Dirmid R. F.|year=1990|chapter=Basic Structures and Processes in West Greenlandic|title=Arctic Languages: An Awakening|publisher=UNESCO|place=Paris|page=317|isbn=92-3-102661-5|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000861/086162e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Greenlandic three [[vowel]] system, composed of {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}}, is typical for an Eskimo–Aleut language. Double vowels are analyzed as two [[mora (linguistics)|morae]], so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography.&lt;ref&gt;Rischel (1974) pp. 79 – 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"&gt;Jacobsen (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The only diphthong in the language is {{IPA|/ai/}}, which occurs only at the ends of words.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Before a [[uvular consonant]] ({{IPA|[q]}} or {{IPA|[ʁ]}}), {{IPA|/i/}} is realized [[allophonic]]ally as {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[ɛ]}} or {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} is realized [[allophonic]]ally as {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, and the two vowels are written ''e, o'' respectively (as in some orthographies used for [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]]).&lt;ref name="NTNU"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hagerup|first1=Asger|title=A Phonological Analysis of Vowel Allophony in West Greenlandic|date=2011|publisher=NTNU}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/a/}} becomes retracted to {{IPA|[ɑ]}} in the same environment. {{IPA|/i/}} is rounded to {{IPA|[y]}} before labial consonants.&lt;ref name="NTNU" /&gt; {{IPA|/u/}} is fronted to {{IPA|[ʉ]}} between two coronal consonants.&lt;ref name="NTNU" /&gt;

The allophonic lowering of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} as {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|o}} respectively before uvulars {{angle bracket|q}} and {{angle bracket|r}}. For example:

: {{IPA|/ui/}} "husband" pronounced {{IPA|[ui]}}.
: {{IPA|/uiqarpuq/}} "she has a husband" pronounced {{IPA|[ueqɑʁpɔq]}} and written {{angle bracket|ueqarpoq}}.

: {{IPA|/illu/}} "house" pronounced {{IPA|[iɬːu]}}.
: {{IPA|/illuqarpuq/}} "he has a house" pronounced {{IPA|[iɬːoqɑʁpɔq]}} and written {{angle bracket|illoqarpoq}}.

=== Consonants ===
Greenlandic has [[consonant]]s at five points of articulation: [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[palatal]], [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]]. It does not have phonemic [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|voicing]] contrast, but rather distinguishes stops from fricatives. It distinguishes stops, fricatives, and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar, and uvular points of articulation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The uvular nasal {{IPA|[ɴ]}} is not found in all dialects and there is dialectal variability regarding its status as a phoneme (Rischel 1974:176–181)&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier palatal sibilant {{IPA|[ʃ]}} has merged with {{IPA|[s]}} in all but a few dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Rischel (1974) pp.173–177&lt;/ref&gt; The labiodental fricative {{IPA|[f]}} is only contrastive in [[loanword]]s. The alveolar stop {{IPA|[t]}} is pronounced as an affricate {{IPA|[t͡s]}} before the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. Often, Danish loanwords containing {{angle bracket|b d g}} preserve these in writing, although this does not imply a change in pronunciation, for example {{angle bracket|baaja}} {{IPA|[paːja]}} "beer" and {{angle bracket|Guuti}} {{IPA|[kuːtˢi]}} "God"; these are pronounced exactly as {{IPA|/p t k/}}.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;

=== Phonotactics ===
The Kalaallisut [[syllable]] is simple, allowing syllables of (C)(V)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel and VV is a double vowel or word-final {{IPA|/ai/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue(1984) p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Native words may only begin with a vowel or {{IPA|/p, t, k, q, s, m, n/}}; they may end only in {{IPA|/p, t, k, q/}} or rarely {{IPA|/n/}}. Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into geminates. All non-nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.&lt;ref&gt;Sadock (2003) pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prosody ===
Greenlandic prosody does not include [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] as an autonomous category; instead, [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] is determined by [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and durational parameters.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen" /&gt; [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.&lt;ref name="BjornumProsody"&gt;Bjørnum (2003) pp. 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Geminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.&lt;ref&gt;Sadock (2003) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Intonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.&lt;ref name="BjornumProsody" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1984) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morphophonology ===
Greenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations.

Greenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is {{IPA|/ʁ/}}. In all other cases the first consonant in a cluster is assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate {{IPA|/tt/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ts]}} and written {{angle bracket|ts}}. Geminate {{IPA|/ll/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɬː]}}. Geminate {{IPA|/ɣɣ/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[çː]}} but is written {{angle bracket|gg}}. Geminate {{IPA|/ʁʁ/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[χː]}}. Geminate {{IPA|/vv/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[fː]}} and written {{angle bracket|ff}}. {{IPA|/v/}} is also pronounced and written {{IPA|[f]}} after {{IPA|/ʁ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum,(2003) p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

These assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words, ''iglu'' ("house"), is ''illu'' in Greenlandic, where the {{IPA|/ɡl/}} consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]]. And the word ''Inuktitut'' itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, becomes ''Inuttut''. The Old Greenlandic diphthong {{IPA|/au/}} has assimilated to {{IPA|/aa/}}.

The consonant {{IPA|/v/}} has disappeared when between {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/a/}}. This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without {{IPA|[v]}} when suffixed to stems ending in {{IPA|/u/}}.

The vowel {{IPA|/i/}} of modern Greenlandic is the result of a historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo–Aleut vowels *i and *ɪ. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede.&lt;ref&gt;Rischel (1985) pp. 553&lt;/ref&gt; In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned [[morphophonology|morphophonologically]] in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *ɪ has the variant {{IPA|[a]}} when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, [[Inuktun]], which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from West and East Greenlandic. East Greenlandic (''Tunumiit oraasiat'') has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. {{IPA|[ɬː]}} to {{IPA|[tː]}}. Thus, for example, the East Greenlandic name of a particular town is [[Ittoqqortoormiit]], which would appear as ''Illoqqortoormiut'' in Kalaallisut.&lt;ref name="Mennecier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MahieuTersis"&gt;Mahieu &amp; Tersis (2009) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
[[File:Parkverbot Grönland.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|A bilingual sign in Nuuk, showing the contrast between Danish and Kalaallisut. The sign translates to "parking forbidden for all vehicles".]]
The [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Greenlandic is highly [[polysynthetic|synthetic]] and exclusively suffixing,&lt;ref&gt;Sadock (2003) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example the word ''Nalunaarasuartaatilioqateeraliorfinnialikkersaatiginialikkersaatilillaranatagoorunarsuarooq'' which means something like "Once again they tried to build a giant radio station, but it was apparently only on the drawing board"&lt;/ref&gt; In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5.&lt;ref&gt;Sadock (2003) pp. 3 &amp; 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Compare this with the English rate of slightly more than one morpheme per word.&lt;/ref&gt; The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue &amp; Lennert Olsen (1992) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few compound words, but lots of derivations.&lt;ref&gt;Sadock (2003) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The grammar employs a mixture of [[Head-marking language|head]] and [[Dependent-marking language|dependent marking]]: both [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] and [[Patient (grammar)|patient]] are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent [[noun phrase]]s inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is [[Ergative language|ergative]].

The language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see [[#Obviation and switch-reference|Obviation and switch-reference]]), two numbers (singular and plural; no [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, interrogative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) and eight cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, as well as for case.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

In this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.

=== Syntax ===
Greenlandic distinguishes three [[Open class (linguistics)|open word classes]]: [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s and [[Grammatical particle|particles]]. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case. Particles do not inflect.&lt;ref name="Bjørnum 2003"&gt;Bjørnum (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

! Gloss
| say-3p/{{sc|IND}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This article uses the following abbreviations for grammatical terminology in the example glosses: {{sc|IND}}: indicative mood; {{sc|INT}}: intransitive; {{sc|TR}}: transitive; {{sc|ABS}}: Absolutive case; I: first person singular; WE: first person plural; YOU: second person; 3p: third person; 4p: reflexive/obviative person; {{sc|ERG}}: ergative case; {{sc|CONT}}: contemporative mood; {{sc|POSS}}: possessor; {{sc|INSTR}}: instrumental case; {{sc|NEG}}: negative; {{sc|INTERR}}: interrogative mood; {{sc|IMP}}: imperative mood; {{sc|OPT}}: optative mood; {{sc|COND}}: conditional mood; {{sc|CAU}}: causative mood; {{sc|PL}}: plural.

| man.{{sc|ABS}}
| No
|}

The verb is the only word required to build a sentence. Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare.&lt;ref name="Bjørnum 2003" /&gt; The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:

Intransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:
: ''Sini-ppoq'' "(S)he sleeps"
: sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In glosses of examples in Greenlandic the abbreviation "3p" means "third person singular" and has the same meaning as the English third person pronouns ''he'', ''she'' and ''it'', but it does not carry any information about gender.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intransitive clause with subject noun phrase:
: ''Angut sinippoq'' "the man sleeps"
: man.{{sc|ABS}} sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}

Transitive clause with no overt arguments:
: ''Asa-vaa'' "(S)he loves him/her/it"
: love-3p/3p

Transitive clause with agent noun phrase:
: ''Angut-ip asa-vaa'' "the man loves him/her/it"
: man-{{sc|ERG}} love-3p/3p

Transitive clause with patient noun phrase:
: ''Arnaq asa-vaa'' "(S)he loves the woman"
: woman.{{sc|ABS}} love-3p/3p

==== Morphosyntactic alignment ====
The Greenlandic language uses [[case (grammar)|case]] to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenlandic is an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] language. This means that, instead of treating the [[morphosyntax|grammatical relations]] as in most European languages where grammatical [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] are marked with [[nominative case]] and [[object (grammar)|objects]] with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for [[Agent (grammar)|agents]] of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a [[nominative–accusative language]].&lt;ref&gt;Langgård, Karen (2009) "Grammatical structures in Greenlandic as found in texts written by young Greenlanders at the turn of the millennium" chapter 15 in Mahieu &amp; Tersis (2009) pp. 231–247{{sic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intransitive:
: ''Anda sini-ppoq'' "Anda sleeps"
: Anda.{{sc|ABS}} sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}

Transitive with agent and object:
: ''Anda-p nanoq taku-aa'' "Anda sees a bear"
: Anda.{{sc|ERG}} bear-{{sc|ABS}} see-3p/3p

==== Word order ====
In transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic, pragmatically neutral word order is [[subject–object–verb|AOXV / SXV]], where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. This order is fairly free, though. [[Topic (linguistics)|Topical]] noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is usually the verb, but it can also be a [[Focus (linguistics)|focal]] subject or object as well. In spoken language also "afterthought" material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1993) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1993) p. 269-270&lt;/ref&gt;

In copula clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement.

: ''Andap tujuuluk pisiaraa'' "Anda bought the sweater"
: Anda  sweater  bought
: A      O         V

An attribute appears after its head noun.

: ''Andap tujuuluk tungujortoq pisiaraa'' "Anda bought the blue sweater"
: Anda sweater blue bought
: A      O       X    V

An attribute of an incorporated noun appears after the verb:

: ''Anda sanasuuvoq pikkorissoq'' "Anda is a skilled carpenter"
: Anda carpenter.IS skilled
: S     V          APP

==== Coordination and subordination ====
Syntactic [[Coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]] is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue(1984) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1993) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Obviation and switch-reference ====
The Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as [[obviative|obviation]]&lt;ref&gt;Bittner (1995) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; or [[switch-reference]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue 1991. 53 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a special so-called fourth person&lt;ref&gt;Woodbury (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) pp. 152–154&lt;/ref&gt; Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person:

: ''illu-a taku-aa'' "he saw his (the other man's) house"
: house-3{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p

: ''illu-ni taku-aa'' "he saw his own house"
: house-4{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p

: ''Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkiga'' "Ole said I had hit him (the other man)"
: Ole say-3p hit-I/3p

: ''Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkini'' "Ole said I had hit him (Ole)"
: Ole say-3p hit-I/4p&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The abbreviation "4p" refers to the fourth or reflexive person.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Eva iser-uni sini-ssaa-q'' "When Eva comes in she'll sleep"
: Eva come.in-4p sleep-expect-3p

: ''Eva iser-pat sini-ssaa-q'' When Eva comes in (s)he'll sleep (someone else).
: Eva come.in-3p sleep-expect-3p

==== Indefiniteness construction ====
There is no category of [[definiteness]] in Greenlandic, so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means. According to some authors,  morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called [[Antipassive voice|antipassive]]&lt;ref&gt;Kappel Schmidt (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadock 2003"&gt;Sadock (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; or intransitive object&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1984) p. 92 &amp; p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; conveys such meaning, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Hallman, Peter (n.d.) "Definiteness in Inuktitut"[http://hallklar.bol.ucla.edu/Inuktitut.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Geenhoven (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; This view, however, is controversial.&lt;ref name="Bittner 1987"&gt;Bittner (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

Active:
: ''Piitap arfeq takuaa'' "Peter saw the whale"
: Peter-{{sc|ERG}} whale see

Antipassive/intransitive object:
: ''Piitaq arfermik takuvoq'' "Peter saw (a) whale"
: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} whale-{{sc|INSTR}} see

=== Verbs ===
The morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex. The two main processes are [[inflection]] and [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] (tense/[[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut).&lt;ref name="Shaer"&gt;Shaer (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bittner2005"&gt;Bittner (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HayashiSprenger"&gt;Hayashi&amp; Spreng (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Derivational morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by [[adverb]]s in English. Derivational suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds. Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as [[postbase]]s rather than suffixes, particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1980) note 1&lt;/ref&gt; Such semantically "heavy" suffixes may express concepts such as "to have", "to be", "to say", or "to think". The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.

==== Inflection ====
Greenlandic verbs inflect for [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: [[indicative]], [[Interrogative mood|interrogative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[optative]]. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or [[Negation (linguistics)|negative]] inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p. 35-50&lt;/ref&gt; The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue &amp; Lennert Olsen (1992) pp. 112 and 119–122)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Indicative and interrogative moods =====

The indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing [[Question#Grammar|questions]]. Questions with the question particle ''immaqa'' "maybe" cannot use the interrogative mood.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''napparsima-vit''? "Are you sick?" (interrogative mood)
: be.sick-YOU/{{sc|INTERR}}

: ''naamik, napparsima-nngila-nga''. "No, I am not sick" (indicative mood)
: no, be.sick-{{sc|NEG}}-I/{{sc|IND}}

Table 5 shows the intransitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb ''neri-'' "to eat" in the indicative and interrogative moods (question marks mark interrogative intonation—questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most [[Indo-European languages]] in which questions are marked by rising intonation). The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. [[Consonant gradation]] like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation (with strengthening to ''pp'' in the 3rd person plural and weakening to ''v'' elsewhere).

===== Imperative and optative moods =====
The imperative mood is used to issue orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''sini-git''! "Sleep!"
: sleep-{{sc|IMP}}

: ''sini-llanga'' "Let me sleep!"
: sleep-1p.{{sc|OPT}}

: ''sini-nnak''! "Don't sleep!"
: sleep-{{sc|NEG}}.{{sc|IMP}}

===== Conditional mood =====
The conditional mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning "if" or "when".&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''seqinner-pat Eva ani-ssaa-q'' "If the sun shines, Eva will go out"
: Sunshine-{{sc|COND}} Eva go.out-expect/3p

===== Causative mood =====
The causative mood (sometimes called the ''conjunctive'') is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning "because", "since" or "when"; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of "that". The causative is also used in main clauses to imply some underlying cause.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum(2003) pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''qasu-gami innar-poq'' "He went to bed because he was tired"
: be.tired-{{sc|CAU}}/3p go.to.bed-3p

: ''matta-ttor-ama'' "I've eaten blubber (that's why I'm not hungry)"
: blubber-eat-{{sc|CAU}}/I

: ''ani-guit eqqaama-ssa-vat teriannia-qar-mat'' "If you go out, remember that there are foxes"
: go.out-{{sc|COND}}/{{sc|YOU}} remember-fut-{{sc|IMP}} fox-are-{{sc|CAUS}}

===== Contemporative mood =====
The contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative can also be used to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum(2003) pp.46–49&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''qasu-llunga angerlar-punga'' "Being tired, I went home"
: be.tired-{{sc|CONT}}.{{sc|I}} go.home-I

: ''98-inik ukio-qar-luni toqu-voq'' "Being 98 years old, he/she died", "he/she was 98 when he/she died"
: 98-{{sc|INSTR}}.{{sc|PL}} year-have-{{sc|CONT}}.4p.{{sc|SG}} die-3p

: ''Eva oqar-poq kami-it akiler-lugit'' "Eva said she had paid for the boots"
: Eva say-3p boot-{{sc|PL}} pay-{{sc|CONT}}.3p.{{sc|PL}}

===== Participial mood =====
The participial mood is used to construct a subordinate clause describing its subject in the state of carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as [[relative clauses]].&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''atuar-toq taku-ara'' "I saw her read/{{sc|I}} saw that she read"
: read-{{sc|PART}}/3p see-I/3p

: ''neriu-ppunga tiki-ssa-soq'' "I hope he is coming/{{sc|I}} hope he'll come"
: hope-{{sc|I}} come-expect-{{sc|PART}}/3p

==== Derivation ====
Verbal derivation is extremely productive, and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.

-''katap''- "be tired of"
: ''taku-katap-para'' "I am tired of seeing it/him/her"
: see-tired.of-I/3p

-''ler''- "begin to/be about to"
: ''neri-ler-pugut'' "We are about to eat"
: eat-begin-WE

-''llaqqip''- "be proficient at"
: ''erinar-su-llaqqip-poq'' "She is good at singing"
: sing-{{sc|HAB}}-proficiently-3p

-''niar''- "plans to/wants to"
: ''aallar-niar-poq'' "He plans to travel"
: travel-plan-3p

: ''angerlar-niar-aluar-punga'' "I was planning to go home though"
: go.home-plan-though-I

-''ngajap''- "almost"
: ''sini-ngajap-punga'' "I had almost fallen asleep"
: sleep-almost-I

-''nikuu-nngila''- "has never"
: ''taku-nikuu-nngila-ra'' "I have never seen it"
: see-never-{{sc|NEG}}-I/3p

-''nngitsoor''- "not anyway/afterall"
: ''tiki-nngitsoor-poq'' "He hasn't arrived after all"
: arrive-not.afterall-3p

==== Time reference and aspect ====
Greenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between, for example, recent and distant past, but the use of these is not obligatory,&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1984:) p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic's extensive derivational system than as a system of [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] markers. Rather than by morphological marking, fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials:&lt;ref&gt;Trondhjem (2009) pp. 173–175&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''toqo-riikatap-poq'' "He died long ago"&lt;ref name="Fortescue 1984 p. 273"&gt;Fortescue (1984) p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;
: die-long.ago-3p/{{sc|IND}}
: ''nere-qqammer-punga'' "I ate recently"&lt;ref name="Fortescue 1984 p. 273" /&gt;
: eat-recently-I/{{sc|IND}}
: ''ippassaq Piitaq arpap-poq'' "Yesterday Peter was running."&lt;ref name="Trondhjem 2009 p. 174"&gt;Trondhjem (2009) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;
: yesterday Peter-{{sc|ABS}} run-3p/{{sc|IND}}

All other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal [[Lexical aspect|aktionsart]].&lt;ref name="Trondhjem 2009 p. 174" /&gt;

: ''Piitaq arpap-poq'' "Peter runs"&lt;ref name="Trondhjem 2009 p. 174" /&gt;
: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} run-3p/{{sc|IND}}
: ''Piitaq ani-voq'' "Peter was gone out"&lt;ref name="Trondhjem 2009 p. 174" /&gt;
: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} go.out-3p/{{sc|IND}}

But if a sentence containing an atelic verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.&lt;ref&gt;Bittner (2005) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart, e.g. ''sar'' expressing "habituality" and ''ssaar'' expressing "stop to".&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1984) pp. 276–287. The dividing line between aktionsart, aspect and still other functions not fitting into these categories would yet have to be clarified.&lt;/ref&gt; Next to these, there are at least two major perfect markers: ''sima'' and ''nikuu''. ''sima'' can occur in several positions with obviously different function&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1984) pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; Rightmost position indicates evidential meaning, but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present.

: ''tiki(t)-nikuu-sima-voq'' "Apparently, she had arrived"&lt;ref&gt;Trondhjem (2009) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;
: arrive-NIKUU-SIMA-3p/{{sc|INT}}

With [[telicity|atelic verbs]], there is a regular contrast between indirective [[evidentiality]] marked by ''sima'' and witnessed evidentiality marked by ''nikuu''.&lt;ref name="Trondhjem 2009 p. 179"&gt;Trondhjem (2009) p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and ''sima'' sometimes is marked.&lt;ref&gt;cp. Trondhjem (2009) p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''qia-sima-voq'' "He cried (his eyes are swollen)"
: cry-SIMA-3p/{{sc|IND}}
: ''qia-nikuu-voq'' "He cried (I was there)"
: cry-NIKUU-3p/{{sc|IND}}&lt;ref name="Trondhjem 2009 p. 179" /&gt;

In the written language&lt;ref name="Fortescue 1984 p. 273" /&gt; and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, ''sima'' and ''nikuu'' can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Trondhjem (2009) pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.

Just as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense, the language also does not have a future tense. Rather, it employs three different strategies to express future meaning:
* suffixes denoting cognitive states that show an attitude about prospective actions.
: e.g. ''Ilimaga-ara aasaq manna Dudley qujanar-tor-si-ffigi-ssa-llugu'' "I expect to get some fun out of Dudley this summer."
:: expect-I/3p/{{sc|IND}} summer this Dudley be.fun-cn-get.from-expect-CONTEMPORATIVE/3p
* inchoative suffixes creating telic actions which can then be understood as already having begun by virtue of the indicative mood.
: e.g. ''Aggiuti-ler-para'' "I've started to bring him."
:: bring-begin-I/3p/{{sc|IND}}
* moods that mark the speech act as a request or wish.&lt;ref&gt;cp. Bittner (2005) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
: e.g. ''Qimmi-t nirukkar-niar-nigik'' "Let us feed the dogs, ok?"&lt;ref&gt;Bittner (2005) pp. 12–13; translation of 15 altered. Glosses standardised to the system used in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;
:: dog-{{sc|PL}} feed-please-we/them/{{sc|IMP}}

While the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix ''-ssa'' and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trondhjem (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described.&lt;ref&gt;Bittner (2005) pp. 11, 38–43&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Noun incorporation ====
There is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has [[noun incorporation]]. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of [[morpheme]]s that require a noun root as their host and which form [[complex predicate]]s that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses.&lt;ref name="Sadock 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadock (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadock(1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadock (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulba.sdsu.edu/~malouf/papers/greenlandic.pdf|title=Malouf (1999)|author=|date=|website=sdsu.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Geenhoven (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Mithun "Polysynthesis in the Arctic" in Mahieu and Tersis (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mithun (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosen (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.

''qimmeq'' "dog" + ''-qar- "have" (+ ''-poq'' "3p")
: ''qimme-qar-poq'' "She has a dog"

''illu'' "house" + -'lior''- "make"
: ''illu-lior-poq'' "She builds a house"

''kaffi'' "coffee" + -''sor''- "drink/eat"
: kaffi-sor-poq "She drinks coffee"

''puisi'' "seal" + -''nniar''- "hunt"
: puisi-nniar-poq "She hunts seal"

''allagaq'' "letter" + -''si''- "receive"
: allagar-si-voq "She has received a letter"

''anaana'' "mother" + -''a''- "to be"
: anaana-a-voq "She is a mother"

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1984) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Case and number are marked by a single suffix. Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes, e.g. ''atuar''- "to read" + -''fik'' "place" becomes ''atuarfik'' "school" and ''atuarfik'' + -''tsialak'' "something good" becomes ''atuarfitsialak'' "good school".

The fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Sadock (2003) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example the suffix with the shape -aa means "his/hers/its" when suffixed to a noun, but "him/her/it" when suffixed to a verb, likewise the suffix -ra either means "my" or "me" depending on whether it is suffixed on a verb or a noun.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pronouns ====
There are personal pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects, but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue (1984) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 200px; height: 200px;"

| uanga || uagut
|-

| illit || ilissi
|-
! scope="row" | Third person

|}

Personal pronouns are, however, necessary in the oblique case:

: ilin-nut  niri-qu-aa
: thou all. eat tell-to 3s-3s-indic.
: 'He told you to eat it'

==== Case ====
The two grammatical core cases ergative and absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases. The oblique cases express information related to movement and manner.

The [[instrumental case]] is versatile. It is used for the instrument with which an action is carried out, for oblique objects of intransitive verbs (also called [[antipassive]] verbs)&lt;ref name="Sadock 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kappel Schmidt (2003) passim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bittner (1987) passim&lt;/ref&gt; and for secondary objects of transitive verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

: coffee-{{sc|INSTR}} drink-usually-3p

: ''Piitaq savim-mik tuni-vara'' "I gave Peter a knife"
: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} knife-{{sc|INSTR}} give-I/3p

It is also used to express the meaning of "give me" and for forming adverbs from nouns:
: ''imer-mik''! "(give me) water"
: water-{{sc|INSTR}}

: ''sivisuu-mik sinip-poq'' "He slept late"
: late-{{sc|INSTR}} sleep-3p

The [[allative case]] describes movement towards something.&lt;ref name="BjornumCase"&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p.74&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''illu-mut'' "towards the house"

It is also used with numerals and the question word ''qassit'' to express the time of the clock, and in the meaning "amount per unit":
: ''qassi-nut? – pingasu-nut''. "When?" – "At three o'clock"
: when-{{sc|ALL}} three-{{sc|ALL}}

: ''kiilu-mut tivi krone-qar-poq'' "It costs 20 crowns per kilo"
: kilo-{{sc|ALL}} twenty crown-have-3p

The locative case describes spatial location:&lt;ref name="BjornumCase" /&gt;
: ''illu-mi'' "in the house"

The [[ablative case]] describes movement away from something or the source of something:&lt;ref name="BjornumCase" /&gt;

: ''Rasmussi-mit allagarsi-voq'' "He got a letter from Rasmus"
: Rasmus-{{sc|ABL}} receive.letter-3p

: ''tuttu-mit nassuk'' " (antler)horn from a rein-deer"
: rein.deer-{{sc|ABL}} horn

The [[prosecutive case]] describes movement through something as well as the medium of writing or a location on the body. It is also used to describe a group of people such as a family as belonging to the modified noun.&lt;ref name="BjornumCase2"&gt;Bjørnum (2003) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''matu-kkut iser-poq'' "He entered through the door"
: door-{{sc|PROS}} enter-3p

: where-{{sc|PROS}} hit-3p/YOU

: ''palasi-kkut'' "the priest and his family"
: priest-{{sc|PROS}}

The [[equative case]] describes similarity of manner or quality. It is also used for deriving language names from nouns denoting nationalities, i.e. "like a person of x nationality [speaks]".&lt;ref name="BjornumCase2" /&gt;
: ''nakorsatut suli-sar-poq'' "he works as a doctor"

In Greenlandic [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] is marked on the noun which agrees with the person and number of its possessor. The possessor is in the ergative case. There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørnum (2003)  p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Table 4 gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of ''illu'' "house". Below are given examples of the use of the possessive inflection, the use of the ergative case for possessors and the use of fourth person possessors.

: ''Anda-p illu-a'' "Anda's house"
: Anda-{{sc|ERG}} house-3p/{{sc|POSS}}

: ''Anda-p illu-ni taku-aa'' "Anda sees his own house"
: Anda-{{sc|ERG}} house-4p/{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p

== Vocabulary ==
[[File:Ilimmarfik.jpg|thumb|The orthography and vocabulary of the Greenlandic language is governed by ''Oqaasileriffik'', the Greenlandic language secretariat, located in the ''Ilimmarfik'' university campus in [[Nuuk]].]]

Greenlandic [[vocabulary]] is mostly inherited from [[Proto-Eskimo–Aleut]], but it has also taken a large number of loans from other languages, especially from Danish. Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word ''palasi'' "priest" is a loan from the Danish "præst". But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. ''qarasaasiaq'' "computer" which literally means "artificial brain". This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt; For example the root for "tongue" ''oqaq'' is used to derive the following words:

* ''oqarpoq''          'says'
* ''oqaaseq''          'word'
* ''oqaluppoq''          'speaks'
* ''oqaasilerisoq ''  'linguist'
* ''oqaasilerissutit''  'grammar'
* ''oqaluttualiortoq''  'author'
* ''oqaasipiluuppaa''  'harangues him'
* ''oqaloqatigiinneq''   'conversation'
* ''oqaatiginerluppaa''  'speaks badly about him'

Lexical differences between dialects are often considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing [[taboo]] on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;

== Orthography ==
[[File:ĸra in a dictionary (ubt).JPG|thumb|'''[[Kra (letter)|ĸ]]''' in a Greenlandic–Danish dictionary from 1926]]Greenlandic is written with the [[Latin script]].  The alphabet:
: A E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V
To spell loanwords from other languages, especially from Danish and English, the additional letters ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', ''W'', ''Æ'', ''Ø'' and ''Å'' are used.&lt;ref&gt;Grønlands sprognævn (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petersen (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Greenlandic uses the symbols "..." and »...« as [[non-English usage of quotation marks|quotation marks]].

From 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in the alphabet invented by [[Samuel Kleinschmidt]]. This alphabet employed the special character ''[[Kra (letter)|kra]]'' ('''Κʼ / ĸ''') which was replaced by [[q]] in the 1973 reform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/greenlandic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the Kleinschmidt alphabet, long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name ''Kalaallit Nunaat'' was spelled ''Kalâdlit Nunât''. This scheme uses a [[circumflex accent]] ( ˆ ) to indicate a long vowel (''e.g.'', ''ât/ît/ût'', modern: ''aat'', ''iit'', ''uut''), an [[acute accent]] ( ´ ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (''i.e.'', ''á'', ''í'', ''ú'' modern: ''a(kk)'', ''i(kk)'', ''u(kk)'')] and, finally, a [[tilde]] ( ˜ ) or a [[grave accent]] ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates vowel length ''and'' gemination of the following consonant (''e.g.'', ''ãt'', ''ĩt'', ''ũt'' or ''àt'', ''ìt'', ''ùt'', modern: ''aatt'', ''iitt'', ''uutt''). The letters ''ê'' and ''ô'', used only before ''r'' and ''q'', are now written ''ee'' and ''oo'' in Greenlandic. The spelling system of [[Nunatsiavummiutut]], spoken in [[Nunatsiavut]] in northeastern [[Labrador]], is derived from the old Greenlandic system.

Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology: the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://giellatekno.uit.no/cgi/d-kal.eng.html|title=Programs for analysing Greenlandic|author=|date=|website=giellatekno.uit.no|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.

The '''Hodï''' (Jodï, Jotí, Hoti) language, also known as '''Yuwana''' (Yoana), '''Waruwaru''', or '''Chikano''' (Chicano), is a small [[unclassified language]] of [[Venezuela]]. Very little is known of it; its several hundred speakers are monolingual hunter-gatherers.

==Classification==
No classification of Hodï has yet been established to the satisfaction of linguists.

Attempts have been made to link Hodï with the nearby [[Piaroa–Saliban languages]]. A recent proposal classifies Hodï and (Piaroa–)Saliban as the branches of a single Jodï–Saliban [[macrofamily]].&lt;ref&gt; Labrada, Rosés; Emilio, Jorge (2015). [http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/jodi1234 "Jodi-Saliban"]. ''[[Glottolog|Glottolog 2.7]]''. Jena: Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.&lt;/ref&gt; However, similarities in vocabulary with the Piaroa–Saliban languages may in fact be due to [[sprachbund]]ing: Henley, Mattéi-Müller and Reid (1996) argue that the apparent [[cognate]]s between Hodï and Piaroa–Saliban are rather [[loanword]]s.

Limited by poor data, Henley et al. argue that Hodï may be related to the [[Nadahup languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Henley, Paul; Marie-Claude Mattéi-Müller y Howard Reid 1996. "Cultural and linguistic affinities of the foraging people of North Amazonia: a new perspective"; ''Antropológica'' 83: 3-37. Caracas.&lt;/ref&gt; The only linguist to speak Hodï and [[Piaroa language|Piaroa]], Stanford Zent, has collected more reliable data and argues that it is "probably" related to the Piaroa–Saliban languages.&lt;ref&gt;Zent S &amp; E Zent. 2008. Los Hoti, in Aborigenes de Venezuela, vol. 2, second edition [https://ivic.academia.edu/Zent/Papers/73523/Los_Jodi]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1985 a relationship to the [[Yanomaman languages]] has also been suggested, in part on the grounds that Hodï shares 20% of its vocabulary with this family,&lt;ref&gt;Migliazzi, Ernesto C. 1985. "Languages of the Orinoco-Amazon region"; H.M.Klein &amp; L. Stark (eds.): ''South American Indian Languages'': 17-139. Austin: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but this hypothesis has since been largely rejected.

==Phonology==
The first phonological analysis is Vilera (1985).&lt;ref&gt;Vilera Díaz, Diana C. 1985. "Introducción morfológica de la lengua Hoti". Thesis in Anthropology. Caracas: Universidad Central de Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huarpe''' (''Warpe'') was a small language family of central Argentina (historic [[Cuyo Province]]) that consisted of two closely related languages. They are traditionally considered dialects, and include  '''[[Allentiac language|Allentiac]]''' (Alyentiyak, Huarpe) and '''[[Millcayac language|Millcayac]]''' (Milykayak).  A third, '''Puntano''' of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]], was not documented before the languages became extinct. 

Kaufman (1994) tentatively linked Huarpe to the [[Mura-Matanawi languages]] in a family he called ''Macro-Warpean''. However, he noted that "no systematic study" had been made, so that it is best to consider them independent families. Swadesh and Suárez both connected Huarpe to [[Macro-Jibaro languages|Macro-Jibaro]], a possibility that has yet to be investigated.

== Phonology ==
The two languages had apparently similar sound systems, and were not dissimilar from Spanish, at least from the records we have. Barros (2007) reconstructs the consonants as follows:

Allentiac had at least five vowels, written ''a, e, i, o, ù''. The ''ù'' is thought to represent the central vowel {{IPAblink|ɨ}}.

The '''Indonesian Wikipedia''' ({{lang-id|{{#property:P1448}}}})&lt;ref&gt;https://id.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halaman_Utama&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://facebook.com/id.wiki/&lt;/ref&gt; is the edition of [[Wikipedia]] in the [[Indonesian language]]. The Indonesian Wikipedia is the fifth-fastest-growing Wikipedia in an Asian language after the Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Turkish language Wikipedias.
Its first article was written on May 30, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [https://id.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elektron&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history Electron History Page in Bahasa Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/r/revo-ag-soekatno/index.shtml Tokoh Indonesia: Revo AGS: Indonesian Wikipedia Contributor]&lt;/ref&gt; yet its Main Page was created six months later on November 29, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [https://id.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Halaman_Utama&amp;action=history Wikipedia Bahasa Indonesia Main Page history]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|id|N}} articles in the Indonesian Wikipedia. In April 2016, there were 462 editors who made at least five edits in that month.

==Background==

Although the Indonesian language is similar to the [[Malay language]], the Indonesian Wikipedia remains separate from the [[Malay Wikipedia]]&lt;ref name=Lihp136&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; (initiated on October 2002).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://ms.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Laman_Utama&amp;dir=prev&amp;action=history|title=Malay Wikipedia History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian and Malay Wikipedias were started separately by two different user groups within six months of each other. In 2009, [[Andrew Lih]] wrote "Because these groups are drawn on national boundaries, merging is not likely to happen soon."&lt;ref name=Lihp136/&gt;

Indonesian is a normative form of the Malay language, an Austronesian (or Malayo-Polynesian) language which had been used as a [[lingua franca]] in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries, and was elevated to the status of an official language with the [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence]] in 1945, drawing inspiration from the Sumpah Pemuda ([[Youth Pledge]]) event in 1928. It is very similar to the official Malaysian form of the language. However, it does differ from the Malaysian form in some ways, with key differences in pronunciation and vocabulary, due in large part to the many Dutch words in the Indonesian vocabulary. It is spoken as a mother tongue by only 7% of the population of Indonesia, but altogether more than 200 million people speak it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axistranslations.com/language-resources/indonesian-language.html Axis translations: Indonesian language]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Malay language]] is spoken by ethnic groups who reside in the [[Malay Peninsula]], southern [[Thailand]], parts of the [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]]. Malay is also considered one of the dialects of the Indonesian language by Indonesians living in central eastern Sumatra, the Riau Islands and parts of the coast of Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=NL Ethnologue report for Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributors==
In 2004, ''[[Tempo magazine|Tempo]]'' magazine published a feature about the Indonesian Wikipedia, in which [[Revo Soekatno]], one of its best known contributors, described it as the "Encyclopedia from the boarding houses", meaning an encyclopedia that was produced by Indonesians living and studying overseas. The article contributed to the popularization of Wikipedia in the archipelago and since then, the Indonesian Wikipedia has seen its number of users rise remarkably.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/cetak/2004/10/04/TI/mbm.20041004.TI89886.id.html Tempo Interactive (2004): Encyclopedia from boarding house] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306121553/http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/cetak/2004/10/04/TI/mbm.20041004.TI89886.id.html |date=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/cetak/2004/10/04/TI/mbm.20041004.TI89886.id.html Tempo Interactive (2004): Encyclopedia from the boarding houses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306121553/http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/cetak/2004/10/04/TI/mbm.20041004.TI89886.id.html |date=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, following [[TIME|''Time'']] featuring "You" as its person of the year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html TIME: Time's Person of the Year: You]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[KOMPAS|Kompas]]'' published a [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|feature article]] on Revo where he was called the "Father of Wikipedia in Indonesian". The article highlighted the spirit of participation as the type of "addiction to the cyberspace that needed to be endorsed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0612/26/Sosok/3187011.htm|last=Sodikin|first=Amir|work=Kompas|title=Revo, Perintis Wikipedia Indonesia|date=26 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141509/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0612/26/Sosok/3187011.htm|archivedate=29 September 2007|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Indonesian publications followed suit to refer to Revo Soekatno as an "activist that built a community portal in Indonesia" praising his contributions to the presence of Indonesia in the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://www.swa.co.id/swamajalah/tren/details.php?cid=1&amp;id=5832 SWA Magazine: Activist who built community portal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305225916/http://www.swa.co.id/swamajalah/tren/details.php?cid=1&amp;id=5832 |date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the Indonesian Wikipedia achieved the milestone of 100,000 articles. One of the contributors mentioned in the article was the user borgx, who made 80,000 edits starting in 2005. That year, the Indonesian Wikipedia had only fifty active contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://www.antara.co.id/print/?i=1235268166 Antara: Indonesian Wikipedia Now 100 Thousand Articles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226234052/http://www.antara.co.id/print/?i=1235268166 |date=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://oase.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/02/24/10472869/Wikipedia.Bahasa.Indonesia.Capai.100.Ribu.Artikel Kompas.com: Indonesian Wikipedia Reach 100 Thousand Articles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305225626/http://oase.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/02/24/10472869/Wikipedia.Bahasa.Indonesia.Capai.100.Ribu.Artikel |date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workshop and seminars===
In March 2007, [[Bina Nusantara University]] invited Indonesian Wikipedians to speak at the first Wikipedia seminar for the public and to introduce Wikipedia Bahasa Indonesia and Wikimedia Foundation projects at its campus in [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://www.sdf.or.id/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=110 Surabaya Design Forum: Invitation to attend Wikipedia Seminar held by Expmo production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306053153/http://www.sdf.or.id/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=110 |date=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the Indonesian Government, through its Department of Communication and Information, decided to establish an annual Indonesian ICT Award and invited the Indonesian Wikipedia Community to hold a workshop on how to write Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://fti.bl.ac.id/2007/11/16/info-seminar-lokakarya-menulis-di-internet/ Information Technology Faculty Information for Seminar and Workshop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213045826/http://fti.bl.ac.id/2007/11/16/info-seminar-lokakarya-menulis-di-internet/ |date=2009-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://fti.bl.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/undangan.jpg Invitation for Workshop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225234433/http://fti.bl.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/undangan.jpg |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Lanin]], one of the speakers interviewed by [[Antara (news agency)|Antara]], stated that the number of contributors to the Indonesian Wikipedia was rising, and the articles were beginning to become more diverse. According to Revo's speech, the challenge for the Indonesian Wikipedia in the future was to gain credibility and give the public assurance about the quality of the content provided.

The first day of the workshop was attended by 40 people, although the number of computers provided for hands-on practice was considerably less than the number of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://www.antara.co.id/arc/2007/11/20/wikipedia-indonesia-terbesar-ketiga-di-asia/ Antara: Indonesian Wikipedia the Third Largest in Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104112344/http://www.antara.co.id/arc/2007/11/20/wikipedia-indonesia-terbesar-ketiga-di-asia/ |date=2008-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, at the 2008 Indonesian ICT Awards, the Indonesian Wikipedia Community held separate workshop sessions for the public and for organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://www.inaicta.web.id/2008/07/23/menulis-di-wikipedia-untuk-organisasi/ INAICTA official page: National Rise Though Digital Creativity - Invitation for organizations to write in the Wikipedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229020259/http://www.inaicta.web.id/2008/07/23/menulis-di-wikipedia-untuk-organisasi/ |date=2008-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesian Wikipedia DVD==
[[Image:Eco Friendly DVD.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Indonesian Wikipedia Complimentary DVD distributed by ''Chip'' magazine on their August 2008 edition]]

In August 2008, the Indonesian version of ''[[CHIP (magazine)|CHIP]]'' magazine distributed a [[Free of charge|complimentary]] DVD containing more than 80,000 articles (without images) with its 11th anniversary edition. This edition also featured a three-page Wikipedia article titled "Wikipedia: When one thousand brains are better than one". The article provided an extensive history of Wikipedia, including the Indonesian Wikipedia, as well as a description of the Wikimedia Indonesia chapter, which was in preparation at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://forum.chip.co.id/images/chip/Daftar_Isi_CHIP_08_2008.pdf Content page for ''Chip'' August 08 Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65ckGb5Wo?url=http://forum.chip.co.id/images/chip/Daftar_Isi_CHIP_08_2008.pdf |date=2012-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a DVD version of the Indonesian Wikipedia with photos was already in existence since April 2008 and could be purchased online from an independent vendor for 20 thousand rupiah, around US$2.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://toko.baliwae.com/product_info.php?products_id=843 Wikipedia Indonesia DVD sold by Toko Baliwae]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation''''' is an influential [[computer science]] textbook by [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] on [[formal language]]s and the [[theory of computation]].  [[Rajeev Motwani]] contributed to the 2000, and later, edition.

== Nickname ==
Among experts also known as the '''''Cinderella Book'''''.  This nickname  is derived from a girl (putatively [[Cinderella]]) on the cover with a [[Rube Goldberg machine]].

== Edition history and reception ==
The forerunner of this book appeared under the title '''''Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata''''' in 1968. Forming a basis both for the creation of courses on the topic, as well as for further research, that book shaped the field of [[automata theory]] for over a decade, cf. (Hopcroft 1989).

[[File:Hopcroft-ullman-old.jpg|thumb|left|''Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata'' appeared in 1968, with an inornate cover.]]

The first edition of ''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation'' was published in 1979, the second edition in November 2000, and the third edition appeared in February 2006. Since the second edition, [[Rajeev Motwani]] has joined Hopcroft and Ullman as third author. 
Starting with the second edition, the book features extended coverage of examples where [[automata theory]] is applied, whereas large parts of more advanced theory were taken out. While this makes the second and third editions more accessible to beginners, it makes it less suited for more advanced courses. The new bias away from theory is not seen positive by all: As [[Jeffrey Shallit|Shallit]] quotes one professor, "they have removed all good parts." (Shallit 2008).

The first edition in turn constituted a major revision of a previous textbook also written by Hopcroft and Ullman, entitled ''Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata''. It was published in 1968 and is referred to in the introduction of the 1979 edition. 
In a personal historical note regarding the 1968 book, Hopcroft states: "Perhaps the success of the book came from our efforts to present the essence of each proof before actually giving the proof" (Hopcroft 1989). Compared with the forerunner book, the 1979 edition was expanded, and the material was reworked to make it more accessible to students, cf. (Hopcroft 1989).
This gearing towards understandability at the price of succinctness was not seen positive by all. As Hopcroft reports on feedback to the overhauled 1979 edition: "It seems that our attempts to lower the level of our presentation for the benefit of students by including more detail and explanations had an adverse effect on the faculty, who then had to sift through the added material to outline and prepare their lectures" (Hopcroft 1989).

Still, the most cited edition of the book is apparently the 1979 edition: According to the website [[CiteSeerX]], 
over 3000 scientific papers freely available online cite this edition of the book (CiteSeerX, 2009).

The '''Jarai language''' (in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] Cho-Rai, Chor, Chrai, Djarai, Gia-Rai, Gio-Rai, Jorai or Mthur; in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] ភាសាចារ៉ាយ - Pheasaea Chrai) is a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] language spoken by the [[Jarai people]] of [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]].  The speakers of Jarai number approximately 262,800&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Gary F. and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2017. Jarai. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Twentieth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Link retrieved on 05.06.17 from https://www.ethnologue.com/language/jra&lt;/ref&gt; without counting other possible Jarai communities in countries different to Vietnam and Cambodia such as United States of America.  They are the largest of the upland ethnic groups of Vietnam's [[Tay Nguyen|Central Highlands]] known as [[Degar]] or Montagnards and the 25% of the population in the Cambodian province of [[Ratanakiri]].

The language is in the [[Chamic languages|Chamic]] subgroup of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, and is thus related to the [[Cham language]] of central Vietnam.

A number of Jarai also live in the United States, having resettled there following the [[Vietnam War]].

== Classification ==

The Jarai language has been classified since 1864 as a Western [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] [[Malayic]], [[Achinese language|Achinese]]-[[Chamic]], Chamic, South, Plateau identified by M. Fontaine as related to the languages of the Thiames ([[Cham language|Cham]]s) and [[Rade language|Rade]] of the ancient kingdom of [[Champa]], today the province of [[Annam (province)|Annam]].&lt;ref&gt;David Thomas (1989). A 19th century perception of Chamic relationships. Mahidol University and Summer Institute of Linguistics. Link retrieved on 05.01.2017 from http://sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/16-17:181-182.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution and dialects ==

Jarai is spoken by some 262,800 people in Cambodia and Vietnam (Simons, 2017) where it is recognized as an official minority language, although in Cambodia it has not its own writing in the [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer scripts]]. Additionally there are some hundreds of Jarai speakers in United States from the Jarai refugees settled in that country after the [[Vietnamese War]]. Jarai dialects can be mutually unintelligible. Đào Huy Quyền (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Đào Huy Quyền (1998). ''Nhạc khí dân tộc Jrai và Bahnar [Musical instruments of the Jrai and Bahnar]''. Hanoi: Nhà xuất bản trẻ.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following subgroups of Jarai [[dialect]]s and their respective locations.

*'''Jarai [[Pleiku]]''': in the [[Pleiku]] area.
*'''Jarai Cheoreo''': in AJunPa (Phú Bổn).
*'''Jarai ARáp''': in northwestern [[Pleiku]], southwestern [[Kon Tum Province|Kon Tum]].
*'''Jarai H’dRung''': in northeastern [[Pleiku]], southeastern [[Kon Tum Province|Kon Tum]].
*'''Jarai Tbuan''': western [[Pleiku]].

Other related groups include:

*'''HRoi''': in western [[Phú Yên Province|Phú Yên]], southern [[Bình Định Province|Bình Định]]. Mixed Ede and Jarai people.
*'''M’dhur''': in southern [[Phú Yên Province|Phú Yên]]. Mixed Ede and Jarai people.
*'''[[Halang language|Hàlang]]''': in southwestern [[Kon Tum Province|Kon Tum]], and some in Laos and Cambodia. Mixed Sedang and Jarai people.

== Phonology ==

Influenced by the surrounding [[Mon–Khmer languages]], words of the various [[Chamic languages]] of Southeast Asia, including Jarai, have become disyllabic with the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] on the second syllable. Additionally, Jarai has further evolved in the pattern of Mon–Khmer, losing almost all vowel distinction in the initial syllable.  While trisyllabic words do exist, they are all [[loanwords]].  The typical Jarai word may be represented:

:(C)(V)-C(C)V(V)(C)

where the values in parentheses are optional and "(C)" in the cluster "C(C)" represents a [[liquid consonant]] {{IPA|/l/, /r/}} or a [[semivowel]] {{IPA|/w/, /j/}}. In Jarai dialects spoken in Cambodia, the "(C)" in the cluster "C(C)" can also be the [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, a phoneme used by the Jarai in Cambodia, but not attested in Vietnam. The vowel of the first syllable in disyllabic words is most often the [[mid-central unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|/ə/}}, unless the initial consonant is the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}.  The second vowel of the stressed syllable produces a [[diphthong]].

=== Alphabet ===

During the [[French Indochina]], they introduced a Jarai alphabet using the [[Vietnamese alphabet]] at the beginning of the 20th century. With the introduction of the [[Bible]] in Jarai language, using that alphabet by Christian missionaries in Vietnam after the Vietnamese War, the Jarai increased their literacy and there are today many publications for the Vietnamese Jarai. There are 40 [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] - 21 [[consonant]]s + 19 [[vowel]]s / 34 [[phoneme]]s - 9 vowel phonemes + 25 consonant phonemes.

== Career ==

Bhagawan acquired a post-graduate degree in English language from [[University of Mysore]].&lt;ref name="Dutt1999"/&gt; As a professor, he taught English at [[Maharaja's College, Mysore|Maharaja's College]] in [[Mysore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Misra|first1=Udit|title=On the record: Intolerance has grown… I don’t see any difference between one political party and another, says rationalist KS Bhagwan|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/on-the-record-intolerance-has-grown-i-dont-see-any-difference-between-one-political-party-and-another-says-rationalist-ks-bhagwan/|accessdate=7 September 2015|work=The Indian Express|date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he worked as a writer and translator. In 1982, his work ''Shankaracharya and Reactionary Philosophy'' (original title: ''ಶಂಕರಾಚಾರ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರತಿಗಾಮಿತನ''), a collection of essays, on how [[Adi Shankara]], an 8th-century [[Hindu]] theologian, advocated the caste system strongly, destroyed Buddhist viharas and was against education for women, [[shudras]] and [[dalit]]s, was published.&lt;ref name="Dutt1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof K S Bhagwan|title=You can attack us but our works will live on: Prof KS Bhagwan|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-can-attack-us-but-our-works-will-live-on-prof-ks-bhagwan/article1-1386415.aspx|publisher=Hindustan Times|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with criticism from right-wing [[Hindu]] groups who issued threats to his life. His other books in Kannada include ''Badalaavane'', ''Antarya'' and ''Kuvempu Yuga''. As a translator, he translated popular works of [[William Shakespeare]] to Kannada. It includes ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'' as ''Venisina Vartaka'', and others such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''..

Bhagawan was chosen for the [[Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award]] for Lifetime Achievement for the year 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=K.S. Bhagawan, four others chosen for Sahitya Academy award|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ks-bhagawan-four-others-chosen-for-sahitya-academy-award/article7669546.ece|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=The Hindu|date=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
At an event in [[Mysore]] on 15 February 2015, Bhagawan said that he would burn certain pages of the Hindu scripture [[Bhagavad Gita]]. He said that verse 32 and 33 in chapter 9 of the scripture describes women, [[vaishya]]s and [[shudra]]s as "sinners" [paapayonaha].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will stick to my stand: Bhagwan|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/465590/will-stick-my-stand-bhagwan.html|accessdate=7 September 2015|work=Deccan Herald|date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of another Kannada writer and rationalist [[M. M. Kalburgi]] and a Bajrang Dal troll's threat that Bhagawan would be the next target for "mock[ing] Hinduism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chishti|first1=Seema|title=After MM Kalburgi, tweet names next target: K S Bhagwan|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/after-mm-kalburgi-tweet-names-next-target-k-s-bhagwan/|accessdate=7 September 2015|work=The Indian Express|issue=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the security at Bhagwan's residence was tightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police security for writer K.S.

== Person ==

In Kokborok grammar use of the notion of [[Grammatical person|'person']] is almost absent; the form of verb is same for one who speaks, one who is spoken to, and one who is spoken about.

== Number ==

In Kokborok there are two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: Singular and plural. The plural marker is used at the end of the noun or pronoun. There are two plural markers: ''rok'' and ''song''. ''Rok'' is universally used while ''song'' is used with human nouns only.
The plural marker is normally used at the end of the noun or pronoun. But when the noun has an adjective the plural marker is used at the end of the adjective instead of the noun.

Examples:

* ''Bwrwirok Teliamura o thangnai''. These women will go to Teliamura.
* ''O bwrwi naithokrok kaham rwchabo''. These beautiful women sing very well.

== Gender ==

In Kokborok there are four [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine gender, feminine gender, common gender, and neuter gender. Words which denote male are masculine, words which denote female are feminine, words which can be both male and female are common gender, and words which cannot be either masculine or feminine and neuter gender.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ Gender examples
| ''borok'' || man - masculine
|-
| ''bwrwi'' || woman - feminine
|-
| ''chwrai'' || child - common
|-
| ''buphang'' || tree - neuter
|}

There are various ways to change genders of words:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ Using different words
| ''bwsai'' || husband || ''bihik'' || wife
|-
| ''phayung'' || brother || ''hanok'' || sister
|-
| ''kiching'' || male friend || ''mare'' || female friend
|}

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ Adding ''in'' at the end of the masculine word
| ''sikla'' || young man || ''sikli'' || young woman
|-
| ''achu'' || grandfather || ''achui'' || grandmother
|-
| colspan="4" | When the masculine words ends in ''a'', the ''a'' is dropped.
|}

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ Adding ''jwk'' at the end of the masculine word
| ''bwsa'' || son || ''bwsajwk'' || daughter
|-
| ''kwra'' || father-in-law || ''kwrajwk'' || mother-in-law
|}

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ Words of common gender are made masculine by adding suffixes, like ''sa'', ''chwla/la'', ''jua'' and feminine by adding ''ma'', ''jwk'', ''bwrwi''
| ''pun'' || goat || ''punjua'' || he goat || ''punjwk'' || she goat
|-
| ''tok'' || fowl || ''tokla'' || cock || ''tokma'' || hen
|-
| ''takhum'' || swan || ''takhumchwla'' || drake || ''takhumbwrwi'' || duck
|}

== Case and case endings ==

In Kokborok there are the nominative, accusative, instrumental, ablative, locative and possessive [[Grammatical case|cases]].

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ Case suffixes
| [[Nominative]] || ''o''
|-
| [[Accusative]] || ''no''
|-
| [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]] || ''bai''
|-
| [[Ablative]] || ''ni''
|-
| [[Locative]] || ''o''
|-
| [[Possessive case|Possessive]] || ''ni''
|}

These case suffixes are used at the end of the noun/pronoun and there is no change in the form of the noun.

== Adjective ==

In Kokborok the [[adjective]]s come after the words they qualify. This rule is strictly followed only in the case of native adjectives. In case of loan adjectives the rule is rather loose. Kokborok adjectives may be divided into four classes:

# pure adjectives
# compound adjectives
# verbal adjectives
# K-adjectives

The first three classes may include both native and loan words. The fourth class is made of purely native words.
e.g.:

# ''hilik'' - heavy, ''heleng'' - light
# ''bwkha kotor'' - (heart big) - brave, ''bwkha kusu'' - (heart small) - timid
# ''leng'' - tire, ''lengjak'' - tired, ''ruk'' - to boil, ''rukjak'' - boiled.
# ''kaham'' - good, ''kotor'' - big, ''kisi'' - wet.

== Numerals ==

Kokborok [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s are both [[decimal]] and [[vigesimal]].
''sa, nwi, tham, brwi, ba, dok, sni, char, chuku, chi''

''rasa'' - hundred, ''saisa'' - thousand, ''rwjag'' - a [[lakh]]

A numeral is organised as:

: ''chisa'' = ''chi'' + ''sa'' = ten + one = 11.

'''Kuvale''' is a southern [[Bantu language]] spoken in Angola, in the middle of a large [[Umbundu language|Umbundu]] -speaking area. It has traditionally been considered a dialect of [[Herero language|Herero]]; however, Maho (2009) has moved it from Bantu Zone R.30 to Zone R.10, which includes Umbundu and a few smaller languages.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt; Ngendelengo may be a distinct language.

'''Marching fire''', also known as '''walking fire''', is a [[military tactic]]; a form of [[suppressive fire]] used during an [[infantry]] assault or [[combined arms]] assault. Advancing units fire their weapons without stopping to aim, in an attempt to [[Pinned down|pin down]] enemy defenders. Marching fire usually ends with an infantry [[Charge (warfare)|charge]] to engage the enemy in [[hand-to-hand combat|close combat]]. The tactic requires ample ammunition and rapid-fire weapons. It differs from [[fire and movement]] in that the attacking force advances in unison rather than [[Leapfrogging (infantry)|leapfrogging]] forward in alternating groups.

An early form of marching fire was used with little success by Prussian troops at the end of the 18th century, then victoriously in the 1866 [[Battle of Königgrätz]] because of the fast-firing [[Dreyse needle gun]]. The modern form of marching fire evolved in the early 20th century from a [[French Army]] infantry assault concept which suggested the use of suppressive fire from a [[light machine gun]] carried by one man—the [[Chauchat]] automatic rifle. The tactic was employed to a limited degree in [[World War I]] then further codified with the introduction of the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] and described in U.S. [[Individual Movement Techniques|small unit infantry tactics]] manuals in the early 1920s. As a combined arms stratagem, the tactic was prominently advocated and utilized by General [[George S. Patton]] in [[World War II]] during his command of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]].

Infantry alone may be insufficient to suppress a well-positioned, well-armed and resolute enemy, especially during the final charge phase. To augment marching fire, supporting forces including heavy weapons teams and armored units may be halted in static positions to maintain suppressive fire throughout the final charge of friendly troops.

==History==
The French military tactician [[Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert]], wrote dismissively about a Prussian tactic he called "marching fire".&lt;ref name=Picq&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7y4uAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA237 |page=237 |title=Battle studies: ancient and modern battle |last=Du Picq |first=Charles Jean Jacques Joseph Ardant |year=1921 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century he witnessed a [[Prussian Army]] maneuver in which advancing troops formed themselves into a [[Line (formation)|battle line]] of two ranks. In alternating fashion, one rank fired their weapons at a [[Military step|slow march]] while the other group reloaded then advanced on the double. The Prussians called this tactic "fire in advancing" (''Feuer im Vormarsch'') and trained in it at the level of platoon, company and battalion. Guibert considered it "ill advised", with the line's progress across the field seen as too slow, exposing the troops for too long to defensive fire.&lt;ref name=Picq/&gt;

[[File:Needle Gun.jpg|frame|left|[[Dreyse needle gun]]]]
The first successful employment of marching fire may be traced to the fast-firing [[Dreyse needle gun]] used by Prussian troops in the mid-19th century. This new breech-loading gun was 2–3 times faster than contemporary muzzle-loading guns, and its lightweight [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] allowed the infantryman to carry more ammunition. A major disadvantage was that escaping hot gases from the breech would strike the face of any trooper who took careful aim. Accordingly, the weapon was often fired while being held away from the face with the result that marksmanship was inferior. In 1866, Prussians were successful in advancing quickly while firing their needle guns in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]]; the decisive battle of the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. Soon, though, the increased use of rapid-fire guns by defending troops neutralized the advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.military-history.us/2010/11/the-dreyse-needle-gun-technology-continued/ |last=Shrier |first=Patrick |title=The Dreyse Needle Gun |date=November 9, 2010 |work=Patrick's Military History &amp; History Blog |accessdate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:Corporal, East Surrey Regiment 1940.jpg|thumb|left|A British soldier demonstrates proper marching fire technique using a [[Thompson submachine gun]] with a 50-round [[drum magazine]]]]

In 1903, French military theorists noticed that the [[Heavy machine gun|machine gun]]s of the day, heavy and relatively immobile, were of little use in infantry assaults. They determined that "the machine gun must learn to walk".&lt;ref name=Chauchat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitrailleuse.fr/France/Chauchat/Chauchat.htm |language=French |title=Fusil mitrailleur Chauchat. FM modèle 1915 C.S.R.G. |work=Les mitrailleuses du premier conflit mondial |publisher=mitrailleuse.fr |year=2003 |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A marching fire tactic (French: ''feu de marche'') was expected to involve incidental suppressive fire, with the advancing troops considered a deadlier threat than the unaimed bullets, causing the enemy to fall back. The prototype guns were not approved for production, and none were in service when [[World War I]] began.&lt;ref name=Chauchat/&gt; At the start of hostilities, France quickly turned an existing prototype ( the "CS" for Chauchat and Sutter ) into the lightweight [[Chauchat|Chauchat M1915]] automatic rifle with a high [[rate of fire]]. The [[French Army]] was equipped with it, and the first American units to arrive in France used it in 1917 and 1918. Hastily mass manufactured under desperate wartime pressures, the weapon was prone to jamming and overheating.&lt;ref name=TrenchWarfare&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sXCn3WrINjwC&amp;pg=PA31 |pages=31–32 |title=World War I Trench Warfare (1916–1918) |last1=Bull |first1=Stephen |last2=Hook |first2=Adam |publisher=Osprey |year=2002 |isbn=1-84176-198-2 |series=Elite |volume=84 |edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the potential of such a gun, the British Army settled upon the American-designed [[Lewis gun]] fitted for a {{convert|.303|in|adj=on}} round; infantry platoons provided with the guns were instructed in [[fire and movement]] tactics. Soon, the gun was seen to be useful in marching fire assaults, notably by the [[Australian Corps]] in the July 1918 [[Battle of Hamel]].&lt;ref name=TrenchWarfare/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sheffield&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tZK2eEqM_gC&amp;pg=PA250 |page=250 |title=War on the Western Front |last=Sheffield |first=G.D. |publisher=Osprey |year=2007 |isbn=1-84603-210-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To serve the same purpose, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] adopted the [[MG 08#MG08/15|MG08/15]] which was impractically heavy at {{convert|48.5|lb|kg|0}} counting the water for cooling and one [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] holding 100 rounds.&lt;ref name=Sheffield/&gt;

In 1918 the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR) was introduced in the US Army, and with the {{convert|15.5|lb|kg|0|adj=on}} weapon came new field tactics including marching fire. The BAR's shoulder sling was to be adjusted in length to allow the butt of the weapon to be held firmly at the side of the torso just above the hips, with one hand at the trigger and the other hand aiming. A recommended rate of fire was one round per footstep, with eyes kept on the target and the weapon aimed low at first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0E9IAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA280 |page=280 |title=Military science and tactics |year=1920 |volume=2 |last=Persons |first=William Ernest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactic was to be employed under conditions of limited field of fire and poor visibility such as advancing through woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCUgAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA535 |pages=534–535 |work=The Military Engineer |title=Does the Present Automatic Rifle Meet the Needs of the Rifleman? |last=Blain |first=W.A. |date=November–December 1921 |volume=12–13 |publisher=Society of American Military Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the [[U.S. Navy]] instructed its landing forces (usually [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]) that marching fire with a BAR was to be used in very limited circumstances, such as when the enemy line was clearly defined and the range was less than {{convert|200|yd}}. Marching fire was not usually employed in the open and was more appropriate in dense woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOD1xJwL2rcC&amp;pg=PA447 |page=447 |title=Landing-Force Manual: United States Navy |year=1921 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]] (ROTC) handbook of 1921 included a description of marching fire as an assault tactic in which the BAR men walk and shoot from the hip with the weapon's weight supported on a shoulder sling, but the accompanying riflemen were expected to halt and carefully aim each of their shots, firing from the shoulder, from a standing or kneeling position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=holCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154 |page=154 |title=The R. O. T. C. manual: a text book for the Reserve Officers Training Corps |year=1921 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins press |edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychological value of marching fire was quickly recognized. Marching fire was seen as a boost to the morale of the assault troops. It was hoped that enemy troops would lose courage if they heard bullets flying around them, if they believed that their position was known to the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Infantry Journal |year=1920 |volume=16.2 |publisher=United States Infantry Association |page=1005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:GeorgeSPatton.jpg|left|thumb|upright|General [[George S. Patton]] in 1943]]
The tactic of marching fire was praised by General [[George S. Patton]] for three reasons: friendly forces using the tactic continued to advance rather than get bogged down, the positive action of shooting provided self-confidence to the soldier, and the enemy's defensive fire was reduced in accuracy, volume and effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Patton&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2A4BPpDQTfcC&amp;pg=PA339 |page=339 |title=War As I Knew It |last1=Patton |first1=George Smith |last2=Harkins |first2=Paul Donal |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=1995 |isbn=0-395-73529-7}} First published in 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGbkHUePtVwC&amp;pg=PA363 |page=363 |title=The soul of battle: from ancient times to the present day, how three great liberators vanquished tyranny |last=Hanson |first=Victor Davis |year=1999 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-684-84502-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patton recommended that the rifleman carrying "that magnificent weapon", the [[M1 Garand]] rifle, should fire his weapon every two or three paces, holding the weapon at his shoulder if desired, but a lower position between the belt and armpit was "just as effective".&lt;ref name=Patton/&gt; Patton advised his 81&amp;nbsp;mm [[M1 mortar]] teams to stay in one place during the assault and apply steady fire, but his smaller 60&amp;nbsp;mm [[M2 mortar]]s should alternately fire and leapfrog forward. Light machine guns could be simultaneously carried and fired by one man while another man fed the ammo belt.&lt;ref name=Patton/&gt; Patton wrote that the main purpose of the tank was to attack infantry in defensive positions rather than other tanks. He instructed his tanks and other armored units to advance with marching fire in support of the infantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pattonhq.com/pdffiles/vintagetext.pdf |title=Military Essays and Articles |last=Patton |first=George S., Jr |editor=Charles M.

[[File:Australian assault on pillbox, January 1943, Papua, Giropa Point.jpg|thumb|right|Australian troops advance against a Japanese pillbox in 1943, supported by an [[M3 Stuart]] tank]]
General [[William E. DePuy]], who rose from junior staff officer to battalion commander in the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] between 1942 and 1945, evaluated the efficacy of unsupported marching fire and found it lacking. Writing after the war, DePuy said that marching fire became a fad, in some American units almost the sole form of attack. DePuy noted that when it was employed against Germans who were "well hidden and in very good positions"—as they usually were—the attackers walked into the enemy's [[kill zone]].&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQGFChkQZ2gC&amp;pg=PA92 |pages=92–93 |last=Parker |first=Danny S. |title=Battle of the Bulge: Hitler's Ardennes Offensive, 1944–1945 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-306-81391-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; DePuy said that if maneuvering infantry alone performed marching fire, the moment when enemy suppression was most needed it would cease during the final charge at which time "the enemy then comes up out of his foxholes and starts to fire at you."&lt;ref name=Gole&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YESvFkBEYEC&amp;pg=PT40 |page=40 |last=Gole |first=Henry G. |title=General William E.

This impairment is classified by deficiencies in expressive and receptive language development that is not attributed to sensory deficits, nonverbal intellectual deficits, a neurological condition, environmental deprivation or psychiatric impairments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/070674370304800907 |title=Behaviour in Children with Language Development Disorders |journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=607–14 |year=2016 |last1=Willinger |first1=Ulrike |last2=Brunner |first2=Esther |last3=Diendorfer-Radner |first3=Gabriele |last4=Sams |first4=Judith |last5=Sirsch |first5=Ulrike |last6=Eisenwort |first6=Brigitte }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2007.10.015 |pmid=18304666 |title=Auditory evoked fields predict language ability and impairment in children |journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=170–5 |year=2008 |last1=Oram Cardy |first1=Janis E |last2=Flagg |first2=Elissa J |last3=Roberts |first3=Wendy |last4=Roberts |first4=Timothy P.L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research illustrates that 2% to 4% of 5 year olds have mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. This distinction is made when children have issues in expressive language skills, the production of language, and when children also have issues in receptive language skills, the understanding of language. Those with mixed receptive-language disorder have a  normal left-right anatomical asymmetry of the planum temporale and parietale. This is attributed to a reduced left hemisphere functional specialization for language. Taken from a measure of cerebral blood flow (SPECT) in phonemic discrimination tasks, children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder do not exhibit the expected predominant left hemisphere activation.&lt;ref name=pmid15714898&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70890-6 |pmid=15714898 |title=Hemispheric Specialization for Language in Children with Different Types of Specific Language Impairment |journal=Cortex |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=157–67 |year=2005 |last1=Pecini |first1=C |last2=Casalini |first2=C |last3=Brizzolara |first3=D |last4=Cipriani |first4=P |last5=Pfanner |first5=L |last6=Chilosi |first6=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder is also known as receptive-expressive language impairment (RELI) or receptive language disorder.&lt;ref name=pmid20813021&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2010.03750.x |pmid=20813021 |title=Intervention for mixed receptive-expressive language impairment: A review |journal=Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology |volume=52 |issue=11 |pages=994–9 |year=2010 |last1=Boyle |first1=James |last2=McCartney |first2=Elspeth |last3=o'Hare |first3=Anne |last4=Law |first4=James }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Classification==
If assessed on the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]], for instance, symptoms of mixed receptive-expressive language disorder may show as relatively low scores for Information, Vocabulary and Comprehension (perhaps below the 25th percentile). If a person has difficulty with specific types of concepts, for example spatial terms, such as 'over', 'under', 'here' and 'there', they may also have difficulties with arithmetic, understanding word problems and instructions, or difficulties using words at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.014 |pmid=17543904 |title=Language Disorders in Children: Classification and Clinical Syndromes |journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=437–67, v |year=2007 |last1=Simms |first1=Mark D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They may also have a more general problem with words or sentences, both comprehension and orally. Some children will have issues with pragmatics - the use of language in social contexts as well; and therefore, will have difficulty with inferring meaning. Furthermore, they have severe impairment of spontaneous language production and for this reason, they have difficulty in formulating questions.&lt;ref name=pmid15714898/&gt; Generally, children will have trouble with morphosyntax, which is word inflections. These children have difficulty understanding and applying grammatical rules, such as endings that mark verb tenses (e.g. -''ed''), third-person singular verbs (e.g. I ''think'', he ''thinks''), plurals (e.g. -''s''), auxiliary verbs that denote tenses (e.g. ''was'' running, ''is'' running), and with determiners (''the, a''). Moreover, children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorders have deficits in completing two cognitive operations at the same time and learning new words or morphemes under time pressure or when processing demands are high. These children also have auditory processing deficits in which they process auditory information at a slower rate and as a result, require more time for processing.&lt;ref name=pmid20813021/&gt;

==Related Disorders==
Studies show that low receptive and expressive language at young ages was correlated to increased autism symptom severity in children in their early school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2011.09.003 |pmid=22093662 |title=Language and communication skills in preschool children with autism spectrum disorders: Contribution of cognition, severity of autism symptoms, and adaptive functioning to the variability |journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=172–80 |year=2012 |last1=Kjellmer |first1=Liselotte |last2=Hedvall |first2=Åsa |last3=Fernell |first3=Elisabeth |last4=Gillberg |first4=Christopher |last5=Norrelgen |first5=Fritjof }}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a chart depicting language deficits of children on the Autistic Spectrum. This table indicates the lower levels of language processing, receptive/expressive disorders, which is more severe in children with autism. When autistic children speak, they are often difficult to understand, their language is sparse and dysfluent, they speak in single, uninflected words or short phrases, and their supply of words is severely depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1071-9091(97)80024-1 |pmid=9195665 |title=Language disorders in children with autism |journal=Seminars in Pediatric Neurology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |year=1997 |last1=Rapin |first1=Isabelle |last2=Dunn |first2=Michelle }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to limited vocabulary while also having deficits in verbal short term memory.&lt;ref name=pmid18067421&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09084280701719203 |pmid=18067421 |title=Learning and Memory Performance of Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) |journal=Applied Neuropsychology |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=255–61 |year=2007 |last1=Riccio |first1=Cynthia A |last2=Cash |first2=Deborah L |last3=Cohen |first3=Morris J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Children who demonstrate deficiencies early in their speech and language development are at risk for continued speech and language issues throughout later childhood. Similarly, even if these speech and language problems have been resolved, children with early language delay are more at risk for difficulties in phonological awareness, reading, and writing throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=pmid18067421/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19011122&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0022219408326215 |pmid=19011122 |title=Using Early Standardized Language Measures to Predict Later Language and Early Reading Outcomes in Children at High Risk for Language-Learning Impairments |journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=61–75 |year=2008 |last1=Flax |first1=Judy F |last2=Realpe-Bonilla |first2=Teresa |last3=Roesler |first3=Cynthia |last4=Choudhury |first4=Naseem |last5=Benasich |first5=April }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder are often likely to have long-term implications for language development, literacy, behavior, social development, and even mental health problems.&lt;ref name=pmid20813021/&gt; If suspected of having a mixed receptive-expressive language disorder, treatment is available from a speech therapist or pathologist. Most treatments are short term, and rely upon accommodations made within the environment, in order to minimize interfering with work or school. Programs that involve intervention planning that link verbal short term memory with visual/non-verbal information may be helpful for these children.&lt;ref name=pmid18067421/&gt; In addition, approaches such as parent training for language stimulation and monitoring language through the "watch and see" method are recommended. The watch-and-see technique advises children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder who come from stable, middle-class homes without any other behavioral, medical, or hearing problems should be vigilantly monitored rather than receive intervention. It is often the case that children do not meet the eligibility criteria established through a comprehensive oral language evaluation; and as a result, are not best suited for early intervention programs and require  a different approach besides the "one size fits all" model.&lt;ref name=pmid19011122/&gt;

'''Máire Ní Chinnéide ''' (English ''Mary'' or ''Molly O'Kennedy''&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium, 29: 2009 p202 Kassandra Conley, Erin Boon, Margaret Harrison – 2011 "... were Ireland's well-known, first-wave feminists Mary Hayden and Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, and leading cultural nationalists Una Ni Fhaircheallaigh [ Agnes O'Farrelly] and the aforementioned Maire Ni Chinneide [Molly O'Kennedy]."&lt;/ref&gt;) (17 January 1879 – 25 May 1967) was an [[Irish language]] activist, playwright, first President of the [[Camogie Association]] and first woman president of [[Oireachtas na Gaeilge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moran | first = Mary | authorlink = Mary Moran (camogie) | title = A Game of Our Own: The History of Camogie | publisher = Cumann Camógaíochta | year = 2011 | location = Dublin, Ireland | pages = 460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born in [[Rathmines]] in 1879 and attended [[Muckross Park College]] and [[Royal University of Ireland|Royal University]] (later the [[National University of Ireland|NUI]]) where she was a classmate of [[Agnes O'Farrelly]], [[Helena Concannon]], and [[Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington]].

==Irish language==
She learned Irish on holiday in [[Ballyvourney]] and earned the first scholarship in Irish from the [[Royal University of Ireland|Royal University]], worth £100 a year, which was spent on visits to the Irish college in [[Ballingeary]].

She studied in the school of Old Irish established by professor [[Osborn Bergin]] and was strongly influenced by the Irish-Australian professor O'Daly. She later taught Latin through Irish at Ballingeary and became proficient in French, German, Italian and Spanish.

She spent the last £100 of her scholarship on a dowry for her marriage to Sean MacGearailt, later first Accountant General of Revenue in the [[Irish civil service]], with whom she lived originally in [[Glasnevin]] and then in [[Dalkey]].

She was a founder member of the radical Craobh an Chéitinnigh, the Keating branch of the [[Gaelic League]] (Conradh na Gaelige), composed mainly of Dublin-based Kerry people and regarded, by themselves at least, as the intellectual focus of the League.

==Camogie==
In August 1904, some six years after the establishment of the earliest women's hurling teams, the rules of camogie (then called ''camoguidheacht''), first appeared in ''Banba'', a journal produced by Craobh an Chéitinnigh. Camogie had come to public attention when it was showcased at the annual Oireachtas (Gaelic League Festival) earlier that year, and it differed from men's hurling in its use of a lighter ball and a smaller playing-field. Máire Ní Chinnéide and Cáit Ní Dhonnchadha (like Ní Chinnéide, an Irish-language enthusiast and cultural nationalist), were credited with having created the game, with the assistance of Ní Dhonnchadha's scholarly brother [[Tadhg Ó Donnchadha]], who drew up its rules.&lt;ref&gt;Ríona Nic Congáil, "'Looking on for centuries from the side-line': Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie", Éire-Ireland (Spring / Summer 2013): 168–192.[https://www.academia.edu/3324668/Looking_on_for_centuries_from_the_side-line_Gaelic_Feminism_and_the_rise_of_Camogie Gaelic Feminism and the Rise of Camogie]&lt;/ref&gt; She was on the first camogie team to play an exhibition match in Navan in July 1904, became an early propagandist for the game and, in 1905 was elected president of the infant Camogie Association. She wrote:

"all existing games were passed in review, but it was felt from the first that Hurling was the model on which the new game should be formed.” Initial matches were played on the grounds of Mr O’Dowd in Drumcondra Park, but “the place was not very suitable and players did not join in any numbers until the Keating Camoguidhthe betook themselves to the [[Phoenix Park]], where they have a convenient ground well off the main road."&lt;ref&gt;Camoguidheacht by Máire Ní Chinnéide, GA Annual 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaelic League==
She later served as Vice-President of Craobh an Chéitinnigh, to [[Cathal Brugha]]. She was active in [[Cumann na mBan]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]] and took the pro-treaty side during the [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] and attempted to set up a woman's organisation "in support of the Free State" alongside [[Jennie Wyse Power]].

==Peig Sayers==
She first visited the [[Blasket Islands]] in 1932 with her daughter Niamh, who was to die tragically young. In the summer of 1934 Máire Bean Nic Gearailt as she was then, who had known [[Peig Sayers]], put the idea into the old woman's head to write a memoir. According to a later interview with Ní Chinnéide

:"she knew and admired her gift for easy conversation, her gracious charm as a hostess, her talent for illustrating a point she was making by a story out of her own experience that was as rich in philosophy and thought as it was limited geographically."&lt;ref&gt;Irish Independent, 12 January 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peig answered that she had "nothing to write." She had learned only to read and write in English at school and most of it was forgotten.

Máire Ní Chinnéide suggested Peig should dictate her memoir to her son Micheal, known to everyone on the island as An File ("The Poet"), but Peig "only shook her head doubtfully." At Christmas a packet arrived from the Blaskets with a manuscript, Máire transcribed it word for word and in summer brought it back to the Blaskets to read it to Peig.

She then edited the manuscript for the Talbot Press. Peig became well known as a prescribed text on the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] curriculum in Irish.

==Writing==
Máire had an acting part in the first modern play performed in Irish on the stage, ''Casadh an tSugáin'' by [[Douglas Hyde]] in 1901. She was later author of children's plays staged by An Comhar Drámuidhachta at the Oireachtas and the [[Peacock Theatre, Dublin|Peacock Theatre]], of which ''Gleann na Sidheóg''  and ''An Dúthchas'' (1908) were published. She was a broadcaster in Irish on 2RN/Raidio Éireann after its foundation in 1926 and author of a translation of [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] (1923). She was president of the Gaelic Players Dramatic group during the 1930s and a founder of the Gaelic Writers Association in 1939.

Ní Chinnéide soon became interested in writing children's plays, including "Gleann na Sidheóg" [Fairy Glen] (1905) and "Sidheoga na mBláth" [Flower Fairies] (1909).  Although there is little information available on the staging of Ní Chinnéide's first play, by the time her second children's play, ''Sidheóga na mBláth,'' was published in ''An Claidheamh Soluis'' in December 1907, "Éire Óg" ["Young Ireland"] branches of the Gaelic League had been established in conjunction with adults' branches. P.H. Pearse in particular voiced the expectation that this play would be staged by many "Éire Óg" branches "before the New Year is very old," thus indicating the immediate take up of such plays. Indeed, a week after the play's publication, it was staged in the Dominican College in Donnybrook, Dublin, where Ní Chinnéide had spent several years as an Irish teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Ríona Nic Congáil, '"Some of you will curse her": Women's Writing during the Irish-Language Revival', Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium, Vol. 29, (2009), pp. 199–222.[https://www.academia.edu/1898254/_Some_of_you_will_curse_her_Womens_Writing_during_the_Irish-Language_Revival Women's Writing during the Irish Language Revival]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She died on 25 April 1967 and is buried in [[Deans Grange Cemetery]].

==Trophy==
In 2007 the [[camogie]] trophy for the annual inter-county [[All-Ireland Junior Camogie Championship#Máire Ní Chinnéide Cup|All Ireland Championship for counties graded Junior B]] was named in her honour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="923">'''Niníne Éces''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 700) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[poet]], thought to be a member of the [[Uí Echdach]], a kindred known for learning, who were located in the south and west of what is now [[County Armagh]]. They are recorded as producing several high-ranking ecclesiastics.

Niníne's surviving compositions include ''Admuinemmar nóeb-Patraicc''. This poem, addressed to [[St. Patrick]], was the basis for ''Dóchas Linn Naomh Pádraig'' by [[Tomás Ó Flannghaile]] (1846–1915).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3254">{{About|the English phrase "no problem"||No Problem (disambiguation){{!}}No Problem}}

'''''No problem''''' is an [[English language|English]] expression, used as a response to [[thank]]s (among other functions). It is regarded by some as a less gracious alternative to "[[you're welcome]]", which shares the same function.  It is similar to the [[Australian English]] expression ''[[no worries]]''. The phrase is used in most of the [[United States]], especially on the [[East Coast of the United States]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Some older people find the expression, particularly when employed in the service industry, to be rude, implying that a reasonable request could have been received as problematic or unwelcome. However, in the culture of younger Americans, "no problem" is often used as a more conversational alternative to the classic "you're welcome". 

It is widely believed that younger speakers especially favor "no problem" over "you're welcome", and empirical research has corroborated this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dinkin|first=Aaron|title=It's no problem to be polite: Apparent-time change in responses to thanks|series=NWAV 45|place=Vancouver, B.C.|year=2016|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~dinkin/NoProblemHandout.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red Wine Glass.jpg|150px|thumb|Oenophiles are devoted to [[wine]].]]

'''Oenophilia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|iː|n|ə|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|i|ə}}{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|Oenophilia}}}} {{respell|EE|nə|FIL|ee-ə}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] for the love (''[[-phil-|philia]]'') of [[wine]] (''[[oinos]]'')) is a love of wine. In the strictest sense, ''oenophilia'' describes a disciplined devotion to wine, accompanying strict traditions of consumption and appreciation. In a general sense however, ''oenophilia'' simply refers to the enjoyment of wine, often by [[layman|laymen]]. Oenophiles are also known as ''wine [[aficionado]]s'' or ''[[connoisseur]]s''. They are people who appreciate or collect wine, particularly [[grape]] wines from certain [[list of wine-producing regions|regions]], [[list of grape varieties|varietal types]], or methods of [[wine making|manufacture]]. While most oenophiles are hobbyists, some may also be professionals like [[vintner]]s, [[sommelier]]s, wine [[merchant]]s, or one who tastes and grades wines for a living.

The word did not exist in the wine lexicon until 1977 when Shirley Copperman coined it for her new bring-your-own-wine restaurant she and her husband dubbed "Oenophilia", located on the upper West Side of Manhattan.  A reviewer in a local paper, ''The Westsider'', wrote about the debut: "If the name suggests a rare disease you wouldn't want to catch, a sign in the window informs you that you may already have it. 'Oenophilia', it says, 'is an affliction of the senses characterized by intense cravings for good food and service and vintage wines served in a tasteful, comfortable setting at reasonable prices.'"&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Ney, The Westsider, NYC 6/30/77, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer from ''The Village Voice'' wrote in 1977: "Oenophilia. No, not a social disease. It's the sensual orientation towards the pleasures of fine food and wine, and the name of a spiffy new bistro for elegant gourmandizing....'"&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Harlib, reviewer, The Village Voice, NYC 6/20/77, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pencil extender''' (or pencil lengthener) is a small instrument (made out of metal or wood) allowing to extend small [[pencil]]s, in order to facilitate their use.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Metzger, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=xpXcOhYwEY8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Pencil+extender&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ytkhaX7_fx&amp;sig=MhRp89TBo5T7lyxpGIFfcxtYYDk&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jjb6U8nkBcuAPenNgcAN&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Pencil%20extender&amp;f=false ''Pencil magic. Landscape drawing techniques''] (first chapter: "Tools and materials'"), 2004 ({{ISBN|978-1-58180-584-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Ever more efficient means of mass production of pencils has driven the replacement cost of a pencil down.  Before this, people would continue to use the stub of a pencil to delay the cost of a new one.&lt;ref name=Petroski1&gt;Henry Petroski, ''The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance'', New York: Random House, 2010 ({{ISBN|0307772438}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  For those who "did not feel comfortable using a stub, pencil extenders were sold. These devices function something like a ''porte-crayon'' [...] the pencil stub can be inserted into the end of a shaft [...] Extenders were especially common among engineers and draftsmen, whose favorite pencils were prized dearly. The use of an extender also has the advantage that the pencil does not appreciably change its heft as it wears down."&lt;ref name=Petroski1 /&gt; Artists currently use extenders to maximize the use of their [[colored pencil]]s.

== Production ==

Several companies still produce this kind of object, including [[Caran d'Ache (company)|Caran d'Ache]], [[Faber-Castell]], [[Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth]], [[General Pencil Company, Inc.]], and the [[Derwent Cumberland Pencil Company]].

The '''Sault Ste. Marie language resolution''' was a government motion passed on January 29, 1990 by [[Sault Ste. Marie City Council]], the governing body of the city of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], which resolved that [[English language|English]] was the sole working language of city government. The resolution ignited a national controversy which made the city a flashpoint in the [[Meech Lake Accord]] debate.

The Sault Ste. Marie resolution was not the first of its kind in Ontario, but Sault Ste. Marie was the largest municipality to pass such a resolution and bore the brunt of the controversy.

The resolution was struck down by a court ruling in 1994, and ceased to have legal effect.

In 2010, [[John Rowswell]], a subsequent mayor of Sault Ste. Marie, apologized to French Canadians across the country for the resolution.&lt;ref name=rowswell&gt;[http://ici.radio-canada.ca/regions/Ontario/2010/01/27/001-excuses-ssm-unilinguisme.shtml "Les excuses de Sault-Sainte-Marie"]. [[CBC News|Radio-Canada]], January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Sault Ste. Marie was founded by French-speaking missionaries in 1623 but had become overwhelmingly English-speaking by the twentieth century.

In response to a French-language education controversy which began in 1987 when a group of [[Franco-Ontarian]] families lobbied to have a new French school opened in the city, the Sault Alliance for the Preservation of English Language Rights (SAPELR) was formed and began circulating petitions to have this resolution passed by council. The group worked in concert with the [[Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada]] (APEC), a lobby group which was concurrently campaigning against the provincial government's [[French Language Services Act]]. Although that law dealt only with provincial government services, APEC's strategy was to convince municipalities that they would be required to provide services in French, regardless of cost or benefit, in an attempt to convince the municipalities to pass this type of resolution. As a result of the schooling controversy, the SAPELR petition quickly garnered over 25,000 signatures.

The resolution was widely seen as retaliation for Quebec Premier [[Robert Bourassa]]'s move to [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms#Use of the clause|override the Supreme Court of Canada ruling]] that declared parts of [[Charter of the French Language|Bill 101]] unconstitutional. Bill 101 had declared French as the only official language of Quebec.

==Text of the resolution==

''Whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie is composed of many different ethnic groups, languages and cultures;''

''And whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie has always shown respect for each of these cultures by providing preferential treatment for none;''

''And whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie has throughout its history had one common working language for all of its written and oral communications, which is English;''

''And whereas the preferred common language of commerce, business, trade, science and normal everyday activities is English;''

''Now therefore be it resolved that the Corporation of the City of Sault Ste. Marie in the interests of maintaining goodwill, harmony and sound and responsible fiscal management continue as it has in the past to accept the use of English as the official language of communication with its citizens and with all levels of government, thereby demonstrating the concept of equality for each ethnic, cultural and language group in its jurisdiction.''

''And further resolved in accordance with the Provisions of the Municipal Act of Ontario Part VII and more specifically Section 104a of Said Act the Council of the Corporation of the City of Sault Ste. Marie declares English to be the official language of the said Corporation.''&lt;ref&gt;''Crosswords: Language, Education and Ethnicity in French Ontario'', Monica Heller, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution passes==
On January 27, 1990, the city's daily newspaper, the ''[[Sault Star]]'', reported that council would debate the language resolution two days later. This triggered the attention of the national media, and with reporters from all across Canada in town to cover the debate, the resolution passed council 11-2.

==Controversy==
Many political figures, including [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Jean Chrétien]] and Ontario premier [[David Peterson]], who had strongly condemned Premier Bourassa's use of the notwithstanding clause, expressed their opposition to the city's move. Both Peterson and his successor as premier, [[Bob Rae]], refused to meet with mayor [[Joe Fratesi]] on several subsequent occasions, even to discuss unrelated matters.

In particular, the resolution was seen as a slap in the face to [[Quebec]], where it was widely viewed as racist. (One [[Environment Canada]] meteorologist sent out a weather report for Sault Ste. Marie in which the forecast called for "a chance of flurries and [[Nazi]]s", leading to her suspension.) Council defended the resolution, suggesting that Quebec's language laws and its refusal to abide by the Supreme Court ruling also constituted racism.

Council was also criticized for seemingly turning its back on the city's own history; although in modern times francophones are only a small percentage of the city's population, the city's history is intimately connected to early [[French Canadian]] missionary and [[Coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageur]] exploration of the [[Great Lakes]] area. Some commentators also jokingly suggested that the resolution would require the city to change its name to St. Mary's Falls.

Entertainers weighed in on the controversy; on their 1991 album ''[[Road Apples (album)|Road Apples]]'', [[The Tragically Hip]] criticized the resolution in the song "Born in the Water":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Smart as trees in Sault Ste. Marie&lt;br&gt;
''I can speak my mother tongue&lt;br&gt; 
''Passing laws, just because&lt;br&gt; 
''And singing songs of the English unsung&lt;br&gt;
''How could you do it?&lt;br&gt; 
''How could you even try?&lt;br&gt;
''When you were born in the water&lt;br&gt; 
''And you were raised up in the sky?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftereffects==

Fratesi, who was viewed by Sault Ste. Marie voters throughout the controversy as standing up for the city's interests, was re-elected mayor in a landslide in 1991. He later became embroiled in a [[conflict of interest]] controversy in 1995 when he applied for the job of chief administrative officer of the city, while still sitting as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sims|first=Harvey|title=The Best Man for the Job: Joe Fratesi and the Politics of Sault Ste. Marie|year=2001|publisher=ECW Press|location=Toronto|isbn=1-55022-454-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quebec Premier Bourassa later passed [[Bill 86]], which amended that province's language laws in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling, so the controversy died down.

On June 30, 1994, a court ruling struck down the English-only resolution as ''[[ultra vires]]'' the council's authority. On August 9, 1999, a resolution was brought forward under a new city council to strike down the resolution. The city's solicitor advised that the resolution was out of order given that a court had already struck down the resolution. Attempting to do what it could, the council then unanimously passed the following resolution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Moved by Councillor Derik Brandt''&lt;br&gt;
''Seconded by Councillor Sam Lepore''&lt;br&gt; 
''Whereas the "language resolution" was struck down by the courts because it was beyond the City’s authority; and&lt;br&gt; 
''Whereas it is not legally possible to rescind a resolution that has already been struck down by the courts;&lt;br&gt;
''Be It Resolved that a notation be added to the Minutes of the Regular Meeting of City Council of January 29, 1990 to include the following beside item 5(e); N.B. "This resolution was struck down by the courts on June 30, 1994 and therefore has no effect."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The effect of the resolution was to amend the minutes containing the English-only resolution to note that the resolution had been struck down.

As recently as 2007, ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'' in [[Montreal]] referred to the town of [[Hérouxville, Quebec|Hérouxville]], then embroiled in a controversy around [[reasonable accommodation]] of immigrants, as Quebec's "own Sault Ste. Marie".&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Macpherson (journalist)|Don Macpherson]], [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=d6859802-d798-46c5-81ae-4710aec5d7a4&amp;p=1 "The town of Herouxville is our own Sault Ste. Marie"], ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', January 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 28, 2010, 20 years less a day after the original resolution was passed, then-Sault Ste. Marie Mayor [[John Rowswell]] apologized to French-Canadians across the country for the resolution of the prior council.&lt;ref name=rowswell/&gt;

==Language Structure==
In [[linguistic typology]], a '''subject+object+verb''' ('''SOV''') language is one in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], and [[verb]] of a sentence always or usually appear in that order. If [[English language|English]] were SOV, "Sam oranges ate" would be an ordinary sentence, as opposed to the actual [[Standard English]] "Sam ate oranges". (A Grammar of Sunuwar)

Sunuwar people called "Khangsa" sign language with voice and direct action, for foreign people who don't understand a sunuwar language.

==Area==
Sunuwar language is spoken in villages in [[Dolakha District|Dolakha]], [[Ramechhap District|Ramechhap]] and [[Okhaldhunga District|Okhaldhunga]], about 120 kilometers east of [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref name="Borchers 1–2" /&gt;

==Writing systems==
Though Sunuwar is most commonly written with the [[Devanagari]] script, a native writing system, [[Jenticha]], has seen limited use since the 1940s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3606">'''Telephone density''' or '''teledensity''' is the number of [[telephone]] connections for every hundred individuals living within an area. It varies widely across the nations and also between urban and rural areas within a country. Telephone density has significant correlation with the [[per capita GDP]] of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Effects of Globalization on Developing Countries |author= |publisher=World Bank Publications |isbn=9780821332856 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-\_xMmhGBs5wC=PA30 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as an indicator of the [[purchasing power]] of the [[middle class]] of the country or specific region.

==Determining telephone density==
In earlier days teledensity was computed as the number of [[fixed telephone lines]] per hundred inhabitants. But this method has become less significant with an increasing number of countries register a trend of [[mobile cellular]] subscribers outnumbering the fixed line connections. Hence, as an alternative, ''mobidensity'' or mobile cellular subscribers per hundred inhabitants was proposed. Since this method caused disadvantage to some countries where the fixed line network is well established, or others where the mobile network is still in its initial stage of development, ''effective teledensity'' has been proposed by ITU as the solution, which is defined as either fixed line connections or mobile subscribers per hundred inhabitants – whichever is higher.&lt;ref name="ITU2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Core ICT Indicators |publisher=ITU |year=2005 |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/partnership/material/CoreICTIndicators.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixed telephone lines per hundred inhabitants is calculated by dividing the number of fixed telephone lines by the total population and then multiplying by 100. Fixed telephone lines include [[PSTN]], [[Wireless local loop|WLL]], [[ISDN]] and [[DSL]]. A single ISDN or DSL subscriber connection may cater to multiple voice channels. This leads to a lack of global standard in the computation of fixed line density and hence [[ITU]] has recommended that all the countries shall provide the methodology of calculation of this figure in order to enhance comparability.&lt;ref name="ITU2005"/&gt;

Mobidensity or mobile cellular subscribers per hundred inhabitants is obtained by dividing the number of mobile cellular subscribers by the population and multiplying by 100. While computing Mobile cellular subscribers users of both post-paid subscriptions and pre-paid accounts are included. Inactive prepaid connections where a call has not been made or received within the last 3 months, are excluded.&lt;ref name="ITU2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Core ICT Indicators |publisher=ITU |year=2010 |url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/ind/D-IND-ICT_CORE-2010-PDF-E.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teledensity and GDP==

The correlation between teledensity and per capita GDP could be represented by a straight line in a logarithmic graph. This relation was first mentioned by A.G.W. Jipp. a German engineer, in his book published in 1962. The graph is helpful to compare the telephone infrastructure development of different countries or regions, on the basis of teledensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Years of Telephone Switching | author=Robert J. Chapuis |author2=Amos E. Joel  |publisher=IOS Press |year=1982 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaVSbjsaBfMC |isbn=9781586033491 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''trophy property''' or '''trophy home''' is a [[real estate]] term for the top 2% of properties in a given subcategory, the term refers to residences, architecturally or historically preserved properties, agricultural lands that have extraordinary yields, high-amenity natural land and properties with spectacular views, or other extraordinary amenities.  The term also can refer to capstone properties such as [[office building]]s or other unique income-producing properties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E4DB1E38F93AA15750C0A96E958260 Trophy Properties Top the Recovery in Chicago - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies in the United States==
Valuing trophy property for federally financed land acquisitions is unique among [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] assignments, in that supplemental standards proffered by many (but not all) federal agencies require that comparable transactions used for valuation be limited to those with an "economic use" and not those acquired solely for "preservation" purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Interagency Standards for Federal Land Acquisition'', current version published in 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, only acquisitions by certain Federal agencies must adhere to this supplemental appraisal standard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16735">{{For|the specific meaning in Wikipedia|Wikipedia:Weasel word}}
A '''weasel word''', or '''anonymous authority''', is an [[slang|informal term]] for words and phrases such as "researchers believe" and "most people think" which make arguments appear specific or meaningful, even though these terms are at best ambiguous and vague. Using weasel words may allow someone to later deny any specific meaning if the statement is challenged, because the statement was never specific in the first place. Weasel words can be a form of [[wikt:tergiversate|tergiversation]], and may be used in advertising and political statements to mislead.

Weasel words can soften or under-state a biased or otherwise controversial statement. An example of this is using terms like "somewhat" or "in most respects," which make a sentence more ambiguous than it would be without them.&lt;ref&gt;Jason, Gary (1988) [http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2649/2090 "Hedging as a Fallacy of Language"], ''Informal Logic'' X.3, Fall 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The expression ''weasel word'' may derive from the egg-eating habits of [[weasel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Roosevelt Association, [http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/TR%20Web%20Book/TR_CD_to_HTML682.html Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia]{{subscription required}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414220921/http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/TR%20Web%20Book/TR_CD_to_HTML682.html |date=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article published by the ''[[Buffalo News]]'' attributes the origin of the term to [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]'', in which the author includes [[simile]]s of weasels sucking eggs.&lt;ref&gt;E. Cobham Brewer, [http://www.bartleby.com/81/17333.html ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'']&lt;/ref&gt; The article said that this was a misnomer, because weasels do not have a [[mandible]] suitable for sucking eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rising |first=Gerry |date=15 March 1999 |title=Weasels |url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~insrisg/nature/nw99/weasels.html |newspaper=Buffalo News |postscript=,&amp;nbsp;''Buffalo.edu''. |accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]]'s ''Metamorphoses'' provides an earlier source for the same etymology. Ovid describes how [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] orders the goddess of childbirth, [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], to prevent [[Alcmene]] from giving birth to [[Hercules]]. Alcmene's servant [[Galanthis]], realizing that Lucina is outside the room using magic to prevent the birth, emerges to announce that the birth has been a success. Lucina, in her amazement, drops the spells of binding and Hercules is born. Galanthis then mocks Lucina, who responds by transforming her into a weasel. Ovid writes (in A.S. Kline's translation) "And because her lying mouth helped in childbirth, she [as a weasel] gives birth through her mouth."&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, Metamorphoses (tr. Anthony S. Kline), [http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph9.htm#483366544 Book IX, 273-323]&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of the word 'weasel' that imply deception and irresponsibility include: the noun form, referring to a sneaky, untrustworthy, or insincere person; the verb form, meaning to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] shiftily;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster online dictionary def'n: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weasel&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase "to ''weasel out''", meaning "to squeeze one's way out of something" or "to evade responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Free Dictionary|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/weasel+out|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression first appeared in Stewart Chaplin's short story "Stained Glass Political Platform" (published in 1900 in ''The Century Magazine''),&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;''The Macmillan Dictionary of Contemporary Phrase and Fable''&lt;/ref&gt; in which weasel words were described as "words that suck the life out of the words next to them, just as a weasel sucks the egg and leaves the shell". [[Theodore Roosevelt]] attributed the term to his friend William Sewall's older brother, Dave, claiming that he used the term in a private conversation in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', 2 September 1916, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/02/104689643.pdf "Origin of 'Weasel Words'"]&lt;/ref&gt; In another early usage, Theodore Roosevelt argued in 1916 that "one of our defects as a nation is a tendency to use ...'weasel words'; when one 'weasel word' is used ... after another there is nothing left".&lt;ref name="words"&gt;{{Cite book

A 2009 study of [[Wikipedia]] found that most weasel words in it could be divided into three main categories:&lt;ref name="Ganter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ganter|first1=Viola|last2=Strube|first2=Michael|title=Finding Hedges by Chasing Weasels: Hedge Detection Using Wikipedia Tags and Shallow Linguistic Features|journal=Proceedings of the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 Conference Short Pape|date=4 August 2009|page=175|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P09-2044|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Numerically vague expressions (for example, "some people", "experts", "many")
# Use of the [[passive voice]] to avoid specifying an authority (for example, "it is said")
# Adverbs that weaken (for example, "often", "probably")

Other forms of weasel words may include these:
*[[Non sequitur (logic)|Non sequitur]] statements
*Use of vague or ambiguous [[euphemism]]s
*Use of grammatical devices such as [[Grammatical modifier|qualifier]]s and the [[subjunctive mood]]
*[[Glittering generality|Glittering or vague generalizations]]

''Generalizing'' by means of [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]], such as ''many'', when quantifiable measures could be provided, obfuscates the point being made, and if done deliberately is an example of "weaseling".

''Non sequitur'', where illogical or irrelevant statements can be used, such as in advertising, can make it appear that the statement describes a beneficial feature of a product or service being advertised.  An example is the endorsement of products by celebrities, regardless of whether they have any expertise relating to the product. In non sequitur fashion, it does not follow that the endorsement provides any guarantee of quality or suitability.

''False authority'' is defined as the use of the passive voice without specifying an actor or agent. For example, saying "it has been decided" without stating by whom, and citation of unidentified "authorities" or "experts", provide further scope for weaseling.  It can be used in combination with the reverse approach of discrediting a contrary viewpoint by glossing it as "claimed" or "alleged".  This embraces what is termed a "semantic [[wikt:cop-out|cop-out]]", represented by the term ''allegedly''.&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;{{Cite book

}} p. 140 "it is alleged"&lt;/ref&gt; This implies an absence of ownership of opinion, which casts a limited doubt on the opinion being articulated.  The construction "mistakes were made" enables the speaker to acknowledge error without identifying those responsible.

However, the passive voice is legitimately used when the identity of the actor or agent is irrelevant. For example, in the sentence "one hundred votes are required to pass the bill", there is no ambiguity, and the actors including the members of the voting community cannot practicably be named even if it were useful to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/passive-voice/ |title=Passive Voice |work=The Writing Center |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] |accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/english/resources/8PassiveVoice.pdf |title=The Passive Voice |work=English and Theatre – Grammar Pages |format=PDF |publisher=[[Acadia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific journal article is another example of the legitimate use of the passive voice.  For an experimental result to be useful, anyone who runs the experiment should get the same result.  That is, the identity of the experimenter should be of low importance.  Use of the passive voice focuses attention upon the actions, and not upon the actor—the author of the article.  To achieve conciseness and clarity, however, most scientific journals encourage authors to use the active voice where appropriate, identifying themselves as "we" or even "I".&lt;ref name="BioMedicalEditor"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.biomedicaleditor.com/active-voice.html | title = Clear Science Writing: Active Voice or Passive Voice? | author = Every, Barbara | date = 5 July 2013 | accessdate = 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[middle voice]]'' can be used to create a misleading impression. For example:
* "It stands to reason that most people will be better off after the changes."
* "There are great fears that most people will be worse off after the changes."
* "Experience insists that most people will not be better off after the changes."

The first of these also demonstrates false authority, in that anyone who disagrees incurs the suspicion of being unreasonable merely by dissenting.  Another example from international politics is use of the phrase "the international community" to imply a false unanimity.

''[[Euphemism]]'' may be used to soften and potentially mislead the audience. For example, the dismissal of employees may be referred to as "rightsizing", "headcount reduction", and "downsizing".&lt;ref name="downsize"&gt;{{Cite web

| accessdate = 5 October 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jargon]] of this kind is used to describe things [[euphemism|euphemistically]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

''Restricting information'' available to the audience is a technique sometimes used in [[Advertising|advertisements]].  For example, stating that a product "...&amp;nbsp;is now 20% cheaper!" raises the question, "Cheaper than what?".  It might be said that "Four out of five people prefer&amp;nbsp;..." something, but this raises the questions of the size and selection of the sample, and the size of the majority. "Four out of five" could actually mean that there had been 8% for, 2% against, and 90% indifferent.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Weasel words can also be used to try to weaken factual statements, for example "The ruling was met with criticism by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch" can be amended to read "The ruling was met with criticism by ''some'' human rights organizations such as..."

[[Image:Styli used in writing in the Fourteenth Century.png|thumb|right|Styli used in writing in the Fourteenth Century.]]
A '''writing implement''' or '''writing instrument''' is an object used to produce [[writing]]. Most of these items can be also used for other functions such as [[painting]], [[drawing]] and [[technical drawing]], but writing instruments generally have the ordinary requirement to create a smooth, controllable [[wikt:line|line]].

Another writing implement employed by a smaller population, is the stylus used by blind users in conjunction with the [[Slate and stylus|slate]] for punching out the dots in [[Braille]].&lt;ref Name="AFB"&gt;{{cite web

==Autonomous==
These have an inherent functionality in that their useful life corresponds to the length of their physical existence, i.e. they cannot "run out" and persist as useless objects.

===Without pigment===
The oldest known examples were created by incising a flat surface with a rigid tool rather than applying pigment with a secondary object, e.g., Chinese [[jiaguwen]] carved into turtle shells. However, this may simply represent the relative durability of such artifacts rather than truly representing the evolution of techniques, as the meaningful application of pigment is attested in prehistoric cave paintings such as the ones at [[Lascaux]].

The ancient [[Sumerian language|Sumerians]] and their successor cultures, such as the [[Babylonians]], produced their [[cuneiform]] writing by pressing a triangular [[stylus]] into soft clay tablets, creating characteristic wedge-shaped marks. The clay tablets were then baked to harden them and permanently preserve the marks.

Several other ancient cultures such as [[Mycenaean Greece]] also inscribed their records into clay tablets but did not routinely bake them; much of the [[Linear B]] corpus from [[Minoan Crete]] was accidentally preserved by a catastrophic fire which hard-baked those tablets. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used [[lead]] styli with [[wax tablet]]s which could be "erased" by rubbing the [[beeswax]] surface smooth again.

In the modern era, [[Hand-held computer|hand held computer]]s and certain other computer [[input device]]s use a stylus to enter information onto a screen by applying pressure rather than by depositing pigment.

Words and names are still commonly inscribed into commemorative objects, such as the [[engraving|engraved]] winners' names on the [[silver]] [[Stanley Cup]] or the [[Gettysburg Address]] carved into the stone wall of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], but the requisite tools are not exclusively considered to be writing instruments.

===With inherent pigment===
[[File:Simon Janashia Museum of Georgia 32.jpg|thumb|The 3rd-4th-century writing implements from [[Mtskheta]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]
The original form of "lead [[pencil]]" was the [[lead]]en stylus used by the ancient Romans, who also used it to write on wood or papyrus by leaving dark streaks where the soft metal rubbed off onto the surface. The concept has been revived in recent times as the core of the "inkless pen": a lead-based metal alloy that leaves dark markings on paper by abrading small pieces of core onto the surface.

However, most modern "lead [[pencils]]" have a nonpoisonous core of greyish-black [[graphite]] mixed with various proportions of [[clay]] for consistency, enclosed within an outer wooden casing to protect the fragile graphite from being snapped apart or from leaving marks on the user's hand.

White [[chalk]] has been traditionally used in [[schoolroom]]s to write on a main [[blackboard]] at the front of the room. In the 19th century, and indeed well into the 20th century, when paper was less readily available, individual students also wrote with chalk on their own small [[slate (writing)|slate]]s.

Both pencils and chalk exist in variants which can create marks in other colors, but colored pencils and colored chalk are generally considered to be [[art supplies]] rather than writing instruments. Similarly, although very young children may use colorful wax [[crayons]] to write words into their pictures, writing is not considered to be the primary use of crayons.

A [[wax pencil]] resembles both a crayon and a pencil in that it contains a brightly colored wax core within a protective paper casing, but its proportions are closer to that of a standard pencil. Wax pencils are primarily used to write onto nonporous surfaces such as [[porcelain]] or [[glass]].

Normal pencils, chalk, and crayons all share the characteristic that they cannot "run out". The useful life of these implements is closely linked to their physical existence. However, specialized accessories such as [[pencil sharpeners]] may be required to reshape the working end of the pigment core or to remove the outer casing from around the tip.

==Assisted==
These require the presence of an added pigment in order to write, and are useless when "empty".

===Pens===
{{main|Pen}}
The [[pen]] is the most common form of writing implement. It has a hard tip which applies ink to a surface.

====Capillary-action dip pens====
Initially, pens were made by slicing a suitable [[Nib (pen)|nib]] point from the end of a thin, hollow natural material which could retain a small reservoir of ink by [[capillary action]]. However, these ink reservoirs were relatively small, requiring the pen to be periodically dipped back into an external [[inkwell]] for replenishing.

[[Reed pen]]s were used by the ancient Egyptians to write on [[papyrus]]. [[Quill]] pens were standard in Europe and the United States up through the 18th and 19th centuries, and are still used in various contexts, such as [[calligraphy]] and formal settings such as major [[bank]] transactions. The most common quills were taken from the wings of [[geese]] or [[raven]]s, although the feathers of [[swan]]s and [[peacock]]s were sometimes favored for prestige.

A [[dip pen]] has a steel nib  (the pen proper) and a pen-holder. Dip pens are very versatile, as the pen-holder can accommodate a wide variety of nibs that are specialized for different purposes: [[Copperplate script|copperplate]] writing, mapping pens, and five-pointed nibs for drawing [[Staff (musical)|music stave]]s.  They can be used with most types of ink, some of which are incompatible with other types of pen. Automatic pens are a category of dip pen, in which the nib is in two parts and can hold a larger quantity of ink. However, like all of its precursors, the steel-nibbed dip pens had a limited ink reservoir and a tendency to drip inkblots on the page.

====Fountain pens====
{{main|Fountain pen}}
[[File:Writing a letter.jpg|thumb|A letter written with fountain pen.]]
[[Fountain pens]] were developed in the 19th century. These consist of the nib unit, an ink reservoir chamber, and an external casing. The casing usually includes a cover for the nib, in order to protect its shape and keep the ink from evaporating dry or wicking into the user's pocket. Depending on the design of the pen, the ink reservoir can be filled in several different ways: direct addition by eyedropper, suction from an internal mechanism, or disposable pre-filled cartridges. Some cartridge-based fountain pens can be fitted with "converters", which are separate piston/suction reservoirs of the same dimensions as the pen's usual refill cartridge; these allow the pen to refill from bottled ink.

Only certain types of ink can be used in a fountain pen, to avoid clogging up the nib unit mechanism. Although the larger reservoir of fountain pens requires less frequent ink replenishment, the ink may inconveniently spill out in certain contexts to stain the paper, fingers, or clothing of an unwary writer. Differences in air pressure may cause spectacular effects when travelling by airplane.

====Disposable pens====
A large number of new pen types were popularized in the 20th century. Some of them are not constructed to be refilled with ink after they run dry; although others can theoretically have their internal ink compartment replaced, the widespread custom is to simply throw away the entire pen when its ink is no longer accessible.

These types include the [[ballpoint pen]] (often called a [[Laszlo Biro|biro]] in many Commonwealth countries) and  the [[felt tip pen]]. Both of these have subtypes which are popularly called by their own specific names, usually based on the type of their ink, such as the fluorescent [[highlighter]], the [[rollerball pen]], and the [[gel pen]].

===Mechanical pencils===
{{main|Mechanical pencil}}
Unlike the construction of a traditional wooden pencil around a solid graphite core, a [[mechanical pencil]] feeds a small, mobile piece of graphite through its tip. An internal mechanism controls the position of the graphite by friction, so that although it remains steady while writing, the graphite can be advanced forward to compensate for gradual wear or retracted to protect it when not in use. The graphite in mechanical pencils is typically much narrower than in wooden pencils, frequently in sub-millimeter diameters. This makes them particularly useful for fine diagrams or small handwriting, although different sizes of refill leads cannot be interchanged in the same pencil unless it has been specially designed for that purpose.

===Brushes===
Although in Western civilization writing is usually done with some form of [[pencil]] or [[pen]], other cultures have used other instruments.  [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] characters are traditionally written with a [[ink brush|brush]], which is perceived as lending itself to a graceful, flowing stroke.

A brush differs from a pen in that instead of a rigid nib, the brush is tipped with soft bristles. The bristles are gently swept across the paper with just enough pressure to allow ink to wick onto the surface, rather than mashing down the brush to the extent of substantial friction resistance. Although pens with semi-flexible nibs and liquid ink can also vary their stroke width depending on the degree of applied pressure, their variation range is far less obvious.

Traditionally, brushes have been loaded with ink by dipping the bristles into an external pool of ink  on an [[inkstone]], analogous to a traditional dip pen with an inkwell. Some companies now make "[[fudepen|brush pens]]" which in that regard resemble a fountain pen, with an internal ink reservoir built into the handle which can be refilled with preloaded cartridges or a bottle-fill converter.

==Accessories==
[[File:Bleistiftverlaengerer.jpg|thumb|A wooden [[pencil extender]].]]

Other implements indirectly associated with writing include [[eraser]]s for pen and pencil, [[pencil sharpeners]], [[pencil extenders]], [[inkwells]], [[blotter paper]], and [[ruler]]s and related [[stationery|drawing instrument]]s. [[Pounce pot]]s were a precursor of blotting paper, being a dispenser for powdery material for drying the paper. [[Stencil]]s can be used to create standardised letters, patterns or signatures.

'''Yaoi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|aʊ|i}}; {{lang-ja|やおい}} {{IPA-ja|ja.o.i|}}), also known as {{Nihongo|'''boys' love'''|ボーイズ ラブ|bōizu rabu}} or {{Nihongo|'''BL'''|ビーエル|bīeru}}, is a [[genre]] of fictional media originating in Japan that features [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] relationships between male characters. It is typically created by women for women and is distinct from homoerotic media marketed to [[gay]] male audiences, such as [[Bara (genre)|bara]], but it also attracts male readers. It spans a wide range of media, including [[manga]], [[anime]], [[drama CDs]], novels, games, and [[Fan labor|fan production]]. ''Boys love'' and its abbreviation BL are the [[generic term]]s for this kind of media in Japan and have, in recent years, become more commonly used in English as well. However, ''yaoi'' remains more generally prevalent in English.

A defining characteristic of yaoi is the practice of pairing characters in relationships according to the roles of ''seme'', the sexual [[Top, bottom and versatile#Top|top]] or active pursuer, and ''uke'', the sexual [[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|bottom]] or passive pursuant. Common themes in yaoi include forbidden relationships, depictions of non-consensual sex, tragedy, and humor. Yaoi and BL stories cover a diverse range of genres such as high school love comedy, [[Historical period drama|period drama]], science fiction and fantasy, [[detective fiction]] and include sub-genres such as omegaverse and ''[[shotacon]].''

Yaoi finds its origins in both fan culture and commercial publishing. As James Welker has summarized, the term yaoi dates back to ''[[dōjinshi]]'' culture of the late 1970s to early 1980s where, as a portmanteau of "'''ya'''manashi '''o'''chinashi '''i'''minashi" (no climax, no point, no meaning), it was a self-deprecating way to refer to amateur fan works that parodied mainstream manga and anime by depicting the male characters from popular series in vaguely or explicitly sexual situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/885378169|title=Boys' love manga and beyond : history, culture, and community in Japan|last=Welker |first=James|publisher=|others=McLelland, Mark J., 1966-, Nagaike, Kazumi,, Suganuma, Katsuhiko,, Welker, James,|year=2015|isbn=9781628461206|location=Jackson|pages=|chapter=A History of Shonen'ai, Yaoi, and Boys Love|oclc=885378169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of yaoi to refer to parody ''dōjinshi'' is still predominant in Japan. In commercial publishing, the genre can be traced back to ''shōnen'ai'', a genre of beautiful boy manga that began to appear in ''[[shōjo manga]]'' magazines in the early 1970s. From the 1970s to 1980s, other terms such as ''tanbi'' and ''[[June (manga magazine)|June]]'' emerged to refer to specific developments in the genre. In the early 1990s, however, these terms were largely eclipsed with the commercialization of male-male homoerotic media under the label of boys love.

Yaoi currently has a robust global presence. Yaoi works are available across the continents in various languages both through international licensing and distribution and through circulation by fans. Yaoi works, culture, and [[fandom]] have also been studied and discussed by scholars and journalists worldwide.{{Anime and manga}}

==History and general terminology==
The genre currently known as ''Boy's Love'', ''BL'', or ''yaoi'' derives from two sources. Female authors writing for shōjo (girl's) manga magazines in the early 1970s published stories featuring [[platonic relationship]]s between young boys, which were known as ''tanbi'' (aesthetic) or ''shōnen ai'' (boy love). In the late 1970s{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} going into the 1980s, women and girls in the dōjinshi (fan fiction) markets of Japan started to produce sexualized [[parodies]] of popular shōnen (boy's) anime and manga stories in which the male characters were recast as gay lovers.{{refn|Initially called ''aniparo'', this term covered both male fans' work about female characters and female fans' work about male characters, but ''yaoi'' would be surpassed by ''aniparo'' as referring to women's fictions.&lt;ref name="Galbraith 11"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galbraith|first=Patrick W. |title=Fujoshi: Fantasy Play and Transgressive Intimacy among "Rotten Girls" in Contemporary Japan |journal=Signs |year=2011 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=211–232 |doi=10.1086/660182}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} By the end of the 1970s, magazines devoted to the nascent genre started to appear, and in the 1990s the term ''boys' love'' or ''BL'' would be invented and would become the dominant term used for the genre in Japan. Although ''yaoi'' derives from girl's and women's manga and still targets the shōjo and [[josei]] demographics, it is currently considered a separate category.&lt;ref name="aestheticism definitions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Confused"&gt;Thorn, Matt [http://www.matt-thorn.com/shoujo_manga/whatisandisnt.php What Shôjo Manga Are and Are Not – A Quick Guide for the Confused] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118183532/http://matt-thorn.com/shoujo_manga/whatisandisnt.php |date=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''yaoi'' has become an [[umbrella term]] in the West for women's [[manga]] or Japanese-influenced comics with male-male relationships,&lt;ref name="aestheticism definitions"/&gt; and it is the term preferentially used by American manga publishers for works of this kind,&lt;ref name = Boston/&gt; Japan uses the term ''yaoi'' to denote ''dōjinshi'' and works that focus on sex scenes.&lt;ref name="aestheticism definitions"/&gt; In both usages, ''yaoi'' / ''boy's love'' excludes ''[[Bara (genre)|gei comi]] (bara)'', a genre which also depicts gay male sexual relationships but is written for and mostly by gay men.&lt;ref name="aestheticism definitions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pedagogy"/&gt; In the West, the term ''[[hentai]] yaoi'' is sometimes used to denote the most explicit titles.&lt;ref name="Hello Boys"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=David |date=8 September 2003 |title=Hello boys |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200309080034 |deadurl=yes |newspaper=''[[New Statesman]]'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105204516/http://www.newstatesman.com/200309080034 |archivedate=5 January 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''yaoi'' to denote those works with explicit scenes sometimes clashes with use of the word to describe the genre as a whole, creating confusion between Japanese and Western writers or between Western fans who insist on proper usage of the Japanese terms and those who use the Westernized versions.

==Concepts==

===Shōnen-ai===
The term ''shōnen-ai'' (boy love) originally connoted [[ephebophilia]] or [[pederasty]] in Japan, but from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, was used to describe a new genre of [[shōjo manga]], primarily produced by the [[Year 24 Group]] of women authors, about beautiful boys in love. Characteristics of shōnen-ai include exoticism, often taking place in Europe,&lt;ref name="Welker06 842"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welker | first1 = James | year = 2006 | title = Beautiful, Borrowed, and Bent: 'Boys' Love' as Girls' Love in Shôjo Manga' | url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 31 | issue = 3| page = 842 | doi = 10.1086/498987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and idealism.&lt;ref name="Suzuki 250"&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999.

London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p.250 {{ISBN|0-8476-9136-5}}, {{ISBN|0-8476-9137-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Angles particularly notes [[Moto Hagio]]'s ''[[The Heart of Thomas]]'' (1974) and  Keiko Takemiya's ''Kaze to Ki no Uta'' (1976–1984) as being groundbreaking, noting their portrayal of intense friendship between males, including jealousy and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Angles | first=Jeffrey | authorlink=Jeffrey Angles | title=Writing the love of boys : origins of Bishōnen culture in modernist Japanese literature | year=2011 | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | location=Minneapolis | isbn=978-0-8166-6970-7|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of shonen-ai is thought to come through two pathways.  Mizoguchi traces the tales back to the ''tanbi'' romances of [[Mori Mari]].&lt;ref name="Welker review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue27/welker_review.htm|title=Intersections: Review, Boys' Love Manga: Essays on the Sexual Ambiguity and Cross-Cultural Fandom of the Genre|publisher=Intersections|author=Welker, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''tanbi'' was used for stories written for and about the worship of beauty,&lt;ref name="aestheticism definitions"/&gt; and romance between older men and beautiful youths&lt;ref name="Mori Mari"/&gt; using particularly flowery language and unusual [[kanji]] (Chinese characters appropriated into Japanese script).&lt;ref name="aestheticism definitions"/&gt; [[Mori Mari]] in {{Nihongo3|''A Lovers' Forest''|恋人たちの森|Koibito tachi no mori}}, considered "the first work of [yaoi]",&lt;ref name="Pagliassotti BL West"&gt;[[Dru Pagliassotti|Pagliassotti, Dru]] (November 2008) [http://www.participations.org/Volume%205/Issue%202/5_02_pagliassotti.htm 'Reading Boys' Love in the West'] Particip@tions Volume 5, Issue 2 Special Edition&lt;/ref&gt; used such unusual kanji for her characters' names that she converted to spelling their names in [[katakana]], a script used to transcribe foreign words.&lt;ref name="Mori Mari"&gt;Vincent, Keith (2007) "[http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/L/lunning_mechademia2.html A Japanese Electra and Her Queer Progeny]" ''Mechademia 2'' pp. 64–79&lt;/ref&gt; The word was originally used to describe an author's distinctive style, for example, the styles of [[Yukio Mishima]] and [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]]. Akiko Mizoguchi describes its application to male-male stories as "misleading", but notes "it was the most commonly used term in the early 1990s."&lt;ref name=MizoguchiSubgenres&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akiko | first1 = Mizoguchi | year = 2003 | title = Male-Male Romance by and for Women in Japan: A History and the Subgenres of Yaoi Fictions | url = | journal = U.S.-Japan Women's Journal | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 49–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to James Welker, Minori Ishida shows that "early boys love narratives" were inspired by European fiction about "beautiful boys", and the writing of the male author [[Taruho Inagaki]].&lt;ref name="Welker review"/&gt;  Carola Bauer cites the ''[[bildungsroman]]'' genre as having influenced shonen-ai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bauer|first1=Carola|title=Naughty girls and gay male romance/porn : slash fiction, boys' love manga, and other works by Female "Cross-Voyeurs" in the U.S. Academic Discourses|date=2013|publisher=Anchor Academic Publishing|location=[S.l.]|isbn=3954890011|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazuko Suzuki describes shōnen-ai as being "pedantic" and "difficult to understand",&lt;ref name="Suzuki 252"/&gt; saying that they required "knowledge of classic literature, history and science"&lt;ref name="Suzuki 250"/&gt; and were replete with "philosophical and abstract musings". Shōnen-ai challenged young readers, who were often only able to understand the references and deeper themes as they grew older and instead were initially drawn to the figure of the male protagonist.&lt;ref name="Suzuki 251"&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. "Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon". In Sherrie Inness, ed., ''Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World''. London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p.251 {{ISBN|0-8476-9136-5}}, {{ISBN|0-8476-9137-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Galbraith defines ''shōnen ai'' as "original content that can approach serious literature in tone and theme", as opposed to a more light-hearted ''yaoi''.&lt;ref name="Galbraith 11"/&gt;  By the late 1980s, the popularity of professionally published shōnen-ai was declining, and dōjinshi (self-published) yaoi was becoming more popular.&lt;ref name="out of hand"/&gt;

The terms ''yaoi'' and ''shōnen-ai'' are sometimes used by Western fans to differentiate between two variants of the genre. In this case, ''yaoi'' is used to describe titles that primarily feature sexually explicit themes and sex scenes, while ''shōnen-ai'' is used to describe titles that focus primarily on romance and omit explicit sexual content, although sexual acts may be implied.&lt;ref name="Drawn Together"/&gt;&lt;ref name="What Girls Like?"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cha |first=Kai-Ming |date=7 March 2005 |title=Yaoi Manga: What Girls Like? |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20050307/29621-yaoi-manga-what-girls-like.html |newspaper=''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood-06"/&gt; According to this use of the terms, ''[[Gravitation (manga)|Gravitation]]'' would be considered ''shōnen-ai'' due to its focus on the characters' careers rather than their love life.&lt;ref name="Hello Boys"/&gt;

===Seme and uke===
[[File:Lesson 1 Private Tutor.jpg|right|thumb|Artwork depicting a seme (left) and uke (right) couple]]
The two participants in a yaoi relationship (and to a lesser extent in [[yuri (genre)|yuri]])&lt;ref&gt;Aoki, Deb (3 March 2007) [http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistswriters/a/EFriedman_2.htm Interview: Erica Friedman – Page 2] "Because the dynamic of the ''seme''/''uke'' is so well known, it's bound to show up in ''yuri''. ... In general, I'm going to say no. There is much less obsession with pursued/pursuer in ''yuri'' manga than there is in ''yaoi''."&lt;/ref&gt; are often referred to as ''[[Seme (martial arts)|seme]]'' ("top") and ''[[Uke (martial arts)|uke]]'' ("bottom").

Aleardo Zanghellini suggests that the martial arts terms have special significance to a Japanese audience, as an archetype of the gay male relationship in Japan includes [[Shudō|same-sex love between samurai and their companions]].&lt;ref name=Zanghellini /&gt; The ''seme'' and ''uke'' are often drawn in the [[bishōnen]] style and are "highly idealised", blending both [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] qualities.&lt;ref name="Kinsella Otaku 1990s"/&gt;

Zanghellini suggests that the samurai archetype is responsible for "the 'hierarchical' structure and age difference" of some relationships portrayed in yaoi and boys' love.&lt;ref name=Zanghellini/&gt; The ''seme'' is often depicted as the [[stereotypical]] male of anime and manga culture: restrained, physically powerful, and protective.

The ''seme'' usually pursues the ''uke'', who often has softer, androgynous, feminine features with bigger eyes and a smaller build, and is often physically weaker than the ''seme''.&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;Jones, V.E. [http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2005/04/25/he_loves_him_she_loves_them/ "He Loves Him, She Loves Them: Japanese comics about gay men are increasingly popular among women"]. ''Boston.com''. April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way the ''seme'' and ''uke'' characters are shown is through who is dominant in the relationship - a character can take the uke role even if he is not presented as feminine, simply by being juxtaposed against and pursued by a more dominant, more masculine, character.&lt;ref&gt;Sihombing, Febriani (2011). "[http://www.imageandnarrative.be/index.php/imagenarrative/article/viewFile/130/101 On The Iconic Difference between Couple Characters in Boys Love Manga.]" Image &amp; Narrative 12 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not the same, a yaoi construct similar to ''seme and uke'' is the concept of '''tachi''' ''and'' '''neko'''. This archetypal pairing is referenced more often in older yaoi volumes - in modern yaoi, this pairing is often seen as already encompassed by seme and uke or simply unnecessary to address. The ''tachi'' partner is conceptualized as the member of the relationship who pursues the more passive partner, the latter of whom is referred to as the ''neko''. ''Seme and uke'' is similar but not identical to ''tachi'' and ''neko'' because the former refers primarily to sexual roles, whereas the latter describes personality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Although seme and uke roles are already used in some manga to describe which member of the relationship is more dominant and which member is more passive, there are just as many manga novels which subtly or overtly differentiate between the two.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} A gay male who asks out another male can initiate the relationship but also enjoy the sensation of being a bottom in anal sex.

Anal sex is a prevalent theme in yaoi, as nearly all stories feature it in some way. The storyline where an uke is reluctant to have anal sex with a seme is considered to be similar to the reader's reluctance to have sexual contact with someone for the first time.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;Avila, K. [http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/jan05/art_0105_1.shtml "Boy's Love and Yaoi Revisited"]. ''Sequential Tart''. January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Zanghellini notes that illustrations of anal sex almost always position the characters to face each other, rather than in the '[[doggy style]].' Zanghellini also notes that the uke rarely [[fellates]] the ''seme'', but instead receives the sexual and romantic attentions of the ''seme''.&lt;ref name=Zanghellini/&gt;

Though these tropes are common in yaoi, not all works adhere to them.&lt;ref name = "Yowie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="girly uke"/&gt;  Carola Bauer states that the "[[butch and femme|butch-femme]]" couple dynamic discussed above became essential in the commercially published fiction of the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Bauer p.82"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bauer|first1=Carola|title=Naughty girls and gay male romance/porn : slash fiction, boys' love manga, and other works by Female "Cross-Voyeurs" in the U.S. Academic Discourses|date=2013|publisher=Anchor Academic Publishing|location=[S.l.]|isbn=3954890011|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLelland says that authors are "interested in exploring, not repudiating" the dynamics between the seme and uke.&lt;ref name="WorldofYaoi"&gt;McLelland, Mark.

===Bara===
{{Main|Bara (genre)}}
Although sometimes conflated with yaoi by [[western world|Western]] commentators, gay men's manga or gei comi, also called ''Men's Love'' (''ML'') in English and ''bara'' in Japan, caters to a gay male audience rather than a female one and tends to be produced primarily by gay and bisexual male artists (such as [[Gengoroh Tagame]]) and serialized in gay men's magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =  McLelland| first =  Mark| title = Male homosexuality in modern Japan| publisher = Routledge| year = 2000| pages = 131, ff| isbn = 0-7007-1300-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bara is an even smaller [[niche market|niche genre]] in Japan than yaoi manga.&lt;ref name="Bara1"&gt;{{cite web | title=A Comics Reader's Guide to Manga Scanlations | author=Dirk Deppey | url=http://archives.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=430&amp;Itemid=70&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=0 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406102805/http://archives.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=430&amp;Itemid=70&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=0 | archivedate=2012-04-06 | publisher=[[The Comics Journal]] | accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered a subgenre of seijin (men's erotica) for gay males, bara more closely resembles comics for men ([[seinen]]) rather than comics written for female readers (shōjo/[[josei]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Few titles have been licensed or [[scanlation|scanlated]] for English-language markets.&lt;ref name = Bara1/&gt;

Bara does not aim to recreate the [[gender roles in non-heterosexual communities|heteronormative gender role]]s between the masculine seme and feminine uke types prominent in yaoi that is generally for a female audience. Gay men's manga is unlikely to contain scenes of "uncontrollable weeping or long introspective pauses",&lt;ref name = Elfodiluce/&gt; and is less likely than yaoi to "build up a strong sense of character" before sex scenes occur.&lt;ref name="McLelland 2000 136"&gt;{{cite book |last = McLelland |first = Mark |title = Male homosexuality in modern Japan |publisher = Routledge |year = 2000 |page = 136 |isbn = 0-7007-1300-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men in bara comics are more likely to be stereotypically [[masculine]] in behaviour and are illustrated as "hairy, very muscular, or [having] a few excess pounds"&lt;ref name="Elfodiluce"&gt;{{cite web | last = Elfodiluce | first = Valeriano | title = L'altra faccia dei manga gay | publisher = Gay.it | date = 12 April 2004 | url = http://www.gay.it/channel/cultura/18439/L-ALTRA-FACCIA-DEI-MANGA-GAY.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; akin to [[beefcake]]s or [[Bear (gay culture)|bears]] in [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay culture]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} While bara usually features gay [[romance novel|romanticism]] and [[hentai|adult content]], sometimes of a violent or exploitative nature, it often explores real-world or autobiographical themes and acknowledges the [[taboo]] nature of [[homosexuality in Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The ''gachi muchi'' ("muscley-chubby") subgenre of boys' love, also termed ''bara'' among English-speaking fans,&lt;ref name="BLLab5.13.09"/&gt; represents a crossover between ''bara'' and ''yaoi'', with considerable overlap of writers, artists and art styles.

==Thematic elements==

===Diminished female characters===
Female characters often have very minor roles in yaoi, or are absent altogether.&lt;ref name=Akibayaoi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher 2002"/&gt; Suzuki notes that mothers in particular are portrayed in a negative light, as in ''[[Zetsuai 1989]]'' when the main character as a child witnesses his mother murdering his father. Suzuki suggests this is because the character and reader alike are seeking to substitute the absence of unconditional maternal love with the "forbidden" all-consuming love presented in yaoi.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999.

''Sequential Tart''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yukari Fujimoto]] states of shōnen manga series used as inspiration for yaoi that "it seems that yaoi readings and likeable female characters are mutually exclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fujimoto|first1=Yukari|editor1-last=Berndt|editor1-first=Jaqueline|editor2-last=Kümmerling-Meibauer|editor2-first=Bettina|title=Manga's cultural crossroads|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=1134102836|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early shōnen-ai and yaoi have been regarded as [[misogynistic]], but Lunsing notes a decrease in misogynistic comments from characters and regards the development of the [[yuri (genre)|''yuri'' genre]] as reflecting a reduction of [[Internalized sexism#Internalized Misogyny|internal misogyny]].&lt;ref name="Yaoi Debate"/&gt; Alternatively, yaoi fandom is also viewed as a "refuge" from mainstream culture, which in this paradigm is viewed as inherently misogynistic.&lt;ref name="yaoi redrawing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McHarry |first=Mark |url=http://www.guidemag.com/temp/yaoi/a/mcharry_yaoi.html |title=Yaoi: Redrawing Male Love |journal=The Guide |date=November 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417001927/http://www.guidemag.com/temp/yaoi/a/mcharry_yaoi.html |archivedate=17 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has become more popular to have a female character supporting the couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fermin|first1=Tricia Abigail Santos|title=Appropriating Yaoi and Boys Love in the Philippines: Conflict, Resistance and Imaginations Through and Beyond Japan|journal=[[ejcjs]]|date=2013|volume=13|issue=3|url=http://japanesestudies.org.uk/ejcjs/vol13/iss3/fermin.html|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yaoi author [[Fumi Yoshinaga]] usually includes at least one sympathetic female character in her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=5222&amp;issue=2007-04-01|title=Ichigenme Volume 1|last=Mayerson|first=Ginger|date=1 April 2007|work=The Report Card|publisher=Sequential Tart|accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many female characters in Yaoi who are [[Fujoshi]] themselves.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Gay equality===
Yaoi stories are often strongly [[homosocial]], which gives the men freedom to bond with each other and to pursue shared goals together, as in [[dojinshi]] representations of ''Captain Tsubasa'', or to rival each other, as in ''[[Haru wo Daiteita]]''. This spiritual bond and equal partnership overcomes the male-female power hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Nagaike03&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kazumi | first1 = Nagaike | year = 2003 | title = Perverse Sexualities, Perverse Desires: Representations of Female Fantasies and Yaoi Manga as Pornography Directed at Women | url = | journal = U.S.-Japan Women's Journal | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 76–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be together, many couples depicted in conventional yaoi stories must overcome obstacles that are often emotional or psychological rather than physical. The theme of the protagonists' victory in yaoi has been compared favourably to Western [[fairy tale]]s, as the latter intends to enforce the [[status quo]], but yaoi is "about desire" and seeks "to explore, not circumscribe, possibilities."&lt;ref name="Yaoi EEL"&gt;McHarry, Mark. (2006) "Yaoi" in Gaëtan Brulotte and John Phillips (eds.). ''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature''. New York: Routledge, pp. 1445–1447.&lt;/ref&gt; Akiko Mizoguchi noted that while homosexuality is sometimes still depicted as "shameful" to heighten dramatic tension, yaoi has increasingly featured stories of [[coming out]] and the characters' gradual acceptance within the wider community, such as ''[[Brilliant Blue (manga)|Brilliant Blue]]''. Mizoguchi remarked that yaoi presents a far more gay-friendly depiction of Japanese society, which she contends is a form of activism among yaoi authors.&lt;ref name="Mizoguchi10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mizoguchi |first=Akiko |title=Comics Worlds and the World of Comics: Towards Scholarship on a Global Scale |date=September 2010 |publisher=International Manga Research Center, [[Kyoto Seika University]] |isbn=978-4-905187-01-1 |pages=145–170 |url=http://imrc.jp/2010/09/26/20100924Comics%20Worlds%20and%20the%20World%20of%20Comics.pdf |editor=Berndt, Jaqueline |accessdate=29 October 2010 |location=Kyoto, Japan |chapter=Theorizing comics/manga genre as a productive forum: yaoi and beyond |month= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69VoOtasa?url=http://imrc.jp/2010/09/26/20100924Comics%20Worlds%20and%20the%20World%20of%20Comics.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some longer-form stories, such as ''[[Fake (manga)|FAKE]]'' and ''[[Kizuna: Bonds of Love|Kizuna]]'', depict the couple moving in together and adopting.&lt;ref&gt;Salek, Rebecca (June 2005) [http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/june05/allaccess_0605.shtml More Than Just Mommy and Daddy: "Nontraditional" Families in Comics] ''Sequential Tart''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gay male characters are empowered in yaoi manga, yaoi manga rarely explicitly addresses the reality of [[homophobia]] in Japanese society. According to Hisako Miyoshi, vice editor-in-chief for [[Libre Publishing]], while earlier yaoi focused "more on the homosexual way of life from a realistic perspective", over time the genre has become less realistic and more comedic, and the stories are "simply for entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hadrien |last=de Bats |contribution=Entretien avec Hisako Miyoshi|editor-last=Brient|editor-first=Hervé|title=Homosexualité et manga: le yaoi|publisher=Editions H|series=Manga: 10000 images |year=2008 |isbn=978-2-9531781-0-4 |pages= 17–19 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yaoi manga often have fantastical, historical or futuristic settings, and many fans consider the genre to be an "escapist fantasy".&lt;ref name="Shamoon p.86"&gt;Shamoon, Deborah (July 2004) "Office Sluts and Rebel Flowers: The Pleasures of Japanese Pornographic Comics for Women" in [[Linda Williams (film critic)|Linda Williams]] ed.

===Rape===
[[Rape fantasy]] is a theme commonly found in yaoi manga.&lt;ref name=Nagaike03/&gt; Anal intercourse is understood as a means of expressing commitment to a partner, and in yaoi, the "apparent violence" of rape is transformed into a "measure of passion". While Japanese society often shuns or looks down upon women who are raped in reality, the yaoi genre depicts men who are raped as still "imbued with innocence" and are typically still loved by their rapists after the act, a trope that may have originated with ''[[Kaze to Ki no Uta]]''.&lt;ref name="Suzuki 257-8"&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. "Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon". In Sherrie Inness, ed., ''Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World''. London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp. 257–258 {{ISBN|0-8476-9136-5}}, {{ISBN|0-8476-9137-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rape scenes in yaoi are rarely presented as crimes with an assaulter and a victim: scenes where a seme rapes an uke are not depicted as symptomatic of the "disruptive sexual/violent desires" of the seme, but instead are a signifier of the "uncontrollable love" felt by a seme for an uke. Such scenes are often a [[plot device]] used to make the uke see the seme as more than just a good friend and typically result in the uke falling in love with the seme.&lt;ref name=Nagaike03/&gt; Rape fantasy themes explore the protagonist's lack of responsibility in sex, leading to the [[Climax (narrative)|narrative climax]] of the story, where "the protagonist takes responsibility for his own sexuality".&lt;ref name="Valenti"&gt;{{cite news |last=Valenti  |first=Kristy L. |date=July 2005 |title="Stop, My Butt Hurts!"

The 2003–2005 ''[[Under Grand Hotel]]'', set in a men's prison, has been praised for showing a more realistic depiction of rape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100709022538/http://www.mania.com/under-grand-hotel-vol-01_article_123833.html Under Grand Hotel Vol. #01 - Mania.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as Fusanosuke Inariya (of ''[[Maiden Rose]]'' fame) utilize rape not as the traditional romantic catalyst, but as a tragic dramatic plot element, rendering her stories a subversion of contemporary tropes that reinforce and reflect older tropes such as the prevalence of romantic tragedy themes. Other yaoi tend to depict a relationship that begins as non-consensual and evolves into a consensual relationship. However, Fusanosuke's stories are ones where the characters' relationship begins as consensual and devolves into non-consensual, often due to external societal pressures that label the character's gay relationship as deviant. Her stories are still characterized by fantasy, yet they do brutally and realistically illustrate scenes of sexual assault between characters.&lt;ref name="Frennea"&gt;Frennea, Melissa. (2012).

==Publishing==
[[File:Yaoi Books by miyagawa.jpg|right|thumb|Books on display at a San Francisco Kinokuniya bookstore]]

===Japan===
As of 1990, seven Japanese publishers included BL content in their offerings - which kickstarted the commercial publishing market of the genre.&lt;ref name="Bauer p.82"/&gt;  By 2003, 3.8% of weekly manga magazines were dedicated to BL.&lt;ref name="Galbraith 11"/&gt; A 2008 assessment estimated that the Japanese commercial yaoi market grossed approximately 12 billion yen annually, with novel sales generating 250 million yen per month, manga generating 400 million yen per month, CDs generating 180 million yen per month, and video games generating 160 million yen per month.  As of this time, magazines for BL included [[Be x Boy|BE-BOY]], GUSH, CHARA and CIEL.&lt;ref name="Nagaike"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nagaike|first=Kazumi|date=April 2009|title=Elegant Caucasians, Amorous Arabs, and Invisible Others: Signs and Images of Foreigners in Japanese BL Manga|journal=Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=[[Australian National University]]|issue=20|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/nagaike.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 report estimated that the yaoi market was worth approximately 21.3 billion yen in both 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-10-14/yano-research-reports-on-japan-2009-10-otaku-market Yano Research Reports on Japan's 2009-10 Otaku Market - News - Anime News Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides manga and anime, there are also Boys' Love (BL) games (also known as yaoi games), usually consisting of visual novels or [[H game]]s oriented around male [[homosexual]] couples for the female market. The defining factor is that both the playable character(s) and possible objects of affection are male. As with yaoi manga, the major market is assumed to be female. Games aimed at a homosexual male audience may be referred to as ''[[Bara (genre)|bara]]''. A 2006 breakdown of the Japanese commercial BL market estimated it grosses approximately 12 billion yen annually, with video games generating 160 million yen per month.&lt;ref name=Nagaike/&gt;

===English-speaking countries===
''Yaoi'' manga are sold to English-speaking countries by companies that translate and print them in English. Companies such as [[Digital Manga Publishing]] with their imprints 801 Media (for explicit ''yaoi'') and ''Juné'' (for "romantic and sweet" ''yaoi''),&lt;ref name="Drawn Together"&gt;Strickland, Elizabeth. [http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-10-31/news/drawn-together/full "Drawn Together."] ''The Village Voice''. 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Kitty Media]], and [[Viz Media]] under their imprint SuBLime. Companies that formerly published yaoi manga but are now defunct include [[DramaQueen]], [[Central Park Media]]'s [[Be Beautiful]],&lt;ref name = Boston/&gt; ''[[Tokyopop]]'' under their imprint BLU, [[Broccoli (company)|''Broccoli'']] under their Boysenberry imprint, and [[Aurora Publishing (United States)|Aurora Publishing]] under their imprint [[Deux Press]]. Yaoi Press, based in Las Vegas and specializing in yaoi that is not of Japanese origin, remains active.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} According to McLelland, the earliest officially translated English-language ''yaoi'' manga was printed in 2003, and as of 2006 there were about 130 English-translated works commercially available.&lt;ref name="bonking"/&gt; In March 2007, [[Media Blasters]] stopped selling ''shōnen'' manga and increased their ''yaoi'' lines in anticipation of publishing one or two titles per month that year.&lt;ref&gt;Cha, Kai-Ming (13 March 2007) [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/1918-media-blasters-drops-shonen-adds-yaoi-.html Media Blasters Drops Shonen; Adds Yaoi] ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 135 yaoi manga published in North America between 2003 and 2006, 14% were rated for readers aged 13 years or over, 39% were rated for readers aged 15 or older, and 47% were rated for readers age 18 and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLelland | first1 = Mark | last2 = Yoo | first2 = Seunghyun | year = 2007 | title = The International Yaoi Boys' Love Fandom and the Regulation of Virtual Child Pornography: The Implications of Current Legislation | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/artspapers/192/ | journal = [[Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy|Sexuality Research and Social Policy: Journal of NSRC]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 93–104 | doi = 10.1525/srsp.2007.4.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although American booksellers were increasingly stocking ''yaoi'' titles in 2008, their restrictions led publishers to label books conservatively, often rating books originally intended for a mid-teen readership as 18+ and distributing them in shrinkwrap.&lt;ref name="Pagliassotti BL West"/&gt; [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] valued the sales of yaoi manga in the United States at approximately [[$US]] six million in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Cha, Kai-Ming (10 August 2008) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/08/RVR110R7D9.DTL&amp;type=books Brokeback comics craze] San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 2007, there were over 10 publishers in North America offering yaoi materials.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Christopher (11 December 2007).

Only a select few yaoi games have been officially translated into English. In 2006, [[JAST USA]] announced they would be releasing ''Enzai'' as ''[[Enzai: Falsely Accused]]'', the first license of a yaoi game in English translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2006-01-16/jast-usa-announces-first-boy's-love-pc-dating-game|title=JAST USA Announces First "Boy's Love" PC Dating-Game|date=16 January 2006|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fan communities have criticized the choice of such a dark and unromantic game as the US market's first exposure to the genre.

===Fan fiction ===
The Japanese [[fan fiction]] (''[[dōjinshi]]'') subculture emerged contemporaneously with its English equivalent in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Drawn Together"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yaoi redrawing"/&gt; Characteristic similarities of fan fiction in both countries include non-adherence to a standard "narrative structure" and a particular popularity of science fiction themes.&lt;ref name="Kinsella Otaku 1990s"/&gt; The early yaoi dōjinshi were amateur publications not controlled by media restrictions. The stories were written by teenagers for an adolescent audience and were generally based on manga or anime characters who were likewise in their teens or early twenties.&lt;ref name="yaoi redrawing"/&gt; Most dōjinshi are created by [[amateurs]] who often work in "circles".&lt;ref&gt;Ishikawa, Yu (2008)  [http://educa.lit.osaka-cu.ac.jp/~ggp/nakami/2008/Comparative%20Studies%20on%20Urban%20Cultures02.pdf#page=33 Yaoi: Fan Art in Japan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722073442/http://educa.lit.osaka-cu.ac.jp/~ggp/nakami/2008/Comparative%20Studies%20on%20Urban%20Cultures02.pdf |date=22 July 2011 }} (PDF) in ''Compilation of papers and seminar proceedings - Comparative Studies on Urban Cultures'', 17–19 September 2008, Osaka City University, pp.37-42 The International School Office, Graduate School of Literature and Human Sciences, Osaka City University.

Typical yaoi dōjinshi features male-male pairings from non-romantic manga and anime. Much of the material derives from male-oriented shōnen and seinen works which contain close male-male friendships and are perceived by fans to imply elements of [[homoeroticism]],&lt;ref name="out of hand"/&gt; such as with ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]''&lt;ref name="pedagogy"/&gt; and ''[[Saint Seiya]]'', two titles which popularized yaoi in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="yaoi redrawing"/&gt; ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'' is known to have a large female readership who engage in yaoi readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fujimoto|first1=Yukari|editor1-last=Berndt|editor1-first=Jaqueline|editor2-last=Kümmerling-Meibauer|editor2-first=Bettina|title=Manga's cultural crossroads|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=1134102836|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers of shōnen manga may create "homoerotic-themed" merchandise as [[fan service]] to their BL fans.&lt;ref&gt;McHarry, Mark (2011).

===Yaoi-inspired works outside Japan===
As yaoi gained popularity in the United States, a few American artists began creating [[original English-language manga]] for female readers featuring  male-male couples referred to as "American yaoi."

A large portion of Western fans choose to [[Copyright infringement|pirate]] yaoi material because they are unable or unwilling to obtain it through sanctioned methods. For example, fans may lack a credit card for payment, or they may want to keep their yaoi private because of the dual stigma of seeking sexually explicit material which is also gay.

==Critical reception==

===General===
Boys' love manga has received considerable critical attention, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside Japan in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="out of hand"/&gt; Different critics and commentators have had very different views of BL. In 1983, [[Frederik L. Schodt]], an American manga writer and translator, has observed that portrayals of gay male relationships had used and further developed bisexual themes already in existence in shoujo manga to appeal to their female audience.&lt;ref name="Schodt83"&gt;Schodt, Frederik L. (1983) ''[[Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics]]''. pages 100–101 Tokyo and New York: Kodansha International. {{ISBN|0-87011-752-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese critics have viewed boys' love as a genre that permits their audience to avoid adult [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] by distancing sex from their own bodies,&lt;ref name="Ueno89"&gt;Ueno, Chizuko (1989) "Jendaaresu waarudo no "ai" no jikken" ("Experimenting with "love" in a Genderless World"). In ''Kikan Toshi II'' ("Quarterly City II"), Tokyo: Kawade Shobō Shinsha, {{ISBN|4-309-90222-7}}. Cited and translated in Thorn, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to create fluidity in perceptions of gender and sexuality and rejects "socially mandated" [[gender role]]s as a "first step toward feminism."&lt;ref name="Takemiya"&gt;[[Keiko Takemiya|Takemiya, Keiko]]. (1993) "Josei wa gei ga suki!?" (Women Like Gays!?) '' Bungei shunjū'', [[June (manga magazine)|Juné]], pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Kazuko Suzuki, for example, believes that the audience's aversion to or contempt for masculine  [[heterosexism]] is something which has consciously emerged as a result of the genre's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. (1999) "Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon". In Sherrie Inness, ed., ''Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World''. London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p.246 {{ISBN|0-8476-9136-5}}, {{ISBN|0-8476-9137-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mizoguchi, writing in 2003, feels that BL is a "female-gendered space," as the writers, readers, artists and most of the editors of BL are female.&lt;ref name=MizoguchiSubgenres/&gt; BL has been compared to [[romance novels]] by English-speaking librarians.&lt;ref name=yaoi101/&gt;&lt;ref name="Romance by Any Other Name"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brenner |first=Robin |date=15 September 2007 |title=Romance by Any Other Name |url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6477427.html |deadurl=yes |journal=[[Library Journal]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607130508/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6477427.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels have also been noted in the popularity of [[lesbianism in pornography]],&lt;ref name = revisited/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonking/&gt; and yaoi has been called a form of "female [[sexual fetishism|fetishism]]".&lt;ref name="Visual Kei"&gt;Hashimoto, Miyuki [http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2007v16n1/10%20Miyuki%20Hashimoto.pdf Visual Kei Otaku Identity—An Intercultural Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607051816/http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2007v16n1/10%20Miyuki%20Hashimoto.pdf |date=7 June 2011 }} Intercultural Communication Studies XVI: 1 2007 pp. 87–99&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariko Ōhara]], a science fiction writer, has said that she wrote ''yaoi'' [[Kirk/Spock]] fiction as a teen because she could not enjoy "conventional pornography, which had been made for men", and that she had found a "limitless freedom" in yaoi, much like in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffery, Larry; Gregory, Sinda; Kotani, Mari; Takayuki, Tatsumi (n.d.)

Other commentators have suggested that more radical gender-political issues underlie BL. In 1998, Shihomi Sakakibara argued that yaoi fans, including himself, were gay female-to-male [[transsexual]]s.&lt;ref name="Sakakibara"&gt;Sakakibara, Shihomi (1998) ''Yaoi genron: yaoi kara mieta mono'' (An Elusive Theory of Yaoi: The view from Yaoi). Tokyo: Natsume Shobo, {{ISBN|4-931391-42-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandra Buckley believes that bishounen narratives champion "the imagined potentialities of alternative [gender] differentiations",&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;Buckley, Sandra (1991) "'Penguin in Bondage': A Graphic Tale of Japanese Comic Books", pp. 163–196, In ''Technoculture''. C. Penley and A. Ross, eds. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota {{ISBN|0-8166-1932-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while James Welker described the bishounen character as "[[queer]]", commenting that manga critic Akiko Mizoguchi saw ''shōnen-ai'' as playing a role in how she herself had become a lesbian.&lt;ref name="Welker06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welker | first1 = James | year = 2006 | title = Beautiful, Borrowed, and Bent: 'Boys' Love' as Girls' Love in Shôjo Manga' | url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 31 | issue = 3| page = 843 | doi = 10.1086/498987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dru Pagliassotti sees this and the ''yaoi ronsō'' as indicating that for Japanese gay and lesbian readers, BL is not as far removed from reality as heterosexual female readers like to claim.&lt;ref name="Pagliassotti BL West"/&gt; Welker has also written that boys love titles liberate the female audience "not just from patriarchy, but from gender dualism and heteronormativity."&lt;ref name="Welker06"/&gt;

===Criticism===
Some gay and lesbian commentators have criticized how gay identity is portrayed in BL, most notably in the ''yaoi ronsō'' or "''yaoi'' debate" of 1992–1997.&lt;ref name="Yaoi Debate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mori Mari"/&gt; A trope of yaoi that has attracted criticism is male protagonists who do not identify as gay, but are rather simply in love with each other. This is said to heighten the theme of all-conquering love,&lt;ref name="Akibayaoi"&gt;Lees, Sharon (June 2006). [http://www.akibaangels.com/articles/06_2006/yaoiandBL.php "Yaoi and Boys' Love"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102055333/http://www.akibaangels.com/articles/06_2006/yaoiandBL.php |date=2 January 2016 }}.

Make Me Puke] ''Sequential Tart'' February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese gay activist Satou Masaki criticized ''yaoi'' fans and artists in an [[open letter]] to the feminist [[zine]] ''Choisir ''in May 1992, writing that the genre was lacking in any accurate information about gay men and conveniently avoided the very real prejudice and discrimination that gay men faced as a part of society. More significantly, its portrayal of gay men as wealthy, handsome and well-educated was simply a vehicle for heterosexual female masturbation fantasies.&lt;ref name="Yaoi Debate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mori Mari"/&gt; An extensive debate ensued, with yaoi fans and artists arguing that ''yaoi'' is entertainment for women, not education for gay men, and that ''yaoi'' characters are not meant to represent "real gay men."&lt;ref name="Mori Mari"/&gt; As internet resources for gay men developed in the 1990s, the ''yaoi'' debate waned&lt;ref&gt;Blackarmor (19 February 2008) "A Follow-Up To the Yaoi Debate" http://blackarmor.exblog.jp/7508722/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317045016/http://blackarmor.exblog.jp/7508722/ |date=17 March 2011 }} (In Japanese.) Accessed 14 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but occasionally resurfaced; for example, when Mizoguchi in 2003 characterized stereotypes in modern BL as being "unrealistic and homophobic".&lt;ref name="MizoguchiAASAM"&gt;Mizoguchi, Akiko. (2003) "Homophobic Homos, Rapes of Love, and Queer Lesbians: Yaoi as a Conflicting Site of Homo/ Hetero-Sexual Female Sexual Fantasy".

There has been similar criticism to the Japanese ''yaoi'' debate in the English-speaking fandom.&lt;ref name = "Yowie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Christopher (18 August 2006). [http://comics212.net/older/2006_08_01_archive.shtml A Few Comments About The Gay/Yaoi Divide – Strong enough for a man, but made for a woman...]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M.J. (May 2002). [http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/may02/ao_0502_4.shtml "A Brief History of Yaoi"]. ''Sequential Tart''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McHarry, Mark. "Identity Unmoored: Yaoi in the West". In Thomas Peele, ed., ''Queer Popular Culture: Literature, Media, Film, and Television''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4039-7490-X}}. pp. 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 and 2004, [[Matt Thorn]] pointed to the complexity of these phenomena, and suggested that ''yaoi'' and [[slash fiction]] fans are discontented with "the standards of femininity to which they are expected to adhere and a [[social environment]] that does not validate or sympathize with that discontent."&lt;ref name="out of hand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorn1993"&gt;Thorn, Matt. (1993) "Unlikely Explorers: Alternative Narratives of Love, Sex, Gender, and Friendship in Japanese Girls' Comics."

In China, BL became very popular in the late 1990s, attracting media attention, which became negative, focusing on the challenge it posed to "heterosexual hegemony." Publishing and distributing BL is illegal in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/liu.htm |title=Intersections: Conflicting Discourses on Boys' Love and Subcultural Tactics in Mainland China and Hong Kong |publisher=Intersections.anu.edu.au |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zanghellini notes that due to the "characteristics of the yaoi/BL genre" of showing characters who are often [[underage]] engaging in romantic and sexual situations, child pornography laws in [[Child pornography laws in Australia|Australia]] and [[Child pornography laws in Canada|Canada]] "may lend themselves to targeting yaoi/BL work". He notes that in the [[Child pornography laws in the United Kingdom|UK]], cartoons are exempt from child pornography laws unless they are used for [[child grooming]].&lt;ref name=Zanghellini/&gt;

In 2001, a controversy erupted in [[Thailand]] regarding gay male comics. Television reports labelled the comics as negative influences, while a newspaper falsely stated that most of the comics were not copyrighted as the publishers feared arrest for posting the content; in reality most of the titles were likely illegally published without permission from the original Japanese publishers. The ''shōnen ai'' comics provided profits for the comic shops, which sold between 30 and 50 such comics per day. The moral panic regarding the gay male comics subsided. The Thai girls felt too embarrassed to read heterosexual stories, so they read gay male-themed josei and shōjo stories, which they saw as "unthreatening."&lt;ref&gt;Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. ''The Essential Guide to World Comics''. ''[[Collins &amp; Brown]]''. 2005. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Youka Nitta has said that "even in Japan, reading boys' love isn't something that parents encourage" and encouraged any parents who had concerns about her works to read them.&lt;ref&gt;Cha, Kai-Ming. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080918083027/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6332853.html Embracing Youka Nitta]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6YlIcwNFL?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080918083027/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6332853.html Archive]). ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. 5/9/2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in Japan, concern about manga has been mostly directed to ''shōnen'' manga, in 2006, an email campaign was launched against the availability of BL manga in [[Sakai City]]'s public library. In August 2008, the library decided to stop buying more BL, and to keep its existing BL in a collection restricted to adult readers. That November, the library was contacted by people who protested against the removal, regarding it as "a form of sexual discrimination". The Japanese media ran stories on how much BL was in public libraries, and emphasised that this sexual material had been loaned out to minors. Debate ensued on [[Mixi]], a Japanese social networking site, and the library would return its BL to the public collection. Mark McLelland suggests that BL may become "a major battlefront for proponents and detractors of '[[gender equality|gender free]]' policies in employment, education and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/mclelland.htm |title=Intersections: (A)cute Confusion: The Unpredictable Journey of Japanese Popular Culture |publisher=Intersections.anu.edu.au |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
