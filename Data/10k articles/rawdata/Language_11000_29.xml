It is unusual for its many [[phoneme]]s and for its contrast between several [[voiceless velar lateral fricative]]s, {{IPA|/ʟ̝̊, ʟ̝̊ʷ, ʟ̝̊ː, ʟ̝̊ːʷ/}}, [[voiceless velar lateral affricate|voiceless]] and [[ejective velar lateral affricate]]s, {{IPA|/k͡ʟ̝̊, k͡ʟ̝̊ʷ, k͡ʟ̝̊ʼ, k͡ʟ̝̊ʷʼ/}}, and a [[voiced velar lateral fricative]], {{IPA|/ʟ̝/}}. It is an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] language with four noun classes&lt;ref name="tutorial"&gt;[http://www.archi.surrey.ac.uk/handout.pdf The Archi language tutorial, presenting an overview of the grammar of Archi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904070032/http://www.archi.surrey.ac.uk/handout.pdf |date=2011-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a remarkable [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] system with huge paradigms and irregularities on all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archi.surrey.ac.uk/ |title=Archi language home page of the Surrey Morphology Group |publisher= |accessdate=14 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301205015/http://www.archi.surrey.ac.uk/ |archivedate=1 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, there are 1,502,839 possible forms that can be derived from a single verb root.&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;Kibrik, A. E. (2001). "Archi (Caucasian—Daghestanian)", ''The Handbook of Morphology'', Blackwell, pg. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The classification of the Archi language has not been definitively established. [[Peter von Uslar]] felt it should be considered a variant of [[Avar language|Avar]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, but [[Roderich von Erckert]] saw it as closer to [[Lak language|Lak]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. The language has also been considered as a separate entity that could be placed somewhere between Avar and Lak{{By whom|date=January 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. The Italian linguist [[Alfredo Trombetti]] placed Archi within an Avar–Ando–Dido group{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, but today the most widely recognized opinion follows that of the Soviet scholar [[Yevgeny Bokarev|Bokarev]], who regards Archi as one of the Lezgian–Samur group of the Dagestan languages.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Schulze places it in the [[Lezgic languages|Lezgian branch]] with all other Lezgian languages belonging to the [[Samur languages|Samur group]].&lt;ref name="lrz-muenchen.de"/&gt;

==Phonology==
Archi has, like its [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] relatives, a very complicated phonological system, with Archi being an extreme example. It has 26 vowel [[phoneme]]s and, depending on analysis, between 74 and 82 consonant phonemes.

===Vowels===
Archi has a symmetric six-vowel system ({{IPA|/i e ə a o u/}}).&lt;ref name="tutorial"/&gt; All except {{IPA|/ə/}} can occur in five varieties: short, pharyngealized, high tone, long (with high tone), and pharyngealized with high tone (e.g. {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/aˤ/}}, {{IPA|/á/}}, {{IPA|/áː/}}, and {{IPA|/áˤ/}}). Of all these, only {{IPA|/ə/}} and {{IPA|/íˤ/}} do not occur word-initially.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/Archi/Linguists/index.aspx|title=Archi Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of non-initial {{IPA|/íˤ/}} are {{IPA|/díˤt͡ʃa/}} ('to be fat')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/Archi/Linguists/lexeme.aspx?LE=1083|title=Archi - 1083 - диIча|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|/iˤntíˤmmaj/}} ('brain').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/Archi/Linguists/lexeme.aspx?LE=1420|title=Archi - 1420 - иIнтиIммай|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
Of the languages without [[click consonant]]s, Archi has one of the largest consonant inventories, with the recently extinct [[Ubykh phonology|Ubykh]] of the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] having a few more. The table below shows all consonants that can be found in the Archi Language Tutorial&lt;ref name="tutorial"/&gt; and the Archi Dictionary.&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;

Of the consonants listed above, the ones in &lt;span style="color:#DE7B1A;"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt; have no word-initial dictionary entries (even though {{IPA|/pː/}}, {{IPA|/tː/}}, and {{IPA|/kː/}} are relatively common), the one in &lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; does not appear in the Tutorial but does have a word-internal dictionary entry (in {{IPA|/mot͡sːór/}}, 'alpine pasture used in summer'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/Archi/Linguists/lexeme.aspx?LE=2101|title=Archi - 2101 - моццор|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ones in &lt;span style="color:#007CC3;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; appear in the Tutorial but have no dictionary entries.

Some of these sounds are very rare. For example, {{IPA|/ʁˤʷ/}} has only one dictionary entry word-internally (in {{IPA|/íʁˤʷdut/}}, 'heavy')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/Archi/Linguists/lexeme.aspx?LE=1387|title=Archi - 1387 - игъIвдут|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two entries word-initially. Likewise, {{IPA|/ʟ̝/}} has only two dictionary entries: {{IPA|/náʟ̝dut/}} ('blue; unripe')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/Archi/Linguists/lexeme.aspx?LE=2213|title=Archi - 2213 - наIкьдут|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|/k͡ʟ̝̊ʼéʟ̝dut/}} ('crooked, curved').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/Archi/Linguists/lexeme.aspx?LE=1838|title=Archi - 1838 - кьекьдут|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] consonants are not simply two instances of the same consonant, though they do appear largely complementary, with the double instances {{IPA|/mm/}}, {{IPA|/ll/}}, and {{IPA|/nn/}} being the most common and {{IPA|/zz/}} less so. That said, {{IPA|/pp/}} can still be found in {{IPA|/ʟ̝̊íppu/}} ('three').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/Archi/Linguists/lexeme.aspx?LE=3833|title=Archi - 3833 - лъибтIу|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also noted by {{Harvcoltxt|Kodzasov|1977}},&lt;ref&gt;translated in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; who describes the fortis consonants as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Strong phonemes are characterized by the intensiveness (tension) of the articulation. The intensity of the pronunciation leads to a natural lengthening of the duration of the sound, and that is why strong [consonants] differ from weak ones by greater length. [However,] the adjoining of two single weak sounds does not produce a strong one […] Thus, the gemination of a sound does not by itself create its tension."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[voiceless velar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|/ʟ̝̊/}}, the [[voiced velar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|/ʟ̝/}}, and the [[voiceless velar lateral affricate|corresponding voiceless]] and [[ejective velar lateral affricate|ejective affricate]]s {{IPA|/k͡ʟ̝̊/}}, {{IPA|/k͡ʟ̝̊ʼ/}} are extremely unusual speech sounds among the languages of the world, because [[Voiceless velar fricative|velar fricatives]] are usually [[central consonant|central]] rather than lateral. The velar laterals are further forward than velars in most languages and could better be called prevelar, like the Tutorial does.&lt;ref name="tutorial"/&gt;

==Orthography==
Until recently Archi did not have a written form, except in studies by specialists who used the [[Latin script]]. In 2006, the [[Surrey Morphology Group]] developed a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]] for Archi based on the [[Avar language#Orthography|Avar]] alphabet, which is used in the Archi–Russian–English Dictionary alongside an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}

===Nouns===
Archi nouns inflect for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural) and for one of 10 regular [[grammatical case|cases]] and 5 [[List of grammatical cases#Place and time|locative cases]] that can all take one of 6 directional suffixes.&lt;ref name="tutorial"/&gt; There are four [[noun class]]es, which are only evident from [[Grammatical conjugation#Verbal agreement|verbal agreement]].&lt;ref name="tutorial"/&gt;

====Case====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Case !! Marker !! Sg. 'ram' !! Pl. 'rams'
|-
| [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]]    || -∅      || baˁkʼ             || baˁkʼ-ur
|-
| [[Ergative case|Ergative]]      || -∅      || beˁkʼ-iri         || baˁkʼ-ur-čaj
|-
| [[Genitive case|Genitive]]      || -n      || beˁkʼ-iri-n       || baˁkʼ-ur-če-n
|-
| [[Dative case|Dative]]        || -s, -sː || beˁkʼ-iri-s       || baˁkʼ-ur-če-s
|-
| [[Comitative case|Comitative]]    || -ʟ̝̊ːu    || beˁkʼ-iri-ʟ̝̊ːu     || baˁkʼ-ur-če-ʟ̝̊ːu
|-
| [[Similative case|Similative]]    || -qˁdi   || beˁkʼ-iri-qˁdi    || baˁkʼ-ur-če-qˁdi
|-
| [[Causal case|Causal]]        || -šːi    || beˁkʼ-iri-šːi     || baˁkʼ-ur-če-šːi
|-
| [[Comparative case|Comparative]]   || -χur    || beˁkʼ-iri-χur     || baˁkʼ-ur-če-χur
|-
| [[Partitive case|Partitive]]     || -qˁiš   || beˁkʼ-iri-qˁiš    || baˁkʼ-ur-če-qˁiš
|-
| [[Substitutive case|Substitutive]]  || -k͡ʟ̝̊ʼəna  || beˁkʼ-iri-k͡ʟ̝̊ʼəna || baˁkʼ-ur-če-k͡ʟ̝̊ʼəna
|}

Depending on the specifics of the analysis, neither the ergative nor absolutive cases are necessarily marked by a specific suffix. Rather, they are marked by the use of the basic (for the absolutive) and oblique (for the ergative) stems in the absence of other markers. There is also a locative-case series, where 6 directional-case suffixes are combined with 5 spatial cases to produce a total of 30 case-localization combinations. However, these do not constitute 30 distinct case forms, because they are easily derivable from a pair of morphemes.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Spatial case !! Marker !! Directional case !! Marker
|-
| [[Inessive case|Inessive]] ("in")    || -aj / -a   || [[Essive case|Essive]] ("As")     || -∅

|-

====Noun classes====
The four [[noun class]]es of Archi are only evident from verbal inflection. The table below summarizes these noun classes and their associated verbal morphology.

==Example phrases==
The following phrases were [[Phonetic transcription|phonetically transcribed]] from Archi:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubotsky|first=Alexander|title=Van Sanskriet tot Spijkerschrift: Breinbrekers uit alle talen|language=Dutch|trans-title=From Sanskrit to Cuneiform: Brain teasers from all languages|pages=17, 68-69|access-date=30 April 2016|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year = 2010|isbn=9089641793|url=http://dare.uva.nl/cgi/arno/show.cgi?fid=174594}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| dogi ebku || The donkey fell.
|-
| q̇on abč̣u || The goat hid itself.
|-
| nôiš ebx̄u || The horse stayed.
|}

===Diminutive===
The inclusions of "little" and "young" in the phrases above refer to a [[diminutive]] form of the verb, which in Archi language commonly refers either to a smaller or younger version of the subject. While nouns pertaining to smaller objects such as items stay the same regardless of whether it is a diminutive or not (e.g. ''x́it'' for both "ladle" and "spoon", ''k̂ut̄ali'' for both "bag" and "little bag" etc.), nouns pertaining to younger animals change into entirely different words (e.g. ''dogi'' "donkey" but ''ḳêrt'' "young donkey", ''nôiš'' "horse" but ''uri'' "young horse" etc.). The verb changes to fit the diminutive regardless of whether the noun changes or not. In the past tense this is done by removing the -b- in front of the -x̄u/-č̣u/-ku inflection. In the present tense this is done by removing the b- as the first letter of the verb.

'''B.T. Lalitha Naik''' (born 4 April 1945) is an Indian politician, writer, and social activist. A former minister for Kannada, Culture, and Department of Women &amp; Child Welfare in the [[Government of Karnataka]]&lt;ref name="AAP springs a surprise in Gulbarga" /&gt; Naik has also served as an MLC (1986-1992) and MLA (1994-1999). She won the [[Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award]] in 1991. She is also known for leading important literary, social and language-rights movements such as [[Bandaya movement]] and [[Gokak agitation]].

== Personal life ==

Lalitha Naik was born in a [[Lambani]] family on 4 April 1945, in Tangali Tanda(now V.L.Nagara), a small village in [[Kadur]], [[Chikmagalur]], to the agriculturalists, (late) Balaji Naik and Ganga Bai.

Naik married Champla Naik in the late 60s and was married to him until his death in 1996. She has three sons from the marriage.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandra Dutt|first1=Kartik|title=Who's Who of Indian Writers 1999: A&amp;ndash;M|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788126008735|page=665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA1V7sICaIwC&amp;pg=PA665&amp;lpg=PA665|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of B.T.

Lalitha Naik is the grand-niece of the renowned [[Bharatanatyam]] danseuse [[K. Venkatalakshamma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ನಾಯಕ್ [Naik]|first1=ಬಿ.ಟಿ. ಲಲಿತಾ [B.T.

== Writing career ==

After her marriage, Naik, started writing radio plays about the trials and tribulations of middle class life for the local [[Akashavani]] station. Encouraged by the popularity she started writing and contributing poems, short stories and articles for prominent Kannada periodicals such as [[Sudha (weekly magazine)|Sudha]], [[Prajavani]] and Taranga. When her novella, ''Nele Bele'', won an award in the annual novella competition conducted by Sudha magazine, she was invited by the writer [[P. Lankesh]] to contribute to his newly started tabloid ''[[Lankesh Patrike]]''. Naik started writing regularly for the tabloid and was soon recognized for her sensitivity, social commitment and progressive views. Her popularity as a writer and journalist led her to being nominated as Member of the [[Karnataka Legislative Council]] (MLC) by the then [[List of Chief Ministers of Karnataka|Chief Minister]] [[Ramakrishna Hegde]].&lt;ref name="KKC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gundurao |first1=Y.N. |title=B.T.

Author of sixteen books, she is also known for her plays, children's fiction and essays. She won the [[Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="KKC" /&gt; Her novel ''Gati'' has been translated into English, and her stories and poems have been translated into English, [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] languages. Her works are part of the syllabus in several universities in Karnataka.&lt;ref name="wel" /&gt;

== Political career ==

While serving as MLC (1986&amp;ndash;1992) Naik joined the Janata Dal, inspired by the socialist ideals of [[Shantaveri Gopala Gowda]] and [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= ಸಮಾಜವಾದದ ಅನುಷ್ಠಾನವೇ ವೆಲ್ಫೇರ್ ಪಾರ್ಟಿಯ ಉದ್ದೇಶ: ಲಲಿತಾ ನಾಯಕ್|trans-title=Aim of Welfare Party is implementation of socialism: Lalitha Naik|url=http://vijaykarnataka.indiatimes.com/articleshow/19174768.cms|work=Vijaya Karnataka|date=24 March 2013|language=Kannada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 she was elected MLA from [[Raichur (Lok Sabha constituency)#Assembly segments|Devadurga]] constituency, Raichur on a Janata Dal ticket, and was made Minister for Kannada, Culture, and Department of Women &amp; Child Welfare in the [[J. H. Patel]] government. Barely two years into her tenure as minister, her son Vishwajit was accused of defiling the statue of [[B.R. Ambedkar]] at B.R. Ambedkar Medical College, Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rajesh|first1=Y.P|title=Avenging Ambedkar|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Avenging-Ambedkar/200396|work=Outlook magazine|date=13 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though subsequent investigations revealed the allegations to be baseless, she was forced to step down at that time. She also served as the President of Women's Janata Dal. After the split of Janata Dal in 1999 into Janata Dal (Secular) and Janata Dal (United), she joined Janata Dal (Secular) headed by [[H.D. Deve Gowda]]. She was a member of its National Executive. Later she quit Janata Dal (Secular) over Gowda's decision to form alliance with [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Welfare Party is the Answer for a Better India: Lalita Naik|url=http://www.karnatakamuslims.com/portal/welfare-party-is-the-answer-for-a-better-india-lalita-naik/|accessdate=2 September 2014|publisher=Karnataka Muslims|date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later joined [[Janata Party]], but left it in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lalitha Naik quits JP|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/Lalitha-Naik-quits-JP/articleshow/775721.cms|work=Times of India|date=13 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, she joined the [[Welfare Party of India]] and served as its National Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lalitha Naik inaugurates Udupi unit of the Welfare Party of India |url=http://www.megamedianews.in/index.php/90553/lalitha-naik-inaugurates-udupi-unit-of-the-welfare-party-of-india/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903133842/http://www.megamedianews.in/index.php/90553/lalitha-naik-inaugurates-udupi-unit-of-the-welfare-party-of-india/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 September 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2014 |publisher=megamedia News |date=26 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections she contested from the [[Gulbarga (Lok Sabha constituency)|Gulbarga constituency]] on an [[Aam Aadmi Party]] ticket and lost to [[Mallikarjun Kharge]].&lt;ref name="AAP springs a surprise in Gulbarga"&gt;{{cite news|title=AAP springs a surprise in Gulbarga|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/aap-springs-a-surprise-in-gulbarga/article5774472.ece|work=The Hindu|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sivanandan|first1=T.

In 2016, Naik was one of 7 JD(S) MLAs suspended for cross voting for candidates of different parties in the [[Indian Rajya Sabha elections, 2016|2016 Rajya Sabha]] election.

Lalitha Naik participated in several social-literary movements of the 1980s including Bandaya movement, a protest movement for social equality and justice, and [[Gokak agitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puttappa|first1=Dr.Patila|title=ಕನ್ನಡ ನಾಡು ನುಡಿ|trans-title=The Kannada Land and Language|date=2005|publisher=Directorate of Publications, Kannada University|edition=Chapter 9 : Gokak Movement|language=Kannada|url=http://kanaja.in/archives/7336}}&lt;/ref&gt; An avowed feminist Lalitha Naik has strongly appealed for the passing of [[Women's Reservation Bill]] in both central and state legislatures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Naik|first1=B.T.

'''Barngarla''', formerly known as '''Parnkalla''', is an [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal language]] of [[Eyre Peninsula]], [[South Australia]], [[Australia]].

"In 2011 an [[Israelis|Israeli]] linguist, working with [[University of Adelaide|Adelaide University]] and the chair of linguistics and endangered languages, [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Professor Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], contacted the Barngarla community about helping to revive and reclaim the Barngarla language. This request was eagerly accepted by the [[Barngarla people]] and language reclamation workshops began in [[Port Lincoln]], [[Whyalla]] and [[Port Augusta]] in 2012" (Barngarla man Stephen Atkinson, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/language-lost-and-regained/story-e6frgcko-1226723462161 Language lost and regained / Barngarla man Stephen Atkinson, The Australian, 20 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The reclamation is based on 170-year-old documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/australias-unspeakable-indigenous-tragedy Australia’s unspeakable indigenous tragedy / Lainie Anderson, 6 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Section 282 in [http://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2015/2015fca0009 FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA: Croft on behalf of the Barngarla Native Title Claim Group v State of South Australia] (2015, FCA 9), File number: SAD 6011 of 1998; [[John Mansfield (judge)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 a mobile app featuring a dictionary of over 3000 Barngarla words was publicly released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/4222576/barngarla-app-to-share-language-gallery/?cs=1500|title=Barngarla app to share language {{!}} GALLERY|last=Harrison|first=Billie|date=2016-10-12|work=Port Lincoln Times|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barry M. Farber''' (born May 5, 1930) is an American [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] radio talk show host, author, commentator and language-learning enthusiast. In 2002, industry publication ''[[Talkers magazine]]'' ranked him the 9th greatest radio talk show host of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkers.com/greatest/ The 25 Greatest Radio Talk Show Hosts of All Time], ''Talkers Magazine Online''. Retrieved November 9. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written articles appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]''. He is the father of journalist [[Celia Farber]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa%3DArticles.showArticle%26art_aid%3D91573 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916173514/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=91573 |archivedate=2011-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and singer-songwriter Bibi Farber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibifarber.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and language learning==
Born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0156545.html] InfoPlease Web site, Web page titled "Farber, Barry", accessed September 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Farber is [[Jews|Jewish]] and grew up in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

After nearly failing Latin in the ninth grade, that summer Farber started reading a [[Mandarin Chinese]] language-learning book. A trip to [[Miami Beach, Florida]], to see his grandparents, coincidentally put him in the midst of a large number of Chinese navy sailors in training there. His Chinese rapidly improved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Back in Greensboro, he took up [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]] on his own before summer vacation was over. He started taking French and Spanish classes in his sophomore year and also learned Norwegian on his own while in high school. He graduated in 1948 from Greensboro Senior High School (see [[Grimsley High School]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

He then attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he learned Russian. As a delegate from the National Student Association to what he later called a "Tito propaganda fiesta called the Zagreb Peace Conference", he found  other Slavic languages were closely related to Russian. A 16-day boat trip back to the United States with Yugoslavs allowed him to practice his Serbo-Croatian.&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Barry, ''Learn Any Language: Quickly, Easily, Inexpensively, Enjoyably, and on Your Own Time'' pp. 22–23, hereafter: ''Learn Any Language''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
After covering the Olympic Games in Helsinki one year in the 1950s, he learned Indonesian on another boat trip back to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;''Learn any Language'', pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

As a newspaper reporter in 1956, Farber was invited by the [[United States Air Force]] to cover the airlift of Hungarian refugees from the uprising in Hungary that year. In an Austrian border village, Farber later wrote, he so impressed a Norwegian man, [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]], with knowledge of the man's native tongue that he was allowed to go on one of the covert missions smuggling Hungarians into Austria.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Farber has knowledge of more than 25 [[languages]], including the ones mentioned above. He has published a book titled ''How to Learn Any Language'' that details his method for self-study. It is based around a multi-track study of the language, the use of memory aids for vocabulary, and the utilization of "hidden moments" throughout the day.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Farber prefers to say that he is a student of a certain number of languages, rather than saying that he speaks them. Of the languages he has studied, half he "dates" and the other half he "marries". According to Farber: "By languages I date, I mean no grammar and no script, languages like [[Bengali language|Bengali]]."&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[http://www.meadowparty.com/farber.html] Law, Keith, Web page titled "Interview with Barry Farber" dated April 6, 2005; accessed September 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from Bengali, the 25 foreign languages he has studied include these 19 ("marriage" or "dating" specified, when known): [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]] (marriage), [[German language|German]],  [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (marriage), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] (marriage), [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (marriage), [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]],&lt;ref&gt;''Learn Any Language'', Chapter: "A Life of Language Learning", subchapter "New Friends", page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Korean language|Korean]].&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

Farber's book, ''How to Learn any Language'' never specifies all of the 25 languages that his publicity materials say he has studied. He says in the book that when he was inducted into the [[U.S. Army]] in 1952, he was "tested and qualified for work in fourteen different languages" and has since learned more in some of those languages as well as the others.&lt;ref&gt;''Learn Any Language''Introduction, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned in the 2005 interview that he still constantly learns bits and pieces of new language—some Albanian phrases or a new phrase each time he went into a grocery store where a Tibetan woman works.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

==Radio career==
His radio career began in New York City, working as the producer for the Tex and Jinx interview program from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, a live remote broadcast over [[WFAN|WNBC-AM]] in the mid-1950s at 10:30 PM to midnight, Monday through Friday.

[[William Safire]] hired Farber as a producer. Farber eventually hosted his own show on [[WINS (AM)|WINS]].&lt;ref name=trn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkradionetwork.com/pg/jsp/general/host.jsp?chartID%3D3%26position%3D6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819113037/http://www.talkradionetwork.com/pg/jsp/general/host.jsp?chartID=3&amp;position=6 |archivedate=2006-08-19}} Talk Radio Network Web site, Web page titled "Barry Farber"; accessed September 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Begun in 1960, his first talk show was called ''Barry Farber’s WINS Open Mike''. It was the only talk show on what was then a rock n’ roll station and was on weeknights at 11pm. He left that job for an evening talk show on [[WOR (AM)|WOR-AM]] in 1962, and then became an all-night host in 1967.&lt;ref name=talkers&gt;[http://www.talkers.com/greatest/9rfarber.htm] Talkers Magazine Web site, page titled "Talkers Magazine 9 Barry Farber"; accessed September 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, he ran for Congress in New York City's 19th district on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ticket, but was defeated by [[Bella Abzug]]. Farber left his talk-radio career for a time in 1977 to delve into politics, [[New York City mayoral election, 1977|running for mayor of New York City]], but was defeated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In November 1977, [[Kaiser Broadcasting]] debuted a weekly talk show hosted by Farber as a replacement to its program hosted by [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]], who died earlier that year, but it was short-lived.&lt;ref name=ToledoWKBD&gt;[http://vintagetoledotv.squarespace.com/print-ads-wkbd Vintage Toledo TV: TV Guide ads for WKBD]&lt;/ref&gt;

Farber then joined [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] for an afternoon drive time talk show, which lasted until 1989 when WMCA changed its format to Christian radio.

In 1990, he became a national talk-show host on the [[ABC Radio Network]], which was trying to build a group of nationwide talk shows at the time. [[Lynn Samuels]] was forced to share her local [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] show with Farber which led to on-air confrontations, and resulted in her departure from the station.  ABC's project later was abandoned, and Farber, Michael Castello, and [[Alan Colmes]] got together and quickly formed their own independent network called Daynet.

Farber is now on CRN Digital Talk Radio, weekdays, and on the [[Talk Radio Network]], hosting a one-hour weekend show and filling in for TRN's weekday hosts, most commonly on ''[[The Laura Ingraham Show]]''.&lt;ref name=talkers/&gt;

Early in the 1970s, Farber was an adjunct professor of journalism at [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] in New York. Often, his former students are heard calling his radio program with admiring words and memories.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

On the radio, Farber became easily identifiable by his unique combination of drawn-out Southern drawl, intense delivery, verbose prose, and quick wit. Sponsors loved his ability to deliver a live commercial spot, often ad-libbed, and make whatever the particular product was sound tantalizing; he always sounded like he truly believed in the product.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1991 he was named "Talk Show Host of The Year" by the National Association of Radio Talk Show Hosts.&lt;ref name=trn/&gt;

In 2008 Farber married Sara Pentz, a television news reporter and journalist.

Farber was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] in 2014.

{{Contains Ethiopic text}}

The '''Bilen language''' (ብሊና ''b(ɨ)lina'' or ብሊን ''b(ɨ)lin'') is spoken by the [[Bilen people]] in and around the city of [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] in [[Eritrea]] and [[Kassala, Sudan|Kassala]] in eastern Sudan. It is the only [[Agaw languages|Agaw (Central Cushitic) language]] spoken in [[Eritrea]]. It is spoken by about 120,000 people.

==Spelling of the name==
"Blin" is the English spelling preferred by native speakers,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} but '''Bilin''' and '''Bilen''' are also commonly used. ''Bilin'' is the reference name arbitrarily used in the current initial English editions of ISO 639-3, but  ''Blin'' is also listed as an equivalent name without preference. In the English list of ISO 639-2, ''Blin'' is listed in first position in both English and French lists, when ''Bilin'' is listed as an alternate name in the English list, and '''Bilen''' is the alternate name in the French list. The ''Ethnologue'' report lists '''Bilen''' as the preferred name, but also ''Bogo, Bogos, Bilayn, Bilin, Balen, Beleni, Belen, Bilein, Bileno, North Agaw'' as alternative names.

==Phonology==
It is not clear if Bilen has tone. It may have [[pitch accent]] (Fallon 2004) as prominent syllables always have a high tone, but not all words have such a syllable.

/r/ is typically realised as a [[flap consonant|tap]] when it is medial and a [[trill consonant|trill]] when it is in final position.

Fallon (2001, 2004) notes intervocalic [[lenition]], such as {{IPA|/b/}} → {{IPA|[β]}}; [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], as in the name of the language, {{IPA|/bɨlín/}} → {{IPA|[blín]}}; [[debuccalization]] with secondary articulation preserved, as in {{IPA|/dérekʷʼa}} → {{IPA|[dɛ́rɛʔʷa]}} 'mud for bricks'. Intriguingly, the ejectives have voiced allophones, which according to Fallon (2004) "provides an important empirical precedent" for one of the more criticized aspects of the [[glottalic theory]] of Indo-European. For example,

{|class="wikitable IPA"
|-
!Ejective consonant!!Voiced allophone!!Gloss
|-
|/laħátʃʼɨna/||[laħádʒɨna]||'to bark'
|-
|/kʼaratʃʼna/||[kʼaradʒna]||'to cut'
|-
|/kʷʼakʷʼito/||[ɡʷaʔʷito]||'he was afraid'

==Writing system==

===Ge'ez abugida===
''See also:'' [[Ge'ez alphabet#Modifications for other languages]]

A writing system for Bilen was first developed by missionaries who used the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez abugida]] and the first text was published in 1882. Although the Ge'ez script is usually used for [[Semitic languages]], the phonemes of Bilen are very similar (7 vowels, labiovelar and ejective consonants). The script therefore requires only a slight modification (the addition of consonants for {{IPA|ŋ}} and {{IPA|ŋʷ}}) to make it suitable for Bilen. Some of the additional symbols required to write Bilen with this script are in the "Ethiopic Extended" [[Unicode]] range rather than the "Ethiopic" range.

Agaw/Bilen syllables are among the Ethiopic glyphs computerized by Dr. Aberra Molla in the 1980s.

===Latin alphabet===
In 1985 the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] decided to use the [[Latin script]] for Bilen and all other non-Semitic [[Languages of Eritrea|languages in Eritrea]]. This was largely a political decision: the Ge'ez script is associated with [[Christianity]] because of its [[Ge'ez language|liturgical use]]. The Latin alphabet is seen as being more neutral and secular. In 1993 the government set up a committee to standardize the Bilen language and the Latin-based orthography. "This overturned a 110-year tradition of writing Blin in Ethiopic script." (Fallon, ''Bilen Orthography'' &lt;ref name="lingref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/acal/36/paper1411.pdf|title=Blin Orthography: A History and an Assessment|date=18 September 2006|author=Paul D. Fallon|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

As of 1997, the alphabetic order was:

:e, u, i, a, é, o, b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z, ñ, ñw, th, ch, sh, kh, kw, hw, qw, gw.
Also ''khw''.

Their values are similar to the IPA apart from the following:

{|class="wikitable IPA"

|é||ɨ

|c||ʕ

'''Classical Gaelic''' ({{lang-gd|Gàidhlig Chlasaigeach}}; {{lang-ga|Gaeilge Chlasaiceach}}) was the shared literary form that was in use in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] from the 13th century to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Maolalaigh, ''Scottish Gaelic in Twelve Weeks''&lt;/ref&gt; The language may be thought of as a high-register version of [[Early Modern Irish]].

Although the first written signs of [[Scottish Gaelic]] having diverged from Irish appear as far back as the 12th century annotations of the [[Book of Deer]], Scottish Gaelic did not have a standardised form and did not appear in print on a significant scale until the 1767 translation of the [[New Testament]] into Scottish Gaelic&lt;ref name=Comp&gt;Thomson (ed.), ''The Companion to Gaelic Scotland''&lt;/ref&gt; although [[John Carswell]]'s ''{{lang|gd|Foirm na n-Urrnuidheadh}}'', an adaptation of [[John Knox]]'s ''[[Book of Common Order]]'', was the first book printed in either Scottish or Irish Gaelic.&lt;ref&gt;Meek, "Scots-Gaelic Scribes", pp. 263-4; Wormald, ''Court, Kirk and Community'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encoding==
[[ISO 639-3]] gives the name "Hiberno-Scottish Gaelic" (and the code &lt;code&gt;ghc&lt;/code&gt;) to cover both Classical Gaelic and [[History of the Irish language#Early Modern Irish|Early Modern Irish]].

'''Diederik''' (or '''Dirk''') '''Johannes Opperman''', commonly referred to as '''D.J. Opperman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|p|ər|m|ʌ|n}} 29 September 1914 – 22 September 1985) was an [[Afrikaans]] [[poetry|poet]]. He is considered to be one of the best known Afrikaans poets of the twentieth century.

==Biography==
He was born on 29 September 1914 in [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], where he grew up. He went to school in the towns of [[Estcourt, KwaZulu-Natal|Estcourt]] and [[Vryheid, KwaZulu-Natal|Vryheid]], and afterwards received an M.A. degree from the [[University of Natal]]. He taught at schools in [[Pietermaritzburg]] and [[Johannesburg]], and later on became editor of ''[[Die Huisgenoot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mieliestronk.com/skryfdjopper.html |title=Skrywers in Afrikaans: D.J. Opperman |date= |website=Mieliestronk.co.za |publisher= |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 he became a lecturer at the [[University of Cape Town]]. During this period he completed one of his most important publications – ''Digters van Dertig'' (Poets of the thirties) – in 1953.

He won the coveted Hertzog prize for poetry in 1947 for his collection ''Heilige beeste'' ("Holy cattle").  From 1960 to 1975 he was a professor of Afrikaans at [[Stellenbosch University]], where he also served on the editorial board of the publication ''[[Standpunte]]'' ("Points of View"). He died in 1985 in [[Stellenbosch]].

He won four [[Hertzog Prize|Hertzog]] prizes (in 1947, 1956, 1969 and 1980), four [[W.A. Hofmeyr Prize|Hofmeyer]] prizes (in 1954, 1956, 1966 and 1980), two [[CNA Prize]]s (in 1964 and 1980), a prize from the ''"Drie-Eeue Stigting"'' ("Three Centuries Foundation") in 1956, the [[Louis Luyt]]-prize in 1980 and the [[Gustav Preller]] prize for [[literary criticism]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nb.co.za/Authors/333 |title=Authors: D.J.

[[File:Dictaphone operator.jpg|thumb|Transcribing dictation with a Dictaphone wax cylinder dictation machine, in the early 1920s.  Note supply of extra wax cylinders on lower part of stand.]]
A '''dictation machine''' is  a [[sound recording]] device most commonly used to record [[Speech communication|speech]] for later playback or to be typed into print. It includes '''digital voice recorders''' and [[tape recorder]]s.

The name "[[Dictaphone]]" is a [[trademark]] of the company of the same name, but has also become a common term for all dictation machines, as a [[genericized trademark]].

== History ==
{{main|Phonograph}}
[[Alexander Graham Bell]] and his two associates took Edison's [[tinfoil]] phonograph and modified it considerably to make it reproduce sound from wax instead of tinfoil. They began their work at Bell's [[Volta Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C., in 1879, and continued until they were granted basic patents in 1886 for recording in wax.&lt;ref name="Newville"&gt;Newville, Leslie J. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30112/30112-h/30112-h.htm Development of the Phonograph at Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory], United States National Museum Bulletin, [[Smithsonian Institution|United States National Museum]] and the [[Museum of History and Technology]], Washington, D.C., 1959, No. 218, Paper 5, pp.69-79. Retrieved from ProjectGutenberg.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EdisonDictaphone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas A. Edison]] dictating in 1907.]]
Thomas A. Edison had [[Thomas_Edison#Beginning_his_career|invented the phonograph]] in 1877, but the fame bestowed on him for this invention&amp;nbsp;— sometimes called his most original&amp;nbsp;— was not due to its efficiency. Recording with his tinfoil phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the tinfoil tore easily, and even when the [[Stylus#Use_in_music_recording_and_reproduction|stylus]] was properly adjusted, its reproduction of sound was distorted and squeaky, and good for only a few playbacks. Although Edison had hit upon the secret of [[sound recording]], immediately after his discovery he did not improve it, allegedly because of an agreement to spend the next five years developing the [[History_of_electric_power_transmission#Early_high_voltage_and_commercial_systems|New York City electric light and power]] system.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;

By 1881 the Volta associates had succeeded in improving an Edison tinfoil machine to some extent. Wax was put in the grooves of the heavy iron cylinder, and no tinfoil was used. The basic distinction between the Edison's first phonograph patent, and the Bell and [[Charles Sumner Tainter|[Charles Sumner] Tainter]] patent of 1886 was the method of recording. Edison's method was to indent the sound waves on a piece of tin-foil, while Bell and Tainter's invention called for cutting, or "engraving", the sound waves into a wax record with a sharp recording stylus.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt; 

Among the later improvements by the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Associates]], the Graphophone used a cutting stylus to create lateral zig-zag grooves of uniform depth into the wax-coated cardboard cylinders, rather than the up-and-down [[Vertical cut recording|vertically-cut]] grooves of [[Thomas Edison|Edison's]] contemporary phonograph machine designs.&lt;ref name="Newville" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tainter2"&gt;Tainter, Charles Sumner. [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/homenotes1.html Recording Technology History: Charles Sumner Tainter Home Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515112211/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/homenotes1.html |date=2008-05-15 }}, History Department of, [[University of San Diego]]. Retrieved from University of San Diego History Department website December 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Dictaphone cylinder machine.jpg|thumb|right|Dictaphone cylinder dictation machine from early 1920s.]]
Notably, Bell and Tainter developed wax-coated cardboard cylinders for their [[Phonograph cylinder|record cylinders]], instead of Edison's cast iron cylinder, covered with a removable film of tinfoil (the actual recording medium, which was prone to damage during installation or removal.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt; Tainter received a separate patent for a tube assembly machine to automatically produce the coiled cardboard tubes, which served as the foundation for the wax cylinder records.

Besides being far easier to handle, the wax recording medium also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;Library and Archives Canada. [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/gramophone/028011-3004-e.html The Virtual Gramophone: Canadian Historical Sound Recordings: Early Sound Recording and the Invention of the Gramophone], [[Library and Archives Canada]] Web site, Ottawa. Retrieved May 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally the Graphophones initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings, then wind-up clockwork drive mechanisms, and finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank that was used on Edison's phonograph.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt;  The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was significantly better than Edison's machine.

[[File:Thomas Edison National Historical Park - Edison Voicewriter Reproducer.jpg|thumb|left|Edison Voicewriter from about 1950]]
Shortly after [[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[phonograph]], the first device for recording sound, in 1877, he thought that the main use for the new device would be for recording speech in business settings. (Given the low audio [[fidelity]] of earliest versions of the phonograph, recording [[music]] may not have seemed to be a major application.)  Some early phonographs were indeed used this way, but this did not become common until the mass production of reusable [[wax]] cylinders in the late 1880s. The differentiation of office dictation devices from other early phonographs, which commonly had attachments for making one's own recordings, was gradual. The machine marketed by the [[Edison Records]] company was trademarked as the "Ediphone". 

Following the invention of the [[audion tube]] in 1906, electric [[microphone]]s gradually replaced the purely acoustical recording methods of earlier dictaphones by the late 1930s. In 1945, the [[SoundScriber]] and [[Gray Audograph]], which cut grooves into a plastic disc, was introduced, and two years later Dictaphone replaced wax cylinders with their [[Dictabelt]] technology, which cut a mechanical groove into a plastic belt instead of into a wax cylinder.  This was later replaced by [[magnetic tape]] recording. While [[reel-to-reel tape]] was used for dictation, the inconvenience of threading tape spools led to development of more convenient formats, notably the [[Compact Cassette]], [[Mini-Cassette]], and [[Microcassette]].

[[File:Olympus Digital Voice Recorder.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] digital voice recorder.]]
[[Digital dictation]] became possible in the 1990s, as falling [[computer memory]] prices made possible pocket-sized digital voice recorders that stored sound on computer memory chips without moving parts. Many early 21st-century [[digital camera]]s and [[smartphone]]s have this capability built in. In the 1990s, improvements in [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]] technology  began to allow computers to [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] recorded audio dictation into [[text file|text]] form, a task that previously required human secretaries or transcribers.  {{As of|2014}} the technology is not robust enough to replace human transcription in most cases.

Despite the advances in technology, analog media are still widely used in dictation recording for their flexibility, permanence, and robustness.

'''''Dorp''''' is a term meaning a [[village]] or small [[town]], in the [[Netherlands]], [[Suriname]], [[Belgian Flanders]] and [[South Africa]]. In some countries a ''dorp'' is also a [[local government area]] or [[municipality]], which may also administer one or more separate, smaller settlements, such as [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]].

Originally a [[Dutch language]] term, ''dorp'' is also used in [[Afrikaans]] which originated from 17th Century Dutch. It is also often used in [[South African English]], in which it is a [[loanword]] from Afrikaans. In South Africa the word is generally used to refer to a [[town]] or [[village]] but can in passing speech be used to refer to a [[city]].

'''John Duns''', commonly called '''Duns Scotus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|oʊ|t|ə|s}}; {{IPA-la|ˈduns ˈskoː.tus|church}}; {{circa}} 1266&amp;nbsp;– 8 November 1308), is generally considered to be one of the three most important philosopher-theologians of [[Western Europe]] in the [[High Middle Ages]], together with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[William of Ockham]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the Plato.Stanford.edu articles [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/ "Duns Scotus"] and [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ "William of Ockham"]&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus has had considerable influence on both [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and secular thought. The doctrines for which he is best known are the "[[univocity of being]]", that existence is the most abstract concept we have, applicable to everything that exists; the [[formal distinction]], a way of distinguishing between different aspects of the same thing; and the idea of [[haecceity]], the property supposed to be in each individual thing that makes it an individual. Scotus also developed a complex argument for the existence of God, and argued for the [[Immaculate Conception]] of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].

Duns Scotus was given the [[scholastic accolades|scholastic accolade]] ''Doctor Subtilis'' (''Subtle Doctor'') for his penetrating and subtle manner of thought. He was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1993.

Little is known of Duns Scotus apart from his work. His date of birth is thought to have been between 23 December 1265 and 17 March 1266, born into a leading family of the region. The site of his birth, in front of the Pavilion Lodge, near the North Lodge of Duns Castle, is now marked by a [[cairn]] which was erected in 1966 by the Franciscan friars of the United Kingdom to mark the 700th anniversary of his birth. Duns Scotus received the [[religious habit]] of the Friars Minor at [[Dumfries]], where his uncle, Elias Duns, was [[custos (Franciscans)|guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duns.bordernet.co.uk/history/dunsscotus.html|work=Duns, Scotland|title=People of Note: John Duns Scotus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duns Scotus's age is based on the first certain date for his life, that of his ordination to the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] at [[St Andrew's Priory, Northampton|St Andrew's]], [[Northampton]], England on 17 March 1291. The minimum [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] age for receiving [[holy orders]] is 25 and it is generally assumed that he would have been ordained as soon as it was permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VRV9Tr_A-98C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brampton |first=C. K. |title=Duns Scotus at Oxford, 1288–1301 |journal=Franciscan Studies |year=1964 |volume=24 |issue=Annual II |pages=5–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; That his contemporaries called him '''Johannes Duns''', after the medieval practice of calling people by their Christian name followed by their place of origin, suggests that he came from [[Duns]], in Berwickshire, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Although Vos (2006, p. 23) has objected that 'Duns' was actually his family name, as someone from Duns would have been known as 'de Duns'.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, Duns Scotus was educated at a Franciscan ''[[studium generale]]'' (a [[medieval university]]), a house behind [[St Ebbe's Church, Oxford]], in a triangular area enclosed by Pennyfarthing Street and running from [[St Aldate's, Oxford|St Aldate's]] to the Castle, the Baley and the old wall,&lt;ref&gt;Vos 2006, p. 27.

At that time there would have been about 270 persons living there, of whom about 80 would have been friars.&lt;ref&gt;Vos 2006, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Duns Scotus appears to have been in [[Oxford]] by 1300, as he is listed among a group of friars for whom the [[provincial superior]] of the English [[ecclesiastical province]] (which included Scotland) requested faculties from the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] for the hearing of [[Confession (religion)|confessions]].&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05194a.htm|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|title=John Duns Scotus}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in a disputation under the regent master, Philip of [[Bridlington]] in 1300–01.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Thomas (ed.). ''The Cambridge Companion to Duns Scotus''. Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He began lecturing on [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]'' at the prestigious University of Paris towards the end of 1302. Later in that academic year, however, he was expelled from the University of Paris for siding with [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in his feud with King [[Philip IV of France]] over the taxation of church property.

Duns Scotus was back in Paris before the end of 1304, probably returning in May. He continued lecturing there until, for reasons that are still mysterious, he was dispatched to the Franciscan ''studium'' at [[Cologne]], probably in October 1307. According to the 15th-century writer [[William Vorilong]], his departure was sudden and unexpected. He was relaxing or talking with students in the ''Prato clericorum'' or ''Pre-aux-Clercs'' – an open area of the [[Rive Gauche]] used by scholars for recreation – when orders arrived from the Franciscan [[Minister General (Franciscan)|Minister General]]; Scotus left immediately, taking few or no personal belongings.&lt;ref&gt;''Narratur de Doctori Subtili qui in Prato clericorum, visa Generalis Ministri obedentia, dum actu Regens esse in scholis Parisiensibus, aut pauca aut nulla de rebus habita dispositione, Parisis exivit ut Coloniam iret, secundum ministri sententiam''. William Vorilong, ''Opus super IV libros Sententiarum'' II, d. 44, q. 1 f. 161va.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duns Scotus died unexpectedly in Cologne in November 1308; the date of his death is traditionally given as 8 November. He is buried in the Church of the Friars Minor there. His [[sarcophagus]] bears the Latin inscription:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''Scotia me genuit. Anglia me suscepit. Gallia me docuit. Colonia me tenet.''&lt;br /&gt;(Scotland brought me forth. England sustained me. France taught me. Cologne holds me.)&lt;/poem&gt;}}
The story about Duns Scotus being buried alive, in the absence of his servant who alone knew of his susceptibility to coma, is probably a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Alban|title=The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints|date=1866|publisher=James Duffy|location=Dublin|chapter=St. Bonaventure, Cardinal, Bishop, and Doctor of the Church|p=note 15|nopp=yes|url=http://www.bartleby.com/210/7/141.html|authorlink=Alban Butler|accessdate=29 May 2014|archiveurl=http://www.bartleby.com|archivedate=2010|volume=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported by [[Francis Bacon]] in his ''Historia vitae et mortis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bacon|first=Francis |title=Historia Vitae et Mortis |year=1638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of Codex 66 of [[Merton College, Oxford]] says that Scotus was also at [[Cambridge]], but we do not know for certain if this is true, or, if it was, when he was there.&lt;ref&gt;Latin text: "''Haec de ordinatione ven. Fratris J. duns de ordine fratrum Minorum, qui floruit Cant Oxon et Parisius et obiit in Colonia''." Quoted in Little 1932, p. 571, citing Callebaut 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Scotus's great work is his commentary on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], which contains nearly all the philosophical views and arguments for which he is well known, including the [[univocity of being]], the [[formal distinction]], less than numerical unity, individual nature or "thisness" ([[haecceity]]), his critique of [[Divine illumination|illuminationism]] and his renowned argument for the existence of God. His commentary exists in several versions. The standard version is the ''Ordinatio'' (also known as the ''Opus oxoniense''), a revised version of lectures he gave as a bachelor at Oxford. The initial revision was probably begun in the summer of 1300 – see the remarks in the Prologue, question 2, alluding to the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]] in 1299, news of which probably reached Oxford in the summer of 1300. It was still incomplete when Scotus left for Paris in 1302. The original lectures were also transcribed and recently published as the ''Lectura''.&lt;ref&gt;See the Bibliography under ''The Examined Report of the Paris Lecture, Reportatio I-A''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two other versions of the work are Scotus's notes for the Oxford lectures, recently published as the ''Lectura'', the first book of which was probably written in Oxford in the late 1290s,&lt;ref name="Pini 2005"/&gt; and the ''Reportatio parisiensis'' (or ''Opus parisiense''), consisting of transcriptions of the lectures on the ''Sentences'' given by Scotus when he was in Paris. A ''reportatio'' is a student report or transcription of the original lecture of a master. A version that has been checked by the master himself is known as a ''reportatio examinata''.

By the time of Scotus, these 'commentaries' on the ''Sentences'' were no longer literal commentaries. Instead, [[Peter Lombard]]'s original text was used as a starting point for highly original discussions on topics of theological or philosophical interest.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Wolter 1995, p. 76 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Book II Distinction 2, about the location of angels, is a starting point for a complex discussion about continuous motion, and whether the same thing can be in two different places at the same time ([[bilocation]]). In the same book, Distinction 3, he uses the question of how angels can be different from one another, given that they have no material bodies, to investigate the difficult question of [[individuation]] in general.

[[File:By23 colophonsmaller.jpg|thumb|[[Colophon (publishing)|Colophon]] from the edition of Scotus' ''Sentences'' commentary edited by Thomas Penketh (died 1487) and Bartolomeo Bellati (died 1479), printed by Johannes de Colonia and Johannes Manthen, Venice in 1477. It reads ''Explicit Scriptum super Primum Sententiarum: editum a fratre Johanne Duns: ordinis fratrum minorum'' Printed versions of scholastic manuscripts became popular in the late fifteenth century.]]

Scotus wrote purely philosophical and logical works at an early stage of his career, consisting of commentaries on Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]''. These are the ''Questions'' on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' and Aristotle's ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', ''[[De Interpretatione|Peri hermeneias]]'', and ''[[Sophistical Refutations|De sophisticis elenchis]]'', probably dating to around 1295.&lt;ref&gt;See the introduction to the critical edition: ''Duns Scoti Quaestiones in librum Porphyrii Isagoge et Quaestiones super Praedicamenta Aristotelis'' (''Opera philosophica'', I), xxix–xxxiv, xli–xlii.&lt;/ref&gt; His commentary on Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' was probably written in stages, the first version having started around 1297,&lt;ref name="Pini 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pini |first=Giorgio |title=Univocity in Scotus's Quaestiones super Metaphysicam: The Solution to a Riddle |journal=Medioevo |year=2005 |volume=30 |pages=69–110 |url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/pini/pini/Blank_files/Univocity%20in%20Scotus.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; with significant additions and amendments possibly after the completion of the main body of the ''Ordinatio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pini |first=Giorgio |title=Univocity in Scotus's Quaestiones super Metaphysicam: The Solution to a Riddle|journal=Medioevo|year=2005|volume=30 |pages=69–110 |url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/pini/pini/Blank_files/Univocity%20in%20Scotus.pdf|format=PDF}}, although this is speculative&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Expositio'' on the ''Metaphysics'' was lost for centuries but was recently rediscovered and edited by Giorgio Pini.&lt;ref name="StanW"&gt;Thomas Williams (2009). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/ "John Duns Scotus"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (online).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are 46 short disputations called ''Collationes'', probably dating from 1300–1305; a work in natural theology (''De primo principio''); and his ''Quaestiones Quodlibetales'', probably dating to Advent 1306 or Lent 1307.

A number of works once believed to have been written by Scotus are now known to have been misattributed. There were already concerns about this within two centuries of his death, when the 16th-century logician [[Jacobus Naveros]] noted inconsistencies between these texts and his commentary on the ''Sentences'', leading him to doubt whether he had written any logical works at all.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth 1987&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Questions on the Prior Analytics'' (''In Librum Priorum Analyticorum Aristotelis Quaestiones'') were also discovered to be mistakenly attributed.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.E. Longpre&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, [[Martin Grabmann|Grabmann]] showed that the logical work ''De modis significandi'' was actually by Thomas of Erfurt, a 14th-century logician of the [[modistae|modist school]]. Thus the claim that [[Martin Heidegger]] wrote his ''Habilitationsschrift'' on Scotus&lt;ref&gt;''Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus'' ("Duns Scotus' Theory of the Categories and of Meaning", 1915)&lt;/ref&gt; is only half true, as the second part is actually based on the work by Erfurt.

== Metaphysics ==

=== Realism ===
Scotus is generally considered to be a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] (as opposed to a [[nominalist]]) in that he treated universals as real. He attacks a position close to that later defended by [[William of Ockham|Ockham]], arguing that things have a common nature – for example the humanity common to [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Plutarch]].

=== Univocity of being ===
He followed [[Aristotle]] in asserting that the subject matter of [[metaphysics]] is "being qua being" (''ens inquantum ens''). Being in general (''ens in communi''), as a univocal notion, was for him the first object of the intellect.

The doctrine of the [[univocity of being]] implies the denial of any real distinction between [[essence]] and [[existence]]. [[Aquinas]] had argued that in all finite being (i.e. all except God) the essence of a thing is distinct from its existence. Scotus rejected the distinction. Scotus argued that we cannot conceive of what it is to be something, without conceiving it as existing. We should not make any distinction between whether a thing exists (''si est'') and what it is (''quid est''), for we never know whether something exists, unless we have some concept of what we know to exist.&lt;ref&gt;''Opus Oxoniense'' I iii 1–2, quoted in Grenz 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjHTcrWmguQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individuation ===
Scotus elaborates a distinct view on [[hylomorphism]], with three important strong theses that differentiate him. He held: 1) that there exists [[matter]] that has no form whatsoever, or prime matter, as the stuff underlying all change, against Aquinas (cf. his ''Quaestiones in Metaphysicam'' 7, q. 5; ''Lectura'' 2, d. 12, q. un.), 2) that not all created substances are composites of form and matter (cf. ''Lectura'' 2, d. 12, q. un., n. 55), that is, that purely spiritual substances do exist, and 3) that one and the same substance can have more than one substantial form – for instance, humans have at least two substantial forms, the soul and the form of the body (''forma corporeitas'') (cf. ''Ordinatio'' 4, d. 11, q. 3, n. 54). He argued for an original principle of [[individuation]] (cf. ''Ordinatio'' 2, d. 3, pars 1, qq. 1–6), the "[[haecceity]]" as the ultimate unity of a unique individual (''haecceitas'', an entity's 'thisness'), as opposed to the common [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] (''natura communis''), feature existing in any number of individuals. For Scotus, the axiom stating that only the individual exists is a dominating principle of the understanding of reality. For the apprehension of individuals, an intuitive cognition is required, which gives us the present existence or the non-existence of an individual, as opposed to abstract cognition. Thus the human soul, in its separated state from the body, will be capable of knowing the spiritual intuitively.

=== Formal distinction ===
Like other realist philosophers of the period (such as Aquinas and [[Henry of Ghent]]) Scotus recognised the need for an intermediate distinction that was not merely conceptual but not fully real or mind-dependent either. Scotus argued for a [[formal distinction]] (''distinctio formalis a parte rei''), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality but whose definitions are not identical. For example, the personal properties of the [[Trinity]] are formally distinct from the Divine essence. Similarly, the distinction between the 'thisness' or ''haecceity'' of a thing is intermediate between a real and a conceptual distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a formal distinction between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul.

== Theology ==

=== Voluntarism ===
Scotus was an Augustinian theologian. He is usually associated with [[Medieval theological voluntarism|theological voluntarism]], the tendency to emphasize God's will and human freedom in all philosophical issues. The main difference between [[Aquinas]]'s rational theology and that of Scotus is that Scotus believed certain predicates may be applied univocally&amp;nbsp;– with exactly the same meaning&amp;nbsp;– to God and creatures, whereas Aquinas insisted that this is impossible and that only analogical predication can be employed, in which a word as applied to God has a meaning different from, although related to, the meaning of that same word as applied to creatures. Duns struggled throughout his works in demonstrating his univocity theory against Aquinas's analogy doctrine.

Scotus gave the lecture, ''Lectura'' I 39, during 1297–1299 to refute the view that everything is necessary and immutable. He claims that the aim of this lecture has two points (''Lectura'' I 39, §31): first, to consider the contingency in what is (''de contingentia in entibus''); second, to consider how God's certain knowledge is compatible with the contingency of things.
Scotus tries to defend the validity of Christian theology against the attack of ancient philosophers. The main argument is unpacked in ''Lectura'' I 39, §§49–53.  Scotus argues that a necessary being (God) is able to have contingent knowledge, and that although this knowledge is contingent, it is not necessarily mutable and temporal by that very fact. 
In ''Lectura'' I 39 §1, Scotus asks, "whether God has determinate knowledge of things according to every aspect of their existence, as according to being in the future."  He presents a counterview which claims that God cannot have determinate knowledge of the future. To support this counterview, Aristotle's ''De Interpretatione'' IX.
In the following arguments, Scotus does not attempt to contradict Aristotle. He does not affirm or reject the ideas of Aristotle. The only issue he argues against is the proposition that God cannot have determinate knowledge of the future. Scotus appears to try to fully demonstrate that Aristotle's text is not contradictory to the Christian doctrine of God.
Scotus argues that God wills with one single volition (''unica volitione'') whatever he wills. God has one volition ''ad intra'', but this one volition can be related to many opposite things ''ad extra''. God can simultaneously will one thing at time 1 and the opposite thing at time 2.
There are various possible interpretations of Aristotle's ''De Interpretatione'' IX.  For example, John Buridan (ca. 1300–1362) thought the Scotistic contingency theory was an Aristotelian view.  Buridan's judgment is all the more possible because of at least four reasons: (1) Aristotle's ''De Interpretatione'' IX, 19a23-25 can be interpreted like the Scotistic contingency theory; (2) Scotus himself does not refute Aristotle's ''De Interpretatione'' IX in ''Lectura'' I 39 §§49–53; (3) Scotus, rather, tries to formulate his contingency theory with the help of other works of Aristotle in ''Lectura'' I 39 §§51, 54; (4) Scotus introduces the diachronic feature of God's volition to his contingency theory as well as the synchronic feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

===Metaphysical argument for the existence of God===
{{Tone|section|date=September 2017}}
Duns Scotus argued that it is better to construct a metaphysical argument for the existence of God, rather than the more common physical argument from motion&lt;ref&gt;Lectura I, d. 2, q. 2, 40 Now efficiency can be considered either as a metaphysical or as a physical property. The metaphysical property is more extensive than the physical for "to give existence to another" is of broader scope than "to give existence by way of movement or change." And even if all existence were given in the latter fashion, the notion of the one is still not that of the other. It is not efficiency as a physical attribute, however, but efficiency as the metaphysician considers it that provides a more effective way of proving God's existence, for there are more attributes in metaphysics than in physics whereby the existence of God can be established. It can be shown, for example, from "composition and simplicity," from "act and potency," from "one and many," from those features which are properties of being. Wherefore, if you find one extreme of the disjunction imperfectly realized in a creature, you conclude that the alternate, the perfect extreme exists in God.
Averroës, therefore, in attacking Avicenna at the end of Bk. I of the Physics, 14 is incorrect when he claims that to prove that God exists is the job of the physicist alone, because this can be established only by way of motion, and in no other way – as if metaphysics began with a conclusion which was not evident in itself, but needed to be proved in physics (For Averroës asserts this falsehood at the end of the first book of the Physics). In point of fact, however, [God's existence] can be shown more truly and in a greater variety of ways by means of those metaphysical attributes which characterize being. The proof lies in this that the first efficient cause imparts not merely this fluid existence [called motion] but existence in an unqualified sense, which is still more perfect and widespread.&lt;/ref&gt; favoured by Aquinas,&lt;ref&gt;Summa Contra Gentiles, I, 13 http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm#13&lt;/ref&gt; following Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;"We shall first set forth the arguments by which Aristotle proceeds to prove that God exists." SCG I, 13.2  http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm#13&lt;/ref&gt; Though the version in ''De Primo Principio'' is the most complete and final version, the ''Ordinatio'' proof is usually offered. However, the ''De Primo'' version is fascinating and worth looking into for a wider understanding of the argument as well as Scotus's metaphysical underpinnings for his argument for God's existence, but we shall base this section of the article on the ''Ordinatio'' version. Let us briefly outline Scotus's argument. He begins his proof by explaining that there are two angles we must take in arguing for the existence of an actually infinite being. First we must approach from the view of the Relative Properties of God; second, from the Absolute Properties of God. Relative properties are those which are predicable of God in relation to creation; absolute properties are those which belong to God whether or not He chose to create. Under the first heading of Relative Properties, Scotus argues for a triple primacy of efficiency, finality and pre-eminence. From there he shows that one primacy implies the others, and finally there can only be one nature that is the First Efficient Cause, Ultimate End, and the Most Perfect Nature. From there the Subtle Doctor discusses the Absolute Properties of God. The First Being is intellectual and volitional, and the intellect and will are identical with the essence of this supreme nature. The First Being is also infinite being. While discussing the infinity of God, Scotus resurrects Anselm's argument and responds to the criticism that Anselm makes an illicit leap from concept to reality. Finally, he gives a definite answer of "yes" to the question of whether there exists an actually infinite being. The very next question of the ''Ordinatio'' deals with the unicity of the nature thus proved to exist. However, the ''De Primo Principio'' version concludes with this argument.

Since the argument is very long and has many parts, we shall content ourselves in this article with stating the premises for the existence of the first efficient cause, assuming that the reader will follow the citations to read the rest of the argument.
The proof for the conclusion that "some efficient cause is simply first such that neither can it be an effect nor can it, by virtue of something other than itself, cause an effect" ''Ordinatio'' I.2.43&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B Duns Scotus – Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B] logicmuseum.com&lt;/ref&gt; runs something like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;1)      Something can be produced.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2)      It is produced either by itself, nothing, or another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3)      Not by nothing, for nothing causes nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;4)      Not by itself, for an effect never causes itself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;5)      Therefore, by another; call it ''A''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;6)      If ''A'' is first, then we have reached the conclusion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;7)      If ''A'' is not first, but also an effect, we return to 2). ''A'' is produced either by itself, nothing, or another.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;8)      From 3) and 4), we say another, ''B''. The ascending series will either continue infinitely or we finally reach something which has nothing prior to it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;9)      An infinite ascending series is impossible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;10)    Therefore, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Scotus acknowledges two objections and deals with them accordingly. First is that he begs the question in assuming a first in the series. Here he argues that while many admit an infinite regress in an accidentally ordered series of causes, no philosopher admits infinite regress in an essentially ordered series. Scotus explains the differences between the two and offers proofs for the conclusion that an infinity of essentially ordered causes in a series is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;See paragraphs 46–55 at [http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B Duns Scotus – Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B] logicmuseum.com&lt;/ref&gt; Second, it is objected that his proof is not really a demonstration since it begins with a contingent premise. That something is produced is contingent and not necessary. Therefore, the proof proceeds from a contingent and not a necessary premise. Scotus says that while that is true, it is utterly manifest that things are produced or effected. But in order to respond, Scotus makes a modal move and reworks the argument. Now he argues from the possibility of production. "It is possible that something can be produced" is a necessary proposition. From there he is able to conclude that it is possible that the first efficient cause exists, and if it is possible that it exists, then it does exist. He assures us that the last claim will be proved later in the argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B Duns Scotus – Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B] (See paragraph 56) logicmuseum.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Lectura'' proof, Scotus argues the following way:{{quote|Although beings different from God are actually contingent with respect to their factual existence, nevertheless, they are not with respect to their possible existence. Hence, those entities which are called contingent with respect to their factual existence are necessary with respect to their possible existence – for instance, although "There exists a man" is contingent, nevertheless "It is possible that he exists" is necessary, because his existence does not include any contradiction. Therefore, "Something – different from God – is possible" is necessary, because being is divided into the contingent and the necessary. Just as necessity belongs to a necessary being in virtue of its condition or its quiddity, so possibility belongs to a possible being in virtue of its quiddity. If the first argument is alternatively qualified with the notion of ontological possibility, then we have necessary propositions as follows: It is possible that there is something different from God – it is not of itself (because then it would not be the case that it were possible), nor from nothing. Therefore, it is possible that it is from something else. Either it is possible that the other agent acts by virtue of itself – and not by virtue of something else, not being from something else – or it is not possible. If so, then it is possible that there is a first agent, and if it [is] possible that it exists, then it exists, just as we have proved before. If not and if there is no infinite regress, then the argument at once comes to a standstill.}}
More can and should be said about this fascinating argument, but we leave it to the reader to search out more of the argument. See especially http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B.

=== Illuminationism ===
Scotus argued against the version of [[illuminationism]] that had been defended earlier in the century by [[Henry of Ghent]]. In his ''Ordinatio'' (I.3.1.4) he argued against the sceptical consequences that Henry claimed would follow from abandoning divine illumination. Scotus argued that if our thinking were fallible in the way Henry had believed, such illumination could not, even in principle, ensure "certain and pure knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pasnau|first=Robert|title=Divine Illumination|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/illumination/ |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:When one of those that come together is incompatible with certainty, then certainty cannot be achieved. For just as from one premise that is necessary and one that is contingent nothing follows but a contingent conclusion, so from something certain and something uncertain, coming together in some cognition, no cognition that is certain follows (''Ordinatio'' I.3.1.4 n.221).

=== Immaculate Conception ===
Perhaps the most influential point of Duns Scotus's theology was his defense of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] (i.e., that Mary herself was conceived without sin). At the time, there was a great deal of argument about the subject. The general opinion was that it was appropriately deferential to the [[Mother of God]], but it could not be seen how to resolve the problem that only with [[Jesus|Christ]]'s death would the stain of [[original sin]] be removed. The great philosophers and theologians of the West were divided on the subject (indeed, it appears that even [[Thomas Aquinas]] sided with those who denied the doctrine, though some [[Thomism|Thomists]] dispute this). The [[feast of the Immaculate Conception|feast day]] had existed in the East (though in the East, the feast is just of the Conception of Mary) since the seventh century and had been introduced in several dioceses in the West as well, even though the philosophical basis was lacking. Citing [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s principle, "''potuit, decuit, ergo fecit''" (He [i.e., God] could do it, it was appropriate, therefore He did it), Duns Scotus devised the following argument: Mary was in need of redemption like all other human beings, but through the merits of Jesus' [[crucifixion]], given in advance, she was conceived without the stain of original sin. God could have brought it about (1) that she was never in original sin, (2) she was in sin only for an instant, (3) she was in sin for a period of time, being purged at the last instant. Whichever of these options was most excellent should probably be attributed to Mary.&lt;ref&gt;''Ordinatio'' III, d.3, q.1&lt;/ref&gt; This apparently careful statement provoked a storm of opposition at Paris, and suggested the line 'fired France for Mary without spot' in the famous poem "Duns Scotus's Oxford," by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]].

Scotus's argument appears in [[Pope Pius IX]]'s 1854 declaration of the [[dogma]] of the Immaculate Conception, "at the first moment of Her conception, Mary was preserved free from the stain of original sin, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Life of Blessed John Duns Scotus|publisher=EWTN|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/scotus.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus's position was hailed as "a correct expression of the faith of the Apostles."&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;

Another of Scotus's positions also gained official approval of the Roman Catholic Church: his doctrine on the universal primacy of Christ became the underlying rationale for the feast of Christ the King instituted in 1925.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;

During his pontificate, [[Pope John XXIII]] recommended the reading of Duns Scotus's theology to modern theology students.

== Veneration ==
Long honored as a [[beatification|Blessed]] by the Order of Friars Minor, as well as in the [[Archdiocese]]s of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and [[Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]], in the 19th-century the process was started seeking his recognition as such by the [[Holy See]], on the basis of a ''[[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] immemorabilis'', i.e., one of ancient standing.&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt; He was declared [[Venerable]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1991, who officially recognized his liturgical cult, effectively [[beatification|beatifying]] him on 20 March 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1993/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19930320_scoto-belanger_sp.html|work=Vatican News Service|title=Ceremonia de Reconocimiento del Culto Litúrgico a Duns Escoto y Beatificación de Dina Bélanger|date=20 March 1993}}{{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later reputation and influence ==

=== Later medieval period ===
Owing to Scotus's early and unexpected death, he left behind a large body of work in an unfinished or unedited condition. His students and disciples extensively edited his papers, often confusing them with works by other writers, in many cases leading to misattribution and confused transmission. Most 13th-century Franciscans followed [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]], but the influence of Scotus (as well as that of his arch-rival [[William of Ockham]]) spread in the fourteenth century. Franciscan theologians in the late Middle Ages were thus divided between so-called Scotists and Ockhamists. Fourteenth century followers included [[Francis of Mayrone]] (died 1325), [[Antonius Andreas]] (died 1320), [[William of Alnwick]] (died 1333), and John of Bassolis (died 1347), supposedly Scotus's favourite student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Courtenay|first=William|title=Early Scotists at Paris: A Reconsideration|journal=Franciscan Studies|date=January 2012|volume=69|issue=1|pages=175–229|doi=10.1353/frc.2012.0009|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/franciscan_studies/v069/69.courtenay.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sixteenth to nineteenth centuries&lt;!--'Pseudo-Scotus' redirects here--&gt; ===
His reputation suffered during the [[English reformation]], probably due to its association with the Franciscans. In a letter to [[Thomas Cromwell]] about his visit to Oxford in 1535, [[Richard Layton]] described how he saw the court of New College full of pages from Scotus's work, "the wind blowing them into every corner."&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Dixon, ''History of the Church of England from the Abolition of the Roman Jurisdiction'', 1:303&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described the Oxford Greyfriar's library in 1538 (just prior to its dissolution) as an accumulation of 'cobwebs, moths and bookworms.'&lt;ref&gt;Catto, Jeremy, "Franciscan Learning in England, 1450–1540", in ''The Religious Orders in Pre-Reformation England'', ed. Clarke 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

When in the sixteenth century the Scotists argued against [[Renaissance humanism]], the term ''duns'' or ''[[dunce]]'' became, in the mouths of the Protestants, a term of abuse and a [[synonym]] for one incapable of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "Dunce". Encyclopædia Britannica. 8 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. p. 671.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Scotism grew in Catholic Europe. Scotus's works were collected into many editions, particularly in the late fifteenth century with the advent of [[printing]]. His school was probably at the height of its popularity at the beginning of the seventeenth century; during the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries there were even special Scotist chairs, e.g. at Paris, Rome, Coimbra, Salamanca, Alcalá, Padua, and Pavia. New ideas were included [[pseudographical]]ly in later editions of his work, such as the [[principle of explosion]], now attributed to '''Pseudo-Scotus'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.  Scotism flourished well into the seventeenth century, and its influence can be seen in such writers as [[Descartes]] and Bramhall. Interest dwindled in the eighteenth century, and the revival of scholastic philosophy, known as [[neo-Scholasticism]], was essentially a revival of Thomistic thinking.

=== Twentieth century ===
The twentieth century saw a resurgence of interest in Scotus, with a range of assessments of his thought.

For one thing, Scotus has received interest from secular philosophers such as Peter King, Gyula Klima, Paul Vincent Spade, and others.

For some today, Scotus is one of the most important [[Franciscan]] theologians and the founder of [[Scotism]], a special form of [[Scholasticism]]. He came out of the Old Franciscan School, to which [[Haymo of Faversham]] (died 1244), [[Alexander of Hales]] (died 1245), [[John of Rupella]] (died 1245), [[William of Melitona]] (died 1260), St. [[Bonaventure]] (died 1274), [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Matthew of Aquasparta]] (died 1289), [[John Peckham]], Archbishop of Canterbury (died 1292), [[Richard of Middletown]] (died c. 1300), etc., belonged. He was known as "Doctor Subtilis" because of the subtle distinctions and nuances of his thinking. Later philosophers in the sixteenth century were less complimentary about his work and accused him of [[Sophism|sophistry]]. This led to the word "[[dunce]]," which developed from the name "Dunse" given to his followers in the 1500s, becoming used for "somebody who is incapable of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]]."

An important question since the 1960s has revolved over whether Scotus's thought heralded a change in thinking on the nature of 'being,' a change which marked a shift from Aquinas and other previous thinkers; this question has been particularly significant in recent years because it has come to be seen as a debate over the origins of 'modernity.' This line of argument first emerged in the 1960s among popular French philosophers who, in passing, singled out Duns Scotus as the figure whose theory of univocal being changed an earlier approach which Aquinas had shared with his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]], ''L'Écriture et la différence'', (Paris, 1967), p216; G Deleuze, ''Différence et répétition,'' (Paris, 1968), pp. 52–8, cited in John Marenbon, "Aquinas, Radical Orthodoxy, and the importance of truth", in Wayne J Hankey and Douglas Hedley, eds, ''Deconstructing radical orthodoxy: postmodern theology, rhetoric and truth'', (Ashgate, 2005), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1990, the historian of philosophy Jean-Francois Courtine argued that, between the time of Aquinas in the mid-thirteenth century and [[Francisco Suárez]] at the turn of the seventeenth, a fundamentally new approach to being was developed, with Scotus taking a major part in its development.&lt;ref&gt;John Marenbon, "Aquinas, Radical Orthodoxy, and the importance of truth", in Wayne J Hankey and Douglas Hedley, eds, ''Deconstructing radical orthodoxy: postmodern theology, rhetoric and truth'', (Ashgate, 2005), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, various scholars extended this argument to locate Scotus as the first thinker who succumbed to what [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] termed 'onto-theology'. 

In recent years, this criticism of Scotus has become disseminated in particular through the writings of the 'Radical Orthodox' group of theologians, centred around [[John Milbank]] and [[Catherine Pickstock]]. The Radical Orthodox model has been questioned by [[Daniel Horan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horan|first1=Daniel|title=Postmodernity and Univocity: A Critical Account of Radical Orthodoxy and John Duns Scotus|date=2014|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9781451465723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Thomas|title=The Doctrine of Univocity is True and Salutary|journal=Modern Theology|date=2005|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, both of whom claim that Scotus' doctrine of the univocity of being is a semantic, rather than an ontological theory. Both thinkers cite Ord. 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 3, n. 163, in which Scotus claims that "This [univocally] is how all the authoritative passages one might find on this topic in the Metaphysics or Physics should be inter- preted: in terms of the ontological diversity of those things to which the concept is attributed, which is compatible with there being one concept that can be abstracted from them". Such a quotation seems to refer to epistemology, with abstracted concepts, rather than with ontology, which Scotus admits can be diverse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6410">'''Avraham Eliyahu Mokotow''' (22 March 1912 – 7 February 1976), better known as Eliyahu Kitov, was a [[Rabbi]], educator, and community activist.

==Biography==
His younger years were spent in the town of [[Opole Lubelskie]], where he learned in a ''[[cheder]]'' and a ''[[beis midrash]]''. Most of his education was from his father, R. Michel, who was a [[Hasidic Judaism|Chassid]], a close student of [[Zadok HaKohen|Rabbi Zadok HaCohen of Lublin]], and had a great influence in forming his personality.

At the age of 17, he left Opole Lubelskie and moved back to [[Warsaw]]. There he studied in a ''beis midrash'', worked at backbreaking jobs, while also doing public work for [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]] of Poland. In his capacity as an educator, he gave lectures in [[Talmud]], [[Tanakh]] and [[Judaism|Jewish thought]]. At that time, he also worked on a volunteer basis in secular Jewish schools for abandoned children, until his ''[[Aliyah]]'' to Israel in 1936. He married a sister of Rabbi [[Alexander Zusia Friedman]], top activist for the [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Dr. Hillel. "The Warsaw Ghetto Diaries". Southfield, Michigan:[[Targum Press]], 1997, p. 341. {{ISBN|1-56871-133-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his immigration to [[Israel]], he worked in construction. As a [[Chareidi Judaism|Chareidi]] Jew, he was extremely dissatisfied with the terrible conditions the Chareidi workers experienced, and helped establish the Union of Agudath Israel workers (''[[Poalei Agudat Yisrael]]''). In addition to its concern for finding steady work for its members, this group eventually established cooperative factories of its own, in the fields of construction and industry. Rav Kitov engaged in this endeavor on a volunteer basis, alongside his own work in construction.

In 1941, he established a school for ''Chareidi'' children, where he served as principal for about eight years. At the same time, he became very involved with public affairs, editing the ''Poalei Agudat Yisrael'' newspaper, ''HaKol'' [''The Voice'']. In this journal, he published hundreds of articles, under various names, on a wide variety of subjects. In these writings, one can discern the budding of his writing capabilities that were to follow in his many books later on.

In 1954, eighteen years after he immigrated to Israel, he left politics and public works and began to write full-time. Despite a lack of funds, he established a small publishing house called ''Aleph Institute Publications'' (now ''Yad Eliyahu Kitov''), through which he published his various books.

From then until the end of his life, some twenty years, his main activity was writing and editing. However, at times he would get involved in education: giving guidance to teachers, lectures and publishing articles, mostly in the United States.

==Works==
*''Chassidim v’Anshei Ma’aseh'' – 5 volumes of Chassidic stories, 1956–1957, 1966. Two of these have been translated by M. Zakon and published in English as "In the Lion's Den," and "Sharp as a Needle."
*''Ish U'Veito'', 1957 – translated into English by Rabbi [[Nachman Bulman]] as "The Jew and his Home."
*''Sefer HaToda'ah'' – His most famous work, translated into [[English language|English]] by Rabbi Nachman Bulman as "The Book of Our Heritage." Also translated into Spanish by Rabbi Natan Grunblatt, [http://www.kehot.com.ar/tiempo.htm Ed. Kehot Lubavitch Sudamericana], as "Nosotros en el Tiempo." The original [[Hebrew language]] version is available online at [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41319 Hebrewbooks.org].
*''Sefer HaParshiyot'' 1961–76 – a rich, comprehensive set on the weekly Torah portions. Although it is mainly based on Midrash and Talmud, early Biblical commentaries, and Chassidic texts, the imprint of the author is noticeable, and many of his own insights are blended into the text.

==Descendants==
Rabbi Kitov had four sons, Oded, Shalom Zvi z"l, Yehoshua and Zurishadai, whose families live in Jerusalem; and three daughters, Rachel (Kitzes) and Ruth (Ben Arza), who also live in Jerusalem; and Na'ama (Nothman) z"l, who lives in South Africa. Many of them and/or their spouses continue to inspire the next generation with his teachings.

==Family history==
There is much misinformation about the family history of Eliyahu Kitov. Literature states he was born Abraham Eliyahu Mokotovski in Warsaw. In fact, he was born Abraham Eliyahu Mokotow and used the surname Mokotow as late as 1953 when he made a trip to the United States. His Polish passport, which he surrendered upon immigrating to Palestine, shows his name as Mokotow. When running for the [[Knesset]] in 1947, he used the name Abraham Eliyahu Mokotovski.&lt;ref&gt;Database of Israel Genealogical Research Group&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born on March 22, 1912, most likely in Opole Lubelskie, Poland, one of at least ten children, the majority born in [[Józefów nad Wisłą]], Poland. The sibling who was just older than he was, was born in [[Zaklików]], Poland, and the sibling just younger than he was, was born in Opole Lubelskie. All these towns are near each other and some distance from Warsaw. If he was born in Warsaw, his parents most likely were visiting there at the time.

He was the son of Michel Mokotow and Rachel Samburski. His father was born on November 22, 1871 in [[Połaniec]], Poland. This town is in the vicinity of the three previously named towns. Michel’s parents were Chaim Tuvia Mokotow (born about 1842) and Malka Wajnberger (born about 1845). Chaim Tuvia's parents were Icek Mokotow (born June 10, 1809 in [[Warka]], Poland) and Esther Holszkiner (born about 1807). Icek's parents were Tuvia David Mokotow (born about 1774, died 18 Jan 1842 in Warsaw) and Tauba Moskowicz (born about 1770). Tuvia's father’s name was Moszek Aronowicz (Moshe ben Aron) who died on July 25, 1810 in Warka, Poland, at the age of 83.

[[File:Efez Celsus Library 5 RB.jpg|thumb|Personification of Episteme in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]], Turkey.]]
"'''Episteme'''" is a philosophical term derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:ἐπιστήμη|ἐπιστήμη]] ''epistēmē'', which can refer to [[knowledge]], [[science]] or [[understanding]], and which comes from the verb {{lang|grc|ἐπίστασθαι}}, meaning "to know, to understand, or to be acquainted with".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)pisth/mh|ἐπιστήμη}}, {{LSJ|e)pi/stamai|ἐπίστασθαι|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Plato contrasts episteme with "[[doxa]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|do/ca^|δόξα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; common belief or opinion. Episteme is also distinguished from "[[techne]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|te/xnh|τέχνη|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a craft or applied practice. The word "[[epistemology]]"  is derived from episteme.

== Western philosophy ==
=== Michel Foucault ===&lt;!-- 'Episteme (Foucault)' redirects here --&gt;
The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] used the term ''épistémè'' in a specialized sense in his work ''[[The Order of Things]]'' to mean the historical, but non-temporal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' which grounds knowledge and its [[discourse]]s and thus represents the [[condition of possibility| condition of their possibility]] within a particular epoch. 

In subsequent writings, he made it clear that several ''épistémè'' may co-exist and interact at the same time, being parts of various power-knowledge systems. But he did not discard the concept:
{{Quote | I would define the episteme retrospectively as the strategic apparatus which permits of separating out from among all the statements which are possible those that will be acceptable within, I won’t say a scientific theory, but a field of scientificity, and which it is possible to say are true or false. The episteme is the ‘apparatus’ which makes possible the separation, not of the true from the false, but of what may from what may not be characterised as scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = Power/Knowledge | year = 1980 | page = 197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet in Foucault's ''The Order of Things'' he describes ''épistémè'' as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, if in any given culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in a theory or silently invested in a practice. (Foucault, 168)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Relation of the Foucaultian épistémè to Kuhn's ''paradigm'' ====
Foucault's use of ''épistémè'' has been asserted as being similar to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of a ''[[paradigm]]'', as for example by [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jean | last = Piaget | title = Structuralism | origyear = 1968 | year = 1970 | page = 132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are decisive differences. 

Whereas Kuhn's ''paradigm'' is an all-encompassing collection of beliefs and assumptions that result in the organization of scientific worldviews and practices, Foucault's ''episteme'' is not merely confined to science but to a wider range of discourse (all of science itself would fall under the ''episteme'' of the epoch). 

Kuhn's paradigm shifts are a consequence of a series of conscious decisions made by scientists to pursue a neglected set of questions. Foucault's ''episteme'' is something like the 'epistemological unconscious' of an era; the resultant configuration of knowledge of a particular ''episteme'' is, to Foucault, based on a set of primordial, fundamental assumptions that are so basic to the ''episteme'' that they're experientially "invisible" to the constituents (such as people, organizations, or systems) operating within the ''episteme.''

Moreover, Kuhn's concept corresponds to what Foucault calls ''theme'' or theory of a science, but Foucault analyzed how ''opposing'' theories and themes could ''co-exist'' within a science.{{Sfn | Foucault | 1969 | loc = ch. II.IV}}  Kuhn doesn't search for the conditions of possibility of opposing discourses within a science, but simply for the invariant dominant paradigm governing scientific research (supposing that ''one'' paradigm always ''is'' pervading, except under paradigmatic transition).  

Foucault attempts to demonstrate the constitutive limits of discourse, and in particular, the rules enabling their productivity; however, Foucault maintained that though [[ideology]] may infiltrate and form science, it need not do so: it must be demonstrated how [[ideology]] actually forms the science in question; contradictions and lack of objectivity is not an indicator of [[ideology]].{{Sfn | Foucault | 1969 | loc = ch. IV.VI.c}} &lt;blockquote&gt;"Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint. And it induces regular effects of power. Each society has its regime of truth, its "general politics” of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true." &lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. (1980): ‘Truth and Power’. In C. Gordon (ed.): ''Power/Knowledge. Selected Interviews &amp; Other Writings 1972-1977'' by Michel Foucault, Brighton: Havester, pp. 109-
133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, Paul (editor) ''The Foucault Reader: An introduction to Foucault’s thought''. (1991)  London, Penguin. 400 pages, {{ISBN|0140124861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kuhn's and Foucault's notions are possibly influenced by the French philosopher of science [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s notion of an "[[epistemological rupture]]", as indeed was Althusser.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

=== Judith Butler ===
In 1997, [[Judith Butler]] used the concept of episteme in her book ''[[Judith Butler#Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative (1997)|Excitable Speech]]'', examining the use of [[speech-act|speech-act theory]] for political purposes.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

'''Ermes di [[Colloredo]]''' (28 March 1622 – 21 September 1692) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[count]] and writer who served the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Republic of Venice]].

Ermes was born in [[Colloredo di Monte Albano]], [[Friaul]]. He was educated at [[Medici]]'s court in [[Florence]] as page of Greatduke [[Ferdinando II de' Medici]], and entered the service of Emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] during the [[Thirty Years War]] as a Cuirassiers' Officier, at the orders of his uncle, Field Marschall Rudolf von Colloredo Mels und Wallsee, Governor of [[Prague]], of the [[Republic of Venice]] as a Cavalry Colonel and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]]. In the latter part of his life Ermes returned to his homeland to focus on writing poetry, most of which centers on the theme of love.

Ermes wrote over 200 [[sonnet]]s, in both [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. He used the ''koinè'' from [[San Daniele]], which would become the most notable literary language and the basis of today's standard Friulian.

Ermes died in Gurizzo, [[Codroipo]].

'''Experimental film''', '''experimental cinema''' or '''avant-garde cinema''' is a mode of filmmaking that rigorously re-evaluates cinematic conventions and explores non-narrative forms and alternatives to traditional narratives or methods of working.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Pramaggiore and Tom Wallis, Film: A Critical Introduction, Laurence King Publishing, London, 2005, pg. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Many experimental films, particularly early ones, relate to arts in other disciplines: painting, dance, literature and poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Laura Marcus, The Tenth Muse: Writing about Cinema in the Modernist Period, Oxford University Press, New York 2007&lt;/ref&gt; or arise from research and development of new technical resources.&lt;ref&gt;* [[Gene Youngblood]], ''Expanded Cinema'' (Dutton, 1970) available as pdf at [http://www.ubu.com/historical/youngblood/index.html Ubuweb]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some experimental films have been distributed through mainstream channels or even made within commercial studios, the vast majority have been produced on very low budgets with a minimal crew or a single person and are either self-financed or supported through small grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-experimental-films.php|title=Top 10 Experimental Films  - Toptenz.net|date=19 January 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental filmmakers generally begin as amateurs, and some used experimental films as a springboard into commercial film making or transitioned into academic positions. The aim of experimental filmmaking is usually to render the personal vision of an artist, or to promote interest in new technology rather than to entertain or to generate revenue, as is the case with commercial films. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/film/experimentation-in-film-the-avant-garde/ MoMA-Experimentaion in Film-The Avant-Garde]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term describes a range of [[filmmaking]] styles that are generally quite different from, and often opposed to, the practices of mainstream commercial and [[documentary film]]making. ''[[Avant-garde]]'' is also used, for the films shot in the twenties in the field of history's avant-gardes currents in France, Germany or Russia, to describe this work, and "[[underground film|underground]]" was used in the sixties, though it has also had other connotations. Today the term "experimental cinema" prevails, because it's possible to make experimental films without the presence of any avant-garde movement in the cultural field.

While "experimental" covers a wide range of practice, an experimental film is often characterized by the absence of linear narrative, the use of various abstracting techniques—out-of-focus, painting or scratching on film, rapid editing—the use of asynchronous ([[Diegesis|non-diegetic]]) sound or even the absence of any sound track. The goal is often to place the viewer in a more active and more thoughtful relationship to the film. At least through the 1960s, and to some extent after, many experimental films took an oppositional stance toward mainstream culture.

Most such films are made on very low budgets, self-financed or financed through small grants, with a minimal crew or, often a crew of only one person, the filmmaker. Some critics have argued that much experimental film is no longer in fact "experimental" but has in fact become a mainstream [[film genre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/experimental.jsp GreenCine &amp;#124; Experimental/Avant-Garde] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210221820/http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/experimental.jsp |date=2005-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its more typical features—such as a non-narrative, [[impressionism|impressionistic]], or poetic approaches to the film's construction—define what is generally understood to be "experimental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Criticism-Ideology/Experimental-Film.html|title=Experimental Film - married, show, name, cinema, scene, book, story, documentary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the European avant-garde==

===Beginnings===
Two conditions made Europe in the 1920s ready for the emergence of experimental film. First, the cinema matured as a medium, and highbrow resistance to the mass entertainment began to wane. Second, avant-garde movements in the visual arts flourished. The [[Dada]]ists and [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] in particular took to cinema. [[René Clair]]'s ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' (1924) featuring [[Francis Picabia]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Man Ray]], and with music by [[Erik Satie]], took madcap comedy into nonsequitur.

Artists [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Cocteau]], Marcel Duchamp, [[Germaine Dulac]], and [[Viking Eggeling]] all contributed Dadaist/Surrealist shorts. [[Fernand Léger]], [[Dudley Murphy]], and Man Ray created the film ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]'' (1924), sometimes described as [[Dadaism|Dadaist]], [[Cubism|Cubist]], or [[Futurism|Futurist]]. Duchamp created the abstract film ''[[Anemic Cinema|Anémic Cinéma]]'' (1926).

[[Alberto Cavalcanti]] directed ''[[Rien que les heures]]'' (1926), [[Walter Ruttmann]] directed ''[[Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis]]'' (1927), and [[Dziga Vertov]] filmed ''[[Man with a Movie Camera|Man With a Movie Camera]]'' (1929), experimental "city symphonies" of [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], and [[Kiev]], respectively.

The most famous experimental film is generally considered to be [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí]]'s ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1929). Hans Richter's animated shorts, [[Oskar Fischinger]]'s abstract films, and [[Len Lye]]'s [[General Post Office|GPO]] films would be excellent examples of more abstract European avant-garde films. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/445895/index.html BFI Screenonline:20s-30s Avant-Garde]&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Working in France, another group of filmmakers also financed films through patronage and distributed them through cine-clubs, yet they were narrative films not tied to an avant-garde school. Film scholar [[David Bordwell]] has dubbed these [[French Impressionist Cinema|French Impressionists]], and included [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Marcel L'Herbier]], and [[Dimitri Kirsanoff]]. These films combine narrative experimentation, rhythmic editing and camerawork, and an emphasis on character subjectivity. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcg7The Filming of Modern Life: European Avant-Garde Film of the 1920s on JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1952, the [[Lettrists]] avant-garde movement in France, caused riots at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], when [[Isidore Isou]]'s ''Traité de bave et d'éternité'' (also known as ''[[Venom and Eternity]]'') was screened. After their criticism of [[Charlie Chaplin]] at the 1952 press conference in Paris for Chaplin's ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', there was a split within the movement. The [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s continued to cause disruptions when they announced the death of cinema and showed their new [[hypergraphics|hypergraphical]] techniques; the most notorious example is [[Guy Debord]]'s ''Howlings in favor of de Sade'' (''[[Hurlements en Faveur de Sade]]'') from 1952.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet filmmakers, too, found a counterpart to modernist painting and photography in their theories of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]. The films of [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Lev Kuleshov]], [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] were instrumental in providing an alternative model from that offered by [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]]. While not experimental films per se, they contributed to the film language of the avant-garde. &lt;ref&gt;[https://nofilmschool.com/2013/09/brief-history-experimental-cinema A (Very Brief) History of Experimental Cinema-No Film School]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prewar and postwar American avant-garde: the birth of experimental cinema==
The U.S. had some avant-garde films before [[World War II]], such as ''[[Manhatta]]'' (1921) by [[Charles Sheeler]] and [[Paul Strand]], and ''[[The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra]]'' (1928) by [[Slavko Vorkapich]] and [[Robert Florey]]. However, much pre-war experimental film culture consisted of artists working, often in isolation, on film projects. Painter [[Emlen Etting]] (1905–1993) directed [[dance film]]s in the early 1930s that are considered experimental. Commercial artist (''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'') and illustrator [[Douglass Crockwell]] (1904–1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulltable.com/VTS/c/crockwell/menu.htm|title=Douglass Crockwell, Alphabet of Illustrators, Chris Mullen Collection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made animations with blobs of paint pressed between sheets of glass in his studio at [[Glens Falls, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=kt2f59q2dp&amp;chunk.id=ch01&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ch01&amp;brand=ucpress|title=Hollywood Quarterly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rochester, New York]], medical doctor and philanthropist [[James Sibley Watson]] and Melville Webber directed ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher (1928 American film)|The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' (1928) and ''[[Lot in Sodom]]'' (1933). [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]], [[Mary Ellen Bute]], artist [[Joseph Cornell]], and Christopher Young made several European-influenced experimental films. Smith and Bute were both influenced by Oskar Fischinger, as were many avant garde animators and filmmakers. In 1930 appears the magazine ''Experimental Cinema'' with, for the first time, the two words directly connected without any space between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Experimental-1930-1934-Periodical-through-Reprints/dp/B001MPSLX0|title=Experimental Cinema 1930-1934 Periodical|first1=Experimental|last1=Cinema|first2=Cinema Crafters of|last2=America|first3=George|last3=Amberg|editor-first1=David|editor-last1=Platt|editor-first2=Lewis|editor-last2=Jacobs|editor-first3=Seymour|editor-last3=Stern|editor-first4=B.

In October 2005, a large collection of films of that time were restored and re-released on DVD, titled ''Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894-1941''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/02/21/posner.html|title=Interview with Bruce Posner, the curator|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305073958/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/02/21/posner.html|archivedate=2010-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Slavko Vorkapich, [[John Hoffman (filmmaker)|John Hoffman]] made two visual tone poems, ''[[Moods of the Sea]]'' (aka ''[[Fingal's Cave]]'', 1941) and ''[[Forest Murmurs]]'' (1947). The former film is set to [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Hebrides Overture]]'' and was restored in 2004 by film preservation expert [[David Shepard (film preservationist)|David Shepard]].

''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943) by [[Maya Deren]] and [[Alexandr Hackenschmied|Alexander Hammid]] is considered by some to be one of the first important American experimental films. It provided a model for self-financed [[16 mm film|16 mm]] production and distribution, one that was soon picked up by [[Cinema 16]] and other [[film society|film societies]]. Just as importantly, it established an aesthetic model of what experimental cinema could do. ''Meshes'' had a dream-like feel that hearkened to Jean Cocteau and the Surrealists, but equally seemed personal, new and American. Early works by [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Shirley Clarke]], [[Gregory Markopoulos]], [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Willard Maas]], [[Marie Menken]], [[Curtis Harrington]], [[Sidney Peterson]], [[Lionel Rogosin]], and [[Earle M. Pilgrim]] followed in a similar vein. Significantly, many of these filmmakers were the first students from the pioneering university film programs established in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]]. In 1946, [[Frank Stauffacher]] started the "Art in Cinema" series of experimental films at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], where Oskar Fischinger's films were featured in several special programs, influencing artists such as Jordan Belson and Harry Smith to make experimental animation.

They set up "alternative film programs" at [[Black Mountain College]] (now defunct) and the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]. [[Arthur Penn]] taught at Black Mountain College, which points out the popular misconception in both the art world and Hollywood that the avant-garde and the commercial never meet. Another challenge to that misconception is the fact that late in life, after each's Hollywood careers had ended, both [[Nicholas Ray]] and [[King Vidor]] made avant-garde films.

===The New American Cinema and Structural-Materialism===
{{main|Structural film}}

The film society and self-financing model continued over the next two decades, but by the early 1960s, a different outlook became perceptible in the work of American avant-garde filmmakers. Artist [[Bruce Conner]] created early examples such as ''[[A Movie]]'' (1958) and ''[[Cosmic Ray (film)|Cosmic Ray]]'' (1962). As [[P. Adams Sitney]] has pointed out, in the work of [[Stan Brakhage]] and other American experimentalists of early period, film is used to express the individual consciousness of the maker, a cinematic equivalent of the first person in literature. [[Brakhage]]'s ''[[Dog Star Man]]'' (1961–64) exemplified a shift from personal confessional to abstraction, and also evidenced a rejection of American mass culture of the time. On the other hand, [[Kenneth Anger]] added a rock sound track to his ''[[Scorpio Rising (film)|Scorpio Rising]]'' (1963) in what is sometimes said to be an anticipation of [[music video]]s, and included some [[camp (style)|camp]] commentary on Hollywood mythology. [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] and [[Andy Warhol]] incorporated camp elements into their work, and Sitney posited Warhol's connection to structural film.

Some avant-garde filmmakers moved further away from narrative. Whereas the New American Cinema was marked by an oblique take on narrative, one based on abstraction, camp and minimalism, Structural-Materialist filmmakers like [[Hollis Frampton]] and [[Michael Snow]] created a highly [[Formalist film theory|formalist]] cinema that foregrounded the medium itself: the frame, projection, and most importantly, time. It has been argued that by breaking film down into bare components, they sought to create an anti-illusionist cinema, although Frampton's late works owe a huge debt to the photography of [[Edward Weston]], [[Paul Strand]], and others, and in fact celebrate illusion. Further, while many filmmakers began making rather academic "structural films" following ''[[Film Culture]]'''s publication of an article by P. Adams Sitney in the late 1960s, many of the filmmakers named in the article objected to the term.

A critical review of the structuralists appeared in a 2000 edition of the art journal ''[[Art In America]]''. It examined structural-formalism as a conservative philosophy of filmmaking.

===The 1960–70s and today.  Time arts in the conceptual art landscape===
[[Conceptual art]] in the 1970s pushed even further. [[Robert Smithson]], a California-based artist, made several films about his [[earthworks (art)|earthworks]] and attached projects. [[Yoko Ono]] made conceptual films, the most notorious of which is ''Rape,'' which finds a woman and invades her life with cameras following her back to her apartment as she flees from the invasion. Around this time a new generation was entering the field, many of whom were students of the early avant-gardists. Leslie Thornton, [[Peggy Ahwesh]], and Su Friedrich expanded upon the work of the structuralists, incorporating a broader range of content while maintaining a self-reflexive form.

[[Andy Warhol]], the man behind [[Pop Art]] and a variety of other oral and art forms, made over 60 films throughout the 1960s, most of them experimental. In more recent years, filmmakers such as [[Craig Baldwin]] and [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]] (''[[Hyperfutura]]'') have made use of stock footage married to live action narratives in a form of mash-up cinema that has strong socio-political undertones.

===Feminist avant-garde and other political offshoots===
[[Laura Mulvey]]'s writing and filmmaking launched a flourishing of [[feminist]] filmmaking based on the idea that conventional Hollywood narrative reinforced gender norms and a patriarchal gaze. Their response was to resist narrative in a way to show its fissures and inconsistencies. [[Chantal Akerman]] and [[Sally Potter]] are just two of the leading feminist filmmakers working in this mode in the 1970s. [[Video art]] emerged as a medium in this period, and feminists like [[Martha Rosler]] and [[Cecelia Condit]] took full advantage of it.

In the 1980s feminist, gay and other political experimental work continued, with filmmakers like [[Barbara Hammer]], [[Su Friedrich]], [[Tracey Moffatt]], [[Sadie Benning]] and [[Isaac Julien]] among others finding experimental format conducive to their questions about identity politics.

The [[queercore]] movement gave rise to a number experimental queer filmmakers such as [[G.B. Jones]] (a founder of the movement) in the 1990s and later [[Scott Treleaven]], among others.

===Experimental Film and the Academy===
With very few exceptions, [[Curtis Harrington]] among them, the artists involved in these early movements remained outside the mainstream commercial cinema and entertainment industry. A few taught occasionally, and then, starting in 1966, many became professors at universities such as the [[State University of New York|State Universities of New York]], [[Bard College]], [[California Institute of the Arts]], the [[Massachusetts College of Art]], [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], and the [[San Francisco Art Institute]].

Many of the practitioners of experimental film do not in fact possess college degrees themselves, although their showings are prestigious. Some have questioned the status of the films made in the academy, but longtime film professors such as [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Ken Jacobs]], [[Ernie Gehr]], and many others, continued to refine and expand their practice while teaching. The inclusion of experimental film in film courses and standard film histories, however, has made the work more widely known and more accessible.

==Exhibition and distribution==

[[File:Jonas Mekas.jpg|thumb|150px|Lithuanian artist [[Jonas Mekas]], regarded as godfather of American [[avant-garde cinema]]]]
Beginning in 1946, [[Frank Stauffacher]] ran the "Art in Cinema" program of experimental and avant-garde films at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].

From 1949 to 1975, the [[:fr:Festival international du cinéma expérimental de Knokke-le-Zoute|Festival international du cinéma expérimental de Knokke-le-Zoute]]—located in [[Knokke-Heist]], [[Belgium]]—was the most prominent festival of experimental cinema in the World. It permits the discovery of American avant-garde in 1958 with Brakhage's films and many others European and American filmmakers.

From 1947 to 1963, the New York-based [[Cinema 16]] functioned as the primary exhibitor and distributor of experimental film in the United States. Under the leadership of Amos Vogel and Marcia Vogel, Cinema 16 flourished as a nonprofit membership society committed to the exhibition of documentary, avant-garde, scientific, educational, and performance films to ever-increasing audiences.

In 1962, [[Jonas Mekas]] and about 20 other film makers founded [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]] in New York City. Soon similar artists cooperatives were formed in other places: [[Canyon Cinema]] in San Francisco, the [[London Film-Makers' Co-op]], and Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Center.

Following the model of Cinema 16, experimental films have been exhibited mainly outside of commercial theaters in small [[film society|film societies]], [[microcinema]]s, [[museums]], [[art galleries]], archives and [[film festivals]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://filmquarterly.org/2009/09/01/the-avant-garde-archive-online/ The Avant-Garde Archive Online-Film Quarterly]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other organizations in both Europe and North America helped develop experimental film. These included [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York City, The Millennium Film Workshop, the [[British Film Institute]] in London, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] and the Collective for Living Cinema.

Some of the more popular film festivals, such as [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]], the [[New York Film Festival]]'s "Views from the Avant-Garde" Side Bar and the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] prominently feature experimental works.

The [[New York Underground Film Festival]], [[Chicago Underground Film Festival]], the [[LA Freewaves]] Experimental Media Arts Festival, [[MIX NYC]] the New York Experimental Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, and Toronto's Images Festival also support this work and provide venues for films which would not otherwise be seen. There is some dispute about whether "underground" and "avant-garde" truly mean the same thing and if challenging non-traditional cinema and fine arts cinema are actually fundamentally related. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fredcamper.com/Film/AvantGardeDefinition.html Naming, and Defining, Avant-Garde or Experimental Film-Fred Camper]&lt;/ref&gt;

Venues such as [[Anthology Film Archives]], [[San Francisco Cinematheque]], [[Berkeley Art Museum|Pacific Film Archive]] in [[Berkeley, California]], Tate Modern, London and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris often include historically significant experimental films and contemporary works. Screening series no longer in New York that featured experimental work include the Robert Beck Memorial Cinema, Ocularis and the [[Collective for Living Cinema]].

Some distributors of experimental film today include Le Collectif Jeune Cinema,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjcinema.org/pages/hors_les_murs.php|title=Collectif Jeune Cinéma|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cinédoc, and Light Cone &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightcone.org/|title=Light Cone - Distribution, diffusion et sauvegarde du cinéma expérimental|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris, [[Canyon Cinema]] in San Francisco, Canadian Filmmaker's Distribution Centre, [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]] in New York, and [http://www.lux.org.uk/ Lux] in London. Sixteen mm prints are still available through these organisations, and some archives. [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org Center for Visual Music] distributes curated film programs of experimental animation, including that of [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Fischinger Oskar Fischinger], [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Belson Jordan Belson], Mary Ellen Bute and others.

All these associations and movements have permitted the birth and development of national experimental films and schools like “body cinema” ("Écoles du corps" or "Cinéma corporel") and “post-structural” movements in France, and “structural/materialism" in England for example.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dominique Noguez]], « Qu’est-ce que le cinéma expérimental ? », ''Éloge du cinéma expérimental'', Paris, [[Centre Georges-Pompidou]], 1979, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on commercial media==
Though experimental film is known to a relatively small number of practitioners, academics and connoisseurs, it has influenced and continues to influence [[cinematography]], [[visual effects]] and [[editing]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://thegoodthebadtheinsulting.blogspot.com/2013/03/mainstream-film-vs-avant-garde-more.html The Good, The Bad and the Insulting: Mainstream Film vs. Avant Garde: More Similar Than We Think?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre of [[music video]] can be seen as a commercialization of many techniques of experimental film. [[Film title design|Title design]] and [[television advertising]] have also been influenced by experimental film. &lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2010/film/awards/avant-garde-influences-the-mainstream-1118026435/ Avant garde influences the mainstream-Variety]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.sonoma.edu/communications/faculty/full-bio/mtv%20at%20the%20movies%20by%20marco%20calavita%20journal%20of%20film%20%20video.pdf “MTV Aesthetics” at the Movies: Interrogating a Film Criticism Fallacy]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sKHcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=experimental+film+title+designs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AobNeSydPg&amp;sig=6saobfwA5QSDOBbtocMQfG6vcbw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjg4N7Ax7beAhXn7oMKHYPQBqE4ChDoATAHegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=experimental%20film%20title%20designs&amp;f=false Motion Graphic Design: Applied History and Aesthetics-Jon Krasner-Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_dekIDkPtMC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;lpg=PA220&amp;dq=experimental+film+tv+advertising&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aNVGoYrFUd&amp;sig=fXzkru7xZUJQ2cs8SsNcsDATX0c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiGwO-NyLbeAhVI6YMKHZbpAPcQ6AEwEXoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=experimental%20film%20tv%20advertising&amp;f=false TV by Design: Modern Art and the Rise of Network Television-Lynn Spigel-Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experimental filmmakers have also made feature films, and vice versa. Notable examples include [[Lars von Trier]], [[Jørgen Leth]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Nikos Nikolaidis]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Kathryn Bigelow]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upress.state.ms.us/books/1834 Kathryn Bigelow: Interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Woody Allen]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2014/07/annie-hall-and-woody-allens-experimental-visual-film-style.html ‘Annie Hall’ and Woody Allen’s Experimental Visual Film Style-Vulture]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Curtis Harrington]], Oscar-winning animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://lukeroberts.tv/blog/little-island-richard-williams/ The Little Island (1958) – Richard Williams-lukeroberts.tv-Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Andy Warhol]], [[Peter Greenaway]], [[Derek Jarman]], [[Harmony Korine]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Isaac Julien]], British Oscar winner [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]], [[Sally Potter]], [[David Lynch]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], [[Vassilis Mazomenos]], [[Thierry Zéno]], [[Patrick Bokanowski]], [[Gus Van Sant]], [[Shaun Wilson]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Simone Rapisarda Casanova]] and [[Luis Buñuel]], although the degree to which their feature filmmaking takes on mainstream commercial aesthetics differs widely.

'''Fala''' ("[[Speech]]", also called ''Xalimego''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proel.org/index.php?pagina=lenguas/fala|title=Promotora Española de Lingüística| access-date=11 April 2018|work=www.proel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Romance language]] commonly classified in the [[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician subgroup]], with some traits from [[Leonese language|Leonese]], spoken in [[Spain]] by about 10,500 people, of whom 5,500 live in a valley of the northwestern part of [[Extremadura]] near the border with [[Portugal]]. The speakers of Fala live in the towns of [[Valverde del Fresno]] (Valverdi du Fresnu), [[Eljas]] (As Ellas) and [[San Martín de Trevejo]] (Sa Martín de Trebellu).

Other names sometimes used for the language are ''Fala de [[Jálama]]'' or ''Fala de Xálima'', but neither of them is used by the speakers themselves, who call their linguistic varieties  ''lagarteiru'' (in Eljas), ''manhegu'' / ''mañegu'' (in San Martín de Trevejo) and ''valverdeiru'' (in Valverde del Fresno).

Even though it has no official status, and has little presence in schools and church, use of the language is vigorous, and the literacy rate in Fala is nearly 100%{{clarify|date=May 2010}}. As a linguistic community, speakers have a strong, independent identity; they have rejected implementing a standard [[orthography]] similar to or based on the Galician one. A translation of the New Testament has been published in Fala (2015).

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Gallego de jálima.PNG|thumb|Extent of the Fala language.]]
In the Middle Ages we can find mixed varieties of Portuguese and Leonese throughout the border between Leon and Portugal, represented in texts as in the ''Foro de Castelo Rodrigo'' (13th century); and although there is no documentation about the colonization and repopulation in this place in the 13th century, there are several hypothesis of Galician citizens moved to protect the frontiers against Muslims as a punishment imposed by the Leonese king, or the delivery of the territories to various military orders by [[Alfonso IX]] and [[Ferdinand II of León|Fernando II]].

Generally speaking, philologists in favor of the Galician theory are based in the hypothesis that the valley is an isolated region and, therefore, the Galician colonists maintain their way of speaking in a "pure" form because of the lack of external influences. This thesis is refuted if we contrast it with other historic data:

* It is considered that before the Galician-Leonese resettlement, this place was already occupied by Portuguese and even after the colonization there was contact with the neighboring country.
* From the 12th until the 16th century, both Portugal and León and Castile wanted the territory because of its importance as a border. It changed from one country to another so the population swore allegiance to one king or another.
* On the other hand, it is contradictory that the orders that these place was given, being enemies, resettled the region with people of the same origin.

[[File:Cartel San Martin.jpg|thumbnail|A sign in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and Fala in [[San Martín de Trevejo]]]]
On August 3, 1992, the association ''Fala i Cultura'' was founded, among its goals being the compilation of a common grammar (based on the Galician one) and the commemoration of ''u día da nosa fala'' (the day of our language) celebrated once a year from 1992 in Eljas, 1993 in Valverde and 1994 in San Martín.

It was not until 1998 that the first literary work in Fala was published: ''Seis sainetes valverdeiros'', written by Isabel López Lajas and published in 1998 by Edicións Positivas ([[Santiago de Compostela]]). It was on this date that the Gabinete de Iniciativas Transfronterizas (Office of Cross-Border Initiatives) started to take interest in Fala and to promote its study, publishing in 1999 scientific works and celebrating in May a "Congress on ''A Fala''".

On June 14, 2000, Fala was recognized by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Extremadura as [[Bien de Interés Cultural]]. Nowadays, although the inhabitants of Jalama Valley can speak Spanish, most of them are bilingual because at home and in other activities outside school, they continue using the local language.

==Sociolinguistic surveys==
In 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Las_hablas_de_San_Mart%C3%ADn_de_Trevejo_Elj.html?id=jm4tMQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y | title = Las hablas de San Martín de Trevejo, Eljas y Valverde del Fresno. Trilogía de los tres lugares | publisher = Editora Regional de Extremadura | isbn = 978-8-476-71494-2 | author1 = Gargallo Gil | first1 = José Enrique | date = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; a survey conducted by [[José Enrique Gargallo Gil]] (a professor at the University of Barcelona) collected the following data regarding the use of Spanish in family conversation:
*4 of the 29 respondents from [[San Martín de Trevejo|San Martín]] use Spanish when speaking with their family (13.8%)
*In [[Eljas]] the figure drops to only 3 out of 54 respondents (5.6%)
*In [[Valverde del Fresno|Valverde]], 25 of 125 respondents use Spanish in this context (20%).

In September/December 1993 a survey was published in issue No. 30 of ''Alcántara'' Magazine by José Luis Martín Galindo, which showed the following percentages of self-identification in San Martín de Trevejo:
*Belief that Fala is a dialect of Spanish: 13%
*Belief that Fala is a dialect of Portuguese: 20%
*Belief that Fala is an autonomous language: 67%

The survey involved only twenty people (over 960 neighbours) and that there was no alternative to answer that the respondent believed that Fala is a dialect of [[Galician language|Galician]]. It is argued that the absence of this option was logical since theories about the possible relation of Fala with Galician were hardly known.

In 1994, a new study showed that 80% of respondents learned to speak Spanish in school, the percentage of speech used in the family environment being as follows:
*100% of the parents of Eljas claim to speak the Fala when talking with their children
*85% of the parents of San Martín claim to speak the Fala when talking with their children
*73% of the parents of Valverde claim to speak the Fala when talking with their children

'''Francisco Balagtas''' (born '''Francisco Baltazar  y de la Cruz'''; April 2, 1788 – February 20, 1862), also known as '''Francisco Baltazar''', was a prominent [[Philippines|Filipino]] poet, and is widely considered one of the greatest Filipino literary [[laureates]] for his impact on Filipino literature. The famous epic, ''[[Florante at Laura]]'', is regarded as his defining [[Creative work|work]].

The surname  "Baltazar", sometimes misconstrued as a [[pen name]], was a legal surname Balagtas adopted after the 1849 edict of Governor-General [[Narciso Claveria y Zaldua]], which mandated that the native population adopt standard Spanish surnames instead of native ones.
His mentor was [[José de la Cruz]], otherwise known as ''Joseng Sisiw''.

== Early life ==
Francisco Balagtas Baltazar  was born on April 2, 1788, in Barrio Panginay, Balagtas Bulacan; formerly Bigaa; He was the youngest of the four children of Juan Baltazar, a blacksmith, and Juana de la Cruz. He was baptized on April 30 that same year.&lt;ref name="baptism"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSMN-52MW |title=Film # 007773763 Image Film # 007773763; ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSMN-52MW — FamilySearch.org |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied Canon Law, Philosophy, Latin, and the Classics in Colegio San Juan de Letran
and Colegio de San Jose. He finished school in 1812.

== Life as a poet ==
Balagtas learned to write poetry from [[José de la Cruz]] (''Joseng Sisiw''), one of the most famous poets of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]], in return for chicks. It was De la Cruz himself who personally challenged Balagtas to improve his writing. Balagtas swore he would overcome Huseng Sisiw as he would not ask for anything in return as a poet.

In 1835, Balagtas moved to Pandacan, Manila, where he met María Asunción Rivera, who would effectively serve as the muse for his future works. She is referenced in ''Florante at Laura'' as 'Selya' and 'MAR'.

Balagtas' affections for MAR were challenged by the influential Mariano Capule. The latter won the battle for MAR when he used his wealth to get Balagtas imprisoned. It was here that he wrote ''Florante at Laura''—in fact, the events of this poem were meant to parallel his own situation.

He wrote his poems in the Tagalog language, during an age when Filipino writing was predominantly written in Spanish.

Balagtas published "Florante at Laura" upon his release in 1838. He moved to Balanga, Bataan, in 1840 where he served as the assistant to the Justice of the Peace. He was also appointed as the translator of the court. He married Juana Tiambeng on July 22, 1842 in a ceremony officiated by Fr. Cayetano Arellano, uncle of future Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the Philippines  -- Chief Justice Arellano. They had eleven children but only  four survived to adulthood. On November 21, 1849, Governor General [[Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa, 1st Count of Manila|Narciso Clavería y Zaldua]] issued a decree that every Filipino native must adopt a Spanish surname. In 1856, he was appointed as the Major Lieutenant, but soon after was convicted and sent to prison again in Bataan under the accusation that he ordered Alferez Lucas' housemaid's head to be shaved.

He sold his land and all of his riches, in order for him to be imprisoned in 1861, and continued writing poetry, along with translating Spanish documents, but he died a year later -- on February 20, 1862, at the age of 73. Upon his deathbed, he asked the favor that none of his children become poets like him, who had suffered under his gift as well as under others. He even went as far as to tell them it would be better to cut their hands off than let them be writers.

Balagtas is greatly idolized in the Philippines that the term for [[Filipino language|Filipino]] debate in extemporaneous verse is named after him: ''[[Balagtasan]]''.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Balagtas,Bulacanjf9650 18.JPG|thumb|"Pook na Sinilangan ni Balagtas" Monument in Panginay, Balagtas, Bulacan]]
An elementary school was erected in honor of Balagtas, the [[Francisco Balagtas Elementary School]] (FBES), located along Alvarez Street in [[Santa Cruz, Manila]]. There is also a plaza and park (Plaza Balagtas) erected in [[Pandacan]], Manila while most of the streets were named after various Florante at Laura characters in honor of Francisco Balagtas. His birthplace, Bigaa, Bulacan, was renamed to [[Balagtas, Bulacan]] in his memory. A museum, historical marker, monument and elementary school has been placed in his birthplace at Panginay, Balagtas, Bulacan. The former Folk Arts Theater in Manila was renamed to [[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas]] to honor Balagtas. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercurian]] crater was also [[Balagtas (crater)|named after him]].  The [[barangay]] of Udyong in [[Orion, Bataan]] was also renamed Balagtas.

On April 2, 2018, [[Google]] celebrated Balagtas' 230th birthday celebration with a [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/02/18/google-celebrates-balagtas-230th-birthday-with-special-doodle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-and-culture/199363-google-doodle-francisco-balagtas-birth-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==

=== Sources of Balagtas' work ===
No original manuscript in Balagtas' handwriting of any of his works has survived to the present day. This is due mainly to two great fires that razed Udyong (Now Balagtas in [[Orion, Bataan]]) and destroyed much of the poet's works.&lt;ref name="businessweekmindanao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweekmindanao.com/2015/03/12/surviving-great-granddaughter-of-balagtas-speaks-highly-of-renowned-poet/|publisher=businessweekmindanao.com|title=The web portal of BWM Group of Publications|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kun sino ang kumathâ ng̃ "Florante": kasaysayan ng̃ búhay ni Francisco Baltazar at pag-uulat nang kanyang karunung̃a't kadakilaan|author=Cruz, H.|date=1906|publisher=Libr. "Manila Filatélico,"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1S5BAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of his works, ''"Florante at Laura"'' or ''"Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at Laura sa Kaharian ng Albanya"'' has been published in numerous editions from its original publication in 1838. The oldest extant edition of the Florante is believed to be the 1861 edition&lt;ref&gt;https://trixiesolis.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/florante-at-laura.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; published in Manila, while a handwritten manuscript written down by [[Apolinario Mabini]] exists and is in the possession of the [[National Library of the Philippines|Philippine National Library]]. 

&lt;br&gt;The major source of the poet's life and works is from a 20th-century work entitled ''"Kun Sino ang Kumatha ng Florante"'' (He who wrote the Florante) by Hermenigildo Cruz. The poet lists down Balagtas' works and recreates some of his plays based on scenes and lines memorized by the poet's children. The book also has an edition of the Florante.&lt;ref name="google" /&gt; Balagtas wrote ten (10) comedias and one (1) metrical romance according to Cruz as well as numerous other poems and short plays that are recorded in his book. These include two (2) ''laos'' or short celebratory scenes usually involving a patron saint and performed during fiestas.

=== Complete works ===
Only 3 of Balagtas' works survived complete and intact to this day. Out of the 3, "Florante at Laura" is considered Balagtas' defining work and is a cultural touchstone for the Philippines.
*''[[Florante at Laura]]'' or ''[[Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at Laura sa Kaharian ng Albanya]]'', an ''awit'' (metrical narrative poem with dodecasyllabic quatrains [12 syllables per line, 4 lines per stanza]); Balagtas' masterpiece
*''La India elegante y el negrito amante'' – a short play in one part
*''[[Orosman at Zafira]]'' – a comedia in three parts

=== Reconstructed/rediscovered works ===
Majority of the source material for Balagtas' work come from Hermenigildo Cruz' book which itself is based on the surviving testimonies and memories of Balagtas' children at the turn of the century. In his book, he reconstructs five (5) plays.&lt;ref name="philippinestudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/ojs/index.php/ps/article/view/2182/4170|publisher=philippinestudies.net|title=Consolidation of Tradition in Nineteenth-Century Tagalog Poetry &amp;#124; Lumbera &amp;#124; Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Rodolfo at Rosemonda''
*''Nudo gordeano''
*''Abdol at Misereanan'' – a ''komedya'', staged in Abucay, Bataan in 1857
*''Bayaceto at Dorslica'' –  a ''komedya'' in three parts, staged at Udyong on September 27, 1857

=== Minor works ===
As a folk poet and employee of the courts, Balagtas' prowess in writing was mainly seen in the yearly fiestas held in nearby towns, a great majority of his plays may have been staged in outdoor theaters set up in town squares and as a poet, a number of his works and writings have been recorded in collections of poetry such as the "''Coleccion de refranes, frases y modismos tagalos''" (Guadalupe, 1890) as well as in the accounts of Spanish officials such as Martinez de Zuniga who recorded traditional plays and religious events in Philippine fiestas.&lt;ref name="philippinestudies"/&gt; 

&lt;br /&gt;Balagtas also wrote in the [[Ladino poem|Ladino]] style of poems that were popular among his contemporaries. He is said to have written two (2) loas recorded in Cruz's book as well as numerous Ladinos and didactic works.

==== Loas ====
*''In praise of the Archangel Michael'' a ''loa'' written for the patron saint of the town of Udyong
*''In Celebration of the crowning of Queen Isabella II of the Bourbon Dynasty'' Celebrating the ascension of [[Isabella II of Spain and the Indies|Isabella II]] to the Spanish throne

=== Minor poems ===
A number of Minor poems are recorded in Cruz's book.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philippinestudies"/&gt;
*''"Pangaral sa Isang Binibining Ikakasal"'' (Admonition to a Young Lady About To Be Married) A didactic work.
*''"Paalam Na sa Iyo. . .!"'' (And So Farewell to You... !) A bilingual poem (Written in Spanish and Tagalog) written in Ladino style.&lt;ref name="philippinestudies"/&gt;

=== Lost works ===
Five (5) of the ten (10) plays Balagtas wrote as recorded by Cruz are considered lost. Another work, "Claus" a translation work from Latin is considered lost for Cruz does not mention any fragments or elaborates on it in his book, Eufronio Alip's 1930 Tagalog literary history mentions the same book.&lt;ref&gt;https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/AEG8734.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext&lt;/ref&gt; Among his other lost works, one should consider plays and short poems written by Balagtas in his lifetime for fiestas and celebrations as well as to earn his living. Eufronio Alip, in his 1930 historical study on Tagalog literature, also provides an additional two (2) titles of plays by Balagtas.&lt;ref&gt;https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/AEG8734.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Don Nuño at Selinda o la desgracia del amor en la inocencia'' – a ''komedya'' in three parts
*''Auredato at Astrome'' – a ''komedya'' in three parts
*''Clara Belmore'' – a ''komedya'' in three parts
*''Alamansor at Rosalinda'' – a komedya staged at Udyong during the town's feast

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">'''Free play''' ({{lang-fr|jeu libre}}) is a literary concept from [[Jacques Derrida]]'s 1966 essay, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences." In his essay, Derrida speaks of a philosophical "[[Event (philosophy)|event]]" that has occurred to the historic foundation of structure. Before the “event,” man was the center of all things. After the “event,” however, man could no longer be judged the center of the universe. Without this centralized reference, all that is left is “free play.”

&lt;blockquote&gt;[U]p until the event which I wish to mark out and define, structure—or rather the structurality of structure—although it has always been involved, has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The function of this center was not only to orient, balance, and organize the structure—one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structure—but above all to make sure that the organizing principle of the structure would limit what we might call the freeplay of the structure. No doubt that by orienting and organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits the freeplay of its elements inside the total form. And even today the notion of a structure lacking any center represents the unthinkable itself.&lt;br&gt;— "Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 278&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Besides the tension of freeplay with history, there is also the tension of freeplay with presence. Freeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically conceived, freeplay must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence; being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not the other way around.&lt;br&gt;—"Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 294&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Gumuz''' (also spelled '''Gumaz''') is a [[dialect cluster]] spoken along the border of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Sudan]]. It has been tentatively classified within the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family. Most Ethiopian speakers live in Kamashi Zone and [[Metekel Zone]] of the [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region]], although a group of 1,000 reportedly live outside the town of [[Welkite]] (Unseth 1989). The Sudanese speakers live in the area east of [[Er Roseires]], around [[Famaka]] and [[Fazoglo]] on the [[Blue Nile]], extending north along the border.&lt;ref name=e16/&gt;

An early record of this language is a wordlist from the [[Mount Guba]] area compiled in February 1883 by [[Juan Maria Schuver]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendy James, ''et al.'', ''Juan Maria Schuver's Travels in North East Africa, 1880-1883'' (London: Hakluyt Society, 1996), pp. 340-43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
Varieties are not all [[mutually intelligible]]. By that standard, there are two or three Gumuz languages. Grammatical forms are distinct between northern and southern Gumuz.&lt;ref&gt;Ahland, Colleen Anne. 2004. "Linguistic variation within Gumuz: a study of the relationship between historical change and intelligibility."  M.A. thesis. University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daats'iin language|Daats'iin]], discovered in 2013, is clearly a distinct language, though closest to southern Gumuz.

''Ethnologue'' lists  Guba, Wenbera, Sirba, Agalo, Yaso, Mandura, Dibate, and Metemma as Gumuz dialects, with Mandura, Dibate, and Metemma forming a dialect cluster.

==Phonology==
Gumuz has both [[ejective consonants]] and [[implosives]]. The implosive quality is being lost at the velar point of articulation in some dialects (Unseth 1989).  There is a series of palatal consonants, including both ejective and implosive.  In some dialects, e.g. Sirba, there is a labialized palatalized bilabial stop, as in the word for 'rat' {{IPA|[bʲʷa]}} (Unseth 1989).

Tones are high and low, with [[downstep]].&lt;ref name="Colleen Ahland 2012"&gt;Colleen Ahland, 2012. "A Grammar of Northern and Southern Gumuz", Doctoral Dissertation, University of Oregon.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Word order is [[Agent–verb–object|AVO]], with [[marked nominative]] case, though there is AOV order in the north, probably from Amharic influence .

In intransitive clauses, subjects in S–V order are unmarked, whereas those in V–S order are marked for nominative case.&lt;ref name="Colleen Ahland 2012"/&gt;

'''Iyo'wujwa Chorote''' is a [[Matacoan language]] spoken by about 2,000 people, mostly in Argentina where it is spoken by about 1,500 people; 50% of whom are monolingual.

Alternate names include: Choroti, Manjuy, and Manjui.

There are about 650 speakers in Paraguay and 8 in Bolivia.  Of the 650 in Paraguay, approximately 480 are considered monolingual. These speakers in Paraguay only refer to themselves as Manjui or Inkijwas.  They refer to the ones residing in Argentina as the Iyo'wujwas, though some who reside with these people in Argentina have migrated from Paraguay.  Most of the Manjui under 40 years old can read and write in their own language and were taught in their own schools.  The principal location of these people is a settlement called Santa Rosa, in the province of Boquerón.  Other locations include Mcal. Estigarribia, Pedro P. Peña, and Yakaquash.

'''Jacques Bouveresse''' ({{IPA-fr|buvʁɛs|lang}}; born 20 August 1940) is a philosopher who has written on subjects including [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Robert Musil]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[philosophy of science]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[analytical philosophy]]. Bouveresse has been called "an ''avis rara'' among the better known French philosophers in his championing of critical standards of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Merquior, JG |title=Foucault |publisher=FontanaPress |location=London |year=1991 |page=154 |isbn=0-00-686226-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is now Professor Emeritus at the [[Collège de France]] where until 2010 he held the chair of [[philosophy of language]] and epistemology. His disciple [[Claudine Tiercelin]] was appointed to a chair of metaphysics and philosophy of knowledge upon his retirement.

==Education and career==
Born on 20 August 1940 in [[Épenoy]] in the [[Doubs]] département of France into a farming family, Jacques Bouveresse completed his secondary education at the seminary of [[Besançon]]. He spent two years of preparation for the baccalauréat in philosophy and [[scholastic theology]] at [[Faverney]] in [[Haute-Saône]]. He followed his preparatory literary classes at the [[Lycée Lakanal]] in [[Sceaux (Hauts-de-Seine)|Sceaux]], and in 1961 entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris.

He presented his doctoral thesis in philosophy on [[Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], entitled "Le mythe de l'intériorité. Expérience, signification et langage privé chez Wittgenstein" .

Beginning with his earliest works, he has consistently constructed his own philosophical and intellectual path, without following the normal routes and modes of academia. In 1976, Wittgenstein was practically unknown in France, as were Musil and the logic and analytical philosophy which he had begun to study in the 1960s. These two last domains notably propelled him towards the lectures of [[Jules Vuillemin]] and [[Gilles Gaston Granger]], who at the time were practically alone in occupying themselves with these problems, and with whom he has maintained a lasting friendship.
 
Academic career : 
* 1966–1969 : Assistant to the Section de Philosophie of the [[University of Paris]] (teaching logic)
* 1969–1971 : Maître-Assistant to the UER de Philosophie of the [[Université Paris I]]
* 1971–1975 : Attached to the [[CNRS]]
* 1975–1979 : Maître de Conférences at the Université Paris I
* 1979–1983 : Professor at the [[University of Geneva]]
* 1983–1995 : Professor at the [[University of Paris]]
* From 1995 : Professor at the [[Collège de France]] in the chair of ''philosophie du langage et de la connaissance''.

==Works==
Bouveresse's philosophy is a continuation of the intellectual and philosophical tradition of central Europe ([[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], [[Boltzmann]], [[Helmholtz]], [[Frege]], the [[Vienna Circle]], [[Kurt Gödel]]). His philosophical programme is in nearly all respects similar to the one conducted by many present day [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic philosophers]].&lt;ref name=Schrift/&gt;

===The thought of Robert Musil===
Jacques Bouveresse is interested in the thought of the early 20th-century Austrian novelist [[Robert Musil]] (who wrote a thesis on philosophy), famous for his novel ''[[The Man Without Qualities]]'', as well as the aversion/fascination with which [[Paul Valéry]] regarded philosophy.

===Incompleteness and philosophy===
Apart from his work on Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jacques Bouveresse is interested in the [[incompleteness theorems]] of [[Kurt Gödel]] and their philosophical consequences. It is on this account that he has attacked, in a popular work ''Prodiges et vertiges de l'analogie'', the use made of these theorems by [[Régis Debray]]. Bouveresse denounces the literary distortion of a scientific concept for the purpose of a thesis. This distortion, according to him, has no other purpose than to overwhelm a readership which lacks the training necessary to comprehend such complex theorems. Bouveresse's reproach to Debray is not that he uses a scientific concept for the purpose of an analogy, but that he uses such a difficult to understand theorem in the attempt to provide an absolute justification in the form of the classic sophism of the argument from authority.

According to Bouveresse, the incompleteness of a [[formal system]] which applies to ''certain'' mathematical systems in no way implies the incompleteness of [[sociology]], which is not a formal system.

[[File:Jim Carroll, Author.jpg|thumb|Jim Carroll in New York City (2005)]]
'''James Dennis Carroll''' (August 1, 1949&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; – September 11, 2009) was an American author, poet, autobiographer, and [[punk rock|punk]] musician. Carroll was best known for his 1978 autobiographical work ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]''; the book inspired a 1995 [[The Basketball Diaries (film)|film of the same title]] that starred [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Carroll.

==Biography==
[https://transgressivefiction.info/jim-carroll/ Carroll] was born to a working-class family of Irish descent, and grew up in New York City's [[Lower East Side]]. When he was about 11 (in the sixth grade) his family moved north to [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] in Upper Manhattan. He was taught by the LaSalle Christian Brothers, and his brother in the sixth grade noted that he could write and encouraged him to do so. In fall 1963, he entered public school, but was soon awarded a scholarship to the elite [[Trinity School (New York City)|Trinity School]].&lt;ref name=NYer2010/&gt; He attended Trinity from 1964 to 1968. Carroll was a basketball star in high school, but also developed an addiction to heroin.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Alex |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/fashion/27Cover.html |title=The Last Days of Jim Carroll |work= The New York Times |date=September 25, 2009 |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll became sober in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

He briefly attended [[Wagner College]] and [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="londontimes"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6834246.ece |periodical=[[The Times]] |title=Jim Carroll: author of The Basketball Diaries |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll identified [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[John Ashbery]], [[James Schuyler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hehir |first=Andrew |url=http://www.catholicboy.com/ohehir.php |title=A Poet Half-Devoured – Jim Carroll Feature Articles |publisher=CatholicBoy.com |date=April 12, 1995 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allen Ginsberg]], and [[William S. Burroughs]] as influences on his artistic career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldman |first=Marlene |url=http://www.catholicboy.com/rsinterview.php |title=Mercury Rising (1999) – Jim Carroll Interviews |publisher=CatholicBoy.com |date=January 8, 1999 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll's marriage to Rosemary Carroll ended in divorce, but the two remained friends. He also dated [[Patti Smith]].&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

===Literary career===
While still in high school, Carroll published his first collection of poems, ''Organic Trains.'' Already attracting the attention of the local literati, his work began appearing in the Poetry Project's magazine ''The World'' in 1967. Soon his work was being published in elite literary magazines like ''[[Paris Review]]'' in 1968,&lt;ref name=NYer2010&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mallon |first1=Thomas |title=Off the Rim: Jim Carroll's "The Petting Zoo" |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=Condé Nast |date= December 6, 2010 |issue= |pages=90–93 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/12/06/101206crbo_books_mallon |accessdate=2010-12-27 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' the following year. In 1970, his second collection of poems, ''4 Ups and 1 Down'' was published, and he started working for [[Andy Warhol]]. At first, he was writing film dialogue and inventing character names; later on, Carroll worked as the co-manager of Warhol's Theater. Carroll's first publication by a mainstream publisher (Grossman Publishers), the poetry collection ''Living at the Movies'', was published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Carroll published ''The Basketball Diaries,'' an autobiographical book concerning his life as a teenager in New York City's [[hard drugs|hard drug]] [[drug subculture|culture]]. ''Diaries'' is an edited collection of the diaries he kept between the ages of 12 and 16, detailing his sexual experiences, high school basketball career, and his addiction to heroin, which began when he was 13.

In 1987, Carroll wrote a second memoir, ''Forced Entries: The Downtown Diaries 1971–1973,'' continuing his autobiography into his early adulthood in the New York City music and art scene as well as his struggle to kick his drug habit.

After working as a musician, Carroll returned to writing full-time in the mid-1980s and began to appear regularly on the spoken-word circuit.  Starting in 1991, Carroll performed readings from his then-in-progress first novel, ''The Petting Zoo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woo |first=Elaine |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-jim-carroll15-2009sep15,0,7425211.story |title=Jim Carroll dies at 60; poet and punk rocker wrote about travails in 'The Basketball Diaries' |publisher=latimes.com |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Canadian filmmaker [[John L'Ecuyer]] adapted "Curtis's Charm", a short story from Carroll's 1993 book ''Fear of Dreaming'', into the film ''[[Curtis's Charm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The romance of junkie paranoia". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', September 14, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music career===
In 1978, after he moved to California to get a fresh start since overcoming his heroin addiction, Carroll formed The Jim Carroll Band, a [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[punk rock]] group, with encouragement from [[Patti Smith]], with whom he once shared an apartment in New York City, along with [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Just Kids]] |last= Smith |first= Patti |year= 2010 |publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-06-093622-8 |pages= 162–164, 166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed a spoken word piece with the Patti Smith Group in [[San Diego]] when the support band dropped out at the last moment. The band was originally called Amsterdam, where they originally formed and were based in [[Bolinas, California]]. The musicians were Steve Linsley (bass), Wayne Woods (drums), Brian Linsley and Terrell Winn (guitars). They released a single "People Who Died", from their 1980 debut album, ''[[Catholic Boy]]''. The album featured contributions from [[Allen Lanier]] and [[Bobby Keys]].

The song also appeared in the 1985 [[Kim Richards]] vehicle ''[[Tuff Turf]]'' starring [[James Spader]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], which also featured a cameo appearance by the band, as well as 2004's ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', and in the 2015 ''[[Mr. Robot (TV series)|Mr. Robot]]'' S1 E10. It was featured in the 1995 film ''The Basketball Diaries'' (based on Jim Carroll's autobiography), and was covered by [[John Cale]] on his ''[[Antártida (album)|Antártida]]'' soundtrack. The song's title was based on a poem by [[Ted Berrigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Lewis MacAdams|MacAdams, Lewis]]|title=Remembering Jim Carroll|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 16, 2009|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-carroll16-2009sep16,0,1608675.story|accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later albums were ''Dry Dreams'' (1982) and ''I Write Your Name'' (1983), both with contributions from [[Lenny Kaye]] and Paul Sanchez (guitar). Carroll also collaborated with musicians [[Lou Reed]], [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Boz Scaggs]], [[Ray Manzarek]] of [[The Doors]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]].

===Death===
Carroll, 60, died of a heart attack at his Manhattan home on September 11, 2009. At the time of his death, he was in ill health due to pneumonia and hepatitis C.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|author=Grimes, William|title=Jim Carroll, Poet and Punk Rocker, Is Dead at 60|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 13, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/books/14carroll.html|accessdate=2012-12-18}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly working at his desk when he died.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Justus Hiddes Halbertsma''', [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] form: '''Joast Hiddes Halbertsma''', pron.

[joːst ˈhɪdəs ˈhalbǝrtsma] (October 23, 1789 in [[Grou]] – February 27, 1869 in [[Deventer]]),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Dutch [[West Frisians|Frisian]] writer, poet, [[Minister (religion)|minister]], [[lexicographer]] and [[linguist]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 587–591.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, he is primarily known for the [[poetry collection|poetry]] and [[short story collection]] ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'', which he wrote with his brother [[Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma|Eeltsje]], publishing the first edition in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, this work was continually expanded, and also came to include contributions by a third brother, [[Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma|Tsjalling]], until all the [[Halbertsma Brothers]]' [[prose]] and poetry was posthumously collected in 1871 to become the famous work ''[[Rimen en Teltsjes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 603–606.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[literature|literary]] value of this collection was later disputed by some [[literary critic|critcs]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 594–596.&lt;/ref&gt; it is undeniable that ''Rimen en Teltsjes'' played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a [[spoken language]] for three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Youth and background===
Justus Hiddes Halbertsma was born on October 23, 1789, in the village of [[Grou]], in the central part of the Dutch province of [[Friesland]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; in the house of his parents on Kowemerk ("Cow Market") street.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son of the baker and small-time [[merchant]]&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, s. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756–1809)&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk)&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsjallings Binnerts (1767–1809).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He had three younger brothers: [[Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma|Tsjalling]] (1792–1852),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Binnert (1795–1847),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma|Eeltsje]] (1797–1858).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Two children who were born later died in early childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; the little boy in 1803,&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the little girl in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The four brothers were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Justus was just twenty years of age and the others were even younger.&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje, who, as authors, became known as the [[Brothers Halbertsma]] later in life,&lt;ref&gt;Hemminga, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruerdtsje Binnerts was a scion of a prominent family in Grou.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Her people were [[Mennonites]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and although her husband had been raised a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], he converted after marrying her.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; From Justus' letters Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; a loving mother, and a deeply religious person.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a [[mariner]] before his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784, he published a long [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] poem under the title ''Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland'' ("Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in [[Gelderland]]").&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, Justus Halbertsma explained the difference between his parents' families when he wrote: "One cannot deny the Halbertsmas a greater skillfulness, speed of thought, a greater adroitness, quickness, and talent than the family of Ruerdtsje Tsjallings; but wat help was that to them against the poverty which overcame most of them, while Ruerdtsje Tsjallings' family for the most part maintain prosperity to this day as part of the dignified middle class?"&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; Against the superior power of those who calmly and calculatedly grew rich, he wrote somewhere else, the Halbertsmas could only "avenge themselves through satire."&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education, clerical career, and family===
Halbertsma's mother Ruerdtsje was the main force behind the thorough education her sons received.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Justus she sent to the French school in the provincial capital of [[Leeuwarden]] for a year, and after that, she enrolled him in the [[Latin school]] in Leeuwarden from 1801 to 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; At the advice of his mother and the Mennonite minister Jan Brouwer, from Leeuwarden, Justus Halbertsma chose a [[clergy|clerical]] career,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he studied theology at the Mennonite Seminary in [[Amsterdam]] from 1807 to 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In that period he also immersed himself in the study of the [[North Germanic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, Halbertsma became minister in [[Bolsward]], where he remained until 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he served the Mennonite congregation in the city of [[Deventer]], in the province of [[Overijssel]], from 1822 to his retirement in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Portret van Joost Hiddes Halbertsma.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Justus Hiddes Halbertsma, drawn by an unknown artist, around 1835.]]

Halbertsma married Johanna Iskjen Hoekema (1794–1847), a Mennonite minister's daughter from [[Workum]], who came from a well-to-do middle-class family,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; on May 10, 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his wife Halbertsma attained possession of the [[farmstead]] Westerein, near Workum, where he and his family often spent a couple of weeks in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from those holidays, he lived out his entire life in Deventer.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; Halbertsma and his wife had five sons from a good marriage, which was however not without its share of problems.&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these sons Petrus, Hidde, and Tsjalling studied [[linguistics]] or medicine, while Watse en Binnert became [[mariner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; As a father, Halbertsma experienced a large amount of grief, as his son Petrus died in 1851 in a [[psychiatric hospital]], while Binnert passed away in 1861, and Hidde [[suicide|took his own life]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a literary figure===
Halbertsma had been greatly influenced in his student years by his acquaintance with the well-to-do and influential Amsterdam merchant Jeronimo de Vries, who championed a national art, inspired by the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. These ideas flew in the face of more modern notions advocated by writers such as [[Hiëronymus van Alphen]] and Johannes Klinker.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; For Halbertsma, who was first and foremost a [[Frisians|Frisian]], and only secondly a [[Dutch people|Dutchman]], this meant an orientation towards national Frisian ideals,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 588–589.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt; from which emanated two goals he set himself in life.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, he wanted to preserve the Western Frisian language by using it for writing again after it had been used almost exclusively as a [[spoken language]] for three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Boelens et al., p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; From that it followed that he had to get the Frisians to read in their own language (otherwise, writing it would not be of much use), and that he should record the Frisian [[vocabulary]] in a [[dictionary]], which would be the first dictionary ever of the Frisian language.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; And secondly, Halbertsma wanted to put renowned Frisian people from the past in the spotlight, to serve as an example for his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;

To attain his first goal, Halbertsma had to use his writings to penetrate the daily life of the Frisian people.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; This he achieved by authoring [[folk literature]] with his brother [[Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma|Eeltsje]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The state and social status of the Western Frisian language at that time becomes clear if one observes the fact that Halbertsma and his brothers, though they laboured tirelessly for the use of Frisian as a written language for poetry and [[prose]], lapsed into Dutch for their correspondence with each other, and apparently did not feel that was in any way strange.&lt;ref&gt;Boelens et al., s. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; As Halbertsma remained the editor of Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and [[short fiction]] were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason the linguist Foeke Buitenrust Hettema would describe Halbertsma later as the '[[literary agent]]' of his brothers Eeltsje and Tsjalling.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, their early works were collected under the title ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'' ("Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket"; original, archaic [[spelling]]: ''De Lape Koer fen Gabe Skroor''), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt; Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'', published in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, pp. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, s. 5, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Those were not sold, however, but at the expense of Halbertsma presented to acquaintances of his all over Friesland.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In that way he awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hemminga, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; These stories and poems were in fact something entirely different from what the readers were used to, not only as to what language they were witten in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. The copies of the booklet often were shared around through entire networks of family and friends, and not seldom the stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on.&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second, expanded edition of ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'', consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 5, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (''De Noarger Rún oan Gabe Skroar''), 1840 (''Twigen út in Alde Stamme''), 1854 (''Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen''), and 1858 (''De Jonkerboer'' and ''Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonstêd'').&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 589–594.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his life, Halbertsma assisted in the editing of a portion of ''[[Rimen en Teltsjes]]'' (''Rhymes and Tales''), the comprehensive publication in which all the Halbertsma Brothers' literary works were collected. He even wrote some new pieces for it, such as the short story ''It Grouwe Pak'' ("The Thick Suit").&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a writer, Halbertsma strongly sensed what the public needed, but at the same time he was a somewhat distant and cerebral author, which tended to have an averse effect on his poetry, especially compared to the poems of his brother Eeltsje, who was a much more emotional writer.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, at least some of Halbertsma's poems, for instance ''Sibbel fan De Ryp'' ("Sibbel from [[Dronrijp|De Ryp]]") and ''Nacht'' ("Night") have made a lasting impression.&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; That said, Halbertsma's short stories were much more acute thanks to his limber use of language, his lively style of writing, and the fact that he refused to mince his words, leading to a rough, scoffing, and sometimes darkly grim atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt; His subject-matter Halbertsma collected from various sources, including German and French [[oral literature]], which he matchlessly revised and placed in Friesland.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[non-conformism|non-conformist]], whose sharp judgments of the works of others made him far from universally loved.&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Before everything else, Halbertsma as a writer was an essayist and a [[satire|satirist]], who liked to include [[topical]] political and social questions in his literary works.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[anecdote]]s of people who knew or met him, he emerges as a sharp-witted and extremely diligent man of capacious [[erudition]] who was a droll story-teller.&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Joost Hiddes Halbertsma.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Justus Hiddes Halbertsma in a photograph dated August 3, 1861.]]

''It Boalserter Nut'' ("The [[Bolsward]] Utility" – the name of a gentlemen's club), which was published in ''De Lapekoer'', was Halbertsma's first short story of a more extended length. As is often the case with Halbertsma's stories, it consists of a [[frame-story]] in which several other more or less stand-alone components are absorbed, such as the essay ''It Jild'' ("The Money").&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Miswier'' ("Continuously Bad Weather") and ''De Twadde Jûn'' ("The Second Evening") are also extensive frame-stories, and ''De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas'' ("Boss Joute's Barbershop") is a [[dialogue]], which includes the intriguing and completely stand-alone story ''Heksershol'' ("Hole of Witchcraft"&amp;nbsp;– an old nickname for the village of [[Molkwerum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The only time Halbertsma wrote a literary work entirely without the participation of Eeltsje, was in 1837, when he published ''Oan Eölus'' ("To [[Aeolus]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, s. 591.&lt;/ref&gt; a story inspired by a great storm in 1830, in which a [[tornado]] has blown thoughts and [[motif (narrative)|motifs]] together like whirling leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra en Oldenhof, s. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oan Eölus'' could perhaps be seen as a clue that Halbertsma harboured greater literary aspirations than would fit in the ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar''.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, s. 591.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a man of science===
And yet, for all that, Halbertsma's literary works did not take centerstage in his life: that place was reserved for his scientific non-fiction books.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; More than fifty years he laboured to complete his dictionary of Western Frisian titled ''Lexicon Frisicum'', for which he chose [[Latin language|Latin]] as the descriptive language, but it remained unfinished. He organised it along the lines of the German dictionary by the [[Brothers Grimm]], but became enmeshed in the addition of insertions and in reworkings, and in writing long [[semantics|semantic]] [[etymology|etymologies]], a part of the work for which he especially had a predilection.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, he never got past the letter F, and the dictionary remained a [[manuscript]], which was published in its unfinished form after Halbertsma's death, in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the material Halbertsma gathered for his ''Lexicon Frisicum'' was used by de [[Fryske Akademy|Frisian Academy]] to develop several Western Frisian dictionaries, notably the 25 part ''Wurdboek fan de Fryske Taal'' ("Dictionary of the Western Frisian Language"; published 1984–2011).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fryske-akademy.nl/nl/kennis-en-samenleving/friese-spelling-en-taalhulp/ Fryske Akademy, ''Andere Taaldiensten en Links'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Halbertsma was the driving force behind the commemoration of the life of the famous 17th century Frisian poet [[Gysbert Japiks]] in 1823,&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; which is seen by some as the starting point of the Frisian Movement. Afterwards he published an extensive literary history work under the title ''Hulde aan Gysbert Japiks'' ("Hail to Gysbert Japiks") in two parts in 1824 and 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829 Halbertsma wrote ''Het Geslacht der Van Harens'' ("The Lineage of the Van Harens"), in which he primarily described the lives and literary works of the brothers and 18th century Dutch-language writers from Friesland Onno Zwier van Haren and [[Willem van Haren]], whose work he admired greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halbertsma was also the author of an 1836 biography of the Frisian poet Jan Cornelis Pieters Salverda (1783–1836), which almost has a [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] feel to it.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 he published a historical work about the [[Mennonites]], called ''De Doopsgezinden en Hunne Herkomst'' ("The Mennonites and Their Origins"),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1851 he followed this up with ''Aanteekeningen op het Vierde Deel van den Spiegel Historiael van Jacob van Maerlant'' ("Notes on Part Four of the [[Spiegel Historiael]] by [[Jacob van Maerlant]]).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1858, at the request of Prince [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]], whom he had met in London,&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; Halbertsma published ''It Ewangeelje fen Matthewes'', which was the first Frisian translation of the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Gospel of Matthew]] (or of any [[gospel]] for that matter).&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; This translation evoked a great deal of criticism from Halbertsma's contemporaries, who thought it was much too [[realism (arts)|realistic]]; today, it still has an almost modern feel to it, showing that Halbertsma was far ahead of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halbertsma had a reputation of being an erudite man, which he won at a young age. He was especially known as a scholar of the [[Germanic languages]], and to the present day he is widely acknowledged to have been a larger-than-life figure in the field of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 589–590.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after returning to Friesland from his study in [[Amsterdam]], friends from his student years who by then were occupying important posts within the civil service, introduced him to the social circles around the Frisian-minded provincial governor [[jonkheer|jonker]] Idsert Aebinga van Humalda.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life Halbertsma was acquainted with prominent Dutch literary figures, such as [[Willem Bilderdijk]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; and what's more, he maintained a lively correspondence with European greats, like the Danish linguist [[Rasmus Rask]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; the English poet [[Robert Southey]],&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; and the German linguist and fairytale-collector [[Jacob Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he was invited to join learned historical and linguistic societies in [[Leiden]],&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Copenhagen]], Berlin, [[Athens]] en [[Halle (Saale)|Halle-Wittenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence Halbertsma expected to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; His sharp pen probably played a role in this,&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; but there were other reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of [[Belgium]], which at that time had just [[Belgian Revolution|seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the [[University of Leiden]], was scant consolation to him.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced on the edge of a [[occupational burnout|burn-out]] for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, that he seems to have achieved a state of mental composure.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part because of his linguistic erudition, Halbertsma has been named as the author of the infamous ''[[Oera Linda Book]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; a falsified work which emerged in 1867 and was written in imitated [[Old Frisian]]. It pretended to be an early history of Friesland and the [[Frisian people]], and for a while it was considered authentic, until it was exposed as a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroor, p. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is considered much more likely that the true author of the ''Oera Linda Book'' was the librarian Eelco Verwijs, who lead the Provincial Library of Friesland and who had befriended Halbertsma,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, s. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, s. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly the writer [[François Haverschmidt]] or the ship carpenter and self-taught freethinker Cornelis over de Linden.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, s. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; If Verwijs was the culprit, it is not thought to be impossible that Halbertsma tacitly or even openly provided him with advice.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, s. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
After his retirement, on October 26, 1856,&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; which Halbertsma applied for himself because his heart was not in his duties as a minister anymore,&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; he withdrew into his upstairs apartment, where from that point on he became increasingly more lonely as his family members and friends died away, although his foreign contacts through correspondence remained intact.&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; Justus Hiddes Halbertsma died in Deventer on February 27, 1869, when he was 79 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; By that time he had been a [[widower]] for 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his sons Watse and Tsjalling.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, the Dr. Joast Halbertsma Award, the highest provincial [[award|decoration]] in the field of historical (and later more general scientific) research concerning the province of [[Friesland]] was named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After the death of all three [[Brothers Halbertsma]], their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of ''[[Rimen en Teltsjes]]'' ("Rhymes and Tales").&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 603–606.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature,&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and although the [[literature|literary]] value of this collection was later disputed by some [[literary critic|critcs]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 594–596.&lt;/ref&gt; it is undeniable that ''Rimen en Teltsjes'' and its predecessor ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'' played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Justus Hiddes Halbertsma's influence on subsequent Western Frisian literature was enormous and of incalculable value.&lt;ref&gt;Boelens et al., p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave "the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected."&lt;ref&gt;Wadman, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; As of today ''Rimen en Teltsjes'' still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his travels to England, [[Scotland]], and Ireland, in 1852 and 1853, Halbertsma was impressed by the number of museums and [[cabinet (room)|cabinets]] of [[antiquities]] there were.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; This provided him with the idea to transfer his own collection of antiquities (originating for a major part in [[Hindeloopen]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt; while the remainder came mostly from excavations of Frisian ''[[terp]]s'')&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; to the Province of Friesland. In 1853, the Cabinet of Antiquities of Friesland was formed out of his collection, which in 1881 became the [[Fries Museum|Frisian Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rademaker-Helfferich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroor, p. 873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halbertsma also gave to the Province of Friesland, in part when he was still alive, his extensive library of scientific books, which was added to the Provincial Library of Friesland, en is to this day available for scientific research purposes at [[Tresoar]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt; A large collection of [[letter (message)|letters]] written by and to Halbertsma, including hundreds to his brothers Eeltsje en Tsjalling, long remained in the custody of the Halbertsma family, until they were given, in the course of the 20th century, on [[commodate|permanent loan]] to the Frisian Literary Museum and Documention Centre (FLMD), which became part of Tresoar in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kapóng''' is a [[Cariban language]] spoken mainly in [[Guyana]], most commonly in the region of the Upper [[Mazaruni River|Mazaruni]]. Though many speakers do not live in villages, there are a number of population centers, notably [[Kamarang]], Jawalla, Waramadong, and Kako. There are two dialects, '''Akawaio''' and '''Patamona'''.

Kapóng also goes by its Macushi name, ''Ingarikó''.

== History ==
The Carib tribes practice an indigenous system of beliefs, one that dates back to the 16th century. It was not until the 19th century that attempts were made to understand the beliefs and practices of this tribe. Much of the Kapóng language refers back to sun worship and sun spirits, which is reflective of the beliefs system of these Carib-speaking tribes. Literature has also found belief in a higher being in the sky among the Carib tribes in Guyana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Geographic Distribution==
The '''Kapóng''' language is found to be spoken in lowland tropical South America, particularly in the countries of Guyana, Brazil, and Venezuela. In Guyana, Kapóng is spoken in forests by the Mazaruni River Basin. Speakers in Brazil are found in the Roraima Indigenous Terra Raposa. The number of speakers in Brazil is about 10,000, and the transmission of language in Brazil is deemed to be of good standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Diversity Endangered|last=Brenzinger|first=Matthias|publisher=Walter de Gruyte|year=2015|isbn=978-3-11-090569-4|location=|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Venezuela, Kapóng is spoken in the states of Bolivar and Monagas.

==Vocabulary==
Much of the Kapóng language has emphasis on a higher spirit/god up in the sky, and this is reflected in the vocabulary in this language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title="THE BURNING FOUNTAIN WHENCE IT CAME": (A study of the system of beliefs of the Carib-speaking Akawaio of British Guiana.)|last=Butt|first=Audrey J.|publisher=Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies|year=1953|isbn=|location=University of the West Indies|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Kapóng'' = Sky People
* ''akwalo'' = the spirit
* ''akwa'' = God's place
* ''Waica'' = warrior
* ''Taemogoli'' = grandfather
* ''Kapo'' = in the sky
* ''Iopotari akuru'' = boss spirit

== Morphology ==
''yamok'' (aemvk) is an ending used to make words plural. (i.e.) Adding ''yamok'' to "Kapong" makes "Kapong" plural; ''Kapong yamok''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-''da''  is a marker used to mark possession. (i.e.) ''kaata'' = book;    ''da kaata'' = &lt;u&gt;my&lt;/u&gt; book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The word order of Kapóng is SOV ([[Subject–object–verb|subject-object-verb]]), however, it is not rigid. There are cases where the object precedes the subject in sentences. An example of this is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Walter F.|date=September 1979|title=A Comparison of Selected Linguistic Features in Some Cariban and Arawakan Languages in Guyana|jstor=30027731|journal=Trustees of Indiana University Anthropological Linguistics|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Walawok yamàk uya molok yachi"

boys         (plural)        fish      catch  = the boys catch fish

There are no gender distinctions found in Kap''ó''ng, as there are no differences in personal pronoun systems and affixes to indicate genders of nouns.

Similes are often used in writing, as many words in this language allow this to occur. Through the use of suffixes, many words can be converted into similes. Examples are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butt|first=Audrey J|date=1961|title=SYMBOLISM AND RITUAL AMONG THE AKAWAIO OF BRITISH GUIANA|url=|journal=Nieuwe West-Indische Gids / New West Indian Guide|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''-kasa'' = 'like'
* ''-walai'' = 'similar to'

'''Katawixi''' (Catawishi) is a [[Katukinan languages|Katukinian]] language formerly spoken in [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Brazil]].  It is nearly extinct among the known populations of Katawixi people, though an uncontacted group nearby may be Katawixi-speaking (Queixalós &amp; Anjos G.S. 2007:29, cited in Hammarström 2010:194).&lt;ref&gt;Harald Hammarström, 2010, 'The status of the least documented language families in the world'. In ''Language Documentation &amp; Conservation'', v 4, p 183 [http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4478/hammarstrom.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
Only a handful of isolated tribes still speak this language.

'''Kim Mun language''' (金门方言) is a [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien language]] spoken by 200,000 of the [[Yao people]] in the provinces of [[Guangxi]], [[Hunan]] and [[Hainan]], as well as 170,000 in some areas of northern Vietnam. (figures as per Ethnologue, 18th Edition)

[[Iu Mien]] and Kim Mun are very similar to each other, having a lexical similarity percentage of 78%.

==Distribution==
In China, Kim Mun is spoken in the following counties (Mao 2004:304-305).&lt;ref&gt;毛宗武, 李云兵 / Mao Zongwu, Li Yunbing. 1997. 巴哼语研究 / Baheng yu yan jiu (A Study of Baheng [Pa-Hng]). Shanghai: 上海远东出版社 / Shanghai yuan dong chu ban she.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethnologue lists several counties in Vietnam where Kim Mun is spoken. The Van Ban district of Lao Cai province is perhaps the primary area. In Vietnam, [[Dao people]] belonging to the Quần Trắng, Thanh Y, and Áo Dài subgroups speak Kim Mun.&lt;ref&gt;Phan Hữu Dật &amp; Hoàng Hoa Toàn. 1998.

'''''Langue nouvelle''''' (French for 'new language') is a grammatical sketch for a proposed artificial [[international auxiliary language]] presented in 1765 by [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]], a French economist, in the ninth volume of [[Encyclopédie|Diderot's encyclopedia]].  It is likely that it influenced [[Volapük]], [[Esperanto]], and other language projects of the 19th century.

==Linguistic properties==

===Phonology===
The phonology is undescribed, except that an "n" may be placed between vowels to avoid [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].  

The sound inventory can only be deduced from the examples given.  Vowels are ''a e i o ou u''; ''donu'' 'will give' and ''donou'' 'gift' attest to a distinction between ''ou'' {{IPAblink|u}} and ''u'' {{IPAblink|y}}.  The vowel of the past tense is sometimes written {{angbr|é}} and sometimes {{angbr|e}}, suggesting that the accent is merely a reminder that the letter is not silent, rather than marking a distinct vowel.  From ''sinta'' 'hundred', cognate with "cent", it would seem that there may be nasalized vowels, for the French letters {{angbr|in}} indicate a nasalized ''e''. That is, ''sinta'' is presumably to be pronounced {{IPA|[sẽta]}} or {{IPA|[senta]}}, not *{{IPA|[sinta]}}.

Attested consonants are:
:{|
|p||t||k
|-
|b||d||g
|-
|f||s||ch?
|-
|v||z||j
|-
|m||n||
|-
| ||l||r
|}

It is possible that ''k, q, c'' all represent {{IPA|[k]}}.  The only illustrative words are ''ki, qui'' 'who, which' and ''co'' 'three', which show that ''k'' and ''qu'' are equivalent before ''i''.  However, the lack of a numeral beginning with ''k'', to contrast with ''co'' 'three', suggests that ''k'' and ''c'' are also equivalent, and that ''co'' is to be pronounced {{IPA|[ko]}}.  The lack of ''ch'' {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, as well as the few other [[French phonology|consonants found in French]], may merely be an accidental omission due to the small sample of vocabulary.

===Verbs and pronouns===
Verbs inflect only for tense and aspect:  Indicative present in ''-a'', future ''-u'', past (''imparfait'') ''-e (-é),'' present perfect (''parfait'') ''-i,'' past perfect ''-o.''  The subjunctive is formed by adding ''-r'' to the indicative: ''-ar, -ur, -er, -ir, -or''; the infinitive by adding ''-s'': ''-as, -us, -es, -is, -os''.  The present participle is in ''-ont''. 

The present doubles as the imperative and, with the help of the verb ''sa'' 'to be', as the passive.  The present subjunctive ''-ar'' may be used for the imperative as well.  Questions are formed by inverting the pronoun and the verb, as in French. 

Person is indicated by pronouns: ''jo'' (I), ''to'' (you singular, thou), ''lo'' (he, she, it), ''no'' (we), ''vo'' (you plural), ''zo'' (they), and the reflexive ''so'' (oneself). Possessive forms are ''me, te, se, noti, voti, se''. Demonstratives, ''soli'' (this) and ''sola'' (that), take plural ''-s'' (these, those). Who, what, which is ''ki''.

{| class="toccolours"
|+ '''Some conjugations'''
|-
|
:''sas'' (to be), ''sis'' (to have been), ''sus'' (to be about to be)
:''sont'' (being)
:''jo sa'' (I am), ''to se'' (you were), ''lo si'' (s/he had been), ''no so'' (we had been), ''vo su'' (you all will be)
:''zo sar'' (that they be), ''jo ser'' (that I were), ''to sir'' (may you have been), ''lo sor'' (that s/he had been), ''no sar'' (let's be)

:''jo dona'' (I give), ''to done'' (you gave), ''lo doni'' (s/he has given), ''no dono'' (we had given), ''vo donu'' (you all will give)
:''zo donar'' (may they give), ''dona!'' (give!), ''done to?'' (did you give?)
:''jo sa dona'' (I am given), ''to se dona'' (you were given), ''lo su dona'' (s/he will be given)
:''sa zo dona?'' (are they given?) ''sont dona'' (being given)
:''donont'' (giving)
|}

''Sofras'' 'to treat oneself' is given as an example of a reflexive verb; it's not clear if the initial ''s'' is a reflexive prefix, as in French ''s'offrir'', or part of the root.  It is however invariable:  ''jo sofra'' (I treat myself), ''to sofra'' (you treat yourself), etc.

===Nouns, prepositions, and adjectives===
For nouns, there are no cases, genders, or articles.  The plural ends in ''-s,'' which unlike in French is pronounced.  [[Augmentative]]s take ''-le (-lé)'', [[diminutive]]s ''-li'':
:''manou'' a house, ''manoule (manoulé)'' a mansion, ''manouli'' a hut; 
:''filo'' a boy, ''filole, filoli''. 

Deverbals end in ''-ou'': 
:''donou'' a gift (''donas'' to give), ''vodou'' will (''vodas'' to want), ''servou'' service (''servas'' to serve)

Prepositions are used:
:''bi manou'' of the house, ''bu manou'' to the house, ''de manou'' from the house, ''po manou'' through the house

It would seem there is no distinction between adjective and adverb, and adjectives do not agree in number with the noun.

===Numerals and digits===
Each numeral starts with a different consonant, and are in alphabet order: 

:''ba'' one, ''co'' two, ''de'' three, ''ga'' four, ''ji'' five, ''lu'' six, ''ma'' seven, ''ni'' eight, ''pa'' nine, ''vu'' ten, ''sinta'' hundred, ''mila'' thousand, ''milo'' million
Ordinals add ''-mu'':  ''bamu'' first, ''comu'' second. 

Numbers are formed by juxtaposing numerals:  Twenty-five is ''covuji'' (two-ten-five). 

The consonants of the numerals one through nine are used as digits (in place of [[Arabic numerals]]), with o for zero, so "25" is written {{angbr|cj}} and "100" is written {{angbr|boo}}.

'''Maltese''' ({{lang-mt|Malti|links=no}}) is the [[national language]] of [[Malta]] and a co-official [[Languages of Malta|language of the country]] alongside [[English language|English]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Malta|url=http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8566&amp;l=1|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also serving as an [[Languages of the European Union|official language of the]] [[European Union]], the only [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] so distinguished. Maltese is descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]], the extinct [[Varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] that developed in [[Sicily]] and was later introduced to Malta, between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=So who are the ‘real’ Maltese|quote=The kind of Arabic used in the Maltese language is most likely derived from the language spoken by those that repopulated the island from Sicily in the early second millennium; it is known as Siculo-Arab. The Maltese are mostly descendants of these people.|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140914/local/So-who-are-the-real-Maltese-.535578|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312063245/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140914/local/So-who-are-the-real-Maltese-.535578|archivedate=2016-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maltese has evolved independently of [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and its varieties into a standardized language over the past 800 years in a gradual process of Latinisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Borg and Azzopardi-Alexander, 1997|title=Maltese|date=1997| publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-02243-6|page=xiii|quote=In fact, Maltese displays some areal traits typical of Maghrebine Arabic, although over the past 800 years of independent evolution it has drifted apart from Tunisian Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|author1=Brincat, 2005|title=Maltese - an unusual formula|quote=Originally Maltese was an Arabic dialect but it was immediately exposed to Latinisation because the Normans conquered the islands in 1090, while Christianisation, which was complete by 1250, cut off the dialect from contact with Classical Arabic. Consequently Maltese developed on its own, slowly but steadily absorbing new words from Sicilian and Italian according to the needs of the developing community.|url=http://macmillandictionaries.com/MED-Magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208063739/http://macmillandictionaries.com/MED-Magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maltese is therefore considered an exceptional descendant of Arabic that has no [[diglossia|diglossic]] relationship with [[Standard Arabic]] or [[Classical Arabic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert D Hoberman|title=Morphologies of Asia and Africa , Alan S.

The origins of the Maltese language are attributed to the arrival, early in the eleventh century, of settlers from neighbouring Sicily, where Siculo-Arabic was spoken, following the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]'s conquest of the island at the end of the ninth century.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/MED-magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509033627/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/MED-magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 May 2008|title=MED Magazine|date=9 May 2008|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has been corroborated by genetic studies, which show that contemporary [[Maltese people]] share common ancestry with Sicilians and Calabrians, with little genetic input from North Africa and the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20070805/opinion/genetic-origin-of-contemporary-maltese.9032 A.E.

The Norman conquest in 1090, followed by the expulsion of the Muslims (complete by 1249) permanently isolated the vernacular from its Arabic source, creating the conditions for its evolution into a distinct language.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; In contrast to Sicily (where Siculo-Arabic became extinct, replaced by [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]), the vernacular in Malta continued to develop alongside Italian, eventually replacing it as official language in 1934 (alongside English).&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

The first written reference to the Maltese language is in a will of 1436, where it is called ''lingua maltensi''. The oldest known document in Maltese is "[[Il Cantilena]]" (''Xidew il-Qada'') by [[Pietru Caxaro]]. It dates from the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Academy"/&gt;

The earliest known Maltese dictionary was a sixteenth-century manuscript entitled "Maltese-Italiano"; it was included in the ''Biblioteca Maltese'' of Mifsud in 1764, but is now lost.&lt;ref name=agius/&gt; A list of Maltese words was included in both the ''Thesaurus Polyglottus'' (1603) and ''Propugnaculum Europae'' (1606) of [[Hieronymus Megiser]], who had visited Malta in 1588–89; Domenico Magri gave the etymologies of some Maltese words in his ''Hierolexicon, sive sacrum dictionarium'' (1677).&lt;ref name="Academy"/&gt; An early manuscript dictionary, ''Dizionario Italiano e Maltese'', was discovered in the [[Biblioteca Vallicelliana]] in Rome in the 1980s, together with a grammar, the ''Regole per la Lingua Maltese'', attributed to a French Knight named Thezan.&lt;ref name=agius&gt;Dionisius A.

==Demographics==
''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' (2015) reports a total of 522,000 Maltese speakers, with 371,000 residing in Malta (close to 90% of Maltese population) according to the European Commission (2012).&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;  This implies a number of some 150,000 speakers in the  [[Maltese diaspora]]. 
Most speakers are bilingual, the majority of speakers (345,000) regularly use English, and a reported 66,800 regularly use French.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; 

The largest diaspora community of Maltese speakers is [[Maltese Australians|in Australia]], with 36,000 speakers reported in 2006 (down from 45,000 in 1996, and expected to decline furtner).&lt;ref&gt;"As at the 2006 Australian Census, the number of Australians speaking Maltese at home was 36,514, compared to 41,250 in 2001 and 45,243 in 1996. The 2006 figures represent a drop of 19.29% when compared with the 1996 figures. Given that many of those who speak Maltese at home are over the age of 60, the number of Maltese speakers will invariably go for a nosedive by 2016."

The Maltese linguistic community in [[Tunisia]] originates in the 18th century. Numbering at several thousand in the 19th century, it was reported at only 100 to 200 people as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Mifsud, [https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/maltas-ambassador-meets-maltese-who-have-lived-their-whole-life-in-tunisia/ Malta's Ambassador meets Maltese who have lived their whole life in Tunisia], TVM, 13 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic, a Semitic language within the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]],&lt;ref&gt;C.F. &amp; F.M. Voegelin. 1977. ''Classification and Index of the World's Languages''. Elsevier.&lt;br/&gt;Merritt Ruhlen. 1991. ''A Guide to the World's Languages, Volume 1: Classification.''

Robert Hetzron. [[Routledge]]. Pages 263–311.&lt;/ref&gt; that in the course of its [[History of Malta|history]] has been influenced by Sicilian and Italian, to a lesser extent [[French language|French]], and more recently English. Today, the core vocabulary (including both the most commonly used vocabulary and [[function word]]s) is Semitic, with large numbers of [[loanword]]s.{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}} Because of the Sicilian influence on Siculo-Arabic, Maltese has many language contact features and is most commonly described as a language with a large number of loanwords.{{sfnp|Borg|1997}}

The Maltese language has historically been classified in various ways, with some claiming that the ancient [[Punic language]] (another Semitic language) was its origin instead of Siculo-Arabic,&lt;ref name="Academy"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Maltese Language Academy |url=http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 |author=L-Akkademja tal-Malti |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923054701/http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Vella|2004|p=263}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/483501/Punic-language|title=Punic language|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|year=2013|accessdate=25 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615054045/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/483501/Punic-language|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believed the language to be one of the [[Berber languages]] (another family within Afroasiatic),&lt;ref name="Academy" /&gt; and under the Fascist [[Kingdom of Italy]], it was classified as [[regional Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRGrRy7S750C&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;ots=-c11unlD4X&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Malta|first=Sean|last=Sheehan|date=12 January 2017|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
{{main|Żejtun dialect|Qormi dialect|Maltralian}}
SIL reports six varieties, besides Standard Maltese:
Gozo, Port Maltese, Rural Central Maltese, Rural East Maltese, Rural West Maltese, and Zurrieq.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

Urban varieties of Maltese are closer to Standard Maltese than rural varieties,&lt;ref name="isser"&gt;Isserlin. Studies in Islamic History and Civilization. BRILL 1986, {{ISBN|965-264-014-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have some characteristics that distinguish them from Standard Maltese. 
They tend to show some archaic features&lt;ref name="isser" /&gt; such as the realization of '''kh''' and '''gh''' and the [[imāla]] of Arabic ā into ē (or ī especially in Gozo)-considered archaic because they are reminiscent of 15th century transcriptions of this sound.&lt;ref name="isser" /&gt; Another archaic feature is the realization of Standard Maltese ā as ō in rural dialects.&lt;ref name="isser" /&gt; 
There is also a tendency to diphthongize simple vowels, e.g., ū becomes eo or eu.&lt;ref name="isser" /&gt; 
Rural dialects also tend to employ more Semitic roots and broken plurals than Standard Maltese.&lt;ref name="isser" /&gt; In general, rural Maltese is less distant from its Siculo-Arabic ancestor than Standard Maltese.&lt;ref name="isser" /&gt;

Voiceless stops are only lightly aspirated and voiced stops are fully voiced. Voicing is carried over from the last segment in [[obstruent]] [[consonant cluster|clusters]]; thus, two- and three-obstruent clusters are either voiceless or voiced throughout, e.g. {{IPA|/niktbu/}} is realised {{IPA|[ˈniɡdbu]}} "we write". Maltese has [[final-obstruent devoicing]] of voiced obstruents and voiceless stops have [[no audible release]], making voiceless–voiced pairs phonetically indistinguishable.{{sfnp|Borg|1997|pp=249–250}}

[[Gemination]] is distinctive word-medially and word-finally in Maltese. The distinction is most rigid [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalically]] after a stressed vowel. Stressed, word-final [[Syllable#open syllable|closed syllables]] with short vowels end in a long consonant, and those with a long vowel in a single consonant; the only exception is where historic {{IPA|*ʕ}} and {{IPA|*ɣ}} meant the [[compensatory lengthening]] of the succeeding vowel. Some speakers have lost length distinction in clusters.{{sfnp|Borg|1997|pp=251–252}}

The two nasals {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} assimilate for [[place of articulation]] in clusters.{{sfnp|Borg|1997|p=255}} {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are usually [[dental stop|dental]], whereas {{IPA|/t͡s d͡z s z n r l/}} are all alveolar. {{IPA|/t͡s d͡z/}} are found mostly in words of Italian origin, retaining length (if not word-initial).{{sfnp|Borg|1997|p=254}} {{IPA|/d͡z/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} are only found in loanwords, e.g. {{IPA|/ɡad͡zd͡zɛtta/}} "newspaper" and {{IPA|/tɛlɛˈviʒin/}} "television".{{sfnp|Borg|1997|p=247}} The pharyngeal fricative {{IPA|/ħ/}} is velar ({{IPAblink|x}}) or glottal ({{IPAblink|h}}) for some speakers.{{sfnp|Borg|1997|p=260}}

===Vowels===
Maltese has five short vowels, {{IPA|/ɐ ɛ i ɔ ʊ/}}, written ''a e i o u''; six long vowels, {{IPA|/ɐː ɛː iː ɪː ɔː ʊː/}}, written ''a e ie i o u''; and seven [[diphthong]]s: {{IPA|/ɐɪ ɛɪ/}} both written ''għi'', {{IPA|/ɐʊ ɔʊ/}} both written ''għu'', and {{IPA|/ɛʊ ɪʊ ɔɪ/}} written ''ew iw oj''.{{sfnp|Borg|Azzopardi-Alexander|1997}}

===Stress===
Stress is generally on the penultimate syllable, unless some other syllable is heavy (has a long vowel or final consonant), or unless a stress-shifting suffix is added. (Suffixes marking gender, possession, and verbal plurals do not cause the stress to shift.)

When two syllables are equally heavy, the penultimate takes the stress, but otherwise the heavier syllable does, e.g. ''bajjad'' {{IPA|[ˈbɐj.jɐt]}} 'he painted' vs ''bajjad'' {{IPA|[bɐj.ˈjɐːt]}} 'a painter'.

Final vowels with grave accents (à, è, ì, ò, ù) are also found in some Maltese words of Italian origin, such as ''libertà'' ("freedom"), ''sigurtà'' (old Italian: ''sicurtà'', "security"), or ''soċjetà'' (Italian: ''società'', "society").

The official rules governing the structure of the Maltese language are found in the official guidebook issued by the ''Akkademja tal-Malti'', the Academy of the Maltese language, which is named ''Tagħrif fuq il-Kitba Maltija'', that is, ''Knowledge on Writing in Maltese''. The first edition of this book was printed in 1924 by the Maltese government's printing press. The rules were further expanded in the 1984 book, ''iż-Żieda mat-Tagħrif'', which focused mainly on the increasing influence of Romance and English words. In 1992 the Academy issued the ''Aġġornament tat-Tagħrif fuq il-Kitba Maltija'', which updated the previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Loan Verbs in Maltese: A Descriptive and Comparative Study |last= Mifsud |first= Manwel |authorlink= |year= 1995 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |location= |isbn= 90-04-10091-1 |pages= 31 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=fO5kE8BKf7cC }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these works were included in a revised and expanded guidebook published in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The [[National Council for the Maltese Language]] (KNM) is the main regulator of the Maltese language (see Maltese Language Act, below) and not the ''Akkademja tal-Malti''. However, these orthography rules are still valid and official.

===Written Maltese===
Since Maltese evolved after the [[Italo-Norman]]s ended the Arab rule of the islands, a written form of the language was not developed for a long time after the Arabs' expulsion in the middle of the thirteenth century. Under the rule of the [[Knights Hospitaller]], both French and Italian were used for official documents and correspondence. During the [[Crown Colony of Malta|British colonial period]], the use of English was encouraged through education, with Italian regarded as the next-most important language.

In 1934, Maltese was recognised as an official language. In the late eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth century, philologists and academics such as [[Mikiel Anton Vassalli]] made a concerted effort to standardize written Maltese. Many examples of written Maltese exist from before this period, always in the Latin alphabet, ''Il Cantilena'' being the earliest example of written Maltese.

==Vocabulary==
Although the original vocabulary of the language was [[Siculo-Arabic]], it has incorporated a large number of borrowings from [[Romance language|Romance]] sources of influence ([[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[French language|French]]), and more recently [[Germanic language|Germanic]] ones (from [[English language|English]]).{{sfnp|Friggieri|1994|p=59}}

The historical source of modern Maltese vocabulary is 52% Italian/Sicilian, 32% Siculo-Arabic, and 6% English, with some of the remainder being French.{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.translationsmalta.com/page.aspx?pid=22 About Malta]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; GTS; retrieved on 2008-02-24&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most [[function words]] are Semitic. In this way, it is similar to [[English language|English]], which is a [[Germanic language]] that had large influence from [[Norman French]]. As a result of this, Romance language-speakers may easily be able to comprehend more complex ideas expressed in Maltese, such as "Ġeografikament, l-Ewropa hi parti tas-superkontinent ta' l-Ewrasja" (''Geographically, Europe is part of the Supercontinent of Eurasia''), while not understanding a single word of a simple sentence such as "Ir-raġel qiegħed fid-dar" (''The man is in the house''), which would be easily understood by any Arabic speaker.

===Romance===
An analysis of the etymology of the 41,000 words in Aquilina's ''Maltese-English Dictionary'' shows that words of Romance origin make up 52% of the Maltese vocabulary,{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}} although other sources claim from as low as 40%,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/maltese.shtml|title=BBC - Languages|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913054653/http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/maltese.shtml|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to as high as 55%.&lt;ref&gt;http://google.com/search?q=cache:DMnjEhi4EicJ:www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/Englisches_Seminar/Lehrstuehle/LS_Kortmann/FoL/index_html/2008-03-17.8198766048+Maltese+55%25+Romance&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5&amp;client=safari{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vocabularies tend to deal with more complicated concepts. They are mostly derived from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and thus exhibit Sicilian phonetic characteristics, such as {{IPA|/u/}} in place of {{IPA|/o/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} in place of {{IPA|/e/}} (e.g. ''tiatru'' not ''teatro'' and ''fidi'' not ''fede''). Also, as with Old Sicilian, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (English 'sh') is written 'x' and this produces spellings such as: ''ambaxxata'' {{IPA|/ambaʃːaːta/}} ('embassy'), ''xena'' {{IPA|/ʃeːna/}} ('scene' cf. Italian ''ambasciata, scena'').

A tendency in modern Maltese is to adopt further influences from English and Italian.
Complex Latinate English words adopted into Maltese are often given Italianate or Sicilianate forms,{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}} even if the resulting words do not appear in either of those languages. For instance, the words "''evaluation''", "''industrial action''", and "''chemical armaments''" become "''evalwazzjoni''", "''azzjoni industrjali''", and "''armamenti kimiċi''" in Maltese, while the Italian terms are ''valutazione'', ''vertenza sindacale'', and ''armi chimiche'' respectively. English words of Germanic origin are generally preserved relatively unchanged.

===Siculo-Arabic===
Siculo-Arabic is the [[genetics (linguistics)|ancestor]] of the Maltese language,{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}} and supplies between 32%{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}} and 40%&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; of the language's vocabulary.

{{harvtxt|Żammit|2000}} found that 40% of a sample of 1,820 [[Classical Arabic|Quranic Arabic]] roots were found in Maltese, a lower percentage than found in [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]] (58%) and [[Lebanese Arabic]] (72%).{{sfnp|Żammit|2000|pp=241–245}} An analysis of the etymology of the 41,000 words in Aquilina's ''Maltese-English Dictionary'' shows that 32% of the Maltese vocabulary is of Arabic origin,{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}} although another source claims 40%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare with approx. 25–33% of Old English or Germanic words in Modern English.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, words expressing basic concepts and ideas, such as {{lang|mt|raġel}} (man), {{lang|mt|mara}} (woman), {{lang|mt|tifel}} (boy), {{lang|mt|dar}} (house), {{lang|mt|xemx}} (sun), {{lang|mt|sajf}} (summer), are of Arabic origin. Moreover, {{lang|fr|[[belles lettres]]}} in Maltese tend to aim mainly at diction belonging to this group.&lt;ref name="isser" /&gt;

The Maltese language has merged many of the original Arabic consonants, in particular the [[emphatic consonants]], with others that are common in European languages. Thus, original [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ð/}}, and {{IPA|/dˤ/}} all merged into Maltese {{IPA|/d/}}. The vowels, however, separated from the three in Arabic ({{IPA|/a i u/}}) to five, as is more typical of other European languages ({{IPA|/a ɛ i o u/}}). Some unstressed short vowels have been elided. The common Arabic greeting {{lang|ar-Latn|as salāmu 'alaykum}} is cognate with {{lang|mt|is-sliem għalikom}} in Maltese (lit. ''the peace for you'', peace be with you), as are similar greetings in other Semitic languages (e.g. {{lang|he-Latn|shalom ʿalekhem}} in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).

Since the attested vocabulary of Siculo-Arabic is limited, the following table compares cognates in Maltese and some other varieties of Arabic (all forms are written phonetically, as in the source):&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Kaye &amp; Judith Rosenhouse. 1997. "Arabic Dialects and Maltese", ''The Semitic Languages''. Routledge. Pp. 263–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===
It is estimated that English loanwords, which are becoming more commonplace, make up 20% of the Maltese vocabulary,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; although other sources claim amounts as low as 6%.{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}} This percentage discrepancy is due to the fact that a number of new English loanwords are sometimes not officially considered part of the Maltese vocabulary; hence, they are not included in certain dictionaries.{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}} Also, English loanwards of Latinate origin are very often Italianised, as discussed above. English loanwords are generally transliterated, although standard English pronunciation is virtually always retained. Below are a few examples:

| futbol

| baskitbol

| fridge
|-
|}
Note "fridge", which is a slang term derived from "refrigerator", a Latinate word which might be expected to be rendered as ''rifriġeratori'' (Italian uses a different word: ''frigorifero'').

==Grammar==
Maltese grammar is fundamentally derived from Siculo-Arabic, although [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[English language|English]] noun pluralization patterns are also used on borrowed words.

===Adjectives and adverbs===
[[Adjective]]s follow [[noun]]s. There are no separately formed native [[adverb]]s, and word order is fairly flexible. Both nouns and adjectives of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origin take the definite article (for example, ''It-tifel il-kbir'', lit. "The boy the elder"="The elder boy"). This rule does not apply to adjectives of Romance origin.

===Nouns===
Nouns are pluralized and also have a [[dual grammatical number|dual]] marker. Semitic plurals are complex; if they are regular, they are marked by ''-iet''/''-ijiet'', e.g., ''art'', ''artijiet'' "lands (territorial possessions or property)" (cf. Arabic ''-at'' and Hebrew ''-ot''/''-oth'') or ''-in'' (cf. Arabic ''-īn'' and Hebrew ''-im''). If irregular, they fall in the ''[[broken plural|pluralis fractus]]'' category, in which a word is pluralized by internal vowel changes: ''ktieb'', ''kotba'' " book", "books"; ''raġel'', ''irġiel'' "man", "men".

Words of Romance origin are usually pluralized in two manners: addition of ''-i'' or ''-jiet''. For example, ''lingwa'', ''lingwi'' "languages", from Sicilian ''lingua'', ''lingui''.

Words of English origin are pluralized by adding either an "-s" or "-jiet", for example, ''friġġ'', ''friġis'' from the word ''fridge''. Some words can be pluralized with either of the suffixes to denote the plural. A few words borrowed from English can amalgamate both suffixes, like ''brikksa'' from the English ''brick'', which can adopt either collective form ''brikks'' or the plural form ''brikksiet''.

===Article===
The [[proclitic]] ''il-'' is the [[definite article]], equivalent to "the" in English and "al-" in Arabic.

The Maltese article becomes ''l-'' before or after a vowel.
* ''l-omm'' (the mother)
* ''rajna l-Papa'' (we saw the Pope)
* ''il-missier'' (the father)

The Maltese article [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] to a following [[coronal consonant]] (called ''konsonanti xemxin'' "[[sun letter|sun consonants]]"), namely:
* Ċ ''iċ-ċikkulata'' (the chocolate)
* D ''id-dar'' (the house)
* N ''in-nar'' (the fire)
* R ''ir-razzett'' (the farm)
* S ''is-serrieq'' (the saw)
* T ''it-tifel'' (the boy)
* X ''ix-xemx'' (the sun)
* Ż ''iż-żarbun'' (the shoe)
* Z ''iz-zalzett'' (the sausage)

Maltese ''il-'' is coincidentally identical in pronunciation to the one of the [[Italian grammar#Articles|Italian masculine articles]], ''il,'' which is also ''l’'' before, but not after, a vowel. Consequently, many nouns borrowed from Standard Italian did not change their original article when used in Maltese. Romance vocabulary taken from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] did change where the Sicilian articles ''u'' and ''a'', before a consonant, are used.
In spite of its Romance appearance, ''il-'' is related to the Arabic article ''[[al-]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Verbs===
Verbs show a [[triliteral]] Semitic pattern, in which a verb is [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] with [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]], [[suffix]]es, and [[infix]]es (for example ''ktibna'', Arabic ''katabna'', Hebrew ''kathabhnu'' (Modern Hebrew: katavnu) "we wrote"). There are two [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: present and perfect. The Maltese verb system incorporates Romance verbs and adds Maltese suffixes and prefixes to them (for example, ''iddeċidejna'' "we decided" ← ''(i)ddeċieda'' "decide", a Romance verb + ''-ejna'', a Maltese first person plural perfect marker).

==Media==
{{Main article|Languages of Malta#Media|l1=Language in the Media in Malta}}
With Malta being a multilingual country, the usage of Maltese in the mass media is shared with other European languages, namely [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. The majority of television stations broadcast from Malta in English or Maltese, although broadcasts from [[Italy]] in Italian are also received on the islands. Similarly, there are more Maltese-language radio programs than English ones broadcast from Malta, but again, as with television, Italian broadcasts are also picked up. Maltese generally receives equal usage in newspaper periodicals to English.

By early 2000s, the use of the Maltese language on the Internet is uncommon, and the number of websites written in Maltese are few. In a survey of Maltese cultural websites conducted in 2004 on behalf of the Maltese Government, 12 of 13 were in English only, while the remaining one was multilingual but did not include Maltese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/minerva/html/dok/malta.doc|title=Country report for MINERVA Plus in 2005|work=Multilingual issues in Malta|accessdate=2008-02-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227064644/http://mek.oszk.hu/minerva/html/dok/malta.doc|archivedate=2008-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code-switching==
The Maltese population, being fluent in both Maltese and English, displays [[code-switching]] (referred to as [[Maltenglish]]) in certain localities and between certain social groups.{{sfnp|Brincat|2005}}

{{Infobox Korean name|hanja=柳美里|hangul=유미리|mr=Yu Mi-ri|rr=Yu Mi-ri|text=In [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: Yū Miri}}
'''Miri Yu''' (born June 22, 1968) is a [[Zainichi Korean]] [[playwright]], [[novelist]], and [[essayist]]. Yu writes in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], her native language, but is a citizen of [[South Korea]].

Yu was born in [[Yokohama]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan, to [[Koreans#Koreans in Japan|Korean]] parents. After dropping out of the ''Kanagawa Kyoritsu Gakuen'' high school, she joined the ''Tokyo Kid Brothers'' (東京キッドブラザース) theater troupe and worked as an actress and assistant director. In 1986, she formed a troupe called ''Seishun Gogetsutō'' (青春五月党), and the first of several plays written by her was published in 1991.&lt;ref name="nytimes_2002-04-06"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, Yu switched to writing prose. Her novels include ''Furu Hausu'' (フルハウス, "Full House", 1996), which won the Noma [[literary prize]] for best work by a new author; ''Kazoku Shinema'' (家族シネマ, "Family Cinema," 1997), which won the prestigious [[Akutagawa Prize]]; ''Gōrudo Rasshu'' (ゴールドラッシュ, "Gold Rush" 1998), which was translated into English as ''Gold Rush'' (2002); and ''Hachi-gatsu no Hate'' (8月の果て, "The End of August," 2004). She has published a dozen books of essays and memoirs, and she was an editor of and contributor to the literary quarterly "[[en-taxi]] ". Her best-selling memoir ''Inochi'' (命, "Life") was made into a movie, also titled ''[[Inochi]]''.&lt;ref name="nytimes_2002-04-06"/&gt;

Yu's first novel, a semiautobiographical work titled ''Ishi ni Oyogu Sakana'' (石に泳ぐ魚, "The Fish Swimming in the Stone") published in the September 1994 issue of the [[literary journal]] [[Shincho|Shinchō]], became the focus of a legal and ethical controversy. The model for one of the novel's main characters&amp;mdash;and the person referred to indirectly by the title&amp;mdash;objected to her depiction in the story. The publication of the novel in book form was blocked by court order, and some libraries restricted access to the magazine version. After a prolonged legal fight and widespread debate over the rights of authors, readers, and publishers versus individuals' rights to privacy, a revised version of the novel was published in 2002.&lt;ref name="nytimes_2002-04-06"/&gt;

Yu has experienced racist backlash to her work because of her ethnic background, with some events at bookstores being canceled due to bomb threats.&lt;ref name="nytimes_2002-04-06"/&gt;

After the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] Yu began to travel to the affected areas often, and from March 16, 2012, she hosted a weekly radio show called "Yu Miri no Futari to Hitori" (柳美里の二人と一人, "Yu Miri's Two People and One Person") on a temporary emergency broadcasting station called Minamisōma Hibari FM, based in [[Minamisōma]], [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]].&lt;ref name="asianews_70117"/&gt;

Since April 2015, Yu has lived in [[Minamisōma|Minamisōma, Fukushima]]. In 2018, she opened a bookstore called Full House and a theatre space called LaMaMa ODAKA at her home in Odaka District.&lt;ref name="asianews_70117"/&gt;

She has one son.

[[File:Mushroom management.png|thumb]]

'''Mushroom management'''{{course assignment | course = Education Program:University College London/MSIN1003 Information World (Autumn 2014) | term = 2014 Q3}}, also known as '''Pseudo-Analysis''' or '''Blind Development''',  is a mocking term used to describe the running of a company where the [[Internal communications|communication]] channels between the [[management|managers]] and the [[employee]]s do not work properly.&lt;ref name=oxfordref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mushroom management|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100218343|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term alludes to the stereotypical (and somewhat inaccurate) view of [[mushroom cultivation]]: "Kept in the dark and periodically given a load of manure".

==Description==
Mushroom management is a style of [[management]] in which the personnel are not familiar with the ideas or the general state of the company, and are given work without knowing the purpose of this work, in contrast with [[open-book management]]. Mushroom management means that workers' curiosity and self-expression are not supported. The employees often have no idea what the company's overall situation is, because the leaders tend to make all the decisions on their own, without asking anyone else to give their opinion.&lt;ref name="maranna"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mar|first1=Anna|title=Mushroom Management|url=http://management.simplicable.com/management/new/mushroom-management|website=Simplicable- business guide|publisher=Simplicable|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem can occur when the manager does not understand the employees' work (in a programming company, for example) and therefore cannot communicate effectively with the employees.&lt;ref name="CRS Press"/&gt;  
 
Mushroom management can also be found in environments that are unrelated to business. It can sometimes be found within schools, when students working in a group decide not to share information with the other students in the group. This means that they will appear more intelligent and hardworking during assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mushroom Management|url=https://projectwiki.sis.uta.fi/wiki/Mushroom_Management|website=ProjectWIki|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
The main reasons for the development of mushroom management within a company can be found at the managerial level. Mushroom management often develops when managers see themselves as the sole decision-makers within the company, rather than the people who lead all the employees towards a shared success. This can often take place unintentionally: managers fear that their employees will discover important new ideas instead of them, which drives the managers to make bad decisions and prevent employees from taking an active role in their work. As a result, the employees end up doing this work in a mechanical, repeated fashion, without contributing in a more productive or active way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mushroom Management|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/leadership/articles/mushroom_management.htm|website=Changing Minds|publisher=Changing Minds|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The key feature of mushroom management is that the employees have limited responsibility over the company. The importance of the decisions they have to make is minimal, which can often reduce [[Occupational stress|workplace-related stress]].&lt;ref name="CRS Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neill|first1=Colin|last2=Laplante|first2=Phillip|title=Antipatterns: Identification,Refactoring and Management|date=2006|publisher=CRS Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|pages=120-121|url=https://books.google.sk/books?id=6t3KzeaO7FIC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=mushroom+management+book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aLAgIeqeCG&amp;sig=cfQNC15pWOowgYksgduyxQMzdkY&amp;hl=sk&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WaRHVP-rD8bD7gbr_IDgBA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mushroom%20management%20book&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The consequences of mushroom management can be extremely detrimental for everyone involved in the company. If the flow of information within a company is insufficient, the people involved often have a limited understanding of how to react in situations that require quick assessment and prompt [[decision making]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gregory|title=Mushroom Management- Don't keep your workforce in the dark|url=http://www.managerwise.com/article.phtml?id=304|publisher=ManagerWise|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a company that makes and sells shoes might research their customers' preferences and discover that these preferences have changed. However, if this piece of information is not passed on to the sales manager of an individual shop, then the shop will still display the "old" shoes and will not attract the customers' attention effectively. At the end of this process, the blame is sometimes even attributed to the shop assistants, because they are the employees in a direct contact with the customers.&lt;ref name="CRS Press"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers===
[[File:Richard S. Fuld, Jr. at World Resources Institute forum.jpg|thumb||[[Richard Fuld]], [[Lehman Brothers]] CEO.]]
During the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] in 2008, considerable information about the bank's management was revealed, including the way [[Richard S. Fuld, Jr.]], the former CEO, organised the bank. The bank had started to concentrate more and more on excessively risky mortgages; however, neither the employees nor the public were aware of the bank's financial situation.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harress|first1=Christopher|last2=Caulderwood|first2=Kathleen|title=The Death Of Lehman Brothers: What Went Wrong, Who Paid The Price And Who Remained Unscathed Through The Eyes Of Former Vice-President|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/death-lehman-brothers-what-went-wrong-who-paid-price-who-remained-unscathed-through-eyes-former-vice|website=International Business Times|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuld, together with other managers, had kept a significant amount of essential information secret, as well as lying to the investors and to all other involved parties. Everybody else had thought that Lehman Brothers were involved with a variety of investments, including both safe and risky investments; in reality, though, they had been working with a much more risky portfolio than was appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montgomery|first1=Ashileigh|title=The Dearth of Ethics and the Death of Lehman Brothers|url=http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/case-studies/the-dearth-of-ethics-and-the-death-of-lehman-brothers|website=Sevenpillars Institute|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the bank became bankrupt, Fuld refused to take the blame for any of these events, even though he was responsible for the concealment of the information.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.com"/&gt;  

===Sinking of the ''Titanic''===
[[File:Stöwer Titanic.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'' sinking.]]
Mushroom management can also occur during the handling of one-off, individual situations. When the ship ''[[Titanic]]'' hit an iceberg, only a few members of the crew were aware that the ship was going to sink. Most of the crewmen were not informed about the seriousness of the situation by the captain, which resulted in chaos and disorganisation. The captain attempted to act on his own, without incorporating the officers into his decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smart|first1=John M.|title=Saving the Titanic- Crowdsourcing to Find Hard Solutions, and Unlearning to Implement Them|url=https://eversmarterworld.wordpress.com/tag/mushroom-management/|website=Ever Smart World|publisher=John M. Smart|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
Sharing information with co-workers and employees is often unavoidable; however, one of the most important tasks for a manager is to differentiate between information that can be shared with others and information that cannot be shared. A company should not share all its information with its employees, because that could be even more damaging. Managers should learn how to distribute information and how to communicate with the people they are responsible for.&lt;ref name="maranna" /&gt; The best way to avoid mushroom management is [[Transparency (behaviour)|transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monty|first1=Scott|title=Why transparency and authenticity wins in business and in marketing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/17/why-transparency-and-authenticity-wins-in-business-and-in-marketing|website=The Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Good mushroom management==
Sometimes, mushroom management can be very helpful if it is handled carefully. This method involves the company's employees being divided into various groups, each of which has all the information which it specifically needs but nothing more, similar to a [[need to know]] approach taken in the military to control access to sensitive material. Meanwhile, the manager is in charge of giving each group the required information. This kind of management is extremely difficult, though, and requires considerable skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munro|first1=Simon|title=I suck at mushroom management|url=http://consultingblogs.emc.com/simonmunro/archive/2008/10/20/i-suck-at-mushroom-management.aspx|website=EMC Consulting|publisher=EMC|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy of mushroom cultivation analogy==
The term refers to the stereotypical view of [[mushroom cultivation]], where mushrooms are "kept in the dark and periodically given a load of manure".&lt;ref name=oxfordref/&gt; In fact, the most commonly cultivated mushroom, ''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'' is grown on a [[pasteurized]] [[compost]] substrate, not raw [[manure]] (common raw ingredients in [[mushroom compost]] are horse manure and straw). The chemical and microbiological nature of finished compost is, however, quite different from raw manure.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Mushrooms are fungi rather than plants and therefore do not use photosynthesis. They can grow without light, but do not actually require darkness in order to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer DM. 2003. [http://extension.psu.edu/publications/ul210/view ''Basic Procedures for'' Agaricus ''Mushroom Growing'']. Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension.&lt;/ref&gt; Most mushroom cultivation is in fact done in dark locations (such as caves) for reasons of utility and to save on the expense of lighting, or, as with the case of the aforementioned ''Agaricus bisporus'', for appearance reasons. Light tends to give the mushrooms a brownish tint. Marketing research has shown the overwhelming customer preference for lighter specimens, so most of the producers try to limit light exposure. Some cultivated mushroom species, however, may need periodic exposure to light in order to induce fruition.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The '''northeastern Iberian script''', also known as '''Levantine Iberian''' or '''Iberian''' because the [[Iberian script]] was the most frequently used, was the main means of written expression of the [[Iberian language]]. The language is also expressed by the [[southeastern Iberian script]] and the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]]. To understand the relationship between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, one should point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs. However, it is clear they have a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script was derived from the [[southeastern Iberian script]]. Some researchers have concluded that it is linked to the [[Phoenician alphabet]] alone, but others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] also had a role.

==Typology and variants==
All the [[paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic value for the [[occlusives]], and monophonemic value for the rest of the [[consonants]] and [[vowels]]. In a [[writing system]] they are neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]], but are rather mixed scripts that are normally identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. The basic signary contains 28 [[sign (linguistics)|sign]]s: 5 [[vowels]], 15 syllabic and 8 consonantic (one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], two [[sibilants]], two [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] and three [[Nasal stop|nasals]]). The northeastern script was very nearly deciphered in 1922 by [[Manuel Gómez-Moreno Martínez]], who systematically linked the [[syllable|syllabic]] signs with the [[occlusive]] values. The decipherment was based on the existence of a large number of [[coin]] legends (some of them bearing [[Latin]] inscriptions) that could easily be linked to ancient place names known from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sources. There are two variants of the northeastern Iberian script: the dual variant is almost exclusive to the ancient inscriptions from the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE and its distinctive characteristic is the use of the dual system. This system was discovered by [[Joan Maluquer de Motes]] in 1968 and allows differentiation of the [[occlusive]] signs ([[Dental consonant|dentals]] and [[velars]]) between [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] by the use of an additional stroke. The simple sign represents the voiced value whilst the complex sign represents the [[unvoiced]] value. The non-dual variant is almost exclusive of the modern inscriptions from the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. 

==Location of findings==
The inscriptions that use the northeastern Iberian script have been found mainly in the northeastern quadrant of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]: largely along the coast from [[Roussillon]] to [[Alicante]], but also with a deep penetration in the [[Ebro]] Valley. The northeastern Iberian inscriptions have been found on different object types ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], silver and [[ceramic]] recipients, [[lead]] plaques, [[mosaics]], [[amphora|amphores]], stones ([[stele]]s), [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]-whorls etc.), representing 95% of the total finds (over 2000 items), and nearly all the scripts were written from left to right. The oldest northeastern Iberian script date to the 4th or maybe the 5th century BCE. The modern ones date from the end of the 1st century BCE or maybe the beginning of the 1st century CE.

In recent years four northeastern Iberian abecedaries or signaries have been published: the [[Castellet de Bernabé signary]], the [[Tos Pelat signary]], the [[Ger signary]] and the [[Bolvir signary]], all of them belonging to the dual variant of the script.

'''Omurano''' is an [[Unclassified language|unclassified]] language from [[Peru]]. It is also known as Humurana, Roamaina, Numurana, Umurano, and Mayna. The language was presumed to have become [[Extinct language|extinct]] by 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|omu}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2011 a [[rememberer]] was found who knew some 20 words in Omurano; he claimed that there were still people who could speak it.

Tovar (1961) linked Omurano to [[Taushiro language|Taushiro]] (and later Taushiro with [[Kandoshi language|Kandoshi]]); [[Terrence Kaufman|Kaufman]] (1994) finds the links reasonable, and in 2007 he classified Omurano and Taushiro (but not Kandoshi) as [[Saparo–Yawan languages]].

[[Maynas language|Maynas]], once mistaken for a synonym, is a separate language.

'''Pablo Andrés Illanes Tapia''' (born March 12, 1973) is a [[Chile]]an writer, scriptwriter, journalist and film director, principally known as the creator of various successful [[telenovela]]s, including ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Adrenalina (telenovela){{!}}Adrenalina|es|3=Adrenalina (telenovela)|vertical-align=sup}}'', ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Machos (telenovela){{!}}Machos|es|3=Machos|vertical-align=sup}}'', ''[[Alguien te mira (Chilean TV series)|Alguien te mira]]'', ''[[¿Dónde está Elisa?]]'' and ''[[Conde Vrolok]]''.

== Biography ==
Illanes studied [[journalism]] at [[Diego Portales University]]. After establishing himself as a [[film critic]] in ''Wikén'', the weekend supplement of the newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'', and at the defunct TV station {{Interlanguage link multi|Canal 2 Rock &amp; Pop|es|3=Canal 2 Rock &amp; Pop|vertical-align=sup}}, he wrote his first telenovela, ''Adrenalina'' (1996). It was aired on [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]]. The telenovela generated controversy{{clarify|date=January 2015}} for its storyline based on fleeting teen romances at a high school in the "barrio alto" (upper district) of Santiago.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

His second telenovela, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Playa salvaje|es|3=Playa salvaje|vertical-align=sup}}'' (1997), was the most watched telenovela of the decade on its channel.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} His initiation as a screenwriter came later, with ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Fuera de control (telenovela){{!}}Fuera de control|es|3=Fuera de control (telenovela)|vertical-align=sup}}'' (1999), which did not generate high [[audience measurement|television ratings]] but was lauded by critics; it became a [[cult film|cult classic]], and would be reaired on two occasions.

After ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Piel canela|es|3=Piel canela|vertical-align=sup}}'' (2001), a series which obtained weak ratings and critical reviews and caused a temporary pause of telenovela production on Canal 13, he reestablished himself with the successful ''Machos'' (2003), co-written with Coca Gómez and Sebastián Arrau. The telenovela had a broad social impact and generated substantial ratings, and won several awards including two [[Altazor Award|Altazor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premioaltazor.cl/mariana-loyola-machos/ Mariana Loyola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529002338/http://www.premioaltazor.cl/mariana-loyola-machos/ |date=2014-05-29 }} and [http://www.premioaltazor.cl/herval-abreu-machos/ Herval Abreu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118225434/http://www.premioaltazor.cl/herval-abreu-machos/ |date=2015-01-18 }}, pages of the Altazor Awards, 2004; accessed 12/10/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was extremely successful and would eventually be rebroadcast in [[Spain]] and various [[Latin America]]n countries including [[Uruguay]], where it was greatly popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teleuruguaya.com/2012/03/y-vamos-abriendo-puertas-los-mercados.html ''Y vamos abriendo puertas''], ''Tele Uruguaya'', March 2012; accessed 12/10/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Illanes then worked at [[Televisión Nacional de Chile]] (TVN) where he wrote the soap operas ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Destinos cruzados|es|3=Destinos cruzados|vertical-align=sup}}'' (2004) and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Versus (telenovela){{!}}Versus|es|3=Versus (telenovela)|vertical-align=sup}}'' (2005). He also adapted the script of the Argentinean soap opera ''[[Floricienta]]'', whose Chilean version, ''[[Floribella#Chile|Floribella]]'', premiered in 2006. Illanes created the first Chilean suspense TV series, ''Alguien te mira'', based on the activities of a psychopath in the affluent section of Santiago, gaining the largest ever audience for a nighttime television series.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} This success allowed him to work on a new project, ''¿Dónde está Elisa?'' a crime/suspense series inspired by real cases such as those of [[Madeleine McCann]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Jorge Matute Johns|es|3=Jorge Matute Johns|vertical-align=sup}}. After that series, he wrote ''Conde Vrolok'', a vampire telenovela set in the 19th century and inspired by [[Dracula]]. He is also the author of the scripts for ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Témpano (telenovela){{!}}Témpano|es|3=Témpano (telenovela)|vertical-align=sup}}'' (2011).

He entered the field of literature with ''Una Mujer Brutal''&lt;ref&gt;[http://yonosoyfunes.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/una-mujer-brutal-de-pablo-illanes/ ''«Una mujer brutal», de Pablo Illanes'' ("Una mujer brutal", by Pablo Illanes), review originally published in ''Caras'' magazine, November of 2000; reproduced in ''El Diario del Antifunes'' (The Newspaper of the Antifunes)], 11.01.2012; acceso 10.12.2012&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{Not a typo|fragilidad}}''. {{As of|2013}}, Illanes is working on a third novel, ''Los Amantes Caníbales'', named after his [[blog]].
 
Illanes directed ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Baby Shower (film){{!}}Baby Shower|es|3=Baby Shower (película)|vertical-align=sup}}'' (2011), a horror film starring actresses such as [[Ingrid Isensee]], [[Claudia Burr]], [[Francisca Merina]], [[Sofía García]], and [[Patricia López]] from several of his previous series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latercera.com/noticia/cultura/2011/01/1453-337725-9-critica-de-cine-baby-shower.shtml Daniel Villalobos. ''Film critic: "Baby Shower"''], ''[[La Tercera]]'', 14.01.2011; accessed 10.12.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He filmed his second feature-length film, ''Videoclub'', in late 2012. It stars [[Pedro Campos]], [[Luciana Echeverría]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Ingrid Cruz|es|3=Ingrid Cruz|vertical-align=sup}}, and its [[soundtrack]] was produced by the band [[Pánico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://diario.latercera.com/2012/12/10/01/contenido/cultura-entretencion/30-125117-9-panico-hara-banda-sonora-de-la-nueva-cinta-de-pablo-illanes.shtml Claudio Vergara. ''Pánico hará banda sonora de la nueva cinta de Pablo Illanes'' (Pánico will make the soundtrack of the new film by Pablo Illanes)], ''[[La Tercera]]'', 12/10/2012; accessed the same day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Illanes became a screenwriter with [[Telemundo]] in 2013, and is contracted to the company for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diario.latercera.com/2012/12/22/01/contenido/cultura-entretencion/30-126084-9-pablo-illanes-deja-tvn-y-llega-a-acuerdo-por-tres-anos-con-la-cadena-telemundo.shtml Cecilia Gutiérrez.

'''Pluractionality''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233521052_Event_Internal_Pluractionality_in_Modern_Hebrew_A_Semantic_Analysis_of_One_Verbal_Reduplication_Pattern&lt;/ref&gt; or '''verbal number''', if not used in [[iterative aspect|its aspectual sense]], is a grammatical device that indicates that the action or [[Verb argument|participants]] of a [[verb]] is/are [[grammatical number|plural]]. This differs from [[frequentative]] or [[iterative aspect|iterative]] [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] in that the latter have no implication for the number of participants of the verb.

Often a pluractional [[transitive verb]] indicates that the [[direct object|object]] is plural, whereas in a pluractional [[intransitive verb]] the [[agent (grammar)|subject]] is plural. This is sometimes taken as an element of [[ergativity]] in the language. However, the essence of pluractionality is that the action of the verb is plural, whether because several people perform the action, it is performed on several objects, or it is performed several times. The exact interpretation may depend on the semantics of the verb as well as the context in which it is used. The lack of verbal number does not generally mean that the action and participants are singular, but rather that there is no particularly notable plurality; thus it may be better described as [[paucal number|paucal]] vs. multiple rather than singular vs. plural.

Although English does not have verbal number as a grammatical device, many English verbs such as ''stampede'' and ''massacre'' are used when one of the participants involves a large number. English also has a number of verbs (often ending in -le, such as ''nibble'') which indicate repetitive actions, and this is similar to some types of grammatically-marked pluractionality in other languages.

==In Ainu==
The [[Ainu language]] of Japan has a [[closed class]] of 'count verbs'. The majority of these end in ''-pa,'' an iterative suffix that has become [[lexicalization|lexicalized]] on some verbs. For example, ''kor'' means 'to have something or a few things', and ''kor-pa'' 'to have many things'; there are also [[causative]] forms of the latter, ''kor-pa-re'' 'to give (one person) many things', ''kor-pa-yar'' 'to give (several people) many things'. The ''-pa'' may occur more than once; this may be a case of the pluractional verb in its iterative aspect:

:''hosip-pa-pa'' "everyone came back"

There are also [[suppletive]] forms:

{|class=wikitable
|+Ainu suppletive pluractionals
!Paucal!!Multiple!!Trans.
|-
|an||oka(y)||''to be''
|-
|as||roski||''to stand''
|-
|a||rok||''to sit''
|-
|arpa,&lt;br/&gt;oman||paye||''to go''
|-
|ek||arki||''to come''
|-
|rayke||ronnu||''to kill''
|-
|uk||uyna||''to take''
|}

In addition to literal number, pluractionality can be used for politeness, much as plural pronouns are in many languages. (See [[T-V distinction]].)

==In Georgian==
[[Georgian language|Georgian]] shows an illuminating distinction between verbal and nominal number.  Georgian verbs may be suppletive for tense and animacy as well as number. When a noun occurs with a numeral in Georgian, it takes the singular form regardless of its semantic number. Verbal agreement is syntactic, and therefore is also singular. However, the pluractionality of the verbal root remains plural. Thus,

Singular participant, singular verb:
:{|
|ivane||da-ǧd-a	
|-
|John([[Grammatical number|{{sm|sg}}]])||[[perfective|{{sm|pfv}}]]-sit({{sm|sg}})-[[grammatical person|3]]{{sm|sg}}
|}
:"John sat down"

Plural participant, plural verb:
:{|
|čem-i||mšobl-eb-i||da-sxd-nen	
|-
|my-[[nominative|{{sm|nom}}]]||parent-[[plural|{{sm|pl}}]]-{{sm|nom}}||{{sm|pfv}}-sit({{sm|pl}})-3{{sm|pl}}
|}
:"My parents sat down"

Grammatically singular but semantically plural participant, mixed verb:
:{|
|čem-i||sam-i||megobar-i||da-sxd-a
|-
|my-{{sm|nom}}||three-{{sm|nom}}||friend({{sm|sg}})-{{sm|nom}}||{{sm|pfv}}-sit({{sm|pl}})-3{{sm|sg}}
|}
:"My three friends sat down"

(See [[Interlinear gloss]] to explain the format of these examples.)

==In Muskogean==
[[Muskogean languages]] such as Koasati have a three-way distinction, with singular, dual, and plural verbs. However, it is not clear if this is pluractionality or simply suppletive verbal agreement for number. See [[Koasati language]] for details.

==In Hopi==
In [[Hopi language|Hopi]], [[dual number|dual]] nouns as subjects take the suffix ''-vit'' and singular verbs. Hopi does not have dual pronouns, but the plural pronouns may be used with singular verbs with a dual meaning. However, it is not clear if this is pluractionality or simply number agreement on the verb. See [[Hopi language]] for details.

==In Central Pomo==
The [[Pomoan languages|Central Pomo language]] of California distinguishes ''{{IPA|ʔčʰá·w}}'' 'sit, stay' and pluractional ''{{IPA|napʰów}}'' for more than one person. The [[perfective]] suffix ''-w'' on these verbs may be replaced with ''-t'' for a plural object:

:{|
|''háyu''||''š-čé-w''
|-
|dog||hook-catch-{{sm|pfv}}
|}
:"He tied up the dog."

:{|
|''háyu''||''š-čé-t''
|-
|dog||hook-catch-{{sm|pfv.pl}}
|}
:"He tied up the dogs."

As in Ainu, pluractionality may be used for politeness.

==In Hausa==
[[Chadic languages]] such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]] use reduplicated verbs with "a general meaning of a repeated action, an action simultaneously performed by several agents, and action performed on more than one object, or various combinations of these 'plural' meanings" (Eulenberg 1971). There are also derived forms:

*''naa aikee su'' 'I sent them'
*''naa a”aikee su'' 'I sent({{sm|pl}}) them'
The first implies that I sent them all together, whereas the second means that I sent them at different times or to different places.

==In Papuan languages==
Pluractionality is not uncommon in New Guinea. The [[Koiarian languages|Koiarian language]] Barai has suppletive forms: 
:{|
|fi||'one sits'||&amp;nbsp;||kari||'many sit'
|-
|abe||'take one'|| ||ke||'take many'
|}

==In American Sign Language==
{{main article|American Sign Language grammar#Verbal number}}
In [[American Sign Language]], verbal number is expressed through [[reduplication]]. There are several [[verbal aspect]]s using modified reduplication that indicate frequent or iterative action; these are unusual cross-linguistically in that transitive verbs lose their transitivity. In addition, transitive verbs may be reduplicated to show plurality of their object; the motion of the verb is either extended or repeated to cover the spatial locations of multiple objects or recipients. These are true [[dual number|duals]] and plurals, and so may be best thought of as [[object incorporation]] rather than pluractionality. For example, {{sm|ask someone a question}} is signed by flexing the index finger of an upright G hand in the direction of that person; the dual involves flexing it at both object loci (sequentially with one hand or simultaneously with both), the simple plural involves a single flexing, which spans the object group while the hand arcs across it, and an individuated plural involves multiple rapid flexings while the hand arcs.

A '''ration stamp''' or '''ration card''' is a stamp or [[Charge card|card]] issued by a government to allow the holder to obtain food or other [[commodities]] that are in short supply during [[war|wartime]] or in other emergency situations when [[rationing]] is in force. Ration stamps were widely used during World War II by both sides after hostilities caused interruption to the normal supply of goods. They were also used after the end of the war while the economies of the belligerents gradually returned to normal. Ration stamps were also used to help maintain the amount of food one could hold at a time. This was so that one person would not have more food than the other.

==India==
{{main article|Ration card (India)}}
Rationing has been present in India since World War II. A ration card allows households to purchase highly subsidised food grain, sugar and kerosene from their local [[Public Distribution System|Public distribution system]] (PDS) shop.

==The United States==
{{main|Rationing in the United States}}
Rationing was used in the United States during World War II.  

Government funds provided to poverty stricken individuals by the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] are often referred to colloquially as "food stamps". The parallels between these "food stamps" and ration stamps as used in war time rationing is limited, however, since food can be purchased in the United States on the regular market without the use of stamps.

==The United Kingdom==
{{main|Rationing in the United Kingdom}}
Rationing was widespread in the United Kingdom during World War II and continued long after the end of the war. It has been credited with greatly increasing public health. Fuel rationing did not end until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{IPA notice}}
This article is about the '''spelling reforms of the [[Portuguese language]]'''.

==Historical background==
Portuguese began to be used regularly in documents and poetry around the 12th century. In 1290, [[Diniz of Portugal|King Diniz]] created the first Portuguese University in [[Lisbon]] (later moved to [[Coimbra]]) and decreed that Portuguese, then called simply the "common language", would henceforth be used instead of [[Latin language|Latin]], and named the "Portuguese language". In 1296, it was adopted by the Royal Chancellary and began to be used for writing laws and in notaries.

The medieval spelling of Portuguese was not uniform, since it had no official standard, but most authors used an essentially [[phonemic orthography]], with minor concessions to [[etymology]] common in other Romance languages, such as the use of ''c'' for {{IPA|/ts/}} before ''e'' or ''i'', but ''ç'' otherwise, or the use of ''ss'' for {{IPA|/s/}} between vowels, but ''s'' otherwise. King Diniz, who was an admirer of the [[Provençal literature|poetry of the troubadours]] and a poet himself, popularized the [[Occitan]] digraphs ''nh'' and ''lh'' for the [[palatal consonant]]s {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, which until then had been spelled with several digraphs, including ''nn'' and ''ll'', as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

During the [[Renaissance]], appreciation for classical culture led many authors to imitate Latin and ([[Romanization of Greek|Romanized]]) [[Ancient Greek]], filling words with a profusion of [[silent letter]]s and other etymological [[grapheme]]s, such as ''ch'' (pronounced as ''c/qu''), ''ph'' (pronounced as ''f''), ''rh'', ''th'', ''y'' (pronounced as ''i''), ''cc'', ''pp'', ''tt'', ''mn'' (pronounced as ''n''), ''sce'', ''sci'' (pronounced as ''ce'', ''ci''), ''bt'', ''pt'', ''mpt'' (pronounced as ''t''), and so on, still found today in the orthographies of [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].

Contrary to neighboring languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or French, whose orthographies were set by language academies in the 17th century, Portuguese had no official spelling until the early 20th century; authors wrote as they pleased.

==Orthographic standardization==
In 1911, the newly formed Portuguese Republic, concerned with improving the literacy of its citizens, charged a commission of [[philologist]]s with defining a standard orthography for Portuguese. The result was what has come to be known in Portugal as the orthographic reform of [[Aniceto dos Reis Gonçalves Viana|Gonçalves Viana]]. The new standard became official in Portugal and its overseas territories at the time, which are today the independent nations of [[Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mozambique]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], and [[East Timor]], as well as the Chinese S.A.R. of [[Macau]] and the [[Portuguese India|Indian]] state of [[Goa]] and territories of [[Daman and Diu]], and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. In 1938, [[Brazil]] set up an orthography of its own, with the same general principles as the Portuguese orthography, but not entirely identical to it.

===Basic principles===
The authors of the first spelling reform of Portuguese, imbued with the modern ideas of [[phonology]], rejected the etymological spellings current in the previous centuries, preferring a more phonetic orthography, like those of Spanish and [[Italian language|Italian]]. On the other hand, considering that the period of [[Galician-Portuguese]] [[Troubadour|troubadorian]] poetry had been a golden age of Portuguese literature, they aimed to keep the new orthography as close to the medieval spelling as possible, in spite of some phonetic changes which the language had undergone. The resulting orthographic standard was essentially a compromise between these intents, on one hand, and common traditions, on the other: in a few cases, spelling conventions which went against etymology but had long become customary were made official.

Thus, the reform kept some graphemic distinctions for phonological traits which were not present in every dialect, but still present in at least some areas: between ''z'' and [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] ''s'' ({{IPA|/dz/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} in medieval Portuguese, but now reduced to {{IPA|/z/}} in most dialects), between ''c/ç'' and ''s(s)'' ({{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} in medieval Portuguese, but now reduced to {{IPA|/s/}} in most dialects), and between ''ch'' and ''x'' (originally {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, now just {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in most dialects, although the distinction is still retained in some). The unstressed vowels ''e'' and ''o'' were also retained for word-family homogeneity and etymology when they were pronounced as ''i'' or ''u'', respectively, and the digraph ''ou'' was differentiated from ''o'', even though many speakers now pronounced both as {{IPA|/o/}}. These distinctions have close parallels in the orthographies of other West European languages.

Since [[stress (linguistics)|word stress]] can be distinctive in Portuguese, the [[acute accent]] was used to mark the stressed vowel whenever it was not in the usual position, more or less as in the orthographies of Spanish and [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. For example, the verb ''critica'' "he criticizes" bears no accent mark, because it is stressed on the syllable before the last one, like most words that end in ''-a'', but the noun ''crítica'' "criticism" requires an accent mark, since it is a [[proparoxytone]].

Since the [[Vowel height|height]] of the vowels ''a'', ''e'' and ''o'' is also distinctive in stressed syllables (see ''[[Portuguese phonology]]''), high stressed vowels were marked with a [[circumflex accent]], ''â'', ''ê'', ''ô'', to be differentiated from the low stressed vowels written ''á'', ''é'', ''ó''. The choice of the acute for low vowels and the circumflex for high vowels went against the conventions of other [[Romance languages]] such as French or Italian, but it was already commonplace in Portuguese before the 20th century. (In many words, Portuguese ''ê'' and ''ô'' correspond to the Latin long vowels ''ē'', ''ō''.)

[[Nasal vowel]]s and nasal [[diphthong]]s usually appear before the orthographic nasal consonants ''n'', ''m'', in which case they do not need to be identified with diacritics, but the [[tilde]] was placed on nasal ''a'' and nasal ''o'' when they occurred before another letter, or at the end of a word. Although the vowel ''u'' can also be nasal before other vowels, this happens in so few words (''mui'', ''muito'', ''muita'', ''muitos'', ''muitas'') that marking its nasality was not considered necessary.

The acute accent was used also to mark the second vowel of a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] in a stressed syllable, where a diphthong would normally be expected, distinguishing for example ''conclui'' "he concludes" from ''concluí'' "I concluded", ''saia'' "that he leave" from ''saía'' "he used to leave", or ''fluido'' "fluid" from ''fluído'' "flowed".

Initially, the orthographic system, both in Brazil and Portugal, determined the usage of diacritics in cases where two words would otherwise be [[Homography|homographic]] but not [[Homophony|homophonous]], such as ''acôrdo'', "agreement", distinguishing it from ''acórdo'', "I wake up". This principle was abandoned in all but a dozen cases in 1945 in Portugal and in 1973 in Brazil. (In most cases the homographs were different [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], meaning that context was enough to distinguish them.)

The orthography set by the 1911 reform is essentially the one still in use today on both sides of the Atlantic with only minor adjustments having been made to the vowels, consonants, and digraphs. Since then, the only remaining significant differences between the two standards, and only substantial changes addressed in the 1990 spelling reform, were in the use of [[diacritic]]s and silent consonants.

==Portuguese orthography vs. Brazilian orthography==
Brazil was never consulted about the orthographic reform of 1911, and so it did not adopt it. In the decades that followed, negotiations were held between representatives of Brazil and Portugal, with the intent of agreeing on a uniform orthography for Portuguese, but progress was slow. In 1931, Portugal and Brazil finally signed an orthographic agreement, on the basis of which Brazil established its own official orthography, in 1938.&lt;!--THE DATES CONCERNING BRAZIL NEED TO BE CHECKED.--&gt;

Soon after, however, it became apparent that there were differences between the spellings being used in the two countries. Even though both were based on the same general principles, phonetic differences between [[European Portuguese]] and [[Brazilian Portuguese]] had led to divergent spellings in some cases. Various attempts were made in the remainder of the 20th century to bring the two orthographies closer to each other, sometimes with modest success, other times without success. To this day, they do not coincide completely.

===Problems with the original orthography===
Notwithstanding its traces of etymology, the 1911 orthography aimed to be phonetic in the sense that, given the spelling of a word, there would be no ambiguity about its pronunciation. For that reason, it had certain characteristics which later produced inconsistencies between the European and the Brazilian orthographies.

In unstressed syllables, hiatuses were originally distinguished from diphthongs with a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]]. For instance, writing ''saüdade'', ''traïdor'', ''constituïção'', so that they would be pronounced ''sa-udade'', ''tra-idor'', ''constitu-ição''. But the pronunciation of these words is not uniform. Many speakers say ''sau-dade'' and ''trai-dor'', especially in fast speech. Furthermore, there are no [[minimal pair]]s that distinguish a hiatus from a falling diphthong in unstressed syllables. For this reason, marking unstressed hiatuses came to be seen as unnecessary, and these tremas were eventually abolished.

The trema was also used in the words where the letter ''u'' is, exceptionally, pronounced in the digraphs ''gue'', ''gui'', ''que'', ''qui'', rather than silent as usual; e.g. ''agüentar'', ''sagüim'', ''freqüente'', ''eqüidade''. However, there is regional variation, with for example the ''u'' being pronounced in a few Brazilian Portuguese accents ''qüestão'', but not in European Portuguese ''questão''. Although the number of words with such divergent pronunciations is small, they have been seen as an obstacle to the orthographic unification of the language.

Unstressed vowels are usually high, but there are exceptions, including a few pairs of [[homograph]]s in European Portuguese which vary only in having either a low or a high vowel in an unstressed syllable. To distinguish these, the [[grave accent]] was at first placed on unstressed low vowels: cf. ''pregar'' "to nail", where the ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɨ/}} in European Portuguese, with ''prègar'' "to preach", where ''è'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, or ''molhada'' {{IPA|/u/}} "wet" with ''mòlhada'' {{IPA|/ɔ/}} "bundle". But in Brazilian Portuguese both words in each example are pronounced the same way, so the grave accent is not used: ''pregar'' {{IPA|/e/}} "to nail/to preach", ''molhada'' {{IPA|/o/}} "wet/bundle"; the intended meaning is inferred from context. The grave accent was eventually abolished, except in a small number of contractions.

In other cases, where an unstressed low vowel was the result of the [[elision]] of the consonants ''c'' or ''p'' before ''c'', ''ç'', ''t'', the consonant was kept in the spelling, to denote the quality of the preceding vowel. For example, in the word ''intercepção'', which is stressed on its last syllable, the letter ''p'' is not pronounced, but indicates that the second ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, as opposed to the second ''e'' in ''intercessão'', which is pronounced {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. Other examples of words where a silent consonant was left to lower the previous vowel are ''objecção'' and ''factor''. In Brazilian Portuguese, the vowels in question are pronounced just like any other unstressed vowels, and, since there is no phonetic ambiguity to undo, the words are simply spelled ''objeção'', ''fator'', and so on.

The orthography distinguished between stressed ''éi'' and stressed ''ei''. In Brazilian Portuguese, these diphthongs are indeed different, but in most dialects of European Portuguese both are pronounced the same way, and ''éi'' appears only by convention in some [[oxytone]] plural nouns and adjectives. This led to divergent spellings such as ''idéia'' (Brazil) and ''ideia'' (Portugal).

The Brazilian spelling has ''a'', ''ê'' or ''ô'' in several words where the European orthography has ''á'', ''é'' or ''ó'', due to different pronunciation. For example, cf. ''pensamos'', ''gênero'', ''tônico'' (Brazil) with ''pensámos'', ''género'', ''tónico'' (Portugal). This happens when the vowels are stressed before the nasal consonants ''m'' or ''n'', followed by another vowel, in which case both types of vowel may occur in European Portuguese, but Brazilian Portuguese allows only high vowels.

==Timeline of spelling reforms==
&lt;!--THE DATES CONCERNING BRAZIL NEED TO BE CHECKED...--&gt;
* '''1911''': First spelling reform in Portugal.
* '''1931''': Orthographic agreement between Portugal and Brazil. Silent ''s'' abolished from words such as ''sciência'', ''scena'', ''scéptico'', etc., and spellings like ''dir-se há'' and ''amar-te hei'' changed to ''dir-se-á'' and ''amar-te-ei''.
* '''1937''': First proposal of orthographic reform in Brazil is mentioned by the Constitution but not enforced.
* '''1943''': First orthographic reform of Brazil is delineated in the ''Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa'', by the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras]].
* '''1945''': Sweeping spelling reform in Portugal eliminates the trema, and differential circumflex accents in most pairs of homographs such as ''acêrto'' and ''acerto'', ''cêrca'' and ''cerca'', ''côr'' and ''cor'', ''fôra'' and ''fora'', ''dêsse'' and ''desse'', and so on.
* '''1946''': The [[Constitution of Brazil]] makes the orthographic reform of 1943 official and mandates that all books published in the country use the official spelling.
* '''1971''': Sweeping spelling reform in Brazil eliminates the trema in hiatuses, most differential circumflexes, and accent marks on vowels with secondary stressed syllables in compounds, such as ''ràpidamente'', ''ùltimamente'', ''cortêsmente'', ''cafèzinho'', and so on. This reform was mockingly nicknamed the "Remington Reform" {{Citation needed|reason=An online search using Google shows nothing except this Wikipedia Article|date=December 2012}} because it reduced dramatically the number of words bearing accents (the reference is to [[Remington Rand]] which manufactured both [[typewriter]]s and [[rifle]]s in Brazil, either because the reform made typewriting easier or because it "executed" a large number of diacritics).
* '''1973''': Portugal follows Brazil in abolishing accent marks in secondary stressed syllables.
* '''1986''': Brazil invites the other six Portuguese language countries, [[Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mozambique]], Portugal and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], to a meeting in [[Rio de Janeiro]] to address the remaining problems. A radical reform which would eliminate the acute accent and the circumflex accent from all words except [[oxytone]]s (as in the orthography of Italian) is proposed, but ill-received by both the Brazilian and the Portuguese media and public, and subsequently abandoned.
* '''1990''': A new orthographic agreement is reached between Brazil, Portugal and the other Portuguese-speaking countries. Not so radical as the 1986 attempt, it proposes a compromise between the two orthographic systems.
* '''2009''': The new 1990 spelling reform goes into effect in Brazil and in Portugal, changing the rules of [[capitalization]] and [[hyphen]] usage, eliminating the [[Trema (diacritic)|trema]] completely from the language (except for foreign words), changing the diphthongs "éi" and "ói" into "ei" and "oi", respectively in [[paroxytone]] words which don't end with a coda /r/, and eliminating [[silent letter]]s as in ''acção'' or ''óptimo'', which are now spelled ''ação'' and ''ótimo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moderna.com.br/acordo/guia_acordo.pdf |title=Guia do Acordo Ortográfico |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601092927/http://www.moderna.com.br/acordo/guia_acordo.pdf |archivedate=June 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2016''': The transitional period in Brazil, during which both orthographies co-existed, ends.&lt;ref&gt;Brazilian Federal Decree [http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:decreto:2012-12-27;7875 7875] of 2012 extended the transition through December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the new orthography is official from January 2016.

==Orthographic Agreement of 1990==

{{main|Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990}}

In 1990, an orthographic agreement was reached between the Portuguese-language countries with the intent of creating a single common orthography for Portuguese.

This [[spelling reform]] went into effect in Brazil on January 1, 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the [[Portuguese President|President]] on July 21, 2008, allowing for a six-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies co-existed. 

The legality of this decision is questioned, as the main bases of the International Treaty that governs the application of the new spelling reform are yet to be established, chiefly the common vocabulary drawn by all participating countries, that still does not exist. Also, the application of International Treaties, as per the Vienna Convention, states that the text of a treaty cannot be changed, and this one has suffered at least two revisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4323">A '''silent English alphabet''' is an alphabetic list of English words containing silent letters from A to Z. As the English language has many words with silent letters, it is possible to create numerous variations on this alphabet with the help of loan words and names from other languages. It is also sometimes referred to as a '''silent letter alphabet'''.

One possible origin for this alphabet goes back to a 1969 meeting of the Association of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, when discussion arose as to how the association's acronym, TESOL, should be pronounced. The association subsequently adopted the following tongue-in-cheek pronunciation guide, composed entirely of words with silent letters: T as in castle, E as in give, S as in island, O as in people, and L as in calm.&lt;ref name=jh&gt;Higgins, John. "Silent English." ''ELT Journal'' 37.4 (1983): 351-351.&lt;/ref&gt;The American linguist John Higgins subsequently spent some time constructing a complete such alphabet. By 1983, his alphabet lacked only words for the letters J, M, Q, V and X.&lt;ref name=jh/&gt;

For some words in the list below, more than one letter counts as silent; in 'daughter', for example, both the 'g' and the 'h' are silent. These words are listed under only one of the two possible letters to avoid redundant entries. Words with a doubled letter in which the second of the two letters is counted as silent, like 'ebb', are not included in the list since they are among the least interesting examples. Note that for a few words in the list, the silent letter is pronounced when the word changes form, e.g., from 'hymn' to 'hymnal' or 'bourgeois' to 'bourgeoisie'.

Purists may consider the 'marijuana' entry for the letter 'j' doubtful, since the 'j' actually is pronounced—though with the sound of 'h' rather than 'j'—whereas in examples for the other letters, the silent letter is not pronounced in any way at all.  The Dutch coin [[rijksdaalder]] has a true silent 'j' per Merriam-Webster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rijksdaalder] 'rijksdaalder' per Merriam-Webster&lt;/ref&gt;

Because some words have two versions of the given letter, one pronounced and one silent, in every case the silent letter is indicated in '''boldface''' type.

'''Taiap''' (or '''Tayap''', also called '''Gapun''', after the name of the village in which it is spoken) is an [[endangered language|endangered]] [[language isolate]] spoken by around a hundred people in the [[East Sepik|East Sepik Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is being replaced by the national language and [[lingua franca]] [[Tok Pisin]].

The first European to come across Taiap was a German missionary in 1938. The language was not studied by linguists until the 1970s because of the inaccessibility of the region.

Taiap has a [[Pandanus language]], spoken when harvesting [[karuka]].&lt;ref name="Pawley"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pawley |first1=Andrew |authorlink1=Andrew Pawley |editor1-last=Dutton |editor1-first=Tom E. |editor2-last=Ross |editor2-first=Malcolm |editor3-last=Tryon |editor3-first=Darrell |editor2-link=Malcolm Ross (linguist) |editor3-link=Darrell Tryon |title=The Language Game:  Papers in Memory of Donald C.

==Classification==
Although [[Donald Laycock]] (1973) placed Taiap in his [[Sepik–Ramu languages|Sepik Ramu]] [[language family]], its structure and vocabulary would be unique for that family, and Ross (2005) found no evidence that it is related to any language of New Guinea. The current extent of Taiap is nearly coincident with what had been an offshore island 6,000 years ago, consistent with the idea that Taiap is a language isolate.

'''Trampling''' is the act of walking on something or someone with the intent of causing damage or pain.

== Scientific use ==
Trampling may be by animals and cause effects. Called ''the trampling effect on the soil''. [[Livestock and livestock management on the Ol Pejeta Conservancy|Ol Pejeta Conservancy]] use the effect of livestock to facilitate grass growing as part of its [[wildlife management]] strategy.

When carrying out investigations like a [[belt transect]], trampling should be avoided. At other times, it is part of the [[experimental design]].

Trampling can be a [[disturbance (ecology)| disturbance to ecology]] and to archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|last2=Hayes|first2=Elspeth|last3=Clarkson|first3=Chris|last4=Fullagar|first4=Richard|title=Movement of lithics by trampling: An experiment in the Madjedbebe sediments, northern Australia|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=March 2017|volume=79|pages=73–85|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2017.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual activity ==
[[File:VIDEO-TRAMPLING-AMATEUR.webm|{{largethumb}}|Trampling]]
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}

'''Trampling'''  refers to the sexual activity that involves being trampled underfoot by another person or persons. Trampling is common enough to support a  [[subgenre]] of '''trampling pornography'''.

Because trampling can be used to produce pain, the trampling fetish for some adherents is closely linked to [[sadomasochistic]] fetishism.

A similar fetish is to imagine themselves as being tiny under another's feet, or being normal size, but being trampled by a giant person.  This is known as "giant/giantess fetishism" or [[macrophilia]].  It is not the same as trampling.

The most common form of trampling is done by a female (mistress) walking on a male [[submissive]] and is usually done barefooted, in socks, nylons, or shoes. The trampler will predominantly walk, jump and stomp on the person's back, chest, stomach, genitalia, face and in some rare instances, the neck.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7044">'''Triad''' refers to a group of three people in sociology. It is one of the simplest human groups that can be studied and is mostly looked at by [[microsociology]]. The study of triads and [[dyad (sociology)|dyad]]s was pioneered by [[Germany|German]] sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] at the end of the nineteenth century. 

A triad can be viewed as a group of three people that can create different group interactions. This specific grouping is common yet overlooked in society for many reasons. Those being that it is compared to the lives of others, how they shape society, and how communication plays a role in different relationships scenarios.&lt;ref name="Simmel"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Georg Simmel and Avant-Garde Sociology: The Birth of Modernity, 1880 to 1920|journal=Contemporary sociology (Washington)|volume=32|issn=0094-3061}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was derived in the late 1800s to early 1900s and evolved throughout time to shape group interactions in the present. Simmel also hypothesized between dyads and triads and how they may differ. A dyad is a group of two people that interact while a triad is another person added on to create more communicational interactions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vedel|first=Mette|last2=Holma|first2=Anne-Maria|last3=Havila|first3=Virpi|date=2016-08-01|title=Conceptualizing inter-organizational triads|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850116300025|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|volume=57|pages=139–147|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2016.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: adding an extra person, therefore creating a triad, this can result in different language barriers, personal connection, and an overall impression of the third person.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

Simmel wanted to convey to his audience that a triad is not a basic group with positive interactions, but how these interactions can differ depending on person to person.

== Studies conducted ==

===Sibling relationships===

Both tests and studies have been conducted as to how siblings interact and how age, gender, and the amount of siblings can create a triad. A majority of the population has doubled over the last decade and recently has been proven that the more parents conceive, the better outcome a child will have when relating to other siblings. It can all depend on the relationships that different families have acquired as children get older. Creating and distinguishing between how a family can interact is a perfect everyday example of a triad in sociology. Applying the [[attachment theory]] created by [[John Bowlby]] can help decipher the differences between communication and interactions across the world.

== Different forms ==

===Closed form===

In [[triadic closure]], a group of three people can form relationships between each individual in that group. Therefore, creating both personal and emotional connections amongst all three individuals. This can be extremely important for others to understand that each person in this triad performs different roles and has different characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The triad value function - theorizing the value potential of connected relationships|journal=The Journal of business &amp; industrial marketing|volume= 31| issue = 7|page=Page 849|issn=0885-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open form===

Even though a triad consists of three people, an open form of a relationship can alter because two out of three members in this group can clash. This can be due to both ''structural construction'' and ''informational construction''. They both provide a means of stability and assurance to sustain an open form relationship into a closed form relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Structural construction can impose stress and clustering as a sense of bad communication between individuals and their different interactions. Informational construction conveys the need for privacy and how various individuals can clash when knowing something the other does not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Georg Simmel ==

===The birth of modernity and how it has shaped society===

Georg Simmel goes into depth on the idea and how he creates the basis of a triad and what led him to his findings. It goes into discussing how places have taken triads shape. For example, in World War two he categorized the war into three various sections—European nationalism, materialism and imperialism.&lt;ref name="Simmel"/&gt; These three fall under "mammonism" this is the support of americanism in world war two and its effects that resulted from the war.&lt;ref name="Simmel"/&gt;

===Exchange and cohesion in dyads and triads===
Simmel conveys how cohesion has played a role in distinguishing between a dyad a triad. Three main factors that have led to these diverse groups is justified by 1) Dyads result in less behavioral changes when compared to triads, 2) Bonds that coincide more with triads than dyads, and 3) Emotion plays a bigger role when communicating between two people (dyad) versus a group with three people (triad).&lt;ref name="Yoon"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoon|first=Jeongkoo|last2=Thye|first2=Shane R.|last3=Lawler|first3=Edward J.|date=2013-11-01|title=Exchange and cohesion in dyads and triads: A test of Simmel's hypothesis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X13000884|journal=Social Science Research|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1457–1466|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last factor is mainly because communication and trust can be altered when mixing emotions between relationships. While in a group of three people it is less likely because the majority constantly communicate and come to an agreement as to what is best.&lt;ref name="Yoon"/&gt;

===Triadic closure===

Georg Simmel had studied the means of how interaction including sports can alter or contribute to how a group can communicate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wonjae|first=Lee|year=2009|title=Structural closure and performance in networks of competition: ATP professional tennis, 1997–2006|url=|journal=The University of Chicago, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2009. 3362042.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going through a list of those that the player is either friends or enemies with, will then result if there is a positive or negative correlation between the two. This theory is known as [[triadic closure]] and was introduced by George Simmel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Network closure has provided a basis of social structure and independent actions amongst other individuals. Social structure and structural action was formed on the foundation of his or her own opinions as one together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Uttamadhanapuram Venkatasubbaiyer Swaminatha Iyer''' (19-Feb-1855 – 28-Apr-1942) was a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] scholar and researcher who was instrumental in bringing many long-forgotten works of [[classical Tamil literature]] to light. His singular effort over five decades brought to light major literary works in Tamil and contributed vastly to the enrichment of its literary heritage. Iyer published over 91 books in his lifetime, on a variety of matters connected to classical Tamil literature, and collected 3,067 paper manuscripts, [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s and notes of various kinds. He is affectionately called ''Tamil Thatha'' (Grandfather of Tamil).&lt;ref&gt;Ramaswamy, Sumathi. ''Passions of the tongue: language devotion in Tamil India, 1891–1970'' p199. (1997) {{ISBN|0-520-20805-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Utthamadhanapuram Venkatasubramanian Swaminathan was born on 19 February 1855 in the village of Suriaymoolai near [[Kumbakonam]] in present-day [[Tamil Nadu]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Academic career==
Swaminatha Iyer learned Tamil literature and grammar for five years as a devoted student to Mahavidvan [[Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai]], a great poet and scholar.  He was also a beneficiary of the reputed Saiva Mutt at Thiruvavaduthurai. Tyagaraja Chettiar was the head of the Tamil Department at the [[Government Arts College, Kumbakonam]]. A student of [[Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai]], he was a man of great erudition and was held in high esteem alike by his pupils and by the public. When Chettiar retired, he recommended that Swaminatha Iyer be invited to take his place. Swaminatha Iyer was duly appointed to that post on 16 February 1880. During his tenure at the College, Swaminatha Iyer met Salem Ramaswami Mudaliar, a civil munsif who had been recently transferred to [[Kumbakonam]]. The friendship between them proved to be a turning point in Swaminatha Iyer's life. Mudaliar was responsible for persuading Iyer to edit and publish the ancient Tamil classics. Swaminatha Iyer had till then confined his enjoyment of Tamil literature to medieval works. Mudaliar also gave him a handwritten copy of ''[[Seevaga Sindhamani]]'' for publication.

==Manuscript recovery==
[[File:U. V. Swaminatha Iyer studying palm-leaf manuscripts.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Iyer studying palm leaf manuscripts]]
As the ''Civaka Cintamani'' was a [[Jain]] classic, Swaminatha Iyer went to the homes of learned member of the Jain community in Kumbakonam to get some doubts cleared. He also read the Jain epics and collated several manuscript versions and arrived at a correct conclusion. It was due to his efforts that the ''Cevaka Cintamani'' was published in 1887. From that time onwards, he began to search for [[Sangam Literature|Sangam]] classics with a view to editing and publishing them. After the ''Cevaka Cintamani'', the [[Pattupattu]] was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100305/jsp/opinion/story_12171918.jsp Telegraph India&amp;nbsp;– March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File: palm_leaf_manuscript.png|frame|Palm Leaf Manuscript]] --&gt;
Thus began Swaminatha Iyer's long search for the original texts of ancient literary works during which he regularly worked with [[C. W. Damodaram Pillai]]. It was a search that lasted until his death. Many people voluntarily parted with the manuscripts in their possession. Swaminatha Iyer visited almost every hamlet and knocked at every door. He employed all the resources at his command to get at the works. As a result, a large number of literary works which were gathering dust as [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s in lofts, storerooms, boxes and cupboards saw the light of day. Of them, the [[Cilappatikaram]], [[Manimekalai]] and [[Purananuru]] were received by Tamil lovers with a lot of enthusiasm. [[Purananuru]], which mirrored the lives of Tamils during the [[Sangam Literature|Sangam]] period, prompted scholarly research on the subject. In a span of about five decades, Swaminatha Iyer published about 100 books, including minor poems, lyrics, puranas and bhakti (devotional) works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2205/stories/20050311002109800.htm The Hindu-Frontline&amp;nbsp;– Mar 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Swaminatha Iyer retired from active teaching in 1919. His research work increased several times after retirement. He travelled from place to place in search of palm leaf manuscripts so as to edit and publish them. From 1924 to 1927, Iyer was the Principal of the Meenakshi Tamil College in [[Annamalai University]], [[Chidambaram]]. On health grounds, he resigned the post, came to Madras and continued his research.

==Contributions to Tamil music==
[[File:U. V. Swaminatha Iyer in Saiva garb.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Swaminatha Ayyar]]
Another significant contribution made by Swaminatha Iyer is in the realm of Tamil [[Carnatic music|music]]. Until Swaminatha Iyer published the [[Cilappatikaram]], [[Pattupattu]] and [[Ettuthokai]], music was a grey area in Tamil research. During the previous four centuries, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Sanskrit]] dominated the music scene in [[Tamil Nadu]] in the absence of any valuable information on Tamil music. Swaminatha Iyer's publications threw light on the presence of Tamil music in the earlier centuries and paved the way for serious research on the subject. As the son of a famous musician of his time, Swaminatha Iyer learnt music from [[Gopalakrishna Bharathi]], a musical exponent and the author of ''Nandan Sarithiram''.

==His autobiography==
Swaminatha Iyer published his autobiography, ''En Saritham'', serialised in the Tamil weekly [[Ananda Vikatan]], from January 1940 to May 1942. It was later published as a book in 1950. Running into 762 pages, the book is an excellent account of the life and times of villages, especially in the Thanjavur district in the late 19th century. The Tamil is simple and peppered with many observations on people as well as descriptions of school life, life in monasteries (Maths). The book also reveals the enormous perseverance of U V Swaminatha Iyer in his quest to master Tamil and save manuscripts.

It was due to his efforts that the world came to know the literary output of the ancient Tamils and their past. Tamil poet and nationalist [[Subramania Bharati]], who inspired the freedom movement with his songs, admired Swaminatha Iyer. Paying tribute to Swaminatha Iyer in one of his poems, Bharati equated Iyer with the sage, [[Agastya]] when he called him ''Kumbamuni''. (Agastya, who was among the first exponents of Tamil, was supposed to have been born in a ''Kumbha''—a kind of vessel—hence the name ''Kumbamuni'') and said: "So long as Tamil lives, poets will venerate you and pay obeisance to you. You will ever shine as an immortal."{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The meeting of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and the grand old man of Tamil literature in 1926 in Chennai was a historic moment. Not only did Tagore call on Swaminatha Iyer, but also penned a poem in praise of his efforts to salvage ancient classical Tamil literary works from palm leaf manuscripts.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The honorary doctoral degree (D.Litt.) was conferred on Iyer by the [[University of Madras]] in 1906. In recognition of his outstanding literary accomplishments and contributions, he was also honoured with the title, ''Mahamahopathiyaya'', literally: "Greatest of great teachers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://casi.ssc.upenn.edu/system/files/The+Classical+Language+Issue.pdf   "the Classical language issue" Economic &amp; Political Weekly&amp;nbsp;– January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, when the [[George V of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Mary of Teck|Princess of Wales]] visited [[Chennai|Madras]], a function was arranged where Swaminatha Iyer was honoured. Iyer was awarded the title of ''Dakshinathya Kalanidhi'' in 1925. In 1932, the [[University of Madras|Madras University]] awarded an honorary PhD to him in recognition of his services in the cause of Tamil. Indian Postal department issued a commemorative postage stamp on 18 February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiapost.gov.in/netscape/Stamps2006.html India Post&amp;nbsp;– Stamps 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; His house in Uthamadhanapuram has been converted as a Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/28/stories/2008042859580900.htm The Hindu&amp;nbsp;– April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venezuelan Spanish''' (''castellano venezolano'' or ''español venezolano'') refers to the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in [[Venezuela]].

Spanish was introduced in Venezuela by the [[colonizer]]s. Most of them were from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], [[Andalusia]], or the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/692307052|title=Empires of the word : a language history of the world|last=Nicholas.|first=Ostler,|date=2010|publisher=Folio Society|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=335-347|oclc=692307052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the last has been the most fundamental influence on modern Venezuelan Spanish, and [[Canarian Spanish|Canarian]] and Venezuelan accents may even be indistinguishable to other Spanish-speakers.

[[Italy|Italian]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants from the late 19th and the early 20th century have also had an influence. German settlers also left an influence when Venezuela was contracted as a concession by the King of Spain to the German Welser banking family ([[Klein-Venedig]], 1528–1546).

The Spaniards additionally brought [[Africa]]n [[slavery|slave]]s, which is the origin of expressions such as ''chévere'' ("excellent"), which comes from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''ché egberi''. Other non-Romance words came from [[indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] languages, such as ''guayoyo'' (a type of [[coffee]]) and ''caraota'' ([[black turtle bean|black bean]]).

==Features==
* Venezuelan Spanish sometimes shortens words, such as ''para'' ("for") to ''pa'''. In addition, {{IPA|/d/}} between vowels is sometimes dropped ([[elision]]): ''helado'' ("ice cream") becomes {{IPA|[eˈlao]}}. Originally from southern Spain and the Canary Islands, those traits are common to many other Spanish variations and in the Caribbean.
* Another common feature is the debuccalization of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, whereby ''adiós'' ("goodbye") becomes {{IPA|[aˈðjoh]}} and ''este'' ("east") becomes {{IPA|[ˈeht̪e]}}. It is common to most coastal areas in America, the Canary Islands, and the southern half of Spain.
* Syllable-final {{IPA|/n/}} undergoes velarisation, or {{IPA|/n/}} undergoes assimilation: ''ambientación'' {{IPA|/aNbi̯eNtaˈsi̯oN/}} ("atmosphere") becomes {{IPA|[ãŋbjẽŋt̪aˈsjõŋ]}} or {{IPA|[ãmbjẽn̪t̪aˈsjõŋ]}}.
* Also like most other American versions of Spanish, Venezuelan Spanish has ''[[yeísmo]]'' (the merger of {{IPAslink|ʎ}} and {{IPAslink|ʝ}}) and ''[[seseo]]'' ({{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are merged). That is, ''calló'' ("s/he became silent") and ''cayó'' ("s/he fell") are homophones, and ''casa'' ("house") is homophonous with ''caza'' ("hunt"). ''Seseo'' is common to all of America, the Canary Islands, and southern Spain, and ''yeísmo'' is prevalent in most Spanish dialects.
* The phoneme {{IPA|/x/}} is realized as glottal {{IPA|[h]}} in the [[Venezuelan Caribbean]], like in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia, Spanish Caribbean islands, Canary Islands, and southern Spain and sometimes in Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina.
*A characteristic common to Spanish in Venezuela, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Costa Rica is the use of the [[diminutive]] ''-ico'' and ''-ica'', instead of the standard ''-ito'' and ''-ita'' in words with ''-t'' in the last syllable: ''rata'' ("rat") becomes ''ratica'' ("little rat"). Another noteworthy diminutive is "manito," instead of the more common "manita."
* The second-person singular informal pronoun is usually ''tú'', as in most of the rest of Latin America and in Spain. That is referred to as ''[[tuteo]]''. However, in [[Zulia (state)|Zulia]] and some parts of [[Falcón (state)|Falcón]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]], it is common to find [[voseo]], the use of ''vos'' instead of ''tú''. That phenomenon is present in many other Latin American variations (notably [[Central American Spanish]] and [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]]), but Zulian ''voseo'' is ''diptongado'': conjugation preserves the [[diphthong]]s of the historical ''vos'' conjugation, which have had [[monophthongization]] in Rioplatense. The Zulian forms are thus the same as those in Spain for the second-person plural ''vosotros''): instead of ''tú eres, tú estás'', Zulian has ''vos sois, vos estáis'' (compare with the plural forms in Spain ''vosotros sois'', ''vosotros estáis'', and with Rioplatense forms, ''vos sos'', ''vos estás''). Another exception to ''tuteo'' in Venezuela is the use of the second-person singular formal pronoun ''usted'' interchangeably with ''tú'' in informal speech, unique to the states of [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]], [[Táchira (state)|Táchira]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Alvarez &amp; Ximena Barros, [http://www.linguisticahispanica.org/aam/alvarez_17.htm "Sistemas en conflicto: las formas de tratamiento en la ciudad de Mérida, Venezuela"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721094723/http://www.linguisticahispanica.org/aam/alvarez_17.htm |date=2006-07-21 }}, Lengua y Habla (2000), Mérida, Universidad de Los Andes.&lt;/ref&gt; As in most of the rest of the Americas, the only plural form of the second person is ''ustedes''.
* The word ''vaina'' is used with a variety of meanings (such as "shame," "thing or topic," or "pity") and is often interjection or a nonsensical filler.
* Venezuelan Spanish has a lot of [[List of Spanish words borrowed from Italian|Italianism]]s, [[Gallicism]]s, [[Germanism (linguistics)#Spanish|Germanisms]], and [[Anglicism]]s.

==Regional variations==
There are several subdialects of Venezuelan Spanish:
*The [[Caracas]] dialect, spoken in the capital, Caracas, is used by the media and is considered to be the standard Spanish of Venezuela, with its variants generally related to the social classes there. It is used mostly in the capital and in other areas of the country like Maracay and Valencia.
*The [[Zulia]]n {{Interlanguage link|Zulian Spanish|es|Español marabino|lt=dialect|WD=}} in the northwest of the country, also called ''maracucho'' or ''marabino'', uses ''voseo''.
*The [[Lara, Venezuela|Lara]] dialect has the older Spanish verbal inflections ''-ades'', ''-edes'', ''-odes'' gave ''-ás'', ''-és'', and ''-ós:" &lt;ref&gt;Lapesa Melgar, Rafael. 1970. [http://www.cvc.cervantes.es/obref/aih/pdf/03/aih_03_1_060.pdf ''Las formas verbales de segunda persona y los orígenes del voseo''.], in: Carlos H. Magis (ed.), ''Actas del III Congreso de la Asociación Internacional de Hispanistas'' (México, D.F., 26-31 Aug 1968). México: Colegio de México, 519-531: 525-526.&lt;/ref&gt; "vos cantáis", "vos coméis", "vos sois."
*The [[Andean Spanish|Andean]] dialect, particularly in the state of Táchira, near the Colombian border, is characterized by a nonaspirated pronunciation of 's' and use of ''usted'', instead of ''tú'', even in informal contexts. Another variant, in the states of Mérida and Trujillo, still uses ''usted'', instead of ''tú'', but has the aspirated pronunciation of {{IPA|/s/}} as a [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant]] {{IPA|[s̺]}}, also called apico-alveolar or grave, between {{IPAblink|s}} and {{IPAblink|ʃ}}. That phonetic trait, unique in the Americas, is from the large number of northern Spanish settlers in Andean Venezuela.
*The Margaritan dialect (oriental), spoken in [[Isla Margarita]] and the northeast of mainland Venezuela. The Margaritan dialect sometimes has an interdental for pre-vowel 's' and uses a strong 'r' instead of 'l' for most words.
