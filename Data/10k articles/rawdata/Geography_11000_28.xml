|Selection of astronomical bodies and objects
|}

An '''astronomical object''' or '''celestial object''' is a naturally occurring [[physical body|physical entity]], association, or structure that exists in the [[observable universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Naming Astronomical Objects |url=http://www.iau.org/public/naming/ |author=Task Group on Astronomical Designations from IAU Commission 5 |date=April 2008 |publisher=International Astronomical Union (IAU) |accessdate=4 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100802140541/http://www.iau.org/public/naming/#minorplanets| archivedate= 2 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], the terms ''object'' and ''body'' are often used interchangeably. However, an '''astronomical body''' or '''celestial body''' is a single, tightly bound, contiguous entity, while an astronomical or celestial ''object'' is a complex, less cohesively bound structure, which may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures.

Examples of astronomical objects include [[planetary system]]s, [[star cluster]]s, [[nebula]]e, and [[galaxies]], while [[asteroid]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[planet]]s, and [[star]]s are astronomical bodies. A [[comet]] may be identified as both body and object: It is a ''body'' when referring to the frozen [[Comet nucleus|nucleus]] of ice and dust, and an ''object'' when describing the entire comet with its diffuse [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] and [[Comet tail|tail]].

== Galaxy and larger ==
The [[universe]] can be viewed as having a hierarchical structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jayant V. | last=Narlikar | date=1996 | title=Elements of Cosmology | publisher=Universities Press | isbn=81-7371-043-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZgbMUypq_oC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the largest scales, the fundamental component of assembly is the [[galaxy]]. Galaxies are organized into [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters]], often within larger [[superclusters]], that are strung along great [[galaxy filament|filaments]] between nearly empty [[Void (astronomy)|voids]], forming a web that spans the observable universe.&lt;ref name=smolin1998&gt;{{cite book | first=Lee | last=Smolin | date=1998 | page=35 | title=The life of the cosmos | publisher=[[Oxford University Press US]] | isbn=0-19-512664-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

THE UNIVERSE has a variety of [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphologies]], with [[irregular galaxy|irregular]], [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and [[Disc galaxy|disk-like]] shapes, depending on their formation and evolutionary histories, including [[Interacting galaxy|interaction]] with other galaxies, which may lead to a [[Galaxy merger|merger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Buta, Ronald James |author2=Corwin, Harold G. |author3=Odewahn, Stephen C. | page=301 | date=2007 | title=The de Vaucouleurs atlas of galaxies | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=0-521-82048-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disc galaxies encompass [[lenticular galaxy|lenticular]] and [[spiral galaxies]] with features, such as [[spiral arms]] and a distinct [[Galactic halo|halo]]. At the core, most galaxies have a [[supermassive black hole]], which may result in an [[active galactic nucleus]]. Galaxies can also have satellites in the form of [[dwarf galaxies]] and [[globular cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521318874 |title=Astronomical Objects for Southern Telescopes |isbn=0521318874 |access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Within a galaxy ==
The constituents of a galaxy are formed out of gaseous matter that assembles through gravitational self-attraction in a hierarchical manner. At this level, the resulting fundamental components are the stars, which are typically assembled in clusters from the various condensing nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Elmegreen | first=Bruce G. | title=The nature and nurture of star clusters | booktitle=Star clusters: basic galactic building blocks throughout time and space, Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union, IAU Symposium | volume=266 | pages=3–13 |date=January 2010 | doi=10.1017/S1743921309990809 | bibcode=2010IAUS..266....3E |arxiv = 0910.4638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The great variety of stellar forms are determined almost entirely by the mass, composition and evolutionary state of these stars. Stars may be found in multi-star systems that orbit about each other in a hierarchical organization. A planetary system and various minor objects such as asteroids, comets and debris, can form in a hierarchical process of accretion from the [[protoplanetary disk]]s that surrounds newly formed stars.

The various distinctive types of stars are shown by the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] (H–R diagram)—a plot of absolute stellar luminosity versus surface temperature. Each star follows an [[evolutionary track]] across this diagram. If this track takes the star through a region containing an [[intrinsic variable]] type, then its physical properties can cause it to become a [[variable star]]. An example of this is the [[instability strip]], a region of the H-R diagram that includes [[Delta Scuti variable|Delta Scuti]], [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae]] and [[Cepheid variable]]s.&lt;ref name=hansen_et_al2004&gt;{{cite book
 | first=Carl J. | last=Hansen |author2=Kawaler, Steven D.|author3= Trimble, Virginia

 | series=Astronomy and astrophysics library
 | edition=2nd | publisher=Springer | date=2004
 | isbn=0-387-20089-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the initial mass of the star and the presence or absence of a companion, a star may spend the last part of its life as a [[compact star|compact object]]; either a [[white dwarf]], [[neutron star]], or [[black hole]].

| footer    = An example of the coastline paradox. If the coastline of [[Great Britain]] is measured using units {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} long, then the length of the coastline is approximately {{convert|2800|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}}. With {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} units, the total length is approximately {{convert|3400|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}}, approximately {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} longer. 
}}

The '''coastline paradox''' is the [[counterintuitive]] observation that the [[coastline]] of a [[landmass]] does not have a well-defined length. This results from the [[fractal]]-like properties of coastlines, i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a [[fractal dimension]] (which in fact makes the notion of length inapplicable). The first recorded observation of this phenomenon was by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=CoastlineParadox|title=Coastline Paradox}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was expanded upon by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature|last=Mandelbrot|first=Benoit|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Co.|date=1983|at=25–33|isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it and the degree of [[cartographic generalization]]. Since a landmass has features at all scales, from hundreds of kilometers in size to tiny fractions of a millimeter and below, there is no obvious size of the smallest feature that should be taken into consideration when measuring, and hence no single well-defined perimeter to the landmass. [[Minkowski–Bouligand dimension|Various approximations]] exist when specific assumptions are made about minimum feature size.

The problem is fundamentally different from the measurement of other, simpler edges. It is possible, for example, to accurately measure the length of a straight, idealized metal bar by using a measurement device to determine that the length is less than a certain amount and greater than another amount—that is, to measure it within a certain [[Measurement uncertainty|degree of uncertainty]]. The more accurate the measurement device, the closer results will be to the true length of the edge. When measuring a coastline, however, the issue is that the result does not increase in accuracy for an increase in measurement —it only increases; unlike with the metal bar, there is no way to obtain a maximum value for the length of the coastline.

== Mathematical aspects ==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
The basic concept of [[length]] originates from [[Euclidean distance]]. In Euclidean geometry, a straight line represents the [[Geodesic|shortest distance between two points]]. This line has only one length. On the surface of a sphere, this is replaced by the [[geodesic]] length (also called the [[great circle]] length), which is measured along the surface curve that exists in the plane containing both endpoints and the center of the sphere. The [[Arc length|length of basic curves]] is more complicated but can also be calculated. Measuring with rulers, one can approximate the length of a curve by adding the sum of the straight lines which connect the points:

[[File:Arclength.svg|330px|center]]

Using a few straight lines to approximate the length of a curve will produce an estimate lower than the true length; when increasingly short (and thus more numerous) lines are used, the sum approaches the curve's true length. A precise value for this length can be found using [[calculus]], the branch of mathematics enabling the calculation of infinitely small distances. The following animation illustrates how a [[Smooth function|smooth]] curve can be meaningfully assigned a precise length:

[[File:Arc length.gif|center]]

However, not all curves can be measured in this way. A [[fractal]] is, by definition, a curve whose complexity changes with measurement scale. Whereas approximations of a smooth curve [[Limit of a sequence|tend]] to a single value as measurement precision increases, the measured value for a fractal does not converge.

{{multiple image
| align = center
| footer   = This [[Sierpiński curve]] (a type of [[Space-filling curve]]), which repeats the same pattern on a smaller and smaller scale, continues to increase in length. If understood to iterate within an infinitely subdivisible geometric space, its length tends to infinity. At the same time, the ''area'' enclosed by the curve ''does'' converge to a precise figure—just as, analogously, the [[land mass]] of an island can be calculated more easily than the length of its coastline.
| width    = 66
| image1   = Sierpiński curve order 1.svg

| image4   = Sierpiński curve order 4.svg
| alt4     = S4
| image5   = Sierpiński curve order 5.svg
| alt5     = S5
}}

As the length of a fractal curve always diverges to infinity, if one were to measure a coastline with infinite or near-infinite resolution, the length of the infinitely short kinks in the coastline would add up to infinity.&lt;ref&gt;Post &amp; Eisen, p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this figure relies on the assumption that space can be subdivided into infinitesimal sections. The truth value of this assumption—which underlies Euclidean geometry and serves as a useful model in everyday measurement—is a matter of philosophical speculation, and may or may not reflect the changing realities of "space" and "distance" on the [[atom]]ic level (approximately the scale of a [[nanometer]]). For instance, the [[Planck length]], many orders of magnitude smaller than an atom, is proposed as the smallest measurable unit possible in the universe.

Coastlines are less definite in their construction than idealized fractals such as the [[Mandelbrot set]] because they are formed by various natural events that create patterns in [[statistically random]] ways, whereas idealized fractals are formed through repeated iterations of simple, formulaic sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz-Otto Peitgen, Hartmut Jürgens, Dietmar Saupe, ''Chaos and Fractals: New Frontiers of Science''; Spring, 2004; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LDCkFOkD2IIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA424 424].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practicality ==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}

In actuality, the concept of an infinite fractal is not applicable to a coastline; as progressively more accurate measurement devices are used (with the measurement result growing every time), other, practical problems with measurement emerge. 
* The sea is in constant motion, meaning there is no fixed "coastline".
* ''Even if'' the sea's movement could be halted while measurement took place, there would be no way (beyond arbitrary decisions) to define where the coastline lies in terms of river outflow. A measurement including the entire banks of every river that extends into a landmass would conflict with many interpretations of a coastline, yet no established technique exists for selecting an arbitrary line where river becomes sea.
* ''Even if'' the issue of rivers were overcome, it would still be impossible to decide which the boundary between land and water is, as land may be wet but not submerged.
* ''Even if'' such a definition could be agreed upon, as increasingly accurate measurement is performed, the problem of measuring the boundary of an atom—which ultimately does not have a defined boundary—arises. Even in the [[Bohr model|classical model of an atom]], which assumes atoms are composed of individual solid particles, most of an atom is made up of the space between these particles. This problem is further exacerbated when other, more modern models of the atom are considered.

Critical geography is one variant of&amp;nbsp;[[Critical theory|critical social science and humanities]]&amp;nbsp;that adopt&amp;nbsp;[[Karl Marx|Marx]]’s thesis to interpret and change the world. Fay (1987) defines contemporary critical science as the effort to understand the&amp;nbsp;[[oppression]]&amp;nbsp;in a society and use this understanding to promote societal change and liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_social_science.html?id=5K98AAAAIAAJ|title=Critical social science: liberation and its limits|last=Fay|first=Brian|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780801494581|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agger (1998) identifies a number of features of critical social theory practiced in fields like geography, which include: a rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[positivism]]; an endorsement of the possibility of progress; a claim for the structural dynamics of&amp;nbsp;[[Social dominance theory|domination]]; an argument that dominance derived from forms of false consciousness, ideology, and myth; a faith in the agency of everyday change and self-transformation and an attendant rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[determinism]]; and a rejection of revolutionary expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_Social_Theories.html?id=eB-B6XercZoC|title=Critical Social Theories: An Introduction|last=Agger|first=Ben|publisher=Avalon Publishing|year=1988|isbn=9780813321745|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Critical geography in the Anglo-American world rooted in the&amp;nbsp;'''radical geography'''&amp;nbsp;that emerged in the early 1970s. Peet (2000) provides an overview of the evolution of radical and critical geography.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peet|first=Richard|year=2000|title=Celebrating Thirty Years of Radical Geography|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=32|issue=6|pages=951–953|doi=10.1068/a32202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, radical geographers tried to transform the scope of the discipline of geography by responding to the great issues of the time - civil rights, environmental pollution, and war. From the mid- to late-1970s saw ascending critiques of the&amp;nbsp;[[quantitative revolution]]&amp;nbsp;and the adoption of&amp;nbsp;[[Marxism|Marxist]]&amp;nbsp;approach. The 1980s is marked by fissures between humanistic, feminist and Marxist streams, and a reversal of structural excess. In the late 1980s, critical geography emerged and gradually became a self-identified field.

Although closely related, critical geography and radical geography are not interchangeable. Critical geography has two crucial departures from radical geography: (1) a rejection of the structural excess of&amp;nbsp;[[Marxism]], in accordance with the&amp;nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]]; and (2) an increasing interest in culture and&amp;nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]], in contrast to radical geography’s focus on the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Peet (2000) notices a rapprochement between critical and radical geography after heated debate in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nevertheless, Castree (2000) posits that critical and radical geography entail different commitments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He contends that the eclipse of radical geography indicates the professionalization and academicization of Left geography, and therefore worries about the loss of the "radical" tradition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Common themes ==
As a consequence of the&amp;nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]], critical geography doesn’t have a unified commitment. Hubbard, Kitchin, Bartley, and Fuller (2002) asserts that critical geography has a diverse&amp;nbsp;[[epistemology]],&amp;nbsp;[[ontology]], and&amp;nbsp;[[methodology]], and does not have a distinctive theoretical identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=71SvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=thinking+geographically#v=onepage&amp;q=thinking%20geographically&amp;f=false|title=Thinking Geographically: Space, Theory and Contemporary Human Geography|last=Hubbard|first=Phil|last2=Bartley|first2=Brendan|last3=Fuller|first3=Duncan|last4=Kitchin|first4=Rob|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2002|isbn=9780567259882|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Blomley (2006) identifies six common themes of critical geography,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blomley|first=Nicholas|year=2006|title=Uncritical critical geography?|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–94|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph593pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing:
# '''A commitment to theory and a rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[empiricism]].'''&amp;nbsp;Critical geographers consciously deploy theories of some form, but they draw from a variety of theoretical wells, such as&amp;nbsp;[[political economy]],&amp;nbsp;[[governmentality]],&amp;nbsp;[[feminism]],&amp;nbsp;[[anti-racism]], and&amp;nbsp;[[anti-imperialism]].
# '''A commitment to reveal the processes that produce&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequalities]]'''. Critical geographers seek to unveil&amp;nbsp;[[Power (social and political)|power]], uncover&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]], expose resistance, and cultivate liberating politics and&amp;nbsp;[[social change]]s.
# '''An emphasis on&amp;nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]]&amp;nbsp;as a means of domination and resistance'''. A common focus of critical geography is to study how representations of space sustain power; or on the contrary, how representations of space can be used to challenge power.
# '''An optimistic faith in the power of critical scholarship'''. Critical geographers believe that scholarship can be used to resist the dominant representations, and scholar can undo power domination and free the oppressed. There exists an implicit confidence in the power of critical scholarship to reach the ignorant, and in the capacities of people to defeat alienation by means of reflexive self-education.
# '''A commitment to progressive practices'''. Critical geographers want to make a difference. They claim to be united with&amp;nbsp;[[social movement]]s&amp;nbsp;and activists with commitments to&amp;nbsp;[[social justice]]. The relationship between critical geography and&amp;nbsp;[[activism]]&amp;nbsp;has been much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Radical_Theory_critical_Praxis.html?id=zGabDAEACAAJ|title=Radical Theory/critical Praxis: Making a Difference Beyond the Academy?|last=Fuller|first=Duncan|last2=Kitchin|first2=Rob|publisher=Praxis (e)Press|year=2004|isbn=9780973456103|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''An understanding of&amp;nbsp;[[space]]&amp;nbsp;as a critical tool.'''&amp;nbsp;Critical geographers pay special attention to how spatial arrangements and representations can be used to produce&amp;nbsp;[[oppression]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]]. Critical geographers identify to varying degrees how space can be used as both a veil and tool of power.

== Critiques ==
A few important questions remain unsolved in critical geography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first one is that there has been relatively limited discussion over the shared commitments of critical geographers, with a few exceptions such as Harvey (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Spaces_of_Hope.html?id=W00VHZg3u2MC|title=Spaces of Hope|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|isbn=9780520225787|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question such as "what are geographers critical of", and "to what end" needs to be answered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Barnes (2002) comments that critical geographers are better at providing explanatory diagnoses than offering anticipatory-utopian imaginations to reconfigure the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Trevor J.|year=2002|title=Critical notes on economic geography from an aging radical. Or radical notes on economic geography from a critical age|url=https://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/acme/article/view/687|journal=ACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–14|issn=1492-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second question concerns the institutionalization of critical geography. Even though critical geographers conceive themselves as rebels and outsiders, critical thinking has become prevalent in geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/maps-and-chaps-7142744|title=Maps and Chaps|last=Byles|first=Jeff|date=2001-07-31|work=Village Voice|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical geography is now situated at the very heart of the discipline of geography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some see institutionalization as a natural result of the analytical strength and insights of critical geography, while others fear that institutionalization has entailed cooperation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The question is whether critical geography still holds its commitment to political change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lastly, as critical geography is practiced across the world, the insights of critical geographers outside the Anglophone world should be better acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bialasiewicz|first=Luiza|year=2003|title=The Many Wor(l)ds of Difference and Dissent|journal=Antipode|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00299|issn=1467-8330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Mizuoka et al. (2005) offered an overview of Japanese critical geography praxis since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mizuoka|first=Fujio|last2=Mizuuchi|first2=Toshio|last3=Hisatake|first3=Tetsuya|last4=Tsutsumi|first4=Kenji|last5=Fujita|first5=Tetsushi|year=2005|title=The Critical Heritage of Japanese Geography: Its Tortured Trajectory for Eight Decades|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=453–473|doi=10.1068/d2204r}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, critical geography should also forge stronger linkage with critical scholars in other disciplines.

'''''Currie''''' is a [[surname]] in the [[English language]]. The name has numerous origins.

==Etymology==

In some cases it originated as an [[habitational name]], derived from [[Currie]] in [[Midlothian]], [[Scotland]]. In other cases it originated as a habitational name, derived from [[Corrie family|Corrie]], in [[Dumfriesshire]], Scotland. A third origin for the surname is that it originated as a Scottish spelling of the Irish surname ''[[Curry (surname)|Curry]]'', a surname which has several origins.&lt;ref name="ancestry"/&gt; A fourth origin of the surname, particularly on [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], is as an [[Anglicised]] form of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''[[MacMhuirich (surname)|MacMhuirich]]''.&lt;ref name="ancestry"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ancestry.com/learn/facts/default.aspx? |title=Learn about the family history of your surname |publisher=[[Ancestry.com]] |accessdate=22 December 2010}}, which cited: {{citation |title=Dictionary of American Family Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-508137-4 }}, for the surname "Currie", "Curry".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black-569"&gt;{{citation |last=Black |first=George Fraser |title=The Surnames of Scotland: Their Origin, Meaning, and History |publisher=[[New York Public Library]] |location=New York |year=1946 |page=569 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebridean ''MacMhuirich'' evolved in such a way that the forms ''McVurich'' and ''McCurrie'' first appeared in the 17th century, and by the 18th century Currie is found on [[Islay]], and on [[Uist]] by the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Grimble|first=Ian|title=Scottish Clans and Tartans|publisher=Hamlyn|publication-place=London|year=1977|isbn=0-600-31935-0|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another origin of the surname is from Curry, in [[Somerset]], [[England]]. In some cases the name may also be derived from the [[Old French]] ''curie'', which means "[[kitchen]]".&lt;ref name="Reaney-121"/&gt;

Early forms of the surname include: ''æt Curi'', in about 1075; and ''de Cury'', in 1212. Both forms are derived from the place name in Somerset. Other early forms include: ''atte Curie'', in SRS 1327; and ''atte Corye''. Early forms of the surname, derived from a Scottish place name, is ''de Curry'', in 1179;&lt;ref name="Reaney-121"&gt;{{Citation |last=Reaney |first=Percy Hilde |editor-last=Wilson |editor-first=Richard Middlewood |title=A Dictionary of English Surnames |edition=3rd |year=1995 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-863146-4 |page=121 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''de Curri'', in 1210. An early form of the surname, when derived from ''MacMhuirich'' is ''M'Currie'' and ''Currie'', in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="Black-193194"&gt;{{citation |last=Black |first=George Fraser |title=The Surnames of Scotland: Their Origin, Meaning, and History |publisher=[[New York Public Library]] |location=New York |year=1946 |pages=193–194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be a Sept of [[Clan Donald]] or [[Clan Macpherson]].

Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of [[manganese nodule|polymetallic nodules]] or active and extinct [[hydrothermal vent]]s at {{convert|1400|to|3700|m}} below the ocean’s surface.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1009963912171|title=Environmental risk assessment of anthropogenic activity in the deep-sea| year = 2000| last1 = Ahnert | first1 = A. | journal = Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Stress and Recovery| volume = 7| issue = 4| pages = 299–315| last2 = Borowski | first2 = C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vents create globular or [[seafloor massive sulfide deposits|massive sulfide deposits]], which contain valuable metals such as [[silver]], [[gold]], [[copper]], [[manganese]], [[cobalt]], and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name=Halfar&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1138289| title = ECOLOGY: Danger of Deep-Sea Mining| journal = Science| volume = 316| issue = 5827| pages = 987| year = 2007| last1 = Halfar | first1 = J.| last2 = Fujita | first2 = R.

P.| pmid=17832066}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposits are mined using either hydraulic pumps or bucket systems that take ore to the surface to be processed. As with all mining operations, deep sea mining raises questions about its potential environmental impact. Environmental advocacy groups such as Greenpeace and the Deep sea Mining Campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/report/|title = Out of Our Depth: Mining the Ocean Floor in Papua New Guinea|date = November 2011|accessdate = December 2015|website = Deep Sea Mining Campaign|publisher = MiningWatch Canada, CELCoR, Packard Foundation|last = Rosenbaum|first = Dr. Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that seabed mining should not be permitted in most of the world's oceans because of the potential for damage to deepsea ecosystems and pollution by heavy metal laden plumes.&lt;ref name=Halfar/&gt;

==Brief history==

In the 1960s the prospect of deep-sea mining was brought up by the publication of J. L. Mero's ''Mineral Resources of the Sea''.&lt;ref name=Glasby/&gt; The book claimed that nearly limitless supplies of cobalt, [[nickel]] and other 
metals could be found throughout the planet's oceans. Mero stated that these metals occurred in deposits of [[manganese nodules]], which appear as lumps of compressed flowers on the seafloor at 
depths of about 5,000 m. Some nations including [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] sent out research vessels in search of nodule deposits. One such vessel was the [[Glomar Explorer]]. Initial estimates of deep sea mining viability turned out to be much exaggerated. This overestimate, coupled with depressed metal prices, led to the near abandonment of nodule mining by 1982. From the 1960s to 1984 an estimated US $650 million had 
been spent on the venture, with little to no return.&lt;ref name=Glasby/&gt;

Over the past decade a new phase of deep-sea mining has begun. Rising demand for precious metals in [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[India]] has pushed these countries in search of new sources. Interest has recently shifted toward hydrothermal vents as the source of metals instead of scattered nodules. The trend of transition towards an electricity-based information and transportation infrastructure currently seen in western societies further pushes demands for precious metals. The current revived interest in phosphorus nodule mining at the seafloor stems from phosphor-based artificial fertilizers being of significant importance for world food production. Growing world population pushes the need for artificial fertilizers or greater incorporation of organic systems within agricultural infrastructure.

Currently, the best potential deep sea site, the Solwara 1 Project, has been found in the waters off [[Papua New Guinea]], a high grade copper-gold resource and the world's first Seafloor Massive Sulphide (SMS) resource.&lt;ref name="naut"/&gt; The Solwara 1 Project is located at 1600 metres water depth in the [[Bismarck Sea]], [[New Ireland Province]].&lt;ref name="naut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilusminerals.com/s/Projects-Solwara.asp|title=Solwara 1 Project – High Grade Copper and Gold|year=2010|publisher=Nautilus Minerals Inc|accessdate=14 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812102807/http://www.nautilusminerals.com/s/Projects-Solwara.asp|archivedate=12 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ROV ([[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s) technology developed by UK-based Soil Machine Dynamics, Nautilus Minerals Inc. is first company of its kind to announce plans to begin full-scale undersea excavation of mineral deposits.&lt;ref name=treasure&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/8312172 "Treasure on the ocean floor"]. ''Economist'' 381, no. 8506: 10. (30 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However a dispute with the government of Papua-New Guinea delayed production and its now scheduled to commence commercial operations in early 2018.&lt;ref name="naut"/&gt;

===Laws and regulations===

The international law–based regulations on deep sea mining are contained in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea]] from 1973 to 1982, which came into force in 1994.&lt;ref name=Halfar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glasby/&gt; The convention set up the [[International Seabed Authority]] (ISA), which regulates nations’ deep sea mining ventures outside each nations’ [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} area surrounding coastal nations). The ISA requires nations interested in mining to explore two equal mining sites and turn one over to the ISA, along with a transfer of mining technology over a 10- to 20-year period. This seemed reasonable at the time because it was widely believed that nodule mining would be extremely profitable. However, these strict requirements led some industrialized countries to refuse to sign the initial treaty in 1982.&lt;ref name=Glasby/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nath, B. 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/10641190051092993| title = Environment and Deep-Sea Mining: A Perspective| journal = Marine Georesources and Geotechnology| volume = 18| issue = 3| pages = 285–294| year = 2000| last1 = Sharma | first1 = B. N. N. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the EEZ of nation states seabed mining comes under the jurisdiction of national laws.  Despite extensive exploration both within and outside of EEZs, only a few countries, notably New Zealand, have established legal and institutional frameworks for the future development of deep seabed mining.

Papua New Guinea was the first country to approve a permit for the exploration of minerals in the deep seabed. Solwara 1 was awarded its licence and environmental permits despite three independent reviews of the environmental impact statement mine finding significant gaps and flaws in the underlying science ( see http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/report/).

The ISA has recently arranged a workshop in Australia where scientific experts, industry representatives, legal specialists and academics worked towards improving existing regulations and ensuring that development of seabed minerals does not cause serious and permanent damage to the marine environment.

==Resources mined==

The deep sea contains many different resources available for extraction, including silver, gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and zinc. These raw materials are found in various forms on the sea floor, usually in higher concentrations than terrestrial mines.

Diamonds are also mined from the seabed by De Beers and others. Nautilus Minerals Inc and Neptune Minerals are planning to mine the offshore waters of Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Oancea, Dan (November 6, 2006). [http://technology.infomine.com/articles/1/99/deep-sea-mining.undersea-miners.black-smoker/deep-sea.mining.and.aspx Deep-Sea Mining and Exploration]. technology.infomine.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraction methods==

[[Recent technological advancements]] have given rise to the use [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|remotely operated vehicles]] (ROVs) to collect mineral samples from prospective mine sites. Using drills and other cutting tools, the ROVs obtain samples to be analyzed for precious materials. Once a site has been located, a mining ship or station is set up to mine the area.&lt;ref name=treasure/&gt;

There are two predominant forms of mineral extraction being considered for full-scale operations: continuous-line bucket system (CLB) and the hydraulic suction system. The CLB system is the preferred method of nodule collection. It operates much like a conveyor-belt, running from the sea floor to the surface of the ocean where a ship or mining platform extracts the desired minerals, and returns the [[tailings]] to the ocean.&lt;ref name="Nath, B. 2000"/&gt; Hydraulic suction mining lowers a pipe to the seafloor which transfers nodules up to the mining ship. Another pipe from the ship to the seafloor returns the tailings to the area of the mining site.&lt;ref name="Nath, B. 2000"/&gt;

In recent years, the most promising mining areas have been the Central and Eastern Manus Basin around Papua New Guinea and the crater of Conical Seamount to the east. These locations have shown promising amounts of gold in the area's sulfide deposits (an average of 26 [[parts per million]]). The relatively shallow water depth of 1050 m, along with the close proximity of a gold processing plant makes for an excellent mining site.&lt;ref name=Glasby/&gt;

Deep sea mining project value chain can be differentiated using the criteria of the type of activities where the value is actually added. During prospecting, exploration and resource assessment phases the value is added to intangible assets, for the extraction, processing and distribution phases the value increases with relation to product processing. There is an intermediate phase – the pilot mining test which could be considered to be an inevitable step in the shift from “resources” to “reserves” classification, where the actual value starts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Abramowski, T. (2016). [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9MrbaTtwGLmclpCaW54ZmgtVGM/view?usp=sharing Value chain of deep seabed mining], Article in the book: Deep sea mining value chain: organization, technology and development, pp 9-18, Interoceanmetal Joint Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration phase involves such operations as locating, sea bottom scanning and sampling using technologies such as echo-sounders, side scan sonars, deep-towed photography, ROVs, AUVs. The resource valuation incorporates the examination of data in the context of potential mining feasibility. 

Value chain based on product processing involves such operations as actual mining (or extraction), vertical transport, storing, offloading, transport, metallurgical processing for final products. Unlike the exploration phase, the value increases after each operation on processed material eventually delivered to the metal market. Logistics involves technologies analogous to those applied in land mines. This is also the case for the metallurgical processing, although rich and polymetallic mineral composition which distinguishes marine minerals from its land analogs requires special treatment of the deposit. Environmental monitoring and impact assessment analysis relate to the temporal and spatial discharges of the mining system if they occur, sediment plumes, disturbance to the benthic environment and the analysis of the regions affected by seafloor machines. The step involves an examination of disturbances near the seafloor, as well as disturbances near the surface. Observations include baseline comparisons for the sake of quantitative impact assessments for ensuring the sustainability of the mining process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Environmental impacts==
Research shows that polymetallic nodule fields are hotspots of abundance and diversity for a highly vulnerable abyssal fauna.&lt;ref name="ugent"&gt;[https://www.ugent.be/en/news/bulletin/polymetallic-nodule-fields-are-required-to-preserve-abyssal-fauna University of Ghent press bulletin, June 7, 2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614163834/https://www.ugent.be/en/news/bulletin/polymetallic-nodule-fields-are-required-to-preserve-abyssal-fauna |date=June 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because deep sea mining is a relatively new field, the complete consequences of full-scale mining operations on this ecosystem are unknown. However, some researchers have said they believe that removal of parts of the sea floor will result in disturbances to the [[benthic zone|benthic layer]], increased [[toxicity]] of the [[water column]] and sediment plumes from [[tailings]].&lt;ref name=Halfar/&gt;&lt;ref name="ugent" /&gt; Removing parts of the sea floor could disturb the habitat of [[benthos|benthic organisms]], with unknown long-term effects.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt; Aside from the direct impact of mining the area, some researchers and environmental activists have raised concerns about leakage, spills and [[corrosion]] that could alter the mining area’s chemical makeup.

Among the impacts of deep sea mining, sediment plumes could have the greatest impact. Plumes are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles floating in the water. Two types of plumes occur: near bottom plumes and surface plumes.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt; Near bottom plumes occur when the tailings are pumped back down to the mining site. The floating particles increase the [[turbidity]], or cloudiness, of the water, clogging [[Filter feeder|filter-feeding]] apparatuses used by benthic organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/10641190500446698| title = Deep-Sea Impact Experiments and their Future Requirements| journal = Marine Georesources &amp; Geotechnology| volume = 23| issue = 4| pages = 331–338| year = 2005| last1 = Sharma | first1 = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface plumes cause a more serious problem. Depending on the size of the particles and water currents the plumes could spread over vast areas.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nath, B. 2000"/&gt; The plumes could impact [[zooplankton]] and light penetration, in turn affecting the [[food web]] of the area.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nath, B. 2000"/&gt;

==Controversy ==
An article in the [[Harvard Environmental Law Review]] in April 2018 argued that "the 'new global gold rush' of deep sea mining shares many features with past resource scrambles – including a general disregard for environmental and social impacts, and the marginalisation of indigenous peoples and their rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://harvardelr.com/2018/04/16/broadening-common-heritage/#_ftn3|title=Broadening Common Heritage: Addressing Gaps in the Deep Sea Mining Regulatory Regime|date=2018-04-16|work=Harvard Environmental Law Review|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/deep-sea-mining-possibly-as-damaging-as-land-mining-lawyers-say|title=Deep-sea mining possibly as damaging as land mining, lawyers say|last=Doherty|first=Ben|date=2018-04-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foreshore and Seabed Act (2004) ignited fierce indigenous opposition in New Zealand, as its claiming of the seabed for the Crown in order to open it up to mining conflicted with Māori claims to their customary lands, who protested the Act as a "sea grab." Later, this act was repealed after an investigation from the UN Commission on Human Rights upheld charges of discrimination. The Act was subsequently repealed and replaced with the Marine and Coastal Area Bill (2011).&lt;ref&gt;DeLoughrey, Elizabeth. “Ordinary Futures: Interspecies Worldings in the Anthropocene.” Global Ecologies and the Environmental Humanities; Postcolonial Approaches.

Organizations like the [http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/about/ Deep Sea Mining Campaign] and Alliance of Solwara Warriors, comprising 20 communities in the Bismarck and Solomon Sea, are examples of organizations that are seeking to ban seabed mining in Papua New Guinea, where the Solwara 1 project is set to occur, and in the Pacific. They argue primarily that decision-making about deep sea mining has not adequately addressed Free Prior and Informed Consent from affected communities and have not adhered to the [[Precautionary principle|Precautionary Principle]], a rule proposed by the 1982 UN World Charter for Nature which informs the ISA regulatory framework for mineral exploitation of the deep sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/about/|title=About the Deep Sea Mining campaign {{!}} Deep Sea Mining: Out Of Our Depth|website=www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{not to be confused with|Tectonic erosion}}
The interaction between '''erosion and tectonics''' has been a topic of debate since the early 1990s. While the [[Tectonics|tectonic effects]] on surface processes such as [[erosion]] have long been recognized (for example, river formation as a result of [[tectonic uplift]]), the opposite (erosional effects on tectonic activity) has only recently been addressed.&lt;ref name=TCLE&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last1=Willett|editor-first1=Sean D. |editor-first2=Niels |editor-last2=Hovius|editor-first3=Mark T. |editor-last3=Brandon |editor-first4=Donald M. |display-editors = 3 |editor-last4=Fisher |title=Tectonics, Climate and Landscape Evolution|journal=Geological Society of America|year=2006|volume=398|url=http://specialpapers.gsapubs.org/content/398}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary questions surrounding this topic are what types of interactions exist between erosion and tectonics and what are the implications of these interactions. While this is still a matter of debate, one thing is clear, the Earth's landscape is a product of two factors: [[tectonics]], which can create topography and maintain relief through surface and rock uplift, and [[climate]], which mediates the erosional processes that wear away upland areas over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whittaker|first=Alexander C.|title=How do landscapes record tectonics and climate?|journal=Lithosphere|year=2012 |volume=4|issue=2|pages=160–164 |doi=10.1130/RF.L003.1|bibcode = 2012Lsphe...4..160W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction of these processes can form, modify, or destroy [[geomorphic]] features on the Earth’s surface.

==Tectonic processes==
The term [[tectonics]] refers to the study of the Earth's surface structure and the ways in which it changes over time. Tectonic processes typically occur at plate boundaries which are one of three types: [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], or [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]].&lt;ref name=VM&gt;{{cite book|last2=Marshak|first1=Ben A. |last1=van der Pluijm|first2= Stephan|title=Earth structure : an introduction to structural geology and tectonics|year=2004|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-92467-X|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes form and modify the topography of the Earth's surface, effectively increasing relief through the mechanisms of [[Post-glacial rebound|isostatic uplift]], crustal thickening, and [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] in the form of [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]]. Increased elevations, in relation to regional base levels, lead to steeper river channel gradients and an increase in orographically localized precipitation, ultimately resulting in drastically increased erosion rates. The topography, and general relief, of a given area determines the velocity at which [[surface runoff]] will flow, ultimately determining the potential erosive power of the runoff. Longer, steeper slopes are more prone to higher rates of erosion during periods of heavy rainfall than shorter, gradually sloping areas. Thus, large mountain ranges, and other areas of high relief, formed through tectonic uplift will have significantly higher rates of erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Perrow|editor-first1= Martin R.|volume=1|chapter=Principles of Restoration|title=Handbook of ecological restoration|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-521-04983-2|edition=Digitally printed version.|editor-first2=Davy|editor-last2= Anthony J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, tectonics can directly influence erosion rates on a short timescale, as is clear in the case of [[earthquakes]], which can trigger landslides and weaken surrounding rock through seismic disturbances.

While [[tectonic uplift]] in any case will lead to some form of increased elevation, thus higher rates of erosion, a primary focus is set on isostatic uplift as it provides a fundamental connection between the causes and effects of erosional-tectonic interactions.

===Isostatic uplift===

Understanding the principle of [[isostasy]] is a key element to understanding the interactions and feedbacks shared between erosion and tectonics. The principle of isostasy states that when free to move vertically, lithosphere floats at an appropriate level in the asthenosphere so that the pressure at a depth of compensation in the asthenosphere well below the base of the lithosphere is the same.&lt;ref name=VM /&gt; Isostatic uplift is both a cause and an effect of erosion. When deformation occurs in the form of crustal thickening an isostatic response is induced causing the thickened crust to sink, and surrounding thinner crust to uplift. The resulting surface uplift leads to enhanced elevations, which in turn induces erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last2=Rushmer|editor-first1=Michael|editor-last1= Brown|editor-first2= Tracy|title=Evolution and differentiation of the continental crust|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0521782376|pages=74–92|edition=Digitally printed version with corrections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, when a large amount of material is eroded away from the Earth's surface uplift occurs in order to maintain isostatic equilibrium. Because of isostasy, high erosion rates over significant horizontal areas can effectively suck up material from the lower crust and/or upper mantle. This process is known as ''isostatic rebound'' and is analogous to Earth's response following the removal of large glacial ice sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.unt.edu/~williams/geog_3350/examreviews/exam1images/Fg17_004.jpg |title=Isostatic uplift and erosion cross section}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isostatic uplift and corresponding erosion are responsible for the formation of regional-scale geologic features as well as localized structures. Two such examples include:[[File:river anticline by, Michael Stevens.pdf|thumb|Formation of a river anticline]]
* '''[[Shield (geology)|Continental shields]]'''- Generally large areas of low relief (&lt;100 m) in the Earth's crust where [[Precambrian]] crystalline [[igneous]] and high-grade [[metamorphic]] rocks are exposed.&lt;ref name=VM /&gt; Shields are considered tectonically stable areas in comparison to the activity occurring at their margins and the boundaries between plates, but their formation required large amounts of tectonic activity and erosion. Shields, along with stable platforms, are the basic tectonic components of continents, therefore understanding their development is critical to understanding the development of other surface features on Earth. Initially, a mountain belt is formed at a convergent plate margin. Transformation of a mountain belt to a shield is majorly dependent on two factors: (1) erosion of the mountain belt by running water and (2) isostatic adjustment resulting from the removal of surface rock due to erosion. This process of erosion followed by isostatic adjustment continues until the system is at isostatic equilibrium. At this point large-scale erosion can no longer occur because the surface has eroded down to nearly sea-level and uplift ceases due to the system's state of equilibrium.&lt;ref name=VM /&gt;&lt;ref name=EDS /&gt;
* '''[[River anticlines]]'''- Geologic structures formed through the focused uplift of rock underlying confined areas of high erosion (''i.e.'', rivers). Isostatic rebound resulting from the rapid removal of overlying rock, via erosion, causes the weakened areas of crustal rock to uplift from the apex of the river. In order for the development of these structures to occur the erosion rate of the river must exceed both the average erosional rate of the area, and the rate of uplift of the orogen. The two factors influencing the development of these structures are stream power of the associated river and the [[flexural rigidity]] of the crust in the area. The combination of increased stream power with decreased flexural rigidity results in the system's progression from a transverse anticline to a river anticline.&lt;ref name="mont"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montgomery|first1=David R.|last2=Stolar|first2= Drew B.|title=Reconsidering Himalayan river anticlines|journal=Geomorphology|date=1 December 2006|volume=82|issue=1–2|pages=4–15|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2005.08.021|bibcode = 2006Geomo..82....4M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Channel flow===

Channel flow describes the process through which hot, [[Viscosity|viscous]] crustal material flows horizontally between the upper crust and lithospheric mantle, and is eventually pushed to the surface. This model aims to explain features common to metamorphic [[hinterlands]] of some [[Orogeny|collisional orogens]], most notably the [[Himalaya]]–[[Tibetan plateau]] system. In mountainous areas with heavy rainfall (thus, high erosion rates) deeply incising rivers will form. As these rivers wear away the Earth's surface two things occur: (1) pressure is reduced on the underlying rocks effectively making them weaker and (2) the underlying material moves closer to the surface. This reduction of crustal strength, coupled with the erosional [[Tectonic uplift#Uplift vs. exhumation|exhumation]], allows for the diversion of the underlying channel flow toward the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Godin|first=L.|last2=Grujic|first2= D.|last3= Law|first3= R. D.|last4=Searle|first4=M.

==Erosional processes==
{{see also|Hillslope evolution}}
[[File:KharazaArch.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[natural arch]] produced by erosion of differentially weathered rock in Jebel Kharaz ([[Jordan]])]]
The term [[erosion]] refers to the group of natural processes, including [[weathering]], dissolution, abrasion, corrosion, and transportation, by which material is worn away from the Earth's surface to be transported and deposited in other locations.
* '''Differential erosion'''- Erosion that occurs at irregular or varying rates, caused by the differences in the resistance and hardness of surface materials; softer and weaker rocks are rapidly worn away, whereas harder and more resistant rocks remain to form ridges, hills, or mountains. Differential erosion, along with the tectonic setting, are two of the most important controls on the evolution of continental landscapes on Earth.&lt;ref name=EDS&gt;{{cite book|last2=Christiansen|first1=W. Kenneth |last1=Hamblin; |first2=Eric H.|title=Earth's dynamic systems|year=2004|publisher=Pearson, Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. [u.a]|isbn=0131420666|edition=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feedback of erosion on tectonics is given by the transportation of surface, or near-surface, mass (rock, soil, sand, [[regolith]], etc.) to a new location.&lt;ref name=TCLE /&gt; This redistribution of material can have profound effects on the state of gravitational stresses in the area, dependent on the magnitude of mass transported. Because tectonic processes are highly dependent on the current state of gravitational stresses, redistribution of surface material can lead to tectonic activity.&lt;ref name=TCLE /&gt; While erosion in all of its forms, by definition, wears away material from the Earth's surface, the process of mass wasting as a product of deep [[fluvial]] incision has the highest tectonic implications.

===Mass wasting===

{{Main|Mass wasting}}[[File:TalusConesIsfjorden.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Scree|Talus cones]] produced by mass wasting, north shore of [[Isfjord (Svalbard)|Isfjord]], [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]].]]
Mass wasting is the geomorphic process by which surface material move downslope typically as a mass, largely under the force of gravity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=James S. |last1=Monroe|first2= Reed |last2=Wicander.|title=The changing Earth : exploring geology and evolution|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole|location=Australia|isbn=0-495-01020-0|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; As rivers flow down steeply sloping mountains, deep channel incision occurs as the river's flow wears away the underlying rock. Large channel incision progressively decreases the amount of gravitational force needed for a slope failure event to occur, eventually resulting in mass wasting.&lt;ref name=TCLE /&gt; Removal of large amounts of surface mass in this fashion will induce an isostatic response resulting in uplift until equilibrium is reached.

===Effects on structural evolution===

Recent studies have shown that erosional and tectonic processes have an effect on the structural evolution of some geologic features, most notably orogenic wedges. Highly useful sand box models, in which horizontal layers of sand are slowly pressed against a backstop, have shown that the geometries, structures, and kinematics of orogenic wedge formation with and without erosion and sedimentation are significantly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malavieille|first=Jacques|title=Impact of erosion, sedimentation, and structural heritage on the structure and kinematics of orogenic wedges: Analog models and case studies|journal=GSA Today|date=January 2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=4–10|url=http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/20/1/pdf/i1052-5173-20-1-4.pdf|doi=10.1130/GSATG48A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=J750DoyVRfw|title=Growth and erosion of an orogenic wedge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical models also show that the evolution of orogens, their final tectonic structure, and the potential development of a high plateau, all are sensitive to the long term climate over the mountains, for example, the concentration of precipitation in one side of the orogen due to [[orographic lift]] under a dominant wind direction.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Castellanos, D., 2007.

The '''geography of Mars''', also known as '''areography''', entails the delineation and characterization of regions on [[Mars]]. Martian geography is mainly focused on what is called [[physical geography]] on Earth; that is the distribution of physical features across Mars and their [[cartography|cartographic]] representations.

==History==
{{main|History of Mars observation}}
[[File:Karte Mars Schiaparelli MKL1888.png|thumb|250px|Map of Mars by Giovanni Schiaparelli. North is at the top of this map; however, in most maps of Mars drawn before [[space exploration]] the convention among [[astronomer]]s was to put south at the top because the [[telescope|telescopic]] image of a [[planet]] is inverted.]]
The first observations of Mars were from ground-based [[telescopes]]. The history of these observations are marked by the [[opposition (astronomy)|oppositions]] of Mars, when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the [[perihelic opposition]]s of Mars which occur approximately every 16 years, and are distinguished because Mars is close to [[apsis|perihelion]] making it even closer to Earth.

In September 1877, (a perihelic opposition of Mars occurred on September 5), [[Italy|Italian]] astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] published the first detailed map of [[Mars]]. These maps notably contained features he called ''canali'' ("channels"), that were later shown to be an [[optical illusion]]. These ''canali'' were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term was popularly mistranslated as ''canals'', and so started the [[Martian canal]] controversy.

Following these observations, it was a long-held belief that Mars contained vast seas and vegetation. It was not until [[spacecraft]] visited the planet during [[NASA]]'s [[Mariner program|Mariner missions]] in the 1960s that these myths were dispelled. Some maps of Mars were made using the data from these missions, but it wasn't until the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] mission, launched in 1996 and ending in late 2006, that complete, extremely detailed maps were obtained. These maps are now available online at http://www.google.com/mars/

==Cartography==

The [[United States Geological Survey]] defines thirty cartographic quadrangles for the surface of Mars. These can be seen below.

{{Mars Quads - By Name}}

==Topography==
[[File:Mars topography (MOLA dataset) with poles HiRes.jpg|thumb|right|640px|High resolution topographic map of Mars based on the ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' [[Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter|laser altimeter]] research led by [[Maria Zuber]] and David Smith.

[[File:Mars Hubble.jpg|thumb|right|Mars, 2001, with the southern polar ice cap visible on the bottom.]]
[[File:Mars NPArea-PIA00161.jpg|thumb|right|North Polar region with icecap.]]
Given that it is a [[planet]], the geography of Mars varies considerably. However, the [[Martian dichotomy|dichotomy]] of '''Martian topography''' is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is consequently divided into two kinds of areas, with differing [[albedo]]. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian 'continents' and given names like [[Arabia Terra]] (''land of Arabia'') or [[Amazonis Planitia]] (''Amazonian plain''). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names [[Mare Erythraeum]], [[Mare Sirenum]] and [[Aurorae Sinus]]. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is [[Syrtis Major Planum]].

The [[shield volcano|shield]] [[volcano]], [[Olympus Mons|Olympus Mons (''Mount Olympus'')]], rises 22&amp;nbsp;km above the surrounding volcanic plains, and is the highest known mountain on any planet in the solar system.&lt;ref name="Carr, M.H. 2006"&gt;Carr, M.H., 2006, The Surface of Mars, Cambridge, 307 p.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in a vast upland region called [[Tharsis]], which contains several large volcanos. See [[list of mountains on Mars]].  The Tharsis region of Mars also has the solar system's largest canyon system, [[Valles Marineris]] or the ''[[Mariner program|Mariner]] Valley'', which is 4,000&amp;nbsp;km long and 7&amp;nbsp;km deep.  Mars is also scarred by countless [[impact crater]]s. The largest of these is the [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas impact basin]]. See [[list of craters on Mars]].

Mars has two permanent polar ice caps, the northern one located at [[Planum Boreum]] and the southern one at [[Planum Australe]].

The difference between Mars' highest and lowest points is nearly 30&amp;nbsp;km (from the top of Olympus Mons at an altitude of 21.2&amp;nbsp;km to the bottom of the Hellas impact basin at an altitude of 8.2&amp;nbsp;km below the datum). In comparison, the difference between Earth's highest and lowest points ([[Mount Everest]] and the [[Mariana Trench]]) is only 19.7&amp;nbsp;km. Combined with the planets' different radii, this means Mars is nearly three times "rougher" than Earth.

The [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature]] is responsible for naming Martian surface features.

===Zero elevation===
On Earth, the zero elevation datum is based on [[sea level]].
Since Mars has no oceans and hence no 'sea level', it is convenient to define an arbitrary zero-elevation level or "[[datum (geodesy)|datum]]" for mapping the surface. The datum for Mars is arbitrarily defined in terms of a constant atmospheric pressure.

From the [[Mariner 9]] mission up until 2001, this was chosen as 610.5 Pa (6.105 mbar), on the basis that below this pressure liquid water can never be stable (i.e., the [[triple point]] of water is at this pressure). This value is only 0.6% of the pressure at sea level on Earth. Note that the choice of this value does not mean that liquid water does exist below this elevation, just that it could were the temperature to exceed 273.16 K (0.01 degrees C, 32.018 degrees F).&lt;ref name="Carr, M.H. 2006"/&gt;

In 2001, [[Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter]] data led to a new convention of zero elevation defined as the [[equipotential surface]] (gravitational plus rotational) whose average value at the equator is equal to the mean radius of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter: Experiment summary after the first year of global mapping of Mars |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |first1=D. |last1=Smith |first2=M. |last2=Zuber |first3=H. |last3=Frey |first4=J. |last4=Garvin |first5=J. |last5=Head |first6=D. |last6=Muhleman |first7=D. |last7=Pettengill |first8=R. |last8=Phillips |display-authors=5 |volume=106 |issue=E10 |pages=23689–23722 |date=25 October 2001 |doi=10.1029/2000JE001364|bibcode=2001JGR...10623689S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zero meridian===
Mars' equator is defined by its rotation, but the location of its [[prime meridian (planets)|prime meridian]] was specified, as was Earth's, by choice of an arbitrary point which was accepted by later observers. The German astronomers [[Wilhelm Beer]] and [[Johann Heinrich Mädler]] selected a small circular feature in the [[Sinus Meridiani]] ('Middle Bay' or 'Meridian Bay') as a reference point when they produced the first systematic chart of Mars features in 1830–32. In 1877, their choice was adopted as the prime meridian by the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] when he began work on his notable maps of Mars.  In 1909 the [[ephemeris]] makers decided that it was more important to maintain continuity of the ephemerides as a guide to observations and this definition was "virtually abandoned."&lt;ref name=Mariner_9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = de Vaucouleurs | first = Gerard | author-link = Gerard de Vaucouleurs | date = 1964 | title = The Physical Ephemeris of Mars | journal = Icarus | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 236–247 | bibcode = 1964Icar....3..236D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Mariner program|Mariner]] spacecraft provided extensive imagery of Mars, in 1972 the Mariner 9 Geodesy/Cartography Group proposed that the prime meridian passed through the center of a small 500 m diameter crater (named [[Airy-0]]), located in Sinus Meridiani along the meridian line of Beer and Mädler, thus defining 0.0° longitude with a precision of 0.001°.&lt;ref name=Mariner_9&gt;{{ Citation | last = de Vaucouleurs | first = Gerard | author-link = Gerard de Vaucouleurs | last2 = Davies | first2 = Merton E. | author2-link = Merton Davies | last3 = Sturms | first3 = Francis M., Jr. | date = 1973 | title = Mariner 9 Areographic  Coordinate  System | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 78 | issue = 20 | pages = 4395–4404 | doi = 10.1029/JB078i020p04395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model used the planetographic [[control point network]] developed by [[Merton Davies]] of the [[RAND Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web | date = 31 January 2001 | title = The Martian Prime Meridian -- Longitude "Zero" | type = MGS MOC Release No. MOC2-273 | publisher = Malin Space Science Systems | url = https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/01_31_01_releases/airy0/ | accessdate = 31 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As radiometric techniques increased the precision with which objects could be located on the surface of Mars, the center of a 500 m circular crater was considered to be insufficiently precise for exact measurements.  The [[IAU]] Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements therefore recommended setting the longitude of the [[Viking 1#Lander|Viking 1 lander]], for which there were extensive radiometric tracking data, as marking the standard longitude of 47.95137° west.  This deﬁnition maintains the position of the center of Airy-0 at 0° longitude, within the tolerance of current cartographic uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Archinal | first = B.A. | last2 = Acton  | first2 = C.H. | last3 = A’Hearn | first3 = M.F. | author3-link = Michael A'Hearn | last4 = Conrad | first4 = A. | last5 = et al | date = 2018 | title = Report of the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements: 2015 | journal = Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy | volume = 130 | issue = 22 | doi = 10.1007/s10569-017-9805-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martian dichotomy===
{{Main| Martian dichotomy}}
Observers of Martian topography will notice a dichotomy between the northern and southern hemispheres.  Most of the northern hemisphere is flat, with few impact craters, and lies below the conventional ‘zero elevation’ level. In contrast, the southern hemisphere is mountains and highlands, mostly well above zero elevation. The two hemispheres differ in elevation by 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;km.  The border separating the two areas is very interesting to geologists.

One distinctive feature is the [[fretted terrain]].&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, R. and J. Guest.  1987.  Geological map of the eastern equatorial region of Mars, scale 1:15,000,000. U. S. Geol. Ser. Misc. Invest. Map I-802-B, Reston, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;  It contains mesas, knobs, and flat-floored valleys having walls about a mile high.  Around many of the mesas and knobs are [[lobate debris apron]]s that have been shown to be rock-covered glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;Plaut, J. et al.  2008. Radar Evidence for Ice in lobate debris aprons in the Mid-Northern Latitudes of Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIX.  2290.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Other interesting features are the large [[Valley networks (Mars)|river valleys]] and [[outflow channels]] that cut through the dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, T. et al.  2007.

The northern lowlands comprise about one-third of the surface of Mars and are relatively flat, with occasional impact craters. The other two-thirds of the Martian surface are the southern highlands. The difference in elevation between the hemispheres is dramatic.  Because of the density of impact craters, scientists believe the southern hemisphere to be far older than the northern plains.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, D. and M. Carr.  1978.  Geological map of Mars.  U.S. Geol. Surv. Misc. Invest. Map I-803, Reston, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of heavily cratered southern highlands date back to the period of heavy bombardment, the [[Noachian]].

Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the differences. The three most commonly accepted are a single mega-impact, multiple impacts, and endogenic processes such as mantle convection.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, T et al.  2007.  Hemispheres Apart:  The Crustal Dichotomy on Mars.  Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci: 35. 621–652.&lt;/ref&gt; Both impact-related hypotheses involve processes that could have occurred before the end of the primordial bombardment, implying that the crustal dichotomy has its origins early in the history of Mars.

The giant impact hypothesis, originally proposed in the early 1980s, was met with skepticism due to the impact area's non-radial (elliptical) shape, where a circular pattern would be stronger support for impact by larger object(s). But a 2008 study&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey C. Andrews-Hanna, Maria T. Zuber &amp; W. Bruce Banerdt ''The Borealis basin and the origin of the martian crustal dichotomy'' Nature 453, 1212–1215 (26 June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; provided additional research that supports a single giant impact.  Using geologic data, researchers found support for the single impact of a large object hitting Mars at approximately a 45-degree angle. Additional evidence analyzing Martian rock chemistry for post-impact upwelling of mantle material would further support the giant impact theory.

==Nomenclature==

===Early nomenclature===
Although better remembered for mapping the [[Moon]] starting in 1830, [[Johann Heinrich Mädler]] and [[Wilhelm Beer]] were the first "areographers". They started off by establishing once and for all that most of the surface features were permanent, and pinned down Mars' rotation period. In 1840, Mädler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of Mars ever made. Rather than giving names to the various markings they mapped, Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters; Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was thus feature "a".

Over the next twenty years or so, as instruments improved and the number of observers also increased, various Martian features acquired a hodge-podge of names. To give a couple of examples, [[Solis Lacus]] was known as the "Oculus" (the Eye), and Syrtis Major was usually known as the "Hourglass Sea" or the "Scorpion". In 1858, it was also dubbed the "Atlantic Canale" by the Jesuit astronomer [[Angelo Secchi]]. Secchi commented that it "seems to play the role of the Atlantic which, on Earth, separates the Old Continent from the New" —this was the first time the fateful ''canale'', which in Italian can mean either "channel" or "canal", had been applied to Mars.

In 1867, [[Richard Anthony Proctor]] drew up a map of Mars-based, somewhat crudely, on the Rev. [[William Rutter Dawes]]' earlier drawings of 1865, then the best ones available. Proctor explained his system of nomenclature by saying, "I have applied to the different features the names of those observers who have studied the physical peculiarities presented by Mars." Here are some of his names, paired with those later used by [[Giovanni Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]] in his Martian map created between 1877 and 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willy Ley|Ley, Willy]] and [[Wernher von Braun|von Braun, Wernher]] ''The Exploration of Mars'' New York:1956 The Viking Press Pages 70–71 Schiaparelli's original map of Mars&lt;/ref&gt; Schiaparelli's names were generally adopted and are the names actually used today:

Proctor's nomenclature has often been criticized, mainly because so many of his names honored English astronomers, but also because he used many names more than once. In particular, [[William Rutter Dawes|Dawes]] appeared no fewer than ''six'' times (Dawes Ocean, Dawes Continent, Dawes Sea, Dawes Strait, Dawes Isle, and Dawes Forked Bay). Even so, Proctor's names are not without charm, and for all their shortcomings they were a foundation on which later astronomers would improve.

===Modern nomenclature===
{{Main|Classical albedo features on Mars}}
{{Main|Planetary nomenclature#Mars}}
Today, names of Martian features derive from a number of sources, but the names of the large features are derived primarily from the maps of Mars made in 1886 by the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]]. Schiaparelli named the larger features of Mars primarily using names from [[Greek mythology]] and to a lesser extent the [[Bible]].  Mars Large [[albedo]] features retain many of the older names, but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example, 'Nix Olympica' (the snows of Olympus) has become [[Olympus Mons]] (Mount Olympus).

Large Martian craters are named after important scientists and science fiction writers; smaller ones are named after towns and villages on Earth.

Various landforms studied by the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s are given temporary names or nicknames to identify them during exploration and investigation. However, it is hoped{{Attribution needed|date=June 2013}} that the [[International Astronomical Union]] will make permanent the names of certain major features, such as the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]], which were named after the seven astronauts who died in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]].

The '''George Davidson Medal''' is awarded by the [[American Geographical Society]] for the "exceptional achievement in research for exploration in the Pacific Ocean or the lands bordering therein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.amergeog.org/awards/george-davidson-medal|title=George Davidson Medal|publisher=American Geographical Society|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the American Geographical Society received a bequest of $5000 from his daughter Ellinor Campbell Davidson to established the medal and a research fund to honor her father. The medal was designed by American sculptor [[Paul Manship]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="VCH4"&gt;Wright, John Kirtland 'The Years of Henry Grinnell', ''Geography in the Making: The American Geographical Society 1851-1951'' (1952) pp. 14-70. — [George Grady Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[George Davidson (geographer)|George Davidson]] was a geographer and scientist noted for his work with the U.S. government exploring and charting the western [[United States]] and [[Alaska]]. Davidson was a geodist for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, working heavily in the [[Pacific]] waters. He later became a professor at the [[University of California]].&lt;ref name="VCH4"/&gt; In 1907, he published ''The Discovery of San Francisco Bay''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3158">'''Henrik Jakob Wikar''' or ''Hendrik Jakob Wikar'' (born 28 October 1752 [[Kokkola]], Finland (at that time Sweden)) was a Finnish explorer who travelled in Southern Africa and wrote his journal describing the life of the  [[khoisan]] people.

Wikar's father was Jakob Johan Wikar, a land surveyor and a deputy of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]],&lt;ref name=KK&gt;[http://www.suominamibiaseura.fi/doc/Namibialainen_keittokirja.pdf Namibialainen keittokirja], accessed 13.9.2011 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother was Margareta Carlborg, his father's second wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/ylioppilasmatrikkeli/henkilo.php?id=8871 Ylioppilasmatrikkeli], accessed 13.9.2011 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikar came from [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]] and studied in [[The Royal Academy of Turku]] in 1769. In 1773 he was employed in Holland by [[Dutch East India Company]]. He worked as a clerk in [[Cape Town]] in the company's hospital. He did not manage well and left in 1775&lt;ref name=KK/&gt; to the north of the Colony where he stayed for four years. From 1778 to July 1779 he wrote his journal there. He was convicted in 1779&lt;ref name=KK/&gt; as a runagate but the journal saved him and he was pardoned autumn 1779, probably because the journal included some important notes for the Company. He described the rituals and customs of the khoisan people, and numerous scientists have used his records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/URN_NBN_fi_joy-20080031/URN_NBN_fi_joy-20080031.pdf Anu Liikanen, Sanit ja khoikhoit varhaisten tutkimusmatkailijoiden kuvauksissa] ('The Sans and ths Khoikhois in the accounts by early explorers'), pro gradu, accessed 13.9.2011 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:SX''' is the entry for [[Sint Maarten]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently no ISO 3166-2 codes are defined in the entry for Sint Maarten. The country has no defined subdivisions.

[[Sint Maarten]], a [[Kingdom of the Netherlands#Countries|constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]], is officially assigned the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code {{mono|SX}}. Moreover, it is also assigned the ISO 3166-2 code {{mono|NL-SX}} under the [[ISO 3166-2:NL|entry for the Netherlands]].

==Changes==

The calving of A-68 reduced the overall size of the Larsen C shelf by 12 percent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is no projected path at this point; however, historical data shows many icebergs broken off from the Antarctic Peninsula reach the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/antarctica-larsen-c-iceberg-path-location-2017-7|title=Where Antarctic iceberg from Larsen C shelf might go in Southern Ocean|last=Mosher|first=Dave|date=12 July 2017|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "A-68" was assigned by the [[National_Ice_Center|US National Ice Center]].

==History and recent developments==
A-68 was part of Larsen C, a section of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]]. The scientific community is divided whether the calving is the result of [[climate change]], or merely a natural occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/ive-studied-larsen-c-and-its-giant-iceberg-for-years-its-not-a-simple-story-of-climate-change-80529?|title=I've studied Larsen C and its giant iceberg for years – it's not a simple story of climate change|last=Luckman|first=Adrian|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists found the crack beginning to form in November 2016, and others suggested that it might have broken off as early as a decade ago.{{fact|date=July 2017}} According to scientists observing the iceberg's path, A-68 "didn't just break through in one clean shot, [but] it formed a lace-network of cracks first."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Satellite images from [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and the [[European Union]]'s [[Copernicus Programme|Copernicus Program]] show that the iceberg is splintering, forming more icebergs in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/antarctica-s-massive-iceberg-is-starting-to-disintegrat-1797128227|title=Antarctica's Massive Iceberg Is Starting to Disintegrate| last=Dvorsky| first=George| work=Gizmodo| access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are looking into the possibility of the ice shelf collapsing as a result of the split with A-68, or whether the iceberg was the "cork" for Larsen C that allows ice to flow more freely into the sea, thereby contributing to rising sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/2/16081998/ice-berg-larsen-c-ice-shelf-collapse-antarctica-climate-change| title=Cracks are still spreading where that massive Antarctic iceberg broke free| last=Becker| first=Rachel|date=2017-08-02|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since November 2017, satelite images show A-68 is slowly drifting northward, with a widening gap to the main shelf. The gap was approximately five kilometers wide and contained a thin layer of loose, floating ice and a cluster of over 11 'smaller' bergs, one much larger than the rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5082241/Earth-s-newest-iceberg-close-NASA-reveals-68-iceberg.html| title=Earth's newest iceberg up close: NASA reveals incredible new images of trillion ton A-68 which is the size of DELAWARE| publisher=Daily Mail| author=Mark Prigg| date=14 November 2017| accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, B-15A drifted away from Ross Island into the Ross Sea and headed north, eventually breaking up into several smaller icebergs in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.space.com/40826-largest-antarctic-iceberg-b15-is-melting.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:B15a a4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Iceberg B-15A four-year journey, March 2006]]
In the last weeks of March 2000, Iceberg B-15 [[Ice calving|calved]] from the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] near [[Roosevelt Island, Antarctica|Roosevelt Island]], Antarctica.&lt;ref name="nfs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Massive Iceberg Peels Off from Antarctic Ice Shelf |work=National Science Foundation |date=22 March 2000 |url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/press/00/pr0012.htm |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atsr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biggest iceberg tracked from space |work=The ATSR Project |date=9 May 2000 |url=http://www.atsr.rl.ac.uk/news/details/09052000/01/index.shtml |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calving occurred along pre-existing cracks in the ice shelf.&lt;ref name="nfs"/&gt; The iceberg measured around {{convert|295|km|mi}} long and {{convert|37|km|mi}} wide, with a surface area of {{convert|10915|km2|mi2}}—larger than the island of [[Jamaica]]. Scientists believe that the enormous piece of ice broke away as part of a long-term natural cycle, which occurs every fifty to one hundred years.&lt;ref name="nfs"/&gt; In 2000, 2002, and 2003, Iceberg B-15 broke up into several pieces, the largest of which, B-15A, covered {{convert|6400|km2|mi2}} of the sea surface.&lt;ref name="arrigo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrigo |first1=Kevin R. |last2=Van Dijken |first2=Gert L. |title=Annual changes in sea-ice, chlorophyll a, and primary production in the Ross Sea, Antarctica |journal=Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography |volume=51 |issue=1–3 |pages=117–138 |publisher=ScienceDirect |location= |date=January–February 2004 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064504000098 |accessdate=17 February 2014 |doi=10.1016/j.dsr2.2003.04.003|bibcode=2004DSRII..51..117A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, after the separation from B-15J, B-15A drifted away from [[Ross Island]] on the open waters of the Ross Sea. In December 2003, a small knife-shaped iceberg, [[:Image:B15k a4.jpg|B-15K]] (about 300&amp;nbsp;km²), detached itself from the main body of B-15A and started drifting northward. By January 2005, prevailing currents caused B-15A to drift toward the [[Drygalski Ice Tongue]], a {{convert|70|km|mi|sing=on}} long extension of the land-based [[David Glacier]], which flows through the coastal mountains of Victoria Land.&lt;ref name="bbc-pile-up"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pile-up as berg hits Antarctica |publisher=BBC |date=19 April 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4460335.stm |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few kilometres from the ice tongue, the iceberg became stranded on a shallow seamount before resuming its northward course.&lt;ref name="new-scientist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhattacharya |first=Shaoni |title=World's largest iceberg 'goes bump in the night' |work=New Scientist |date=19 April 2005 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7283-worlds-largest-iceberg-goes-bump-in-the-night.html#.UwIDSXyYbX4 |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 April 2005, B-15A collided with the ice tongue, breaking off the tip of the ice tongue; the iceberg seemed unaffected by the collision.&lt;ref name="bbc-pile-up"/&gt;

Iceberg B-15A continued to drift along the coast leaving [[McMurdo Sound]]. On 27–28 October 2005, the iceberg ran aground off [[Cape Adare]] in [[Victoria Land]] and broke into several smaller pieces,&lt;ref&gt;MacAyeal, D., Okal, E., Aster, R., Basis, J., Brunt, K., Cathles, L.

Three additional pieces were named B-15P, B-15M, and B-15N. Iceberg B-15A then moved farther up north and broke up into more pieces. These were spotted by air force fisheries patrol{{clarify|reason=which is it, air force or fisheries patrol? and which nation?|date=May 2015}} on 3 November 2006. On 21 November 2006 several large pieces were seen just 60&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of [[Timaru, New Zealand|Timaru]], New Zealand—the largest measured about {{convert|1,8|km|mi}}, rising {{convert|37|m|ft}} from the surface of the ocean.

==Effect on Antarctic ecology==
[[File:Iceberg B-15A weather instrument.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Researchers installing weather and GPS instruments on Iceberg B-15A, 29 January 2001]]
On 29 January 2001, researchers from the University of Chicago and the University of Wisconsin installed weather and [[Global Positioning System]] instruments on Iceberg B-15A. It was the first time an iceberg had been monitored in this way. The data gathered led to an unprecedented understanding of how giant icebergs make their way through the waters of Antarctica and beyond.

Iceberg B-15A collided with the [[Drygalski Ice Tongue]] on 10 April 2005, breaking off an {{convert|8|km2|mi2|sing=on}} section of the ice tongue. Antarctic maps needed to be redrawn.

B-15A prevented ocean currents and winds from assisting in the 2004–2005 summer break-up of the sea ice in [[McMurdo Sound]], and was an obstacle to the annual resupply ships to three research stations. The [[Drift ice|floe]] was expected to cause a catastrophic decline in the population of [[Adélie penguin]]s, as it added considerable distances which parent penguins must travel back from the sea to their chicks. [[Weddell seal]]s and [[Skuas]] are also inhabitants of McMurdo Sound and their populations may have been affected as well.

In October 2006, a study showed that a large storm in the Gulf of Alaska generated a trans-Pacific ocean swell that may have contributed to breaking B15-A into many pieces on 27 October 2005.&lt;ref name="macayeal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacAyeal |first=Douglas R.|title=Transoceanic wave propagation links iceberg calving margins of Antarctica with storms in tropics and Northern Hemisphere |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=33 |issue=17 |pages= L17502|publisher= |location= |date=12 September 2006 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006GL027235/full |accessdate=18 February 2014 |doi=10.1029/2006gl027235 |bibcode=2006GeoRL..3317502M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The swell travelled {{convert|13500|km|mi}} from Alaska to Antarctica over six days. Scientists are studying this event as an example of how weather in one area can have effects in other parts of the world, and with concern over the effects on [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Richard |title=Alaskan Storm Plays Role of Butterfly for Antarctica |publisher=National Public Radio |date=5 October 2006 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6204027 |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more detailed study in 2010, however, shows that the iceberg breakup was principally caused by repeated grounding with near-coastal [[bathymetry]] near [[Cape Adare]], Victoria Land.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin |first=Seeley.|title=Kinematic and seismic analysis of giant tabular iceberg breakup at Cape Adare, Antarctica |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth |volume=115 |issue=B6 |pages= B06311|publisher= |location= |date=18 June 2010 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009JB006700/abstract |accessdate=18 February 2014 |doi=10.1029/2009jb006700 |bibcode=2010JGRB..115.6311M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">'''Integration of traffic data with navigation systems''' enables navigation systems to use [[Traffic reporting|traffic and other related data]] to optimise routing and travel times by taking into account traffic conditions and other disruptions to traffic flows. The integration may occur in a number of ways. For example, integrated [[automobile navigation system]]s use an on-board navigation system and cellular telephone. The navigation system would use the [[global positioning system]] (GPS) to position the automobile with respect to streets in a map database, to determine a route to the destination and to update the location as the automobile moves. A cellular telephone in the automobile may then communicate with a traffic information server to obtain travel times for each street segment of the route, which would then be used to refine the planned route, or to offer to the driver as an alternative. The cellular telephone can also be used to provide dynamic travel time information to the traffic information server, with each automobile in the system periodically transferring travel times for each segment that is traversed. The traffic information server would then analyse travel times to update travel time data for each street segment, which is then available to other users when they next connect to the traffic server. Other integration models exist.

According to Consumer Reports, the data may be transmitted through [[Bluetooth]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]], or [[XM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/12/gps-traffic.html Understanding GPS navigation traffic services: Consumer Reports Cars Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227115333/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/12/gps-traffic.html |date=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, [[Clear Channel]] made a deal with [[BMW]] to supply traffic data for the carmaker's [[Automotive navigation system|navigation units]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clearchannel.com/Radio/PressRelease.aspx?PressReleaseID=1744 Clear Channel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to GPS Review, the suppliers of traffic data to the navigation units get their own data from "road sensors, local departments of transportation, data collected from operators of large fleets of vehicles, and other manual sources such as traffic helicopters and listening to police scanners." 

Patents have been taken out for services that will collect movement data from [[GPS device]]s on the road to determine the current travel time between various points.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Patents US 5933100A: [http://www.google.com/patents?id=UYEWAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=%2Bnavigation+%2Btraffic Automobile navigation system with dynamic traffic data]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Viagem do Japao.png|300px|thumb|Japan Voyage, Portuguese trade route linking Goa to Nagasaki (blue) and Spanish routes (white)]]

The '''Japan voyage''' (''viagem do Japão'' in Portuguese) was a trade route established by the Portuguese from 1550 to 1639 linking [[Goa]], then capital of the [[Portuguese India]], to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, Sanjay, "The Portuguese Empire in Asia, 1500-1700: A Political and Economic History"&lt;/ref&gt; This lucrative annual trip was carried out under monopoly of the Portuguese crown, and was in charge of a Captain general. The charge of [[Captain general]] of the Japan's trip was officially attributed by the [[governor of Portuguese India]] as a reward for services rendered. The large ships involved in this trade were referred to as the ''nau do trato'', the silver ships, China's ships, and became known among the Japanese as [[Black Ships|Kurofune (black ships)]], a term that came to be used to name all Western ships that supplied in Japan during the [[Edo period]].

[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|left|A Portuguese Black Ship in [[Nagasaki]]. Japanese [[Nanban art]] screen, XVII century]]

Upon arriving in Japan in 1543, Portuguese merchants and adventurers engaged in a profitable trade on the island of [[Kyushu]],  on their own ships and Chinese reeds, without a stable port. Because of a ban on the relations between China and Japan, they acted as intermediaries. In 1550, the importance of this trade led to the creation of an annual trip under the monopoly of the Portuguese Crown. To this end, a chief captain was appointed. This was a coveted position assigned by the official authorities as a reward for services rendered. The right to carry on the "Japan voyage" was donated by the local Crown entities such as the city of Macau, Kochi, Malacca. Later, it was auctioned in Goa to the highest bidder.

Given the long distance between Goa and Japan, the route initially departed from [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]]. After several attempts to create an intermediate stop in China, in 1554 [[Leonel de Sousa]], the chief captain of Japan's voyage, reached an [[Luso-Chinese agreement (1554)|agreement]] with [[Guangzhou|Canton]] authorities to legalize the Portuguese trade, on condition of paying specially stipulated customs duties.&lt;ref&gt;DIFFIE, SHAFER, WINIUS, Bailey Wallys, Boyd C., George Davison, "Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580", p.389&lt;/ref&gt; From 1557, the Portuguese achieved the official establishment in [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]. The city became integrated in a [[triangular trade]] that finished in Japan. Then, in 1570, after an agreement with the local daimyō, they founded the city of [[Nagasaki]]. The ship sailed from Goa in April or May, loaded with fabrics, glass and glass objects, Flanders watches and Portuguese wines.&lt;ref name=Cham&gt;{{Citar web|ultimo=Rodrigues|primeiro=Helena|título=Nau do trato|url=http://www.fcsh.unl.pt/cham/eve/content.php?printconceito=1060|obra=Cham|publicado=Cham|acessodata=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their proximity and similar sporting cultures, [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are frequent rivals in a wide variety of international sports.

South Korea and Japan has had a long history in judo, especially with the two nations' dominance in Asia.

In recent times, the rivalries have been greatest in the men's half-lightweight, lightweight and middleweight categories.

In the men's half-lightweight, rivalries stemmed to the quarter-final at the [[Judo at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's 66 kg|2012 Olympic Games]], that featured Japan's [[Masashi Ebinuma]] and South Korea's [[Cho Jun-ho (judoka)|Cho Jun-ho]]. The decision was first called in Cho's favor, and then recalled to hand the win to Ebinuma. It is one of the most controversial fights in Olympic judo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Ebinuma had dominated the weight division from [[2011 World Judo Championships – Men's 66 kg|2011]]-[[2014 World Judo Championships – Men's 66 kg|2014]], winning three world championships, before South Korean [[An Baul]] broke his streak by winning the [[2015 World Judo Championships – Men's 66 kg|2015 World Championships]].

In the men's lightweight, Korea had a surge of dominance in the division with [[Wang Ki-chun]], who won the world championships in [[2007 World Judo Championships|2007]] and [[2009 World Judo Championships|2009]]. In [[2010 World Judo Championships – Men's 73 kg|2010]], Japan's [[Hiroyuki Akimoto]] took over Wang as the world champion, marking a new era of Japanese dominance in the men's lightweight. Fellow countrymen [[Riki Nakaya]] and [[Shohei Ono]] then shared domination, with Nakaya winning in [[2011 World Judo Championships – Men's 73 kg|2011]] and [[2014 World Judo Championships – Men's 73 kg|2014]], and Ono in [[2013 World Judo Championships – Men's 73 kg|2013]] and [[2015 World Judo Championships – Men's 73 kg|2015]]. In the upcoming [[Judo at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympics]], it is widely thought that newly formed rivals Ono and Japanese-born Korean [[An Chang-rim]] will be favorites for gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the men's middleweight, one of Japan's weaker divisions alongside the half-middleweight, South Korea had the upper hand in the past decade, producing two world champions in the form of [[Lee Kyu-won]] (2009) and [[Gwak Dong-han]] ([[2015 World Judo Championships – Men's 90 kg|2015]]), and an [[Judo at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's 90 kg|Olympic champion]] in [[Song Dae-nam]]. Japan's closest finish in recent times was in [[2010 World Judo Championships – Men's 90 kg|2010]] and [[2011 World Judo Championships – Men's 90 kg|2011]] with [[Daiki Nishiyama]]'s silver medals. Today, Gwak has formed a rivalry with several Japanese middleweights, most notably Nishiyama (3-3), [[Mashu Baker]] (2-1 in favor of Baker) and [[Yuya Yoshida]] (1-1), and will most likely compete against them at the 2016 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In the team's competition, Japan and South Korea rekindled their vie for the number one country in judo at the [[2015 World Judo Championships – Men's team|2015 World Championships]], meeting in the final. With wins from Ebinuma, reigning [[2015 World Judo Championships – Men's 81 kg|world champion]] [[Takanori Nagase]] and Takeshi Ojitani, Japan claimed their [[2014 World Judo Championships – Men's team|second]] consecutive team gold while Korea settled for silver in their first team fight in five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Jupiter Artland''' is a contemporary [[sculpture park]] and [[art gallery]] in [[West Lothian]], Scotland. Jupiter Artland Foundation is a [[Registered Charity|registered charity]] that is subsidized by classes, workshops, events, ticket sales, and donations. 

Jupiter Artland is open to general visits between May and September.

Jupiter Artland sits in the grounds of [[Bonnington House]], a 19th-century country house around {{convert|7|km}} west of the city of [[Edinburgh]].

The grounds of the house have been developed as the sculpture park and two new wings designed by Benjamin Tindall Architects were completed in 2015 to provide indoor gallery space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jupiterartland.org/story |title=Story |publisher=Jupiter Artland |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sculpture collection was established in 1999 by art collectors Robert and Nicky Wilson and "focuses on nurturing the work of contemporary artists and commissioning site-specific work for its 120-acres of woodland and meadow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36158524|title=V&amp;A up for Museum of the Year £100,000 prize|publisher=BBC News|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Jupiter Artland was shortlisted for the 2016 [[Museum of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfund.org/prize/news/2016/april/museum-of-the-year-shortlist-announced Artfund]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 it was a filming location for [[BBC Four]]'s "Magic Numbers: Hannah Fry's Mysterious World of Maths", presented by mathematician Dr [[Hannah Fry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4282">{{About|a type of administrative unit in the Near East}}
A '''kaza''' ({{Lang-ar|قضاء}}, ''qaḍāʾ'', {{IPA-ar|qɑˈd̪ˤɑːʔ|pron}}, plural: {{lang|ar|أقضية}}, ''aqḍiyah'', {{IPA-ar|ˈɑqd̪ˤijɑ|pron}}; {{lang-ota|kazâ}}&lt;ref name=Somel151/&gt;) is an [[administrative division]] historically used in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and currently used in several of its successor states. The term is from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and means "jurisdiction"; it is often translated "district",&lt;ref name=Faroqhi/&gt; "sub-district"&lt;ref name=Quataert/&gt; (though this also applies to a [[nahiye]]), or "juridical district".&lt;ref name=Rogan/&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
In the Ottoman Empire, a kaza was originally a "geographical area subject to the legal and administrative jurisdiction of a ''[[kadı]]''.&lt;ref name=Somel151/&gt; With the first [[Tanzimat]] reforms of 1839, the administrative duties of the ''kadı'' were transferred to a governor ''([[kaymakam]])'', with the ''kadıs'' acting as judges of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Somel144/&gt; In the Tanzimat era, the kaza became an administrative district with the 1864 Provincial Reform Law, which was implemented over the following decade.&lt;ref name=Rogan/&gt; A kaza unified the jurisdiction of a governor ''(kaymakam)'' appointed by the [[Interior ministry|Ministry of the Interior]],&lt;ref name=Cetinsaya/&gt; a treasurer (chief finance officer), and a judge ''(kadı)'' in a single administrative unit.&lt;ref name=Rogan/&gt; It was part of efforts of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] to establish uniform, rational administration across the empire.&lt;ref name=Rogan/&gt;

The kaza was a subdivision of a [[sanjak]]&lt;ref name=Somel151/&gt; and corresponded roughly to a city with its surrounding villages. Kazas, in turn, were divided into [[Nahiyah|nahiyes]] (governed by ''müdürs'' and ''[[mütesellim]]s'') and villages (''karye'', governed by ''[[Muhtar (title)|muhtars]]'').&lt;ref name=Cetinsaya/&gt; The 1871 revisions to the administrative law established the nahiye (still governing a ''müdür''), as an intermediate level between the kaza and the village.&lt;ref name=Cetinsaya/&gt;

==Turkey==
The early [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] continued to use the term ''kaza'' until it renamed them [[List of districts in Turkey|ilçe]] in the 1920s.

==Arab countries==
The kaza was also formerly a second-level administrative division in [[Syria]], but it is now called a [[mintaqah]].

The kaza or '''qadaa''' is used to refer to the following:
* [[districts of Iraq]] (second-level, below the governorate)
* [[districts of Lebanon]] (second-level, below the governorate)
* [[Jordan#Administrative divisions|Sub-districts]] (third-level, below the governorate and the district)
* [[Districts of Mandatory Palestine|subdistricts of Mandatory Palestine]]
* [[Districts of Israel|Counties of Israel]]

__NOTOC__
'''Kempty Falls''' is a waterfall in Ram Gaon and at the south of Kempty, in the [[Tehri Garhwal district|Tehri Garhwal]] District of [[Uttarakhand]], [[India]]. It is {{convert|13|km|mi|0}} from [[Mussoorie]] on the Chakrata Road, and {{convert|45|km|mi|0}} from [[Dehradun]]. It is nearly 1364 meters above sea level, at 78°-02’East longitude and 30° -29’North latitude. The Kempty Falls, and the area around is surrounded by high mountain ranges at an altitude of 4500 feet. There is an estimated tourist inflow to the Falls of over 10 lakh (one million).
[[File:Aerial view of the Kempty Falls.jpg|thumb]]
Kempty Falls were developed as a tourist destination by [[United Kingdom|British]] officer John Mekinan, around 1835. The name Kempty is probably derived from the word 'camp-tea'.  A stream of water running throughout the year starting from the southwest of the village of Banglow ki kandi moves northwest and falls from 4,500&amp;nbsp;ft. Splitting into five other cascades, the water falls a further 40&amp;nbsp;feet.

The nearest medical centres are at Dehradun, Mussoorie and Kempty, the nearest railway station at [[Dehradun railway station|Dehradun]], and the nearest airport the [[Jolly Grant Airport]] at Dehradun.

Mapmaking at the Asia-Pacific Margin, 1600-1900 |publisher= Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, Harvard University| archivedate= April 2, 2015| access-date= December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She specializes in [[East Asia]], and she teaches [[History of Japan|Japanese history]] and history of [[cartography]].

==Works==
Wigen's first book, ''The Making of a Japanese Periphery, 1750-1920'' (1995), explores southern [[Nagano Prefecture]] in Japan and how the silk industry transformed it. ''The Making of Japanese Periphery, 1750-1920'' won the 1992 [[John K. Fairbank Prize]] of the [[American Historical Association]].

She studied the same locality in her second book, ''A Malleable Map: Geographies of Restoration in Central Japan, 1600-1912''(2010), exploring the roles of cartography, [[chorography]], and regionalism. ''A Malleable Map'', wrote one reviewer, examines how "protoindustrial enterprises" such as sericulture and papercraft appeared on maps and reflected larger economic and political changes over roughly four centuries from the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] period through the [[Meiji period]]. Wigen focuses on how the relationship between regional and national identities "played an integral role in the creation of modern Japan".&lt;ref name=MMap&gt;{{cite book |last = Wigen |first = Kären |year = 2010 |title = A Malleable Map: Geographies of Restoration in Central Japan, 1600-1912 |publisher = University of California Press| location = Berkeley |isbn = 9780520259188  |page= 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the pictorial and nonpictorial ways in which the geographical location of [[Shinano, Nagano|Shinano]] was shown redefined the ways in which people conceived of the place. These ways were "malleable" because they changed according to the needs and priorities of Tokugawa shoguns, merchants, Meiji officials, travelers, and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Review |last = Chervin |first = Reed H.| journal = Studies on Asia | year = 2013 |volume = 3| pp = 87–90|url = http://studiesonasia.illinoisstate.edu/seriesIV/documents/Chervin_Studies_Oct2013.pdf |publisher= Illinois State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her third book, ''[[The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography]]'' (1997), co-authored with Martin Lewis, explains why the present system of classifying certain landmasses as "continents" is comparatively recent and derived more from historical accident and political concerns than from natural geographical features. Reviewers also generally welcomed ''The Myth of Continents''. One noted that readers would find it a "useful volume" which dealt with [[Eurocentrism]], [[Afrocentrism]], [[Orientalism]], [[postcolonialism|postcolonial thought]], and geographic education. Because it summarized classic and contemporary research, the volume was "an important stepping-stone between frequently obtuse, jargon-laden academic works on the one hand, and popular views of geography on the other."  Lewis and Wigen's concern is [[metageography]], which they define as "the set of spatial structures through which people order their knowledge of the world" They find that geographies are "much more than just the ways in which societies are stretched across the earth's surface. They also include the contested, arbitrary, power-laden, and often inconsistent ways in which those structures are represented epistemologically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first= Barney| last= Warf| url= http://asq.africa.ufl.edu/files/Vol-1-Issue-4-BR.pdf |title= Book Reviews| publisher= University of Florida Board of Trustees| journal= [[African Studies Quarterly]] |volume= 1| number= 4| year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist Rita Kipp in reviewing the book wrote:
{{quote|What is "mythical" about the canonical seven continents we learned in school is that their sometimes arbitrary boundaries can derail our generalizations about culture and history. The way "Africa" is used in much Afro-centric scholarship, for example, overlooks the cultural divide marked roughly by the Sahara Desert. Perhaps the most vexing continents, however, are Asia and Europe, the boundary between them being the tinder for many scholarly disputes. Martin and Wigen object, above all, when geographical determinism creeps into our talk of these "continents," as if the land forms themselves and their analytical separability explain why people live and think differently in these places.&lt;ref name= kipp15&gt;{{citation | url = http://asianetwork.org/ane-archived-issues/1999-february/anex1999-february-kipp.pdf |title = Book Review: The Myth Of Continents |first = Rita Smith |last = Kipp |journal = ASIANetwork Exchange| volume = 6 |number = 3 |year = 1999|p = 15| ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Kipp confessed "I found myself in a defensive mood during much of this book, and sometimes bored with what I thought I already knew about Eurocentrism, Orientalism, and the social construction of all scholarly categories and boundaries. The total effect, however, is finally arresting."&lt;ref name= kipp15 /&gt;

The geographical historian [[James M. Blaut]], however, while praising the usefulness of the book, called it "pretentious" and their argument "rather conventional and indeed rather conservative." He especially criticized their use of the term "metageography": "the word metageography seems to have been coined by the authors as an impressive-sounding synonym for 'world cultural geography.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Blaut  |first =James M. |authorlink = |title =The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography (Review) |journal =Journal of World History |volume =10 |issue = 1 |pages =205–210 |publisher = |location = |date =1999 |language = |url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jwh/summary/v010/10.1blaut.html |jstor = |issn = |doi = 10.1353/jwh.2005.0002 |accessdate = |ref= none}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a forum in the [[Journal of World History]], where Lewis and Wigen replied,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 =Lewis| first1= Martin W. |first2= Karen| last2= Wigen |authorlink = |title =Third Worldism or Globalism?

In April 2015, she delivered the [[Edwin O. Reischauer Lectures]] at [[Harvard University]] on the topic "Where in the World? Mapmaking at the Asia-Pacific Margin, 1600-1900."&lt;ref name= Reischauer /&gt;

Wigen's latest project is another collaboration, ''Cartographic Japan: A History in Maps'', with co-editors Sugimoto Fumiko and Cary Karacas (forthcoming 2016).&lt;ref name= "Stanford profile" /&gt;

'''LABash''' is an annual student [[Landscape Architecture]] conference held in North America. Each year, LABash is hosted by a different University in the United States or Canada. Students and professionals, have traveled from [[Canada]] and some as far away as [[South Korea]] and [[New Zealand]] to attend. The conference consists of guest speakers, workshops, [[charrette|design charettes]], expos and social events.

The annual event was founded by three Landscape Architecture students James Macgregor from the University of Guelph and Ted Baker and Al Reghr from the University of Toronto  ]]. They traveled to several other landscape architecture schools in Canada and the Eastern US to network and exchange knowledge and skills. In 1970, the first LABash conference was held at the University of Guelph, Ontario. It has since become a tradition to host the conference in different universities each year. Landscape architecture professionals, past graduates, current students and professionals and students from related fields such as [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], [[urban design]], and art have joined to celebrate landscape architecture, learn new skills, network with other students and prospective employers, and gain inspiration for their work.

=== Controversy ===
Alcohol was removed from conference events after the first night due to the behavior of student conference attendees from other schools.

The 48th Annual LABash carried the theme “Identify.” Keynote speakers included Ken Smith, Susannah Drake, and Gina Ford. The student directors strived to welcome speakers that would generate a diverse array of voices and perspectives. They also started some new practices, such as:

* Asking a distinguished alumnus (Mark A. Focht, PLA FASLA. Deputy Commissioner / Chief Operating Officer at New York City Parks and Recreation) to serve as the Grand Marshall of the 2018 LABash.
* Hosting a dedicated graduate school fair to encourage the more than 250 undergraduate attendees to meet with graduate program representatives from eight schools.
* Offering 13 LACES (CEU) credits to entice professionals to participate.

Changing the world may sound like a big task, but it is only possible through you.

Throughout the weekend, guests were asked to be conscious of the ideas, people, and experiences they encounter and reflect:

How will you make your mark?

What inspires you?

What has shaped you?

What will you do?"

This is a '''list of by-elections to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]] and the [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Council]] of the [[Falkland Islands]]'''. The [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands]] was founded on 13 November 1845, originally as an entirely appointed body. The first elections to the council took place in [[Falkland Islands general election, 1949|1949]]. The Legislative Assembly replaced the Legislative Council with the implementation of the new [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands|Constitution]] on 1 January 2009.

The Legislative Assembly consists of eight elected members, five from [[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley]] and three from [[Camp (constituency)|Camp]]. Under section 32(2) of the [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands|constitution]], if an elected member of the Legislative Assembly vacates their seat for any reason other than a [[dissolution of parliament|dissolution of the Assembly]], there is a by-election to fill the empty seat. The by-election must be held within 70 days of the vacancy occurring, unless the Assembly is due to be dissolved within 126 days.

==Legislative Assembly==
The [[Falkland Islands general election, 2009|first election]] to the newly constituted Legislative Assembly took place on 5 November 2009 and the assembly was dissolved on 17 October 2013 in preparation for the [[Falkland Islands general election, 2013|2013 general election]].

A by-election took place in the [[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley constituency]] on 3 January 2008 after the incumbent councillor, Richard Andrew Davies, became Chief Medical Officer. There was controversy over the circumstances that led to the by-election as Richard Davies had been advised by the Government that he could take on the office of Chief Medical Officer without forfeiting his seat in the Legislative Council. However, this was later deemed to be unconstitutionally, forcing Davies to give up his seat. Davies sort re-election at the by-election, but lost out to [[John Birmingham (politician)|John Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Falkland Islands: Penguin News weekly update |author= |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2007/11/23/falkland-islands-penguin-news-weekly-update |newspaper=[[MercoPress]] |date=23 November 2007|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last election to the Legislative Council prior to it being reconstituted into the Legislative Assembly on 1 January 2009.

[[File:Nobel prizes world map.svg|thumb|Nobel prizes world map]]
This is a '''list of [[Nobel Prize]] laureates by country'''. Listings for ''Economics'' refer to the related [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. The Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded 567 times to 889 recipients, of which 25 awards (all Peace Prizes) were to organizations. Due to some recipients receiving multiple awards, the total number of recipients is 860 individuals and 22 organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/index.html Statistics about the Nobel Prize at the official website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The present list ranks laureates under the country/countries that are stated by the Nobel Prize committee on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/ Chronological list of ''All Nobel Laureates'' on the official website of the Nobel Prize committee.]&lt;/ref&gt; The list does not distinguish between laureates who received a full prize and the majority who shared a prize.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (2010): Evolution of National Nobel Prize Shares in the 20th Century, ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2634, web site {{cite web |url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/nobelshare.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327012415/http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/nobelshare.html |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some laureates are listed under more than one country, because the official website mentions multiple countries in relation to the laureate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ Example of an award applied to more than one country.]&lt;/ref&gt; If a country is merely mentioned as the place of birth, an asterisk (*) is used in the respective listing to indicate this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2007/ Example of a birthplace mentioned in addition to the country the award is applied to.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the birth country is mentioned in ''italics'' at the other listings of this laureate. 

Organizations are listed here if the Nobel Prize committee relates them to a single country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1977/ Example of an awarded organization that is related to a country]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polish flag with coat of arms.jpg|thumb|upright|Flag with coat of arms of the Republic of Poland]]

A variety of '''Polish flags''' are defined in current Polish national law, either through an act of parliament or a ministerial ordinance. Apart from the [[Flag of Poland|national flag]], these are mostly military flags, used by one or all branches of the [[Polish Armed Forces]], especially the [[Polish Navy]]. Other flags are flown by vessels of non-military uniformed services.

Most Polish flags feature white and red, the national colors of Poland. The national colors, officially adopted in 1831, are of [[Heraldry|heraldic]] origin and derive from the [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] of the [[Coat of arms of Poland|coats of arms of Poland]] and [[Coat of arms of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Additionally, some flags incorporate the white eagle of the Polish coat of arms, while other flags used by the Armed Forces incorporate [[military eagle]]s, which are variants.

Both variants of the national flag of Poland were officially adopted in 1919, shortly after Poland re-emerged as an independent state in the aftermath of [[World War I]] in 1918. Many Polish flags were adopted within the following three years.&lt;ref name=kromer&gt;{{cite web

 |df           = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The designs of most of these flags have been modified only to adjust to the changes in the official rendering of the national coat of arms. Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassicist]] to [[Baroque]] in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Communist rule]] from 1944 to 1990. Legal specification for the shades of the national colors has also changed with time. The shade of red was first legally specified as [[vermilion]] by a presidential decree of 13 December 1928.&lt;ref name=znamier&gt;{{cite book

This verbal prescription was replaced with coordinates in the CIE 1976 [[Lab color space|color space]] by the Coat of Arms Act of 31 January 1980.&lt;ref name=coa-act /&gt;

{{Main|Flag of Poland}}

The basic variant of the [[national flag]] is a plain white-and-red horizontal bicolor. A variant [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with the [[coat of arms]] is restricted to official use abroad and at sea. Legal restrictions notwithstanding, the two variants are often treated as interchangeable in practice.

Special state service flags are used by state-employed civil special-purpose ships while on duty. These flags all follow the same basic design; a white flag with a horizontal stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is emblazoned with the national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken in the middle and does not touch the anchor or the arms. The type of special service performed by the ship is indicated by the color of the middle stripe.&lt;ref name=service&gt;{{Cite Polish law

==People==
===Maria do Couto Maia-Lopes===
Maria do Couto Maia-Lopes (24 October 1890 &amp;ndash; 25 July 2005) is the 2nd [[oldest people|longest-lived]] person to be documented in [[Portugal]]. She was born and lived in [[Grijó (Vila Nova de Gaia)|Grijó]], in [[Vila Nova de Gaia]], which is near the city of [[Porto]].

She remembered the day when the last king of Portugal, [[Manuel II of Portugal|D. Manuel II]], visited the nearby town of [[Espinho, Portugal|Espinho]], on 23 November 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diario-universal.com/2007/07/morreu/maria-do-couto-maia-lopes/Report on Maria do Couto Maia-Lopes] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729195435/http://www.diario-universal.com/2007/07/morreu/maria-do-couto-maia-lopes/Report |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a total of eight daughters, seven grandchildren, ten great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1942. One of her great-granddaughters married a grandson of Portugal's oldest ever man, Augusto Moreira de Oliveira (1896 &amp;ndash; 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2005-07-26-portugals-oldest-woman-dies-at-114 Portugal's oldest woman dies at 114]&lt;/ref&gt;  Maia-Lopes died 25 July 2005, aged 114 years 274 days.

===Alice Sanders===
Alice Sanders ([[São Jorge Island]], 12 May 1897 &amp;ndash; [[Merced, California]], 7 November 2007)&lt;ref name="GRG"/&gt; was one of the last survivors of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. Alice Catarina Matos was born in the [[Azores]] archipelago. Her family emigrated to [[Half Moon Bay]] (California) in 1903, when Alice was 6 years old. The April 18, 1906 San Francisco earthquake, a few weeks prior to Alice's ninth birthday, was a traumatic experience to her family, since they believed the end of the world had come. In 1912, the Matos family moved to [[Gustine, California|Gustine]], where  Alice met Clarence Leonard Sanders, who became her husband on Christmas Day in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portuguesetimes.com/Ed_1899/Util/beat.htm |title=New Bedford, Mass |publisher=Portuguese Times |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530171831/http://www.portuguesetimes.com/Ed_1899/util/beat.htm |archivedate=2010-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of ecoregions in Oregon''' provides an overview of [[ecoregions]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] designated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] (CEC). The Commission's 1997 report, [[List of Ecoregions of North America|Ecological Regions of North America]], provides a spatial framework that may be used by government agencies, [[non-governmental organization]]s, and academic researchers as a basis for [[Risk management|risk analysis]], [[natural resource management|resource management]], and [[environmental science|environmental study]] of the continent's [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=CEC&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] | title=Ecological Regions of North America: Toward a Common Perspective | url=http://www.cec.org/files/PDF/BIODIVERSITY/eco-eng_EN.pdf | year=1997 | accessdate=2008-04-10 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecoregions may be identified by similarities in [[geology]], [[physiography]], [[vegetation]], [[climate]], [[soil]]s, [[land use]], [[wildlife]] distributions, and [[hydrology]].&lt;ref name=oregon4&gt;{{Cite document | last=Thorson | first=T.D. | last2=Bryce | first2=S.A. | last3=Lammers | first3=D.A. | title=Ecoregions of Oregon (color poster with map, descriptive text, summary tables, and photographs) | place=Reston, Virginia | publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] | year=2003 | url=ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/or/or_front.pdf | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification system has four levels. Levels I, III, and IV are shown on this list. '''Level I''' divides [[North America]] into 15 ecoregions; of these, 3 are present in Oregon. '''Level III''' subdivides the continent into 182 ecoregions; of these, 9 lay partly within Oregon's borders. '''Level IV''' is a further subdivision of Level III ecoregions. There are 65 Level IV ecoregions in Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-oregon-ecoregions-l4-map.php |title=Interactive Map of Oregon Level 4 Ecoregions |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which continue into adjacent areas in the neighboring states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], [[Nevada]], and [[California]]. The task of defining and mapping these ecoregions was carried out by the '''Oregon Ecoregion Project''', a collaborative effort involving the EPA, the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), the United States Forest Service (USFS), and other state and federal agencies. The new classification system they developed may differ from previous frameworks developed separately by the agencies.&lt;ref name=oregon4/&gt;

Oregon is [[biodiversity|ecologically diverse]]. The [[Western Oregon|west side]] of the state has a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]-influenced climate and receives plentiful [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] three seasons of the year. In contrast, [[Eastern Oregon]] lies in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and is much drier. The climatic gradient is evident in the state's [[landscape]]s: [[forest]]ed [[mountain]]s, [[Glaciated Rocks|glaciated peaks]], [[shrub]]- and [[grass]]-covered [[plain]]s, [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[valley]]s, [[beach]]es, [[desert playas]], and [[wetland]]s.&lt;ref name=oregon4/&gt;

'''The Mandara Kingdom''' (sometimes called '''Wandala''') was an [[Africa]]n kingdom in the [[Mandara Mountains]] of what is today [[Cameroon]]. The [[Mandara people]] are descended from the kingdom's inhabitants.

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 108-212-18, Kamerun, Sultan Bukar.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Bukar Afade]] c. 1911/15.]]

Tradition states that Mandara was founded shortly before 1500 by a female ruler named Soukda and a non-Mandarawa hunter named Gaya. The kingdom was first referred to by [[Fra Mauro]] (in 1459) and [[Leo Africanus]] (in 1526); the provenance of its name remains uncertain.

For the kingdom's first century of history, its rulers warred with neighbouring groups in an effort to expand their territories. After conquering the Dulo (or Duolo) and establishing the capital at [[Dulo, Mandara|Dulo]] c. 1580, the dynasty of [[Sankre]], a war leader, began. When the Dulo made an attempt to seize the throne, the [[Kanem-Bornu Empire|Bornu]] kingdom supported the claim of [[Aldawa Nanda]], a member of Sankre's house. Emperor [[Idris Alaoma]] of Borno personally installed Nanda as king in 1614. Bornu thus attained an influential position over Mandara.

[[Mai Bukar Aji]], the 25th king, made Mandara a [[sultan]]ate c. 1715, which it would remain for nearly two hundred years. Muslim visitors converted Bukar to Islam, and the [[Islamization|Islamicisation]] of the kingdom would continue for most of the next century. The kingdom experienced a golden age of sorts under Bukar and his successor, [[Bukar Guiana]] (1773-1828). Around 1781, the Mandara defeated the kingdom of [[Kanem-Bornu Empire|Borno]] in a major battle, further expanding their control in the region. At the peak of her power at the turn of the century, Mandara received tribute from some 15 chiefdoms. However, the kingdom faced a setback in 1809, when [[Modibo Adama]], a [[Fula people|Fulani]] disciple of [[Usman dan Fodio]], led a [[jihad]] against Mandara. Adama briefly seized Dulo, though the Mandara counterattack soon drove him from the kingdom's borders. Adama's defeat prompted Borno to ally with Mandara once again against the Fulani invaders.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 108-212-20, Kamerun, Sultan Bukar mit Gefolge.jpg|thumb|Sultan Bukar Afade (on horse) with a following of his people, c.1911/15.]]
Upon the death of ruler [[Bukai Dgjiama]], Mandara's non-Muslim tributaries rose up, and the Fulani attacked once more. By 1850, Borno could not pass up the opportunity to attack the weakened kingdom. This renewed conflict began to sap the kingdom's strength, paving the way for the invasion of [[Muhammad Ahmad]]'s forces in the 1880s. In 1895 or 1896, Muhammad Ahmad's army destroyed Dulo, marking a further decline in Mandara power. However, the kingdom continued to exist, repelling continual Fulani raids until it finally fell to them in 1893.

[[United Kingdom|English]] explorer [[Dixon Denham]] accompanied a slave-raiding expedition from [[Kanem-Bornu Empire|Borno]] into the Mandara kingdom in February 1823; though he barely escaped with his life following the raiders' defeat, he brought back one of the first European accounts of the kingdom. In 1902, the kingdom was conquered by [[Germany]], passing then to [[France]] in 1918. In 1960, the Mandara kingdom became a part of newly independent Cameroon.

'''Meenmutty Falls''' is a [[waterfall]] located {{convert|45|km}} from [[Trivandrum city]] in [[Thiruvananthapuram District]] in the Indian state of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. The falls are located near the [[Neyyar Dam|Neyyar Reservoir]] area. No transportation is available so visitors have to trek 2km through the dense forests to reach the falls. It is very beautiful fall with beautiful surroundings.  The [[Kombaikani Falls]] lie {{convert|2|km}} upstream of the Meenmutti Falls on the trek path to [[Agastyakoodam]].

The '''Military Grid Reference System''' ('''MGRS''')&lt;ref name="DMA8358_1_Chapter3"&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tm8358.1/tr83581b.html#ZZ26 DMA Technical Manual 8358.1, Chapter 3.] Datums, Ellipsoids, Grids, and Grid Reference Systems&lt;/ref&gt; is the geocoordinate standard used by [[NATO]] militaries for locating points on the earth.  The MGRS is derived from the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)]] grid system and the [[Universal Polar Stereographic|universal polar stereographic (UPS)]] grid system, but uses a different labeling convention. The MGRS is used for the entire earth.

An example of an ''MGRS coordinate'', or ''grid reference'', would be [{{Coor URL}}21_18_34.0_N_157_55_0.7_W_&amp;language=en 4QFJ12345678], which consists of three parts: 
* 4Q (grid zone designator, GZD)
* FJ (the 100,000-meter square identifier)
* 12345678 (numerical location; [[Easting and northing|easting]] is 1234 and [[Easting and northing|northing]] is 5678, in this case specifying a location with 10&amp;nbsp;m resolution)

An MGRS grid reference is a point reference system.  When the term 'grid square' is used, it can refer to a square with a side length of {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, 1&amp;nbsp;km, {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, 10&amp;nbsp;m or 1&amp;nbsp;m, depending on the precision of the coordinates provided.  (In some cases, squares adjacent to a Grid Zone Junction (GZJ) are clipped, so polygon is a better descriptor of these areas.)  The number of digits in the numerical location must be even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10, depending on the desired precision.  When changing precision levels, it is important to [[truncate]] rather than [[rounding|round]] the easting and northing values to ensure the more precise polygon will remain within the boundaries of the less precise polygon.  Related to this is the primacy of the southwest corner of the polygon being the labeling point for an entire polygon.  In instances where the polygon is not a square and has been clipped by a grid zone junction, the polygon keeps the label of the southwest corner as if it had not been clipped.

* 4Q .....................GZD only, precision level 6° × 8° (in most cases)
* 4QFJ ...................GZD and 100&amp;nbsp;km Grid Square ID, precision level 100&amp;nbsp;km
* 4QFJ 1 6 ...............precision level 10&amp;nbsp;km
* 4QFJ 12 67 .............precision level 1&amp;nbsp;km
* 4QFJ 123 678 ...........precision level 100&amp;nbsp;m
* 4QFJ 1234 6789 .........precision level 10&amp;nbsp;m
* 4QFJ 12345 67890 .......precision level 1&amp;nbsp;m

==Grid zone designation==
The first part of an MGRS coordinate is the ''grid-zone designation''. The 6° wide UTM zones, numbered 1–60, are intersected by latitude bands that are normally 8° high, lettered C–X (omitting I and O). The northmost latitude band, X, is 12° high. The intersection of a UTM zone and a latitude band is (normally) a 6° × 8° polygon called a ''grid zone'', whose ''designation'' in MGRS is formed by the zone number (one or two digits – the number for zones 1 to 9 is just a single digit, according to the example in DMA TM 8358.1, Section 3-2,&lt;ref name="DMA8358_1_Chapter3"/&gt; Figure 7), followed by the latitude band letter (uppercase). This same notation is used in both UTM and MGRS, i.e. the UTM grid reference system; the article on [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] shows many maps of these grid zones, including the irregularities for Svalbard and southwest Norway.

As Figure 1 illustrates, Honolulu is in grid zone 4Q.

[[Image:MGRSgridOriginSchemeAA.png|thumb|Figure 1. The origin of the MGRS grid, in the Pacific. Honolulu is in 4QFJ.]]

==100,000-meter square identification==
The second part of an MGRS coordinate is the ''100,000-meter square identification''.  Each UTM zone is divided into 100,000 meter squares, so that their corners have UTM-coordinates that are multiples of 100,000 meters.  The ''identification'' consists of a column letter (A–Z, omitting I and O) followed by a row letter (A–V, omitting I and O).

Near the equator, the columns of UTM zone 1 have the letters A–H, the columns of UTM zone 2 have the letters J–R (omitting O), and the columns of UTM zone 3 have the letters S–Z.  At zone 4, the column letters start over from A, and so on around the world. 

For the row letters, there are actually two alternative lettering schemes within MGRS: 
* In the ''AA scheme'',&lt;ref name="MGRS_Final_Guidance"&gt;
[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/MGRS_Final_Guidance.doc NGA Guidance for the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS).]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''MGRS-New'',&lt;ref name="Military_Map_Reading_201"&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/mmr201.pdf Military Map Reading 201], published by [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|NGA]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is used for [[WGS84]] and some other modern [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]]s, the letter for the first row – just north of the equator – is A in odd-numbered zones, and F in even-numbered zones, as shown in figure 1.  Note that the westmost square in this row, in zone 1, has identification AA. 
* In the alternative ''AL scheme'',&lt;ref name="MGRS_Final_Guidance"/&gt; also known as ''MGRS-Old'',&lt;ref name="Military_Map_Reading_201"/&gt; which is used for some older [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]]s, the row letters are shifted 10 steps in the alphabet.  This means that the letter for the first row is L in odd-numbered zones and R in even-numbered zones.  The westmost square in the first row, in zone 1, has identification AL.

If an MGRS coordinate is complete (with both a grid zone designation and a 100,000 meter square identification), and is valid in one lettering scheme, then it is usually invalid in the other scheme, which will have no such 100,000 meter square in the grid zone. (Latitude band X is the exception to this rule.) Therefore, a position reported in a modern [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] usually can not be misunderstood as using an old datum, and vice versa – provided the datums use different MGRS lettering schemes.

In the map (figure 1), which uses the AA scheme, we see that Honolulu is in grid zone 4Q, and square FJ. To give the position of Honolulu with 100&amp;nbsp;km resolution, we write 4QFJ.

[[Image:MGRSgridHawaiiSchemeAARealigned.png|thumb|Figure 2. The MGRS grid around Hawaii. Honolulu is in the 10&amp;nbsp;km square that is called 4QFJ15.]]

==Numerical location==
The third part of an MGRS coordinate is the ''numerical location'' within a 100,000 meter square, given as ''n'' + ''n'' digits, where ''n'' is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  If 5 + 5 digits is used, the first 5 digits give the easting in meters, measured from the left edge of the square, and the last 5 digits give the northing in meters, measured from the bottom edge of the square.  The resolution in this case is 1 meter, so the MGRS coordinate would represent a 1-meter square, where the easting and northing are measured to its southwest corner.  If a resolution of 10 meters is enough, the final digit of the easting and northing can be dropped, so that only 4 + 4 digits are used, representing a 10-meter square.  If a 100-meter resolution is enough, 3 + 3 digits suffice; if a 1&amp;nbsp;km resolution is enough, 2 + 2 digits suffice; if 10&amp;nbsp;km resolution is enough, 1 + 1 digits suffice.
10 meter resolution (4 + 4 digits) is sufficient for many purposes, and is the NATO standard for specifying coordinates.

If we zoom in on Hawaii (figure 2), we see that the square that contains Honolulu, if we use 10&amp;nbsp;km resolution, would be written 4QFJ15.

If the grid zone or 100,000-meter square are clear from context, they can be dropped, and only the numerical location is specified. For example:
*If every position being located is within the same grid zone, only the 100,000-meter square and numerical location are specified.
*If every position being located is within the same grid zone and 100,000-meter square, only the numerical location is specified.
*However, even if every position being located is within a small area, but the area overlaps multiple 100,000-meter squares or grid zones, the entire grid reference is required.

One always reads map coordinates from west to east first (easting), then from south to north (northing). Common mnemonics include "in the house, up the stairs", "left-to-right, bottom-to-top" and "Read Right Up".

===Truncate, don't round===
As mentioned above, when converting UTM coordinates to an MGRS grid reference, or when abbreviating an MGRS grid reference to lower precision, one should ''truncate'' the coordinates, not round. This has been controversial in the past, since the oldest specification, TM8358.1,&lt;ref name="DMA8358_1_Chapter3"/&gt; used rounding, as did GEOTRANS&lt;ref name="Geotrans"&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/geotrans/index.html GEOTRANS] Geographic Translator software and source code from the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; before version 3.0.
However, truncation is used in GEOTRANS since version 3.0, and in NGA Military Map Reading 201&lt;ref name="Military_Map_Reading_201"/&gt; (page 5) and in the US Army Field Manual 3-25.26.&lt;ref name="Field_Manual_3_25_26"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-25-26/index.html Map Reading and Land Navigation], U.S. Army Field Manual No. 3-25.26 (see section 4-6).&lt;/ref&gt; The civilian version of MGRS, [[USNG]], also uses truncation.&lt;ref name="Cavell"&gt;J. Anthony Cavell, [http://www.amerisurv.com/PDF/TheAmericanSurveyor_USNationalGrid-Cavell_June2005.pdf USNG: Getting it right the first time]. ''The American Surveyor,'' June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Squares that cross a latitude band boundary==
The boundaries of the latitude bands are parallel circles (dashed black lines in figure 1), which do not coincide with the boundaries of the 100,000-meter squares (blue lines in figure 1).  For example, at the boundary between grid zones 1P and 1Q, we find a 100,000-meter square BT, of which about two thirds is south of latitude 16° and therefore in grid zone 1P, while one third is north of 16° and therefore in 1Q.  So, an MGRS grid reference for a position in BT should begin with 1PBT in the south part of BT, and with 1QBT in the north part of BT.  At least, this is possible if the precision of the grid reference is enough to place the denoted area completely inside either 1P or 1Q. 

But an MGRS grid reference can denote an area that crosses a latitude band boundary. For example, when describing the entire square BT, should it be called 1PBT or 1QBT?  Or when describing the 1000-meter square BT8569, should it be called 1PBT8569 or 1QBT8569? In these cases, software that interprets an MGRS grid reference should accept both of the possible latitude band letters.  A practical motivation was given in the release notes for GEOTRANS,&lt;ref name="Geotrans"/&gt; Release 2.0.2, 1999:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The MGRS module was changed to make the final latitude check on MGRS to UTM conversions sensitive to the precision of the input MGRS coordinate string.  The lower the input precision, the more "slop" is allowed in the final check on the latitude zone letter.  This is to handle an issue raised by some F-16 pilots, who truncate MGRS strings that they receive from the Army.  This truncation can put them on the wrong side of a latitude zone boundary, causing the truncated MGRS string to be considered invalid.  The correction causes truncated strings to be considered valid if any part of the square which they denote lies within the latitude zone specified by the third letter of the string.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Polar regions==
[[Image:MGRSgridSouthPole.png|thumb|Figure 3. The MGRS grid around the South Pole.]] 

[[Image:MGRSgridNorthPole.png|thumb|Figure 4. The MGRS grid around the North Pole.]] 

In the polar regions, a different convention is used.&lt;ref name="Appendix_B"&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tm8358.1/tr83581f.html DMA Technical Manual 8358.1, Appendix B.] Datums, Ellipsoids, Grids, and Grid Reference Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;  South of 80°S, UPS South ([[Universal Polar Stereographic]]) is used instead of a UTM projection.  The west half-circle forms a grid zone with designation A; the east half-circle forms one with designation B; see figure 3.  North of 84°N, UPS North is used,  and the west half-circle is Y, the east one is Z; see figure 4.  Since the letters A, B, Y, and Z are not used for any latitude bands of UTM, their presence in an MGRS coordinate, with the omission of a zone number, indicates that the coordinates are in the UPS system. 

The lettering scheme for 100,000&amp;nbsp;m squares is slightly different in the polar regions.  The column letters use a more restricted alphabet, going from A to Z but omitting D, E, I, M, N, O, V, W; the columns are arranged so that the rightmost column in grid zone A and Y has column letter Z, and the next column in grid zone B or Z starts over with column letter A.  The row letters go from A to Z, omitting I and O.  The restricted column alphabet for UPS ensures that no UPS square will be adjacent to a UTM square with the same identification.

In the polar regions, there is only one version of the lettering scheme.&lt;ref name="Appendix_B"/&gt;

[[Image:Crocus Bonte Krokus.jpg|thumb|150px|A group of crocuses (''Crocus'') in flower]]
'''Ornamental bulbous plants''', often called '''ornamental bulbs''' or just '''bulbs''' in [[gardening]] and [[horticulture]], are [[herbaceous]] [[Perennial plant|perennials]] grown for ornamental purposes, which have underground or near ground [[storage organs]]. Botanists distinguish between true [[bulb]]s, [[corms]], [[rhizome]]s, [[tuber|tubers and tuberous roots]], any of which may be termed "bulbs" in horticulture. Bulb species usually lose their upper parts during adverse conditions such as summer drought and heat or winter cold. The bulb's storage organs contain moisture and nutrients that are used to survive these adverse conditions in a dormant state. When conditions become favourable the reserves sustain a new growth cycle. In addition, bulbs permit vegetative or asexual multiplication in these species.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}} Ornamental bulbs are used in [[park]]s and [[gardens]] and as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]].{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}}

==Terminology==

The word "bulb" has a somewhat different meaning to [[botany|botanists]] than it does to gardeners and [[horticulture|horticulturalists]]. In the context of gardening, a "bulb" is a plant's underground or ground-level storage organ that can be dried, stored and sold in this state, and then planted to grow again. Many bulbs in this sense are produced by "[[storage organ|geophyte]]s", i.e. plants whose growing point is below ground level. However, not all bulbs in the gardening sense are produced by geophytes. For example, [[rhizome|rhizomatous]] [[Iris (plant)|irises]] are included in books on ornamental bulbs, but their growing points are above ground. Many bulbs are produced by [[lilioid monocots]], but not all lilioid monocots have bulbs. [[Brian Mathew]] says that "we just have to accept that there is no accurate term which we can use for this group of plants and we are left with 'bulbs' as the snappiest and most convenient."{{sfn|Mathew|1997|p=1}}

Botanically, gardeners' "bulbs" may be true bulbs, corms, rhizomes or tubers,{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}} or combinations of these.

==Types==

===True bulbs===
[[File:Red onion cut labelled.svg|thumb|Bulb of a red onion, cut vertically]]
{{main|Bulb}}
A true [[bulb]] (i.e. a bulb in the botanical sense) is an underground vertical [[shoot]] that has modified [[leaf|leaves]] (or thickened leaf bases) that are used as [[food]] storage organs by the plant. The bottom of the bulb is made up of a short section of stem forming the basal plate. Storage leaves are produced from the top of the basal plate, roots from the underside.&lt;ref name=Ster06/&gt; Other examples of species with true bulbs, apart from those already mentioned, are ''[[Muscari]], [[Tulipa]] and [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]''.{{sfn|Schauenberg|1965|p=2}}

===Corms===
[[File:CormAnatomy5686.jpg|thumb|''[[Crocosmia]]'' corm, showing solid construction with outer tunic and shoots emerging from the top ]]
{{main|Corm}}
A [[corm]] is a short, vertical, swollen underground [[plant]] [[Plant stem|stem]] consisting of one or more [[internodes]] with at least one growing point, with protective leaves modified into skins or tunics.  The thin tunic leaves are dry papery, dead sheaths, formed from the leaves produced the year before. They act as a covering that protects the corm from insects and water loss. Internally a corm is mostly made of starch-containing [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells above a more-or-less circular basal node that grows roots. Corms are sometimes confused with true bulbs; they are often similar in appearance to bulbs externally, but corms are internally structured with solid tissues, which distinguishes them from bulbs, which are mostly made up of layered fleshy scales.&lt;ref name=Ster06/&gt;

===Rhizomes===
[[File:Gingembre.jpg|thumb|Dried ginger rhizome]]
{{main|Rhizome}}
A rhizome is a horizontal [[plant stem|stem]] that often grows underground, usually sending out [[root]]s and [[shoot]]s from its nodes. Some plants have rhizomes that grow above ground or that lie at the soil surface, including some ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' species. Usually, rhizomes have short internodes; they send out roots from the bottom of the nodes and new upward-growing shoots from the top of the nodes. Examples of plants that grow in this way include [[iris (plant)|iris]]es, [[lily of the valley]] (''Convallaria majalis'') and [[Canna (plant)|cannas]].&lt;ref name=Ster06/&gt;

===Tubers===
[[File:Root tubers of Dahlia variabilis.png|thumb|Root tubers of ''Dahlia'']]
{{main|Tuber}}

A [[stem tuber]] may form from thickened [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]]s. The tops or sides of the tuber produce shoots that grow into typical stems and leaves, and the undersides produce [[root]]s. Such tubers tend to form at the sides of the parent plant and are most often located near the soil surface. A below ground stem tuber is normally a short-lived storage and regenerative organ developing from a shoot that branches off a mature plant. The new tubers are attached to a parent tuber or form at the end of an underground rhizome. In the autumn the plant dies except for the new offspring stem tubers, which in spring regrow one or more new shoots producing stems and leaves. Some plants also form smaller tubers and/or tubercules, which act like [[seed]]s, producing small plants that resemble (in morphology and size) seedlings. Some stem tubers, such as those of tuberous [[begonia]]s, are long lived, but many tuberous plants have tubers that survive only until the plants are in full leaf, at which point the tuber is reduced to a shrivelled up husk.&lt;ref name=Ster06/&gt;

Roots can also form tuberous structures (tuberous roots) that are in some ways similar to stem tubers, but of a different anatomical origin. Ornamental plants with tuberous roots include the Persian buttercup, ''[[Ranunculus asiaticus]]'',{{sfn|Mathew|1997|pp=133–134}} and [[dahlia]]s.{{sfn|Mathew|1997|p=84}} When sold in the dry form, dahlia "bulbs" consist of a cluster of tuberous roots attached to one or more stems. Only the stems produce buds, from around the "collar" close to where the roots are attached. A tuber without any attached stem will not grow.&lt;ref name=Scha65/&gt;

Tubers may form from the [[hypocotyl]] of the young seedling, as in ''[[Cyclamen]]''.&lt;ref name=Grey88/&gt; Since the hypocotyl is a region between the stem and the roots, such tubers are variable in their anatomy and growth habits. Thus the roots of ''[[Cyclamen graecum]]'' grow from the base of the tuber, suggesting it is a stem tuber, whereas those of ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' mostly grow from the upper surface of the tuber, suggesting it is a root tuber.{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=12}}

==Environmental adaptations and distribution==

Annual species complete their life cycle during favourable seasons and pass unfavourable ones as seeds. Bulbous plants, on the other hand, have developed storage organs as a reserve to allow them to survive unfavourable conditions in a resting condition in order to begin growth again when environmental conditions become more favourable.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} The dormant or resting period may be in summer or winter, or may depend on rainfall, as in the tropics.{{sfn|Mathew|1997|pp=6–7}} The different strategies enable bulbous plants to survive adverse conditions such as extremely hot and dry summers, very cold winters, or periods of drought.

===Summer dormancy===

[[File:Crocus cartwrightianus Sounion 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'' flowering on 15 November in Greece]]

Most bulbous plants are adapted to hot, dry summers and cooler, wetter winters. They are dormant through the summer and grow during the autumn, winter and spring.{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=43}} Within this group, there are variations, largely determined by how cold the winter is. Many [[tulip]]s (''Tulipa'' species) of Asian origins, for example, have adapted to an extreme continental climate, with dry, very hot summers, very cold winters and springs with short showers. They grow mainly during the spring.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} In cultivation such tulips may be planted in late autumn (e.g. November in the northern hemisphere).{{sfn|Schauenberg|1965|p=267}} In regions where winters are milder, some species, such as ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'', flower in the autumn, either at the same time as the leaves appear or before.{{sfn|Mathew|1987|p=56}} Others, such as ''[[Arum creticum]]'', produce leaves in the autumn which last through the winter until the plant flowers in the spring.{{sfn|Mathew|1987|p=13}}

Summer drought occurs particularly, but not exclusively, in those regions of the world with a [[Mediterranean climate]], which are rich in bulbous plants. Such regions include the [[Mediterranean]] itself through to [[Central Asia]], the south west of [[South Africa]], the south west of [[Australia]], parts of the western United States, such as [[California]], and parts of western South America, particularly [[Chile]].{{sfn|Mathew|1997|pp=6–7}}

[[Image:Little Chittenden Wood - geograph.org.uk - 1861070.jpg|thumb|A [[bluebell wood]] in [[Kent]], England]]
Many species that grow in the [[understory]] of deciduous woods or forests are also summer dormant. They use their stored reserves in order to grow rapidly and complete their annual growth-cycle at the beginning of spring before the developing tree canopy blocks out the sun's light.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} North America is home to many such woodland bulbs, including ''[[Erythronium]]'', ''[[Trillium]]'' and some lilies, such as ''[[Lilium pardalinum]]''.{{sfn|Rix|1983|pp=128–130}} The common bluebell, ''[[Hyacinthoides non-scripta]]'', is native to western parts of Europe, but particularly the British Isles,&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/biodiversity/endangered-species/hyacinthoides-non-scripta/distribution-ecology/index.html |title=''Hyacinthoides non-scripta'' (British bluebell) &gt; Distribution and ecology |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |author=Fred Rumsey |work=Species of the day |accessdate=2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it carpets the floor of some woods. The woodlands of Asia, including [[China]] and [[Japan]], are home to bulbous plants such as [[arisaema]]s and the giant [[cardiocrinum]]s.{{sfn|Rix|1983|pp=128–130}}

Some bulbous plants grow in [[Community (ecology)|communities]] that are adapted to recurrent fires during the dry season (for example, many [[Iridaceae]] species). During these periods the plants are dormant and in this way can survive the heat of the fire. The fires clean the surface vegetation, eliminating competition and also supplying nutrients to the ground from the ashes of the burnt plants. When the first rains fall, the bulbs, corms and rhizomes rapidly start to shoot, starting a new period of growth and development sustained by the reserves accumulated in their storage tissues during the previous season.  Various South African species from the genus ''[[Cyrtanthus]]'', for example, are well known for their ability to flower rapidly after natural grassland wildfires, and for this reason several of these species are known as "fire lilies". In fact, some species, such as ''[[Cyrtanthus contractus]]'', only flower after a wildfire.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt;

===Winter dormancy===

[[File:Eucomis bicolor 2191.JPG|thumb|''[[Eucomis comosa]]'', a winter dormant bulbous plant]]
A second category of bulbous plants are those adapted to dry, generally cool winters and warmer, wetter summers. They are dormant through the winter and grow in spring, summer and autumn. Regions of South Africa and [[Lesotho]] with this type of climate include the East Cape, and the [[Drakensberg]] mountains in the north east of [[Western Cape]] province, which are particularly rich in bulbous species,{{sfn|Phillips|Rix|1989}} including plants such as [[Gladiolus|gladioli]], ''[[Eucomis]]'' and ''[[Rhodohypoxis]]''. Other areas with similar winter drought include parts of Central America, such as [[Mexico]] where the tiger flower (''[[Tigridia pavonia]]'') is found.{{sfn|Mathew|1997|p=11–12}}

===Seasonal dormancy===

In some areas of the tropics, rainfall is interspersed with periods of dryness; more than one wet/dry cycle may occur in a year. Bulbous plants in these areas are adapted to warm, wet periods followed by warm, dry periods. They typically flower near the beginning of the rainy season. Such a climate occurs in Kenya, which has wet conditions in October to December and then again in February to May. Glory-lilies (''[[Gloriosa (plant)|Gloriosa]]'') and ''[[Crinum]]'' species are examples of bulbous plants adapted to these conditions. Tropical Asia has similarly adapted bulbous plants, such as species of ''[[Hedychium]]'' (gingers).{{sfn|Rix|1983|pp=89–92}}

== History of use ==

Plants with fleshy underground parts were probably first used as food. [[Onion]]s (''Allium cepa'') were cultivated in [[Ancient Egypt]]. In [[South America]], the [[potato]] (''Solanum tuberosum''), [[Oxalis tuberosa|oca]] (''Oxalis tuberosa'') and the [[sweet potato]] (''Ipomoea batatas'') were cultivated for thousands of years.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} Other parts of bulbous plants were also used in cooking. The [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s of [[Crete]] grew and traded [[saffron]] (either the wild species ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'' or the cultivated ''Crocus sativus''). The plant is depicted in paintings from around 1550 BC.{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=93}} Saffron consists of the dried [[stigma (botany)|stigmas]] of the flowers, and is used as a spice and also as a dye.{{sfn|Mathew|1987|p=56}} Some bulbous plants were used in medicine in [[Classical antiquity|classical times]]; one example is the [[Drimia maritima|sea squill]] (''Drimia maritima'') which grows from a true bulb.{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=93}}

[[Image:Fresque_du_printemps,_Akrotiri,_Grèce.jpg|thumb|Lilies on a Bronze Age fresco from excavations at Akrotriri, [[Santorini]], Greece]]
Wall paintings dated to around 1700–1600 BC from [[Santorini#Minoan Akrotiri|Minoan Akrotiri]] provide some of the earliest evidence for the apparently ornamental use of bulbous plants. Some of the plants in the frescos are clearly lilies, which have usually been identified as ''[[Lilium candidum]]''. However, this species has white flowers, and those in the frescos are red, which suggests they may be ''[[Lilium chalcedonicum]]''.&lt;ref name=Nuge08/&gt; ''L.&amp;nbsp;candidum'', the Madonna lily, was later used as a symbol in Christianity, where the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] was represented with lilies in her hands.{{sfn|Schauenberg|1965|p=204}} The symbol of the Fleur de Lys was originally based on the flower of a species of [[Iris (plant)|Iris]] ''([[Iris pseudacorus]]'') that appeared in Egyptian and Indian religious paintings long before it was adopted as the emblem of the kings of France in the 5th Century.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Many ornamental bulbs were introduced into Europe via [[Turkey]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent]] (who reigned 1520–1566) was noted for his love of gardens, where tulips and other bulbs were grown. [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], the ambassador to the sultan from [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]] in Vienna, observed ornamental bulbous plants such as narcissi, hyacinths and "those which the Turks call tulipam".{{sfn|Rix|1983|p=93}} The botanist [[Carolus Clusius]], who was based in Vienna from 1573 to around 1580, devoted one volume of his 1576 botanical work ''Rariorum Plantarum Historia'' to bulbs, some of which he knew from introductions via Turkey, such as tulips, ''[[Iris susiana]]'', ''[[Galanthus elwesii]]'' and ''[[Fritillaria persica]]''. Clusius had a major impact on bulb growing in Europe. Through his later position as the Director of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Leiden Botanic Garden]], he established the Netherlands as the centre of commercial ornamental bulb growing.{{sfn|Rix|1983|pp=94–95}}

It is therefore apparent that bulbous plants have served as food and symbols of religion and royal power for thousands of years. They have also been admired and used for the beauty of their flowers since time immemorial and by many civilizations. The list of the countries that have used bulbous plants as ornaments since the Christian era is long and includes [[Greece]], [[Egypt]], [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[India]] among others. The list of genera cultivated in these countries as ornamental plants is even longer: ''[[Lycoris (plant)|Lycoris]],'' ''[[Lilium]], [[Crocus]], [[Cyclamen]], [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]], [[Scilla]], [[Gladiolus]], [[Muscari]], [[Ranunculus]], [[Allium]], [[Iris (plant)|Iris]] and [[Hyacinth (plant)|Hyacinthus]]''.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}}

==Bulbous plants in the garden==
Some varieties of bulbous plants thrive under adverse conditions such as poor soil or shade, and are therefore well suited to use in a garden. Varieties can be chosen that bloom at various times of year. They can be intermingled with other plants, used in pots, or even placed in the lawn or underneath fruit trees.{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}}{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}

Regarding their size, it is possible to find species that only grow a few centimetres such as ''[[Crocus minimus]]'' up to examples of 3.6m such as ''[[Cardiocrinum giganteum]]''.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Taylor|1996}}

While some bulbs are poisonous or at least inedible to humans,{{examples|date=February 2017}} many bulbs – especially those of the [[onion]] family ([[leeks]], [[garlic]], [[chives]], [[shallots]]) – are grown both privately and commercially as food crops. The onion especially provides the basis for a huge variety of dishes.

=== Flowerbeds and borders ===

Bulb species are traditionally planted in flowerbeds ([[parterre]]s) and [[herbaceous border]]s in parks and gardens. The selection of species to plant depends on various factors, such as the soil type, the position (sunny or shady location), the colour or effect that is required and the season of the year when the plants are required to flower.
[[Image:Tulips 09148.jpg|thumb|Border of tulips planted among [[pansy|pansies]]]]
Some examples of bulbous plant genera and their flowering season are given below:
* Spring flowering bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bulb center spring blooming bulbs|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/spring-blooming-bulbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spring Flowering Bulbs Picture Book|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/photos/Spring-flowering-Picture-Book.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring is the most typical season for bulbs to flower. Some examples are: ''[[Allium]], [[Arum]], [[Asphodelus]], [[Camassia]], [[Convallaria]], [[Crocus]], [[Cyclamen]], [[Eranthis]], [[Freesia]], [[Fritillaria]], [[Galanthus]], [[Hyacinth (plant)|Hyacinth]]us, [[Hippeastrum]], [[Iris (plant)|Iris]], [[Ixia]], [[Leucojum]], [[Muscari]], [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]], [[Ornithogalum]], [[Ranunculus]], [[Scilla]], [[Trillium]] and [[Tulipa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tulip Picture Book|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/photos/Tulip-book.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Zephyranthes]]''.
* Summer flowering bulbs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bulb center summer blooming bulbs|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/summer-blooming-bulbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer Flowering Bulbs Picture Book|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/photos/Summer-flowering-bulbs-Picture-Book.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Achimenes]], [[Agapanthus]], [[Allium]], [[Alstroemeria]], [[Amaryllis]], [[Anemone]], [[Begonia]], [[Calochortus]], [[Canna (plant)|Canna]], [[Crinum]], [[Crocosmia]], [[Dahlia]], [[Dierama]], [[Eucomis]], [[Galtonia]], [[Gladiolus]], [[Gloriosa (plant)|Gloriosa]], [[Haemanthus]], [[Hymenocallis]], [[Lilium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lily Picture Book|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/photos/Lily-book.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxalis]], [[Pancratium (plant)|Pancratium]], [[Paradisea]], [[Polianthes]], [[Sprekelia]], [[Tritonia (plant)|Tritonia]], [[Watsonia (plant)|Watsonia]], [[Zantedeschia]].''
* Autumn (fall) flowering bulbs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bulb center autumn blooming bulbs|url=http://www.bulbsonline.org/ibc-jsp/en/education/beroepsonderwijs/autumn-blooming-bulbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crocus]], [[Colchicum]], [[Cyclamen]], [[Nerine]], [[Sternbergia]].''
* Winter flowering bulbs: some species from the following genera: ''[[Galanthus]], [[Crocus]], [[Cyclamen]]'' and ''[[Eranthis]].''

Some species of bulbous plants grow naturally in shady or woodland areas, and thus are well suited to areas in a garden that have similar conditions. Some species for shade are ''[[Allium ursinum]], [[Anemone blanda]], [[Anemone nemorosa]], [[Arum italicum]], [[Convallaria majalis]], [[Corydalis flexuosa]],  [[Cyclamen purpurascens]], Disporum flavescens, [[Erythronium]], [[Fritillaria pallidiflora]], [[Galanthus]], [[Hyacinthoides non-scripta]], [[Iris douglasiana]], Leucojum vernum, [[Lilium martagon]], [[Ranunculus ficaria]], [[Sanguinaria canadensis]], [[Smilacina racemosa]], [[Trillium]]'' and ''[[Uvularia grandiflora]]''.

=== Naturalization   ===

In large parks it is possible to plant some species so that they multiply spontaneously and grow amongst the grass or under trees. This practice, the naturalization of a species, is widely used in northern Europe and requires that the species' ecological requirements be satisfied. The most obvious advantage of this cultivation method is that it minimizes the attention the plants require once they have been naturalized.  The plants that are suitable for naturalization are those that are sufficiently small but able to compete with the surrounding grass, they must be robust and able to withstand year after year of inclement weather and they must be prolific in order to spread rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscaping brochure, International bulb centre|url=http://video.bulbsonline.org/emag/HOVUK/flash.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flower Bulb Research Program, Dept. of Horticulture, Cornell University|url=http://www.flowerbulbs.cornell.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Victoria Park, crocuses.jpg|thumb|Naturalized crocuses in Victoria Park, London]]
Some of the bulbs that are suitable for naturalization in parks include: ''[[Allium]],'' ''[[Anemone]],'' ''[[Arum]],'' ''[[Colchicum]]'', ''[[Crocus]],'' ''[[Cyclamen]],'' '' [[Hyacinthoides|Endymion]],'' ''[[Fritillaria]], [[Galanthus]], [[Ipheion]], [[Leucojum]], [[Lilium]], [[Muscari]], [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]], [[Ornithogalum]], [[Scilla]], [[Sternbergia]]'' and ''[[Tulipa]].''

===  Rock gardens ===

A [[rock garden]] is a garden that uses a combination of rocks and small plants. The plants are often chosen for their suitability to rocky terrain. Some of the bulb genera that are most suitable for rock gardens include:{{sfn|Rossi|1990}} ''[[Allium]]'', ''[[Anemone]]'', ''[[Anthericum]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium]]'', ''[[Chionodoxa]]'', ''[[Cyclamen]]'', ''[[Eranthis]]'', ''[[Erythronium]]'', ''[[Galanthus]]'', ''[[Ipheion]]'', ''[[Muscari]]'', ''[[Ornithogalum]]'', ''[[Oxalis]]'', ''[[Romulea]]'', ''Rhodohypoxis'' and ''[[Scilla]]''.

== Multiplication ==

Bulbs can reproduce [[Plant reproduction#Sexual reproduction|sexually]], through seeds, or even [[Plant reproduction#Asexual reproduction|vegetatively]]. Reproduction through seeds is generally used to rapidly increase the number of individuals of a given species and to improve genetic diversity. Many of the bulb species are [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]], so pollination can only occur between [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] of different plants in order to obtain seeds. The majority of seeds from bulbous plants germinate well if they are sown as soon as they reach maturity. Some species need a cold period in order to germinate.
The biggest problem in reproducing through seeds is that the resulting plants have a greater variability in a wide range of characteristics, such as flower colour and height and flowering period. This means that asexual or vegetative reproduction is normally used commercially to propagate this type of plant. This means that the characteristics of a determined cultivar remain unaltered.&lt;ref name=Skel78/&gt;

Bulbs can reproduce vegetatively in a number of ways depending of the type of storage organ the plant has.&lt;ref name=Skel78 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HartKest87/&gt;&lt;ref name=infojardin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keen04/&gt;

== Commercial production ==
[[Image:Bollenveld Hillegom.JPG|thumb|Commercial tulip field in Hillegom, the Netherlands]]

Bulbs can be [[evergreen]], such as ''[[Clivia]],'' ''[[Agapanthus]]'' and some species and varieties of ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' and ''[[Hemerocallis]]''. However, the majority are [[deciduous]], dying down to the storage organ for part of the year. This characteristic has been taken advantage of in the commercialization of these plants. At the beginning of the rest period the bulbs can be dug out of the ground and prepared for sale as if they remain dry they do not need any nutrition for weeks or months.{{sfn|Rossi|1990}}{{sfn|Hessayon|1999}}

Bulbous plants are produced on an industrial scale for two main markets, cut flowers and dried bulbs. The bulbs are produced to satisfy the demand for bulbs for parks, gardens and as house plants, in addition to providing the bulbs necessary for the production of cut flowers. The international trade in cut flowers has a worldwide value of approximately 11,000 million Euros, which gives an idea of the economic importance of this activity.

The Netherlands has been the leader in commercial production since the start of the 16th Century, both for the dried bulb market and for cut flowers.  In fact, with approximately 30,000 [[hectare]]s dedicated to this activity the production of bulbs in the Netherlands represents 65% of global production. The Netherlands also produces 95% of the international market in bulbs dedicated to the production of cut flowers. The [[United States]] is the second largest producer followed by [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Brazil]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=Clap01/&gt;

== International societies dedicated to bulbous plants ==

* [[International Bulb Society]]. http://www.bulbsociety.org/
:Established in 1933, this society is an international educational and scientific organization, it is a charity dedicated to the dissemination of information regarding the cultivation, conservation and botany of all types of bulbous plants. Their website contains an excellent gallery of high quality photographs of bulbous plants.

* The [[Pacific Bulb Society]]. http://www.pacificbulbsociety.org/
:Organized in 2002, this society disseminates information and shares experiences regarding the cultivation of ornamental bulbous plants. Their website contains an exceptional educational resource, "Pacific Bulb Society Wiki", with images and information regarding numerous species of bulbous plants.

'''Province Island''' ({{lang-fr|Île de la Province}}) is an island mostly in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Québec]], but partly in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]]. It is situated in  [[Lake Memphremagog]]. The island's area is 0.31&amp;nbsp;km². Although 0.028&amp;nbsp;km² (9%) at its southern point is part of the United States (Town of [[Derby, Vermont|Derby]], [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans County]] in the state of [[Vermont]]), the greater part belongs to the city of [[Magog, Quebec|Magog]], in [[Memphrémagog Regional County Municipality]], Quebec.  At the end of the 18th century a pioneer named Martin Adams and his wife built a house on the island, where they grew [[flax]] and [[vegetable]]s. The island used to be known as ''Zabriskie'' and ''Howard Island''. It is under private ownership; a [[pheasant]] hunt is organized annually. The [[Canada–United States border]] is marked by a [[Border vista|five-meter strip]] cut through the forest.

'''Sibutu Passage''' is a deep channel some 18 miles (29&amp;nbsp;km) wide that separates [[Borneo]] from the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. It has a deep sill allowing entry of deep water into the Sulu basin while connecting the [[Sulu Sea]] with the [[Sulawesi Sea]] that feeds from the [[Pacific Ocean]] by the [[Mindanao Current]].

Although [[H. Otley Beyer]] argued in favor of a [[Models of migration to the Philippines|settlement of the Philippines]] across [[land bridge]]s during the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], modern [[bathymetry|bathymetric]] soundings have shown that the centers of the Sibutu Passage and the [[Mindoro Strait]] are both deep enough that they probably still existed at that time, although the Sulu and other [[Philippine Islands]] beyond were one connected island. If verified, therefore, the [[Callao Man]] would have needed to have crossed open sea to reach the islands.

It was established after a rearrangement of related sections of the Anthropological Society, itself formed in 1873 by [[Hjalmar Stolpe]], [[Hans Hildebrand]], [[Oscar Montelius]], and [[Gustaf Retzius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Culin |first=Stewart |title=Hjalmar Stolpe |journal=American Anthropologist |publisher=American Anthropological Association |date=January–March 1906 |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnl0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=%22Swedish+Society+for+Anthropology+and+Geography |doi=10.1525/aa.1906.8.1.02a00160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society functions as a link between science and the public, especially in the subjects of [[anthropology]] and [[geography]]. It awards research fellowships, organizes excursions and lectures, hands out awards such as the Vega Medal and Retzius Medal. In 1880, it began publishing the Swedish yearbook ''[[Ymer (journal)|Ymer]]'' and it has published the international journal ''[[Geografiska Annaler]]'' since 1919. The journal is divided between [[physical geography]] and [[human geography]]. In 2018, it established ''[[kritisk etnografi]]''.

== Awards given by the society ==
The society created the ''[[Vega (ship)|Vega]]'' Medal in 1881 on the occasion of Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld's return to Stockholm, after he had discovered the [[Northern Sea Route|North East Passage]]. Since then, the Vega Medal has been awarded to a physical geographer roughly every three years. In the intervening years, the society awarded the [[Anders Retzius]] Medal to a human geographer or an anthropologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helmfrid | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Geography in Sweden | url = | journal = Belgeo | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, however, it was decided that awarding a medal named after Retzius wasn't appropriate anymore, considering that his racial studies (that included the active collection of [[skull]]s from [[indigenous people]]s) are met with disapproval by modern anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kleen |first=Björn af |date=2015-03-07 |title=Stopp för medalj till rasforskarens minne |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/stopp-for-medalj-till-rasforskarens-minne-1/ |newspaper=Dagens Nyheter |location= |access-date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the SSAG medal was given to [[Didier Fassin]] in 2016. The awards are handed out by the king of Sweden on 24 April, the anniversary of Nordenskiöld's return to Stockholm.

The regulation of '''telephone numbers in Germany''' is the responsibility of the [[Federal Network Agency]] (''German:'' Bundesnetzagentur, BNetzA) of the [[German government]]. The agency has a mandate to [[telecommunications in Germany]] and other infrastructure systems.

== Overview ==
Germany has an open [[telephone numbering plan]]. There used to be no fixed lengths for either area codes or subscriber telephone numbers, meaning that some subscriber numbers may be as short as two digits. As a result, dialing sequences are generally of a variable length, except for some non-geographic area codes for which subscriber numbers use a fixed-length format. It is not possible to determine unambiguously the end of a phone number from a prefix or the digits already dialed. This feature allows the extension of the length of phone numbers without revoking or changing existing numbers.
Cell phone numbers in Germany are not given geographic area codes but non-geographic codes. Thus they can easily be told apart from other numbers.

A new numbering plan was introduced on May 3, 2010. Since then new landline phone numbers have a standard length of 11 digits including the area code and omitting the trunk prefix 0. Area codes remain as they are and are still variable in length. Exceptions to the 11 digit rule are the four cities of [[Berlin]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Munich]] which are the only cities with two digit area codes and require only 10 digit numbers so as not to exceed the maximum length of 8 digits for a subscriber number.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/cln_1911/DE/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Unternehmen_Institutionen/Nummerierung/Nummerierungskonzept/nummerierungskonzept_node.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The German telephone network uses 5200 geographical area codes, the length of which varies from two to five digits (not including the [[trunk prefix|trunk code]] 0), with five-digit area codes only being assigned in the [[new states of Germany|New States]] (prefix 03). In general, geographic area codes start with digits 02 to 09, whereas other non-geographic area codes including those for cell phone usage are assigned to 01 and network services to 11.&lt;ref name="nk09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BNetzA/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Regulierung/Nummernverwaltung/Nummerierungskonzept/Nummerierungskonzept2011pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|author=Bundesnetzagentur (''Federal Network Agency'')|title=Nummerierungskonzept 2011 (''Numbering Concept of 2011'')|accessdate=2012-08-09|language=German}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic numbering ==
{{Main|Area codes in Germany}}
Geographic area codes have a length of two to five digits. The maximum total length is eleven digits.

Geographic numbers are assigned to carriers in blocks, from which these carriers can make derivative assignments to subscribers.

Subscriber numbers do not start with 0 or 11 and can be called directly from landlines within the same geographic area code.

Originally, the first digits following the area code would indicate a smaller area within these area codes or the type of the subscriber line ([[Plain old telephone service|analogue]] or [[ISDN]]). However, this is no longer true as subscribers can keep their numbers when moving within an area code or when switching from analogue to ISDN. Further, new carriers assign numbers from different blocks.

* (0xx) xxxx-xxxx
:This is the format used for the four largest geographic areas in Germany: Berlin (030), Hamburg (040), Frankfurt (069) and Munich (089).
:Newly assigned numbers have a length of eight digits for the local subscriber number, yielding a total length of ten digits (not including the 0 trunk code). This is shorter than the maximum of eleven digits in other areas in order to avoid local numbers to be longer than eight digits.
:Numbers assigned in the past, which are generally grandfathered, may be as short as five digits.

* (0xxx) xxxx-xxxx
:In area codes that use three digits, newly assigned numbers (for all locations from May 2010, some cities earlier: [[Cologne]] already in February 2007) also have a length of eight digits, yielding a total length of eleven digits. Grandfathered numbers may be as short as four digits (seven total).

* (0xxxx) xxx-xxxx
:In area codes that use four digits, newly assigned numbers (for all locations from May 2010, some cities earlier: e.g. [[Heidelberg]] already in May 2003) have a length of seven digits, also yielding a total length of eleven digits. Grandfathered numbers may be as short as three digits (seven total) in very rural areas.

* (03xxxx) xx-xxxx
:Some smaller areas in [[New states of Germany|former East Germany]] use five-digit area codes, all of which start with 3. Newly assigned numbers (for all locations from May 2010, some locations earlier) have a length of six digits, also yielding a total length of eleven digits.

== Non-geographic numbering ==
{{Main|Area codes in Germany}}
Non-geographic numbers were originally assigned the prefix 01. However, some of these services have been moved to other area codes.

* 010xy, 0100yy
:These numbers can be dialled in front of the actual phone number in order to select a carrier ([[call-by-call]]).

* 011…
:Area codes starting with 011 overlap the prefix for network services. In general, these numbers cannot be dialled from abroad, with the exception being 0116xxx (or +49-116xxx) for [[harmonised services of social value]].

* 012xx-xxxxxxx…
:The prefix 012 has been assigned as a testbed for innovative services such as VoIP or unified messaging, for which no other area codes were available. Allocations were only valid for a maximum of five years, after which new numbers would have to be assigned. Recent requests for registrations have been declined and referred to the premium-rate services under 0900. When the last remaining allocation expires in 2011, the prefix is planned to be returned to the reserved range.

* 0137-xxx xxxxxxx, (0138-1xxx…)
:The area code 0137 is assigned for services which may result in a high number of connections in a fairly short period of time, e. g. votes or competitions initiated from TV or radio shows. The first digit indicates the rate for a call, the second digit indicates the maximum number of calls that can be handled per time period.
:There are also sixteen&lt;ref name="nk09"/&gt; grandfathered numbers in the range 0138-1, which have originally been allocated by [[Deutsche Bundespost]].

* 015xx-xxxxxxx, 016x-xxxxxxx, 017x-xxxxxxx
:Mobile numbers are assigned non-geographic area codes starting with 015, 016 and 017 and have a length of 3 or 4 digits without the trunk prefix. The numbers have a total length of ten or eleven digits without the trunk prefix: numbers starting with 17 or 16 are 10 digits long except 176 and 1609 which are 11 digits long like the numbers starting with 15. 
:Network operators issue area codes as listed in the following table.

:However, since the advent of [[mobile number portability]], mobile phone number prefixes can no longer be relied on to determine the current operator behind a particular mobile phone number – only the original operator. As mobile phone plans often include different rates for intra-network calls it is important for users on such plans to know the network operator of the party they wish to call. The information on which number is registered to which cellular network is updated daily and is publicly available. 
:All network operators offer free automated services that can be reached via phone and/or internet and give users the ability to enter any number and determine which network the number belongs to. 

* 018xx-xxxxxxx…018xxxxxxx-xx
:The prefix 018 is used for user groups. The length of the block number and the terminal number is flexible from two to seven digits. However, the sum is always nine digits, yielding a total length of eleven digits including the 18.

* 0180-xxxxxxx
:The area code 0180 is used for service-oriented services such as call centres, hotlines, etc. Prior to 2010-03-01, these numbers were known as shared cost services, a name that had been obsoleted by falling prices for national calls.

* 0181-xxx-x…, 0181-xxxx-x…
:The area code 0181 is used for international virtual private networks (international user groups). The length of the IVPN block number is three or four digits; the terminal number may be up to seven digits.

* 019xxx
:Numbers from 0191 to 0194 are used for dial-up access to online services (e.g. to the [[Internet]]).

* 0198…, 0199…
:Numbers starting with 0198 and 0199 are reserved for routing of service numbers and network-internal use.

* 031-x
:The numbers 031-0 and 031-1 are test numbers that will reach a recorded announcement indicating the selected carrier for long-distance and local calls, respectively.

* 032-xxxxxxxxx
:National subscriber numbers have been allocated the area code 032. They are similar to geographic numbers but not tied to a specific location, allowing for nomadic use. Unlike personal numbers, national subscriber numbers are assigned to carriers in blocks, from which these carriers can make derivative assignments to subscribers. The total length is eleven digits (not counting the 0).

* 0700-xxxxxxxx
:The area code 0700 is used for [[personal numbering]]. Unlike national subscriber numbers, the numbers are assigned individually, allowing for memorable numbers.

* 0800-xxxxxxx
:The area code 0800 is assigned to [[freephone]] numbers. The numbers are assigned individually, allowing for memorable numbers.

* 0900-x-xxxxxx
:The area code 0900 is assigned to premium-rate services. The first digit following the area code indicates the service type:

:{| class="wikitable"
! scope="col" | Prefix
! scope="col" | Service Type
|-
! scope="row" | 0900-1
| Information services (no adult content)
|-
! scope="row" | 0900-3
| Entertainment services (no adult content)
|-
! scope="row" | 0900-5
| Other services (including those offering adult content)
|}
:The numbers are assigned individually, allowing for memorable numbers.

* 09009-xxxxxxx
:So-called "dialers", that is programmes that call a premium-rate service or modify a computer's configuration to call such a service must use numbers using the area code 09009. These programmes must also be registered with the Federal Network Agency.

=== Emergency and network services ===
Network services are not dialed with the trunk prefix 0. They resemble local numbers that start with 11 but usually cannot be dialed after an area code.

* 110 - Police
* 112 - Fire brigade, ambulance, rescue services (also the universal emergency number in the EU)
* 115 - Civil services; requests are either answered directly or forwarded to the competent authority.
* 116 xxx - [[Harmonised services of social value]]
* 118 xx - Directory assistance
* 19 222 - Non-emergency medical transports. This number is not an emergency number but a local number assigned uniformly in all geographic area codes. This requires dialling the area code from mobile phones or other non-geographic lines.
:(Originally, the block 19 xxx was used for local numbers assigned uniformly in all or several geographic area codes. All other allocations have already been converted to ordinary geographic numbers.)

==History==
FIXME
--&gt;

== History ==
Before [[German reunification]], [[West Germany]] (including [[West Berlin]]) used country code +49 and [[East Germany]] used country code [[+37]], each with its separate area codes and telephone networks. In 1992, two years after reunification, the phone networks were merged under country code +49.

Geographic numbers in the New States were assigned area codes starting with 03, in some cases followed by the former East German area code (without the initial 0) or a code similar to it. Thus, [[Leipzig]], for example, which had used East German domestic area code 041, was assigned the new area code 0341 in the unified telephone system. On the other hand, some area codes were changed: for example, the small town of [[Zossen]] used to have East German area code 0323, but the new area code is 03377. Area code 030, formerly used by West Berlin, was assigned to the entire reunified [[Berlin]].

The released country code +37 was later reused as the initial digits of several new codes for [[Europe]]an countries that became independent states at the time (e.g.: +370 for [[Lithuania]], +374 for [[Armenia]], +375 for [[Belarus]], etc.), as well as some [[microstate]]s whose telephone networks had formerly been integrated to those of surrounding larger countries (e.g. +376 for [[Andorra]], +377 for [[Monaco]] and +378 for [[San Marino]]).

The German phone network became fully digitised in 1997, allowing more flexible use of the numbering space.

On 1 January 1998, the [[Bundesnetzagentur|Federal Network Agency]] (named the Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Postal Services at the time) became the numbering authority for phone numbers in Germany.

[[File:LochesTuffeau.JPG|thumb|250px|Part of the enciente wall at the [[Château de Loches]], showing ''tuffeau'' blocks of various ages and in various stages of decay.]]

'''Tuffeau stone''' — in [[French language|French]], simply '''''tuffeau''''' or '''''tufeau''''' — is a local [[limestone]] of the [[Loire Valley]] of [[France]]. It is characterized as a chalky or sandy, fine-grained limestone, white to yellowish-cream in appearance, and micaceous (containing some white flakes of [[mica]], or [[muscovite]]).  The soft stone is extracted from numerous quarries and has made a major mark on the architectural landscape of the Loire and its tributaries — especially the valley's world-famous [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley|chateaux]]. 

==Geology==
Tuffeau dates to the [[Mesozoic era]] ([[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Turonian]] stage). The Loire Valley formed the floor of a vast sea 90 million years ago. Over the millennia, sediment from the sea floor, comprising fossilized living organisms and sand particles, became compressed to form what is now known as Tuffeau stone. It differs from genuine [[chalk]] by the presence of [[foraminifera]] and many remains of shells originally deposited in shallow water (between 2 and 20 meters) and subsequently agitated, near a coastline. In contrast, true chalk is rich in another type of shelly [[micro-fossil]], the [[coccolith]], which was deposited in deeper (~ 200 meters), and quieter, water.

The term ''tuffeau'' is etymologically related to another stone, [[tuff]], to which is it not geologically related — and to [[tufa]], to which it is geologically related. These words derive from Italian ''tufo'' and from Latin ''tōphus'' or ''tōfus'' ("stone").

==Physical properties==
Tuffeau has a very low density compared with many other rocks, being half as dense as granite, comparable in density with ebony, and only about 10 to 20% heavier than water. It has porosity of up to 50%, whereas that of granite is only about 1%. The compressive strength of the stone is a factor of 10 to 20 times less than that of granite.

When mixed with local sand and flinty clays from later eras, tuffeau is said to create the best vineyards soils.

==Mining==
[[File:Carrière de tuffeau à Bourré, Loir-et-Cher.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A tuffeau mine at [[Bourré, Loir-et-Cher|Bourré]]]]
Tuffeau mining reached its peak in the [[15th century]]. As a construction material — especially in the [[Touraine]] and [[Anjou]] regions — tuffeau has been extracted mostly from natural riverside bluffs, which are extensive. The extracted blocks could thus be loaded onto boats. Over the centuries, this has created extensive underground  galleries, or mines, some of which are several kilometers in extent. These artificial caves have long been used as human dwellings, as the indoor temperature is remarkably constant from summer to winter. The greatest concentration of these cave dwellers — ''les troglodytes'' — is in the region of [[Saumur]].

[[File:Montrésor tuffeau.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Typical cave dwelling in a ''tuffeau'' bluff in [[Montrésor]]]] 

The mines are a perfect environment for wine cellars. Many of the larger caves have become ''[[Champignon|champignonnieres]]'' — i.e., are used for growing a commercial variety of mushroom, which is transported daily to the markets of Paris.

==Architecture==
[[File:Chambord.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The visual appeal of ''tuffeau'' is amply evident at the celebrated [[Chateau de Chambord]]]]
Numerous buildings in the Loire Valley, from the most modest to the most grandiose, were built from blocks of tuffeau stone, including the Château de Beaulieu near [[Saumur]], the [[Château d'Ussé]] and the Château de la Motte d'Usseau, and many worker's cottages at Longères.

'''''Tunnel People''''' is an [[anthropological]]-journalistic account describing an underground [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless]] community in [[New York City]]. It is written by war photographer and anthropologist [[Teun Voeten]] and was published by the Oakland-based independent publishing house PM Press in 2010.

== Background ==
In late 1980s and early 1990s New York, thousands of the homeless roamed the streets. Most slept on the streets or in shelters, but a small group of them went underground and took refuge in the huge system of subway and train tunnels.  One of the biggest and most accessible groups of these homeless people lived in part of the Amtrak tunnel, which runs for 50 blocks under Manhattan’s Riverside Park. Over time the tunnel became home to some 75 people who lived scattered in small groups in self made shacks, in empty maintenance bunkers, or in recesses and caves along the tunnel wall.&lt;ref name="Morton, Margaret, ‘The Tunnel. The Architecture of Despair’"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Margaret|title=The Tunnel.

Life in the Tunnels beneath New York City'"&gt;{{cite book|last=Toth|first=Jeniffer|title=The Mole People.

Several journalists wrote articles and made documentaries about tunnel life and the individuals living there. However, few of the journalists spent much time underground and some even produced stories, which lacked the necessary intimate knowledge of their subjects to be completely accurate.&lt;ref name="Cecil Adams, The Mole People revisited"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=The Mole People revisited|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2498/em-the-mole-people-em-revisited|publisher=[[The Straight Dope]]|accessdate=March 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph Brennan, Fantasy in The Mole People"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brennan|first=Joseph|title=Fantasy in The Mole People|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/mole-people.html|publisher=www.columbia.edu|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel people were evicted in 1996, but Amtrak and homeless organizations were able, with support from the federal government,&lt;ref name="Henneberger, M., ‘US to Offer Housing Vouchers to Lure Homeless from the Subways’"&gt;{{cite news|last=Henneberger|first=Melinda|title=US to Offer Housing Vouchers to Lure Homeless from the Subways|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/nyregion/us-to-offer-housing-vouchers-to-lure-homeless-from-the-subways.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 18, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a plan that would offer them alternative housing.&lt;ref name="Morton, Margaret, ‘Homes for the Invisible’, in: New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morton|first=Margaret|title=Homes for the Invisible’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/07/opinion/homes-for-the-invisible.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists who had established relations of trust with the tunnel people, such as Marc Singer, Margaret Morton and the author helped the tunnel people through the administrative process. Some succeeded in starting new lives above ground. Currently, the original tunnel is sealed off and all inhabitable structures are pulled down and destroyed. Nevertheless, a few individuals still live underground, but the city appears to tolerate them as long as they do not erect permanent structures.&lt;ref name="Andrea Star Reese, Finding Community in the Shadows"&gt;{{cite news|last=Star Reese|first=Andrea|title=Finding Community in the Shadows|url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/showcase-190/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Living with the tunnel people ==
Teun Voeten was brought into the tunnel by Terry Williams,&lt;ref name="Tunnel People on Panos Pictures"&gt;{{cite web|last=Voeten|first=Teun|title=Tunnel People|url=http://www.panos.co.uk/stories/2-13-1156-1662/Teun-Voeten/Tunnel-People/#|publisher=Panos Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; an ethnographer from the New School of Social Research. There he was introduced to one of the tunnel residents, Bernard Isaac, who became his guide.  After a few visits, Voeten asked Isaacs for permission to join the tunnel people in taking up residence there. Isaacs agreed, and Voeten was given an empty bunker in his camp.  Voeten lived there full-time for a period of 5 months, from the winter of 1994 and into the summer of 1995. By helping the people with their work, mainly collecting redeemable cans, and sharing their daily life, Voeten gained the confidence of many tunnel dwellers and obtained a wealth of ethnographic details about tunnel life and homeless life in the mid 90s.

== Content ==
''Tunnel People'' focuses on the lives of a few individuals: Bernard Isaacs, the main character in the book. He is a well mannered and eloquent man who has been nicknamed "Lord of the Tunnel"; Isaacs' neighbor Bob, a former short order cook with a drug problem; Tony, A Puerto
Rican ex-convict; Marcus, a macrobiotic hippie; and Julio, another Puerto Rican young man who is an alcoholic. There are also Estoban, a Cuban refugee who lost all his papers; his Cuban neighbors Poncho and Getulio; Joe and Kathy, a reclusive Vietnam veteran and his wife who keep 20 cats; Frankie, a young runaway and his friend Ment, who appears always to run into trouble with the law. Voeten describes the events of their daily lives in great detail, sometimes literally transcribing their conversations. Several chapters are devoted to the economy of the homeless. Contrary to popular assumptions, the homeless in the tunnel do not primarily resort to begging, but have developed quiet sophisticated ways to generate income.&lt;ref name="People Say We Eat Rats, But Food Is the Least Damn.Problem in New York. It's Peace of Mind That's Elusive"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCann|first=Collum|title=People Say We Eat Rats, But Food Is the Least Damn Problem in New York. It's Peace of Mind That's Elusive|newspaper=Observer Magazine|date=July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some trade books and items they find on the streets; most however collect cans and redeem them for 5 cents a piece at supermarkets. One chapter is a discussion of homelessness in which Voeten makes an inventory of the most important literature on homelessness then in existence. In another chapter, Voeten researches the many organizations that cater to the homeless. In many interviews, he speaks with aid workers, policemen and subway officials who work with homeless people. The last chapters of the book are devoted how the tunnel people are dealing with their upcoming eviction. In the updated U.S. version of the book, Voeten was able to track down many tunnel dwellers and relates their present circumstances in additional chapters.&lt;ref name="witteman"&gt;{{cite news|ref=witteman|last=Witteman|first=Jonathan|title=Terugkeren naar de tunnelmens|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/2443867/2011/06/10/Terugkeren-naar-de-tunnelmens.dhtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222163430/http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/2443867/2011/06/10/Terugkeren-naar-de-tunnelmens.dhtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-22|newspaper=[[de Volkskrant]]|date=2011-06-10|location=Amsterdam  |access-date= 2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan Bell, Baloney’s Not the Answer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Ryan|title=Baloney’s Not the Answer|url=http://www.molossus.co/prose/non-fiction/baloneys-not-the-answer/|publisher=www.molossus.co|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219101142/http://www.molossus.co/prose/non-fiction/baloneys-not-the-answer/|archivedate=2015-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate section are 32 black and white photos made by the author himself.

In this last edition he added a few new chapters in which he tracks down most tunnel dwellers and described what happened with them in the thirteen years since the original book was published.

'''UN/LOCODE''', the '''United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations''', is a [[geocode|geographic coding scheme]] developed and maintained by [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE). UN/LOCODE assigns codes to locations used in [[trade]] and [[transport]] with functions such as [[port|seaports]], [[rail terminal|rail]] and road terminals, [[airport]]s, Postal Exchange Office and [[border crossing point]]s. The first issue in 1981 contained codes for 8,000 locations. The version from 2011 contained codes for about 82,000 locations.&lt;ref name="Note 2011-1" /&gt;

==Structure==
UN/LOCODEs have five characters. The first two letters code a country by the table defined in [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]. The three remaining characters code a location within that country. Letters are preferred, but if necessary digits 2 through 9 may be used, excluding "0" and "1" to avoid confusion with the letters "O" and "I" respectively.

For each country there can be a maximum of 17,576 entries using only letters (26×26×26), or 39,304 entries using letters and digits (34×34×34).

For the US, the letter combinations have almost all been exhausted. So in 2006, the Secretariat added 646 entries with a digit as the last character.

==Loose consistency with existing IATA airport codes==
For airports, the three letters following the [[country code]] are not always identical to the [[IATA airport code]]. According to the Secretariat note for Issue 2006-2, there are 720 locations showing a different IATA code.&lt;ref name="Note 2006-2" /&gt;

==Official UN/LOCODE tables==
UN/LOCODEs are released as a table. An individual revision is officially referred to as an "issue". A discussion of the table's structure follows.

It also has a separate reference entry showing an alternate spelling of ''Gothenburg''.

===Data fields===
The fields are listed in the official order.

====Ch (Changes)====
:A change from the previous issue is indicated by one of the following characters in the first column:&lt;ref name="Note 2006-2" /&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Marked for deletion in the next issue
: &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Change in location name (usually spelling)
: &lt;tt&gt;¦&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Other changes in the entry (not location)
: &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Entry added to the current issue
: &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Reference entry
: &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Retained for certain entries in the USA code list ("controlled duplications")

====Locode====
:The code is represented with a space between the alpha-2 codes of ISO 3166-1 country code and the 3-character element.

====Name====
:Names of locations should be shown using the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet with, where appropriate, diacritic signs as contained in ISO 10646-1/1993 or ISO 8859-1/1987.

====Name Without Diacritics====
:The name of the location, but non-practicable Diacritics may be ignored and should not be converted into additional characters(e.g., Göteborg may be read as Goteborg,  rather than Goeteborg, Gothenburg, Gotembourg, etc.).
:Can contain an apostrophe, e.g. [[L'viv]]

====SubDiv (Subdivision)====
:The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1 to 3 character alphabetic and/or numeric code for the administrative division (state, province, department, etc.) of the country, as included in [[ISO 3166-2]]/1998. Only the latter part of the complete ISO 3166-2 code element (after the hyphen) is shown.

====Function====
:Each defined function gets a classifier; the most important are:
:* 1 = port (for any kind of waterborne transport)
:* 2 = rail terminal
:* 3 = road terminal
:* 4 = airport
:* 5 = postal exchange office
:* 6 = Inland Clearance Depot – ICD or "Dry Port", "Inland Clearance Terminal", etc.
:* 7 = fixed transport functions (e.g. oil platform)"; the classifier "7" is reserved for this function. Noting that the description "oil pipeline terminal" would be more relevant, and could be extended to cover also electric power lines and [[ropeway]] terminals.
:* B = Border crossing function
:* 0 = function not known, to be specified

====Status====
:Indicates the status of the entry by a 2-character code. The following codes are used at present:
:*AA: Approved by competent national government agency
:*AC: Approved by Customs Authority
:*AF: Approved by national facilitation body
:*AI: Code adopted by international organisation (IATA or ECLAC)
:*AM: Approved by the UN/LOCODE Maintenance Agency
:*AQ: Entry approved, functions not verified 
:*AS: Approved by national standardisation body
:*RL: Recognised location - Existence and representation of location name confirmed by check against nominated gazetteer or other reference work
:*RN: Request from credible national sources for locations in their own country
:*RQ: Request under consideration
:*UR: Entry included on user's request; not officially approved 
:*RR: Request rejected
:*QQ: Original entry not verified since date indicated
:*XX: Entry that will be removed from the next issue of UN/LOCODE

====Date====
:The date the location was added or updated: 0207 is July 2002, 9501 is January 1995, etc.
:Note that the edition published in 2008 uses the value 0701 for additions, while in other cases the exact month is used like 9710, 0212.

====IATA====
:For correlation purposes, the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for the location is marked if different from the second part of the UN/LOCODE.

====Coordinates====
:Some entries have coordinates in the database. They are represented as: ddmmN dddmmW, ddmmS dddmmE, etc.

====Remarks====
:The remarks column can among other things contain a hint to what specifically was changed (See data field - "Change").

==Availability==
Availability
UN/LOCODE is available on the [http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/welcome.html UNECE website], where the latest release of UNLOCOD directories and background documents are listed. Complete UN/LOCODE code list may be downloaded in the format of.mdb (MS Access database), .txt (text file) and .csv (Comma-separated values). HTML pages are also displayed on the website by countries.

==Data Maintenance Requests==
UN/LOCODE Data Maintenance Request system is web-based (http://apps.unece.org/unlocode/), which enables registered users to submit online requests for new UN/LOCODE entry modifications.

The system provides online functions for 
:*Registration of users and password retrieval 
:*Submission of requests for new UN/LOCODE entries 
:*Submission of requests for modification changes in existing UN/LOCODE entries 
:*A guide to explain the use of the system

==Errors==
In 2006-07 &lt;tt&gt;IQ IRB&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Irbil]] was added while &lt;tt&gt;IQ ABL&lt;/tt&gt; [[Arbil]] with almost the same coordinates existed. In the 2007 edition &lt;tt&gt;IQ ABL&lt;/tt&gt; gets marked for deletion and &lt;tt&gt;IQ EBL&lt;/tt&gt; [[Erbil International Apt]] is added to the database, but with a different coordinates, reflecting the distance between airport and city. The error is to delete ABL and to insert IRB.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}}

Occasionally locations are listed twice; this is not necessarily an error. In issue 2006-1, &lt;tt&gt;ARSMC &lt;/tt&gt; [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] (functions 2,3) was added while &lt;tt&gt;ARTUC &lt;/tt&gt; Tucumán (function 1) already was in the list. The coordinates are with very little deviation the same. Also in 2006-1, &lt;tt&gt;ARSSJ &lt;/tt&gt; [[San Salvador de Jujuy]] was added (function 4) while &lt;tt&gt;ARJUJ &lt;/tt&gt; Jujuy (functions 1,2,3,5) already existed.

=== 2009-1 ===
The 2009-1 release added several entries for Ukraine where the longitude is off by a few orders of magnitude. Ranging from 23230E to 38829E, they are outside what would constitute an eastern [[longitude]]. [[Ivano Frankovsk]] and [[Chuguyev]] have two entries now, along with Nikolayev. For all three, the [[Romanization|romanized]] spelling varies.

==Problems==
Some entries do not have coordinates, so it is not clear where they actually refer to. If an IATA code changes, then the UN/LOCODE could also be considered to have changed.

The '''Victoria Medal''' is an award presented by the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. It is awarded "for conspicuous merit in research in [[geography]]" and has been given since 1902, in honour of the late [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="yearbook1914"&gt;{{cite book |title=Year-Book and Record. 1914 |url=http://scans.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/4/42/yearbookrecord1914royauoft/yearbookrecord1914royauoft.pdf |location=London |publisher=The Royal Geographical Society |date=1914 |access-date=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until then, the society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Medal]] had alternatively been known as the "Victoria Medal", and the new medal resembled its original design.&lt;ref name="yearbook1914" /&gt;
