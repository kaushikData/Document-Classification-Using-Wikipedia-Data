      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22371">The American media{{who|date=August 2016}} referred to 1985 as the '''Year of the Spy''' because law enforcement arrested many foreign spies operating on American soil. However, the preceding year, 1984, actually had more arrests for espionage in the United States.

The eight major agents who became infamous in 1985 for espionage against the United States were [[John Anthony Walker]], Richard Kelly Smyth, [[Sharon Scranage|Sharon W. Scranage]], [[Larry Wu-Tai Chin]], [[Jonathan Pollard|Jonathan Jay Pollard]], [[Ronald Pelton|Ronald William Pelton]], Randy Miles Jeffries, and [[Edward Lee Howard]].

==Political climate==
The majority of these operatives were spying for Communist nations. Their arrests in 1985 heightened tensions between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] at a crucial point in the [[Cold War]]; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] rose to power as Soviet general secretary in the same year.

These high-publicity cases added to the American public's suspicion of the Soviets at a time when the Soviet Union was transitioning into new leadership and reforms under Gorbachev. Even Gorbachev's meeting with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] at the November [[Geneva Summit (1985)|Geneva Summit]] did little to reduce uncertainty as to the future of [[Soviet Union–United States relations|U.S.-Soviet relations]].

The arrest of so many foreign spies working within the [[United States Intelligence Community]] sparked two demands among the American public: more internal government security and protection against infiltration, and more and better public access to government information.&lt;ref name="Petersen2001"&gt;Petersen, Julie K. "Understanding Surveillance Technologies: Spy Devices, Their Origins &amp; Applications." [[Boca Raton, Florida]]: CRC Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
As a result, journalists and researchers who had been demanding and obtaining government information sought to store it in one central location and in 1985 created the [[National Security Archive]] at [[The George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="NSArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/the_archive.html|title=About the National Security Archive|work=gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Anthony Walker===
[[John Anthony Walker]] was born on July 28, 1937, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Margaret Scaramuzzo and James Vincent Walker. James drank heavily and frequently beat Margaret and their children.&lt;ref name="CrimelibWalker2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/walker/2.html|title=Family of Spies: The John Walker Jr. Spy Case|work=[[Crime Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, John Anthony Walker was a rebellious practical joker. At his Catholic high school, he performed poorly academically and did not participate in sports. When he was 17, he was arrested for robbing a gas station, and he admitted to six other burglaries. In court his older brother, a US Navy petty officer, urged the judge to give him probation so that he might enlist in the Navy and gain discipline.&lt;ref name="NASAWalker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/ospp/securityguide/Spystory/Walker.htm|title=John Walker|website=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker enlisted in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="NASAWalker" /&gt;

In 1967, he walked into the Soviet embassy in Washington, DC and offered to steal codes, code machines, and classified documents from the Navy for the initial price of $500 to $1000 per week.&lt;ref name="CrimelibWalker1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/walker/1.html |title=Family of Spies: The John Walker Jr. Spy Case |work=[[Crime Library]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209235720/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/walker/1.html |archive-date=2015-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later recruited his wife Barbara, his friend Jerry Whitworth, his older brother Arthur, and his son Michael to aid him in his espionage activities.&lt;ref name="CrimelibWalker2" /&gt;

Barbara eventually disclosed the ring's activities to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. After completing a [[dead drop]] coordinated with a Soviet operative north of Washington, DC, Walker searched for $200,000 that the Soviet operative was supposed to have dropped five miles away. He could not find the package, and checked into a local inn to regroup. The FBI had arranged a sting. The hotel's front desk worker lured him from his room at 3:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on May 20, 1985, with a phone call about damage to his van in the hotel’s parking lot, at which point two FBI agents apprehended him.&lt;ref name="CrimelibWalker2" /&gt;

The Walker case stunned America as the last major spy case involving Americans was the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] case of the 1950s.

===Richard Kelly Smyth===

Richard Kelly Smyth was an American physicist, businessman, and [[NATO]] and [[NASA]] consultant on aerospace guidance technology. His [[Huntington Beach, California]], business, Milco International Incorporated, was a leading contractor to the US government on aerospace technology and an exporter of this technology.&lt;ref name="wrmea8507"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/071585/850715006.html|title=WRMEA - The Great Krytron Caper|work=WRMEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between January 1980 and December 1982, Smyth allegedly illegally exported 15 shipments of 810 [[krytron]]s total&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/farr.htm|title=Israel's Nuclear Weapons|work=fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to alleged Israeli-intermediary, businessman (and film producer) [[Arnon Milchan]] of the Israeli company Heli Trading Company. Milchan then allegedly mediated the transfer of the krytrons to the Israeli government.&lt;ref name="wrmea8507" /&gt;

Because [[krytron]]s are electronic switches capable of triggering nuclear explosive devices, the US government deems them munitions and only allows their legal export via a stringent licensing process, though krytrons much smaller than those Smyth exported are central components of common items like copy machines and strobe lights.&lt;ref name="wrmea8507" /&gt;

Operation Exodus, a [[United States Customs Service|US Customs]] program, was instrumental in Smyth’s capture. Ronald Reagan's administration designed Operation Exodus to cut off smuggling of technology and goods to Soviet countries and funded the program by taking $30 million from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and giving it to Customs.&lt;ref name="cbp2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/CustomsToday/2002/January/custoday_shield_america.xml|title=U.S. Customs Today - January 2002 - "Shield America" against terrorism|website=[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smyth was arrested in May 1985 but he fled with his wife while awaiting trial.  The couple was discovered in [[Málaga]], Spain in July 2001. After his extradition to the US, he pleaded guilty in December 2001 to violating the [[Arms Export Control Act]] and to making false statements to US Customs. His sentence included 40 months in prison and a $20,000 fine, though he was immediately eligible for parole because of his old age. He was 72 at the time of sentencing.&lt;ref name="BBC1960179"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1960179.stm|title=BBC News - MIDDLE EAST - US nuclear parts trafficker sentenced|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high drama of the covert relationship between Richard Kelly Smyth, Hollywood producer [[Arnon Milchan]], and the entire episode that became known as the [[Krytron]] affair, was documented in the 2011 book ''Confidential, The Life of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon Milchan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Confidential-Secret-Hollywood-Tycoon-Milchan/dp/0615433812|title=Confidential: The Life of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon - Arnon Milchan: Meir Doron, Joseph Gelman: 9780615433813: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sharon W. Scranage===

[[Sharon Scranage|Sharon W. Scranage]] was a young American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] secretary serving in [[Accra]], the capital of [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="CTCIntl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcintl.com/CIA%20fall%20so%20low.htm|title=ctcintl|work=ctcintl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghanaian government used Michael Agbotui Soussoudis, a young male intelligence officer to target her, romance her, and solicit US intelligence from her.&lt;ref name="Mendez2003"&gt;Mendez, Antonio and Jonna and Bruce Henderson. "Spy Dust: Two Masters of Disguise Reveal the Tools and Operations That Helped Win the Cold War." New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scranage disclosed to Soussoudis the identities of undercover CIA agents working in Ghana as well as plans for a coup against the Ghanaian government by dissidents.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/07/us/us-grand-jury-indicts-an-ex-cia-employee.html|title=U.S. Grand Jury Indicts An Ex-C.I.A. Employee|work=[[The New York Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soussoudis then passed the information to Ghanaian intelligence chief and Marxist Kojo Tsikata, who then passed it to Cuba, Libya, and East Germany.&lt;ref name="dailykos887"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/7/12/103958/887|title=Sharon Scranage: 5 years for Violating Intelligence ID Act|work=dailykos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the Adjudicative Desk Reference, the US government’s guidelines for a person’s eligibility for access to classified information, it is not uncommon for foreign intelligence agents, especially in Communist nations, to use the promise of sex and romance against operatives to gain trust and obtain information.&lt;ref name="SMDCsexF"&gt;[http://www.smdc.army.mil/ADR/sexbeh/sexF.htm Sexual Behavior Frameset&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 1985 Scranage began her sentence of 5 years in prison for espionage and violating the [[Intelligence Identities Protection Act]]. She earned parole after serving 18 months.&lt;ref name="Muskingum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intellit.muskingum.edu/spycases_folder/usother_folder/usotherm-z.html|title=Spy Cases - U.S. - Other - M-Z|website=[[Muskingum University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soussoudis received a sentence of 20 years but permanently left the US in exchange for a suspended sentence.&lt;ref name="Time1083872"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1083872,00.html|title=TIME|work=time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress passed the Intelligence Identities Protection Act in 1982 in response to the murder of Athens, Greece CIA station chief Richard Welch by Marxist group The 17 November Organization.&lt;ref name="Novelguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/exgi_0001_0001_0/exgi_0001_0001_0_00009.html|title=Novelguide - Search Result|work=Novelguide}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation made it illegal to disclose the identities of or personal information about intelligence officers.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2123411/|title=A Nutty Little Law|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|date=26 July 2005|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Larry Wu-Tai Chin===

[[Larry Wu-Tai Chin]] was born in Beijing. He began his US government career as translator for the US Army during World War II. He performed the same job for the US Consulate in Shanghai, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], and the CIA’s [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]].&lt;ref name="PBSspy4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/spy/spies/four.html|title=China Spying - Four Chinese Espionage Investigations - From China With Love - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spied for China for 30 years. He told the Chinese government [[Richard Nixon]]'s secret diplomatic goals before Nixon's visit to China, and China was able to strategically prepare for negotiations. Chinese intelligence agents then passed Chin’s secrets on to the Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="USNews"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031110/10spy.b1.htm|title=China Doll: Was a Chinese-American Temptress Really a Secret Agent?|author=Chitra Ragavan|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China paid Chin between $500,000 and $1 million, with which he accumulated 29 rental properties and Las Vegas gambling debts totaling more than $96,000.&lt;ref name="Time980275"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980275,00.html|title=My Country for a Rolex|date=7 March 1994|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chin channeled his compulsive gambling habit and used it as a way to hide his espionage profits.&lt;ref name="SMDCgamt"&gt;[http://www.smdc.army.mil/adr/gambling/gamt.htm Gambling Text&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After federal district judge Robert Mehrige found him guilty of spying for China on February 7, 1986,&lt;ref name="NYTimes_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/26/us/conviction-upheld-for-a-spy-in-cia-who-killed-himself.html|title=Conviction Upheld for a Spy In C.I.A. Who Killed Himself|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chin suffocated himself with a plastic bag in his Virginia prison cell.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/24/us/convicted-spy-is-determined-to-have-died-of-asphyxiation.html|title=Convicted Spy Is Determined To Have Died of Asphyxiation|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonathan Jay Pollard===

[[Jonathan Jay Pollard]], son of a microbiology professor, grew up in South Bend, Indiana.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/07/books/the-spy-form-south-bend.html|title=THE SPY FORM SOUTH BEND|first=Robert|last=Pear|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he loved to read and tell stories. His family lost 70 relatives during the Holocaust, and he dreamed of avenging these wrongs.&lt;ref name="NASAPollard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/ospp/securityguide/Spystory/Pollard.htm|title=Jonathan Jay Pollard|work=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Stanford University where he falsely boasted that Israeli intelligence paid his tuition and his father worked for the CIA.&lt;ref name="PBSPollard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/venona/dece_pollard.html|title=NOVA Online - Secrets, Lies, and Atomic Spies - Jonathan Jay Pollard|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving graduate school at Tufts University, he became a civilian US Naval intelligence officer in 1979. He earned a promotion in 1984 and immediately passed satellite imagery and CIA reports to Israeli agents, unsolicited. Apart from cash, he received jewelry and a honeymoon on the Orient Express for his wife Anne Henderson.&lt;ref name="PBSPollard" /&gt;

Pollard reportedly admitted to selling materials that could fill a 10-foot by 6-foot by 6-foot space to the Israeli Intelligence, from where, it is claimed some intelligence specialists believe that the Soviet moles then passed those secrets along to Moscow.&lt;ref name="wrmea9809"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0998/9809052.html|title=WRMEA - The Strange Campaign to Secure the Release of Convicted Spy Jonathan Jay Pollard|work=WRMEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollard’s need to constantly handle classified materials drew too much attention, and he was arrested by the FBI on November 18, 1985.  He pleaded guilty to espionage and received a sentence of life in prison on June 4, 1986.&lt;ref name="MuskingumPollard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intellit.muskingum.edu/spycases_folder/pollard_folder/pollardintro.html|title=Spy Cases - U.S. - Pollard - Introduction|work=[[Muskingum University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Anne served her 5-year sentence for unauthorized possession of government documents, she divorced Pollard.&lt;ref name="PBSPollard" /&gt;

In April 2008, federal prosecutors accused 84-year-old retired US Army engineer and New Jersey resident [[Ben-ami Kadish|Ben-Ami Kadish]] of passing intelligence to an Israeli official who also received information from Pollard.&lt;ref name="Xinhua8037644"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/23/content_8037644.htm|title=Former U.S. army engineer charged in old spy case_English_Xinhua|work=xinhuanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ronald William Pelton===
[[Ronald William Pelton]] was born in 1942. After attending Indiana University, he joined the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] and analyzed [[SIGINT]] in Pakistan. He had a photographic memory.&lt;ref name="SpymuseumPelton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spymuseum.com/pages/agent-pelton-ronald.html|title=Robert Hanssen - spymuseum.com|website=[[International Spy Museum]]|access-date=2008-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511185513/http://www.spymuseum.com/pages/agent-pelton-ronald.html|archive-date=2008-05-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began working for the [[National Security Agency]] as a communications specialist in 1966. He personally went to the Soviet embassy in Washington, DC and volunteered to spy after he retired in 1979.&lt;ref name="Time1074834"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1074834,00.html|title=Spies, Spies Everywhere|date=21 June 2005|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually disclosed to the Soviets intelligence about [[Operation Ivy Bells]], a plan to monitor underwater Soviet communication cables.&lt;ref name="CNNtraitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/nsa/stories/traitor/index.html|title=CNN.com In-Depth Specials - Inside the NSA|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the information Pelton had disclosed was so sensitive that CIA director Bill Casey and NSA director William Odom asked the media to report any leaked information to them before going to press.&lt;ref name="CNNtraitor" /&gt;

Alleged Soviet defector [[Vitaly Yurchenko]] was a KGB colonel who revealed Pelton’s identity during an interrogation by the CIA.&lt;ref name="SpymuseumPelton" /&gt;

Pelton received three concurrent life sentences in 1986.&lt;ref name="Time1074834" /&gt;

===Randy Miles Jeffries===

Randy Miles Jeffries worked as a clerk for the FBI from 1978 to 1980. In 1983 he received a one-year suspended sentence for heroin possession and attended rehab. A social service worker referred him to Acme Reporting Company, a stenography and reporting company that frequently contracted with federal agencies. Here Jeffries was responsible for photocopying, bundling, and handling classified documents and later disposing of them, unshredded, in a dumpster.&lt;ref name="DoDGoodSec"&gt;Department of Defense Security Institute. “Good Security Does Make a Difference: The Case of Randy Miles Jeffries and the Acme Reporting Company.” Security Awareness Bulletin, January 1990/Number 2-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 1985, Jeffries conspired with a coworker to attempt to sell to the Soviet Military Office in northwest Washington three classified documents including one titled “US House of Representatives, Department of Defense Command Control Communication and Intelligence Programs, C31, Closed Session, Subcommittee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.” At 4:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. he hand-delivered sample documents to the Soviet Military Office.  He returned on December 17, at which time Soviet agents paid him $60.  On December 20 he met with an undercover FBI agent who was posing as a Soviet. Law enforcement arrested Jeffries later that night.&lt;ref name="DoDGoodSec" /&gt;

A subsequent federal audit of Acme Reporting Company revealed that their security system was a total failure. Background checks were inadequate, employees worked on classified materials from home, and no proper document destruction procedures were in place.&lt;ref name="DoDGoodSec" /&gt;

In response to the Jeffries case, the Defense Investigative Service started Project Insight in 1986 to gather and analyze industrial security data and develop recommendations for new techniques.&lt;ref name="DoDGoodSec" /&gt;

On March 13, 1986, a federal judge sentenced Jeffries to 3 to 9 years imprisonment.

===Edward Lee Howard===

[[Edward Lee Howard]] was a [[Boy Scout]], an [[altar boy]], and a Returned [[Peace Corps]] Volunteer who served in [[Colombia]].  After a period spent doing international development work with [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], Howard went to work for the CIA in 1981.&lt;ref name="PeaceCorpsOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/2026986.html|title=Peace Corps Online: October 1, 2002: Headlines:  Obituaries: Intelligence Issues: COS - Colombia: COS - Dominican Republic: COS - Russia: Spokesman Online:  Mysterious life, death of Edward Lee Howard|work=peacecorpsonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 1983, the CIA fired him after noting discrepancies in his [[polygraph]] tests regarding past drug use and petty theft. Howard promptly made drunken phone calls to the US embassy in Moscow using a phone line he knew Soviets were monitoring, and thereby exposed his former supervisor as a CIA employee.&lt;ref name="PeaceCorpsOnline" /&gt;

In 1984 Howard allegedly sold US intelligence to KGB agents in Austria.  In 1985 he vanished into the New Mexico desert after Soviet defector and KGB deputy chief Vitaly Yurchenko gave the FBI information which caused them to heavily surveil Howard.  Howard escaped with the help of his wife Mary, who drove home from the desert with a dummy decoy in the passenger seat of the car, and played a recording of Howard's voice on a phone line she knew the FBI was tapping.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/23/world/edward-lee-howard-50-spy-who-escaped-to-soviet-haven.html|title=Edward Lee Howard, 50, Spy Who Escaped to Soviet Haven|first=Sabrina|last=Tavernise|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard defected to Russia where the Soviets granted him asylum, an apartment, and a new identity.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_5" /&gt;

Howard died on July 12, 2002, at the age of 50, according to former KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and State Department spokesman Richard A. Boucher.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_5" /&gt;

The organization maintains an online database of roller coasters  including ride specifications and archives of published news articles. The club also recognizes of historically significant roller coasters with  Coaster Classic and ACE Roller Coaster Landmark statuses.

== History ==
Organization founders Roy Brashears, Paul Greenwald and Richard Munch met at a roller coaster riding marathon event promoting of the 1977 movie [[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|''Rollercoaster'']] at the ''Rebel Yell'' roller coaster (now titled [[Racer 75]]) at [[Kings Dominion]] amusement park in Doswell, Virginia. The three discovered they shared the same passion for roller coasters and decided to form a club that would allow others that shared the same interests to join. They organized Coaster Con I the following year at [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] theme park in June 1978. On the final day of the event during a business meeting, the name American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) was chosen as the club's name. Coaster Con events have been held annually ever since &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Rutherford |first1=Scott |title=The American Roller Coaster |place=Osceola, Wisconsin |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |page=120 |year=2000 |isbn=0-7603-0689-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The organization is almost entirely run by volunteers, with the exception of an independent contractor who runs certain day-to-day operations regarding mailings, receipt of event payment/membership dues and merchandise. ACE members are required to pay annual membership dues that are available in individual, couple, family and corporate packages. The organization fulfills one of its primary goals of providing education through its publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Incredible Scream Machine, A History of the Roller Coaster|year=1987|last1=Cartmel|first1=Robert|page=191|place=Fairview Park, Ohio|publisher=Amusement Park Books|isbn=0-87972-341-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other goals include promoting the conservation, appreciation, and enjoyment of roller coasters and their place in history as architectural and engineering landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Harry G. Traver: Legends of Terror|year=1982|last1=Munch|first1=Richard|page=176|place=Mentor, Ohio|publisher=Amusement Park Books|isbn=0-935408-02-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE is governed by an executive committee of five officers and six directors. Four of the officer positions are directly elected and one indirectly elected by the club's membership. These officers are the President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary and Immediate Past President. The six directors are appointed by the president and approved by a majority vote of the remaining officers.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;Constitution and Bylaws http://www.aceonline.org/constitution/&lt;/ref&gt; The Regional Representation Director, oversees a system of ACE regions, which sponsors events and publishes regional websites and newsletters.

== Awards ==

=== ACE Coasters Classics ===
The ACE Coaster Classic award was developed during a period when changes in the design, equipping, and operation of wood coasters threatened to erase these time-honored experiences and rituals. The award is designed to recognize coasters that still adhere to these principles, while allowing riders to safely experience the thrill of the classic wooden roller coaster ride. To be eligible for ACE Coaster Classic status, the coaster must meet the following criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Coaster Awards http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/?type=1&lt;/ref&gt;
* Traditional lap bars that allow riders to experience so-called airtime, or negative G's, the sensation of floating above the seat, must be installed. Individual, ratcheting lap bars do not meet this requirement.
* Riders must be able to slide from side-to-side in their seats. A coaster with any restraint or device that restricts this freedom, like seat dividers between riders, does not meet this requirement.
* Riders must be able to view upcoming drops and thrills. A coaster with headrests on every seat or the majority of seats that restrict this view does not meet this requirement.
* Riders must be free to choose where they sit. A coaster where riders are assigned seats before boarding does not meet this requirement.

The amusement park or theme park operating a coaster that is recognized as a Coaster Classic is usually presented a custom plaque. The plaque typically states:
{{cquote|THE AMERICAN COASTER ENTHUSIASTS RECOGNIZES THIS COASTER AS AN ACE COASTER CLASSIC.

ACE salutes this park for maintaining this coaster as an American treasure in its purest form. We congratulate you for the use of traditional materials, methods and equipment, which are fundamental to the classic wooden roller coaster experience.

ACE commends this park for operating this coaster in the traditional manner so that future generations may enjoy its classic thrills and its enduring popularity.}}

It has been noted, however, that most coasters usually have disqualifying ratcheting lap bars, seat dividers and head rests to prevent people from trying to stand up during ride. For example, [[Rolling Thunder (roller coaster)|Rolling Thunder]] at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] had [[Roller coaster elements#Buzz bars|buzz bars]] which meet traditional lap bar Coaster Classic requirements, but it is ''not'' a classic because of headrests and seat dividers being added in 1981 to prevent people from standing up during the ride.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolling Thunder (roller coaster)#Trains]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Golden Age Coaster ===
The Golden Age Coaster award, a prequel to the Roller Coaster Landmark award, was established to recognize significant roller coasters that were built during the 1920s. [[Giant Dipper]] at [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]] received the Golden Age Coaster award in addition to the Roller Coaster Landmark award. [[Giant Dipper (Belmont Park)|Giant Dipper]] at [[Belmont Park (San Diego)]] also received the Golden Age Coaster award.&lt;ref&gt;Coaster Awards http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/?type=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preservation ==
ACE takes an active role in the preservation of endangered roller coasters. Since 1985, the club has either directly or indirectly helped save more than half a dozen. One of the most notable include the [[Phoenix (roller coaster)|Phoenix]] located at [[Knoebels Amusement Resort]] in [[Elysburg, Pennsylvania]]. The wooden coaster was relocated from [[Playland Park (San Antonio, Texas)|Playland Park]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Another the organization saved was [[Leap the Dips]], the world's oldest operating wooden coaster, located at [[Lakemont Park]] in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]]. In addition to preservation, some parks have also sought the opinions of ACE members regarding roller coaster design, as was the case with [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]] at [[Holiday World]] in [[Santa Claus, Indiana]].

On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain [[personally identifiable information]] from its servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/04/technology/anthem-insurance-hack-data-security/ |title=Insurance giant Anthem hit by massive data breach |first=Charles |last=Riley |work=cnn.com |date=4 February 2015 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 2015 Anthem raised the number to 78.8 million people whose personal information was affected. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-hacked-database-included-78-8-million-people-1424807364 |title=Anthem: Hacked Database Included 78.8 Million People |first=Anna |last=Mathews |work=cnn.com |date=24 February 2015 |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association#Member companies|brands Anthem, Inc. uses]] to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, [[Amerigroup]], [[Caremore]], and [[UniCare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/data-breach-at-health-insurer-anthem-could-impact-millions/|title=Data Breach at Health Insurer Anthem Could Impact Millions —  Krebs on Security|work=krebsonsecurity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Healthlink]] says it was also a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthlink homepage|url=http://www.healthlink.com|website=healthlink.com|accessdate=10 February 2015|location=Center of page; even the Anthem page doesn't reference Healthlink.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised.

==Theft of the data==
The data was stolen over a period of weeks the month before the data breach was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/2015/02/breach-health-insurer-exposes-sensitive-data-millions-patients/ |title=Health Insurer Anthem Is Hacked, Exposing Millions of Patients' Data  |first=Kim |last=Zetter |work=wired.com |date=5 February 2015 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthem was not required by law to encrypt the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnet.com/news/anthems-hacked-customer-data-was-not-encrypted/ |title=Anthem's stolen customer data not encrypted - CNET |first=Lance |last=Whitney | work=cnet.com |date=6 February 2015 |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anthem faced several civil class-action lawsuits, which were settled in 2017 at a cost of $115 million. Anthem did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/06/26/anthem-settles-security-breach-lawsuit-affecting-80m/103217152/ |title=Anthem settles a security breach lawsuit affecting 80M |first=Liz |last=Freeman |work=usatoday.com |date=26 June 2017 |accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the data==
Data from the attack is expected to be sold on the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/02/06/why-hackers-are-targeting-medical-sector/xxjFN6G3cFJZ8Fh3mF3XhN/story.html |title=Why hackers are targeting the medical sector |first1=Tom |last1=Murphy |first2=Brandon |last2=Bailey |work=bostonglobe.com |date=6 February 2015 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Persons whose data was stolen could have resulting problems about [[identity theft]] for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/02/05/anthem-data-breach-lifelong-battle-customers/22953623/ |title=Anthem data breach could be 'lifelong battle' for customers |first=Shari |last=Rudavsky |work=indystar.com |date=7 February 2015 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthem had a {{US$|100}} million insurance policy for cyber problems from [[American International Group]].&lt;ref name="Osborne Feb 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/anthem-data-breach-cost-likely-to-smash-100-million-barrier/ |title=Anthem data breach cost likely to smash $100 million barrier &amp;#124; ZDNet |first=Charlie |last=Osborne |work=[[ZDNet]] |date=12 February 2015|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One report suggested that all of this money could be consumed by the process of notifying customers of the breach.&lt;ref name="Osborne Feb 2015"/&gt;

==Responses==
Anthem advised people whose data was stolen to monitor their accounts and remain vigilant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/anthem-breach-what-should-i-do-right-now-n300796 |title=Anthem Breach: What Should I Do Right Now? |first1=Ben |last1=Popken |first2=Kelli |last2=Grant |work=nbcnews.com |date=6 February 2015 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthem retained [[Mandiant]] to review their security systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2015/02/04/massive-data-breach-at-health-insurer-anthem-reveals-social-security-numbers-and-more/ |title=Health Insurer Anthem Struck By Massive Data Breach |first=Gregory S. |last=McNeal |work=forbes.com |date=4 February 2015 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theft of the data raised fears generally about the theft of medical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-anthem-hack-fallout-20150206-story.html#page=1 |title=Anthem hack raises fears about medical data - LA Times |first=Chad |last=Terhune |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=5 February 2015 |publisher=[[Tribune Co]] |location=[[Los Angeles, CA|Los Angeles]] |issn=0458-3035 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/business/data-breach-at-anthem-may-lead-to-others.html |title=Data Breach at Anthem May Forecast a Trend - NYTimes.com |first1=Reed |last1=Abelson |first2=Julie |last2=Creswellfeb |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 February 2015 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer from [[Harvard Law School]] suggested that this data breach might spark reform of security practices and government data safety regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2015/02/07/time-for-a-healthcare-data-breach-review/ |title=Time for a Healthcare Data Breach Review? &amp;#124; Bill of Health |first=Nicholas |last=Terry |work=blogs.law.harvard.edu |publisher=Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy at [[Harvard Law School]] |date=7 February 2015|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation conducted by several state insurance commissioners blames the breach on an attacker whose identity was withheld, and claims that the breach was likely ordered by a foreign government whose name was withheld.&lt;ref name="CAPressRelease"&gt;{{Cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Investigation of major Anthem cyber breach reveals foreign nation behind breach |url=http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2017/release001-17.cfm |location=[[Sacramento, California]] |publisher=[[California Department of Insurance]] |date=2017-01-17 |access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also concluded that Anthem had taken reasonable measures to protect its data before the breach and that its remediation plan was effective at shutting down the breach once it was discovered.&lt;ref name="CAPressRelease"/&gt; It also marks the starting date of the breach as February 18, 2014.&lt;ref name="CAPressRelease"/&gt;

A class action settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.databreach-settlement.com/|title=Welcome to In re Anthem, Inc.

It has most commonly been used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.

Violence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, intimidation, impersonation, disinformation, and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Violence in [[labor unrest|labor disputes]] may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 318&lt;/ref&gt; for example the hiring and deployment of [[goon squad]]s to intimidate, threaten or even assault strikers.

== History ==

[[Image:Frank-little-d-1917.jpg|thumb|150px|Union organizer [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]] was pulled from his bed and lynched in 1917 because of his union activities]]

Historically, violence against unions has included attacks by detective and guard agencies, such as the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]], [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency|Baldwin Felts]], [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns]], or [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel]] detective agencies; citizens groups, such as the [[Citizens' Alliance]]; company guards; police; national guard; or even the military. In particular, there are few curbs on what detective agencies are able to get away with.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''From Blackjacks To Briefcases'', Robert Michael Smith states that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, anti-union agencies spawned violence and wreaked havoc on the labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; One investigator who participated in a [[Commission on Industrial Relations|congressional inquiry into industrial violence]] in 1916 concluded that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Espionage is closely related to violence. Sometimes it is the direct cause of violence, and, where that cannot be charged, it is often the indirect cause. If the [[Labor spies|secret agents of employers]], working as members of the labor unions, do not always investigate acts of violence, they frequently encourage them. If they did not, they would not be performing the duties for which they are paid, for they are hired on the theory that labor organizations are criminal in character.&lt;ref&gt;William White, The New republic, Volume 26, Republic Pub. Co., 1921, page 129, quoting Luke Grant&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In U.S. Senate testimony in 1936 about an employer who wanted to contract with the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton agency]]. Known personally to the author of the book ''The Pinkerton Story'', this employer was characterized as a "sincerely upright and Godly man." Yet Pinkerton files record that the employer wanted the agency "to send in some thugs who could beat up the strikers."&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Story, James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett, 1951, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the Pinkerton agency changed its focus from strike-breaking to undercover services.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 75, quoting ''Strikebreaking Services'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkerton declined the request from this employer.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Story, James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett, 1951, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Morris Friedman]], detective agencies were themselves for-profit companies, and a "bitter struggle" between capital and labor could be counted upon to create "satisfaction and immense profit" for agencies such as the Pinkerton company.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Such agencies were in the perfect position to fan suspicion and mistrust "into flames of blind and furious hatred" on the part of the companies.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agencies sell tactics including violence===

Harry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how one of the largest union busters in the United States, [[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], had a sales pitch offering the use of provocation and violence. The agency would routinely tell employers — prospective clients — of the methods used by their undercover operatives,&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once the union is in the field its members can keep it from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set far apart. A contract can at once be entered into with the employer, covering a long period, and made very easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Different types of violence===

[[Image:Lattimer massacre.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Striking Pennsylvania mine workers began their protest march near Harwood. [[Lattimer massacre|Many would soon be killed by the Luzerne County sheriff.]]]]Some anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing [[Anna LoPizzo]].&lt;ref&gt;William Dudley Haywood, Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the [[Frank Little (unionist)|hanging of union organizer Frank Little]] from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]]. A note was pinned to his body which said, "Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the "L" for Frank Little circled.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the [[Anaconda Road Massacre]]. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ludlow Death Car.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Machine gun equipped armored car built with steel from [[CF&amp;I|CF&amp;I's Pueblo steel works]], known to the striking miners as the ''Death Special''. "The machine gun was turned on striking miners and used to riddle the Forbes tent colony."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;]]The unprovoked attack was similar to another event, which had occurred twenty-three years earlier in Pennsylvania. During the [[Lattimer massacre]], nineteen unarmed immigrant coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine near [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]], on September 10, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John W. ''Transitions: From Eastern Europe to Anthracite Community to College Classroom.'' Bloomington, Ind.: iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-33732-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William. ''Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth.'' State College, Penn.: Penn State Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-271-02214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miners, mostly of [[Poles|Polish]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] and [[Germans|German]] ethnicity, were shot and killed by a [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County]] sheriff's [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]]. In this group as well, all of the miners had been shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Ronald L. Welsh Americans: A History of Assimilation in the Coalfields. Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Michael. Unmeltable Ethnics: Politics and Culture in American Life. 2d ed. New York: Transaction Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting followed a brief tussle over the American flag carried by the miners. Their only crime was asserting their right to march in the face of demands that they disperse.

In 1927, during a coal strike in [[Colorado]], state police and mine guards fired pistols, rifles and a machine gun into a group of five hundred striking miners and their wives in what came to be called the [[Columbine Mine massacre|Columbine Mine Massacre]]. In this incident as well, many of the miners were immigrants, and there had been a disagreement over the question of trespassing onto company property in the town of [[Serene, Colorado|Serene]], with the miners asserting it was public property because of the post office. There was, once again, a tussle over American flags carried by the strikers.

While the Columbine mine shooting was a surprise, newspapers played a deadly role in conjuring the atmosphere of hate in which  the violence occurred. Lurid editorials attacked the ethnicity of the strikers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, The Columbine Mine Massacre, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, pages 135-136&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers began calling for the governor to no longer withhold the "mailed fist", to strike hard and strike swiftly,&lt;ref&gt;''Denver Morning Post'' editorial, November 2, 1927, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; and for "Machine Guns Manned By Willing Shooters" at more of the state's coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Boulder Daily Camera, November 17, 1927, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of these editorials, state police and mine guards fired on the miners and their wives, injuring dozens and killing six.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, The Columbine Mine Massacre, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, pages 138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

In all of the above incidents, the perpetrators were never caught, or went unpunished. An exception resulted from a shooting of strikers at the Williams &amp; Clark Fertilizing Company near the Liebig Fertilizer Works at [[Carteret, New Jersey]] in 1915. One striker was killed outright, and more than twenty were injured in an unprovoked attack when deputies fired on strikers who had stopped a train to check for strikebreakers. The strikers found no strikebreakers, and were cheering as they exited the train. Forty deputies approached and suddenly fired on them with revolvers, rifles, and shotguns. As the strikers ran, "the deputies ... pursued, firing again and again."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "1 KILLED, 20 SHOT BY STRIKE GUARDS; Deputies Drive Off Laborers at the Liebig Fertilizer Works in Carteret, N.J.", January 20, 1915, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to attending physicians, all the strikers' wounds were on the backs or legs, indicating the guards were pursuing them.&lt;ref&gt;The Survey, January 30, 1915, page 458&lt;/ref&gt; A local government official who witnessed the shooting called it entirely unprovoked.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "1 KILLED, 20 SHOT BY STRIKE GUARDS; Deputies Drive Off Laborers at the Liebig Fertilizer Works in Carteret, N.J.", January 20, 1915, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Four more of the strikers, all critically injured, would die. Twenty-two of the guards were arrested and the crime was investigated by a Grand Jury; nine deputies were subsequently convicted of manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". At the Forbes tent colony,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes..."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After deaths of women and children at Ludlow,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he backlash was vicious and bloody. Over the next ten days striking miners poured out their rage in attacks across the coalfields...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The U.S. Army was called upon to put an end to the violence, and the strike sputtered to an end that December.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, pages 3,212&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be devious and subtle, as when [[union busting]] specialist Martin Jay Levitt assigned confederates to scratch up cars in the parking lot of a nursing home during an organizing drive, and then blamed it on the union as part of an anti-union campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a result of Operative Smith's "clever and intelligent" work, a number of union organizers received severe beatings at the hands of unknown masked men, presumably in the employ of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Friedman offers examples of these incidents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
About February 13, 1904, William Farley, of Alabama, a member of the [UMWA] National Executive Board ... and the personal representative of [UMWA] [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|President Mitchell]] ... addressed coal miners' meetings ... [on their return trip] eight masked men held them up with revolvers, dragged them from their wagon, threw them to the ground, beat them, kicked them, and almost knocked them into insensibility.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Saturday, April 30, 1904, W.M. Wardjon, a national organizer of the United Mine Workers, while on board a train en route to [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], was assaulted by three men at [[Sargents, Colorado|Sargents]], about thirty miles west of [[Salida, Colorado|Salida]]. Mr. Wardjon was beaten into unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Morris Friedman accused the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|Colorado Fuel and Iron Company]] (CF&amp;I), operated by [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his lieutenant in Colorado, Jesse Welborn, of responsibility for the beatings during the 1903-04 strike.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by [[Victor G. Reuther|Victor Reuther]] and others in 1937, "[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized [[tear gas]] attacks and mounted charges."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Lichtenstein, Walter Reuther: the most dangerous man in Detroit, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colorado labor war, 1903-1904 ===
[[Image:Gen sherman bell.jpg|left|thumb|140px|General Sherman Bell. Photo from [[The Pinkerton Labor Spy]], published in 1907.]][[Image:Karl linderfelt.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Karl Linderfelt, center. Photo caption reads: "OFFICERS OF THE COLORADO NATIONAL GUARD From left to right: Captain R. J. Linderfelt, Lieut. T. C. Linderfelt, Lieut. K. E. Linderfelt, (who faced the charge of assault upon Louis Tikas, the dead strike leader), Lieut. G.S. Lawrence and Major Patrick Hamrock. The last three were in the Ludlow battle of April 20, 1914."]]A study of industrial violence in 1969 concluded, "There is no episode in American labor history in which violence was as systematically used by employers as in the [[Colorado Labor Wars|Colorado labor war of 1903 and 1904]]."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

About the middle of February, 1904, leadership of the Colorado National Guard became concerned that the Mine Owners were failing to cover the payroll of the soldiers. General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to take another soldier he could trust to "hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine" in order to convince the mine owners to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of the secrecy was, the incident would then be blamed on the union.

However, Major Ellison reported that the miners took a route out of the mine that would not make ambush possible. Reardon ordered Ellison to pursue an alternative plan, which was shooting up one of the mines. Major Ellison and Sergeant Gordon Walter fired sixty shots into two mine buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; The plan worked, and the mine owners paid up. Ellison would later testify (in October 1904) that General Reardon informed him 
Adjutant General Sherman Bell and [[James Hamilton Peabody|Colorado Governor James Peabody]] knew about the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; Major Ellison's testimony about the shooting plot, and about the staged attacks on striking miners, was corroborated by two other soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludlow massacre, 1914===
Professor James H. Brewster, a faculty attorney with the [[University of Colorado]] who was investigating the strike for [[Elias M. Ammons|Governor Ammons]], was aware that militia Lieutenant [[Karl Linderfelt]] was guilty of abuse and beatings of innocent citizens, including a small Greek boy "whose head was split open".&lt;ref&gt;Industrial relations, Final Report and Testimony Submitted to Congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations, Volume 7, 1916, pages 6632-6668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, Dana Frank, Robin D. G. Kelley, Three Strikes: Miners, Musicians, Salesgirls, and the Fighting Spirit of Labor's Last Century, Beacon Press, 2002, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Brewster sent a telegram to Governor Ammons requesting Linderfelt's removal. No action was taken. In a subsequent face to face meeting with the governor, three months prior to the Ludlow Massacre, Brewster again insisted that Linderfelt be removed, but again, Ammons declined. In later testimony, Professor Brewster stated that Linderfelt was the reason for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial relations, Final Report and Testimony Submitted to Congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations, Volume 7, 1916, pages 6632-6668&lt;/ref&gt; On the day that the [[Ludlow Massacre]] occurred, Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt, commander of one of two companies of the Colorado National Guard, had [[Louis Tikas]], leader of the Ludlow tent colony of striking miners, at gunpoint. Tikas was unarmed, and the miners would later explain that he approached the militia to ask them to stop shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Zeese Papanikolas, Buried Unsung, Louis Tikas and the Ludlow Massacre, University of Nebraska Press, 1982, page 226&lt;/ref&gt; While two militiamen held Tikas, Linderfelt broke a rifle butt over his head. Tikas and two other captured miners were later found shot dead. Tikas had been shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Thomas G., Killing for Coal: America's Deadliest Labor War (Harvard UP, 2008) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies lay along the Colorado and Southern railroad tracks for three days in full view of passing trains. The militia officers refused to allow them to be moved until a local of a railway union demanded the bodies be taken away for burial. A court martial found Lieutenant Linderfelt guilty of assaulting Tikas with a Springfield rifle, "but attaches no criminality thereto. And the court does therefor acquit him."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, Dana Frank, Robin D. G. Kelley, Three Strikes: Miners, Musicians, Salesgirls, and the Fighting Spirit of Labor's Last Century, Beacon Press, 2002, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1916 Congressional investigation===

In 1916, the [[Commission on Industrial Relations]], created by the [[U.S. Congress]], issued a final report on its investigation of industrial unrest. On the question of violence in industrial disputes, the Commission stated, in part,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many instances of the use of physical force by the agents of employers have ... come before the Commission, indicating a relatively wide use, particularly in isolated communities.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Patrick Walsh, Basil M. Manly, John Rogers Commons, Final report of the Commission on industrial relations, United States. Commission on Industrial Relations, Barnard &amp; Miller print, 1915, pages 139-142&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Late 20th century anti-union violence==

By the early 1900s, public tolerance for violence during labor disputes began to decrease. Yet violence involving strikebreaking troops and armed guards continued into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi. The new methods were still effective at controlling, or reducing, unions.&lt;/ref&gt; The level of violence that anti-union agencies engaged in eventually resulted in their tactics becoming increasingly public, for there were a very great number of newspaper and muckraking articles written about such incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, pp. xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Resources that once were allocated to overt control over workforces began to be assigned to other methods of control, such as industrial espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, the public no longer considered companies unassailable.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet legislation related to employer strategies such as violent strike breaking would have to wait until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, employers began to embrace new methods of managing workers and unions which were still effective, but much more subtle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, and noted that attacks on strikers by company guards had all but disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence still occurs in labor disputes, for example, when one side miscalculates. Bringing in outside security forces, as one example, can lead to violence in modern labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of cameras and camcorders may affect levels of violence in labor disputes today.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples since 1940 ===

*[[Victor Reuther]], a leader of the [[United Auto Workers]] in [[Detroit]], survived an assassination attempt in 1949, with the loss of his right eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/05/us/victor-reuther-influential-labor-leader-dies-at-92.html|title=Victor Reuther, Influential Labor Leader, Dies at 92|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=2004-06-05|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats ===

Sometimes, threats of violence cause damage to union members or supporters. Other times, threats against unions or their members may backfire. For example, Indiana Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Cox was fired after suggesting that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker should use live ammunition against pro-union protesters involved in the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]]. More recently, a Deputy Prosecutor in Indiana's Johnson County, Carlos Lam, suggested that Governor Walker should mount a "[[false flag]]" operation which would make it ''appear'' as if the union was committing violence. After initially claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam admitted to sending the suggestion and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, American Bar Association Journal, posted Mar 25, 2011, http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/a_second_indiana_prosecutor_is_out_of_a_job_for_unusual_advice_to_wisconsin/ retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, posted March 25, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |df= }} retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cullen Werwie, press secretary for Governor Walker, states that Walker's office was unaware of Lam's email. According to CBS News, Werwie also commented, "Certainly we do not support the actions suggested in (the) email. Governor Walker has said time and again that the protesters have every right to have their voice heard, and for the most part the protests have been peaceful. We are hopeful that the tradition will continue."&lt;ref&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, American Bar Association Journal, posted Mar 25, 2011, http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/a_second_indiana_prosecutor_is_out_of_a_job_for_unusual_advice_to_wisconsin/ retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, posted March 25, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |df= }} retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ayni''' ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], also spelled ''Ayniy'' or ''Aini'') can refer to either the concept of reciprocity or mutualism among people of the Andean mountain communities or the practice of this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 30027956|title = The Language of Reciprocity in Southern Peruvian Quechua|last = Mannheim|first = Bruce|date = Fall 1986|journal = Anthropological Linguistics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a noun, the law of ayni states that everything in the world is connected, and is the only commandment that rules daily life in many communities like the [[Q'ero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AYNI – the force of reciprocity {{!}} Inka World|url = http://www.inka-world.com/en/ayni-force-reciprocity.html|website = www.inka-world.com|accessdate = 2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a verb, this often refers to the cooperation between the members of a [[community]] when one member gives to another, he or she is entitled to receive something back. Well-known practitioners of Ayni include the [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymara people|Aymara]], as well as numerous other tribes that live in the [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Bolivia]].

In communities like the [[Q'ero]], five principles define the Andean way of life: ''munay'' (to love), ''yachay'' (to learn, know, and remember), ''llan'kay'' (to work), ''kawsay'' (life), and ''ayni'' (reciprocity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Andean Codex: Adventures and Initiations among the Peruvian Shamans|last = Williams|first = J. E.|publisher = Hampton Roads Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 1571743049|location = Charlottesville, VA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, ayni is regarded as the most important principle, as it provides the backbone of life. This is because ayni is not limited to being compensated for earlier help; a more broad definition of ayni would be the exchange of energy between humans, nature, and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AYNI – the force of reciprocity {{!}} Inka World|url = http://www.inka-world.com/en/ayni-force-reciprocity.html|website = www.inka-world.com|accessdate = 2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this would be ayni between a human and a tree: A tree is watered by a human, and the tree uses this water to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. The oxygen is used by humans to perform respiration and survive, and some glucose may eventually find its way into products that humans use such as fruits. In return, humans convert oxygen back to carbon dioxide for use by the tree, as well as plant seeds the tree produced to create more trees. The simple of act of watering a tree can also reap in rewards including by not limited to: creating shade, wind barriers, soil anchors, and more. The relationships that can be defined as ayni thus extend to everything beneficial involving two parties.

== Ayni as a verb ==
In practice, Quechua and Aymara communities apply ayni through human to human interaction. This is thought to have originated from the harsh climate of the Andean mountain region and the mutualism thus demanded for the survival of the people living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peru: Life of the Quechua {{!}} Scholastic.com|url = http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=11773|website = www.scholastic.com|accessdate = 2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of a community help other members for private purposes when support is needed for activities such as construction and planting.  Participants are supplied with food and drink by the hosting party. The party that was helped returns the favor by assisting those who helped them or others in need of aid, completing the reciprocity.

This is not to be confused with [[Communal work#Mink'a|Mink'a]], also native to the Andean region, in which participants are typically paid for services such as harvesting crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = eCommons@Cornell: Negotiating Hybridity: Moral Economy And Globalization In Highland Bolivia|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1813/31465|website = hdl.handle.net|accessdate = 2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar Concepts ==

There are many concepts globally that show similarly to ayni. While none of them are exactly the same as ayni, they all show mutualism to a certain extent.

{{refimprove|date=May 2015}}

A '''Bohemian''' ({{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|ˈ|h|iː|m|i|ə|n}}) is a resident of [[Bohemia]], a region of the [[Czech Republic]] or the former [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], a region of the former Crown of Bohemia ([[lands of the Bohemian Crown]]). In English, the word "Bohemian" was used to denote the [[Czech people]] as well as the [[Czech language]] before the word "Czech" became prevalent in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name = Oxford/&gt;

In a separate meaning, "Bohemian" may also denote "a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts" according to [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries Online]]. (See [[Bohemianism]]).&lt;ref name = Oxford&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Bohemian "Bohemian"], ''Oxford Dictionaries'' online, Oxford University Press, Retrieved on: 2011-09-14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ottův slovník naučný - 17 České kroje - 2.jpg|thumb|Bohemian traditional costumes]]
The name "Bohemia" derives from the name of the [[Boii]], a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe who inhabited that area towards the latter [[La Tène period]]. The toponym ''Boiohaemum,'' first attested by [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'' 28.&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly taken to mean "home of the Boii" (from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]] root *''haima-'' meaning "world, home"). 

The word "Bohemian" has never been widely used by the local Czech population. In [[Czech language|Czech]], the region since the early Middle Ages has been called ''Čechy'' but also, especially during the period of restoration/emancipation of the Czech language and nation, as ''Čechie.'' Another term, stressing the importance of the state/nation, is ''Království české'' ("Czech Kingdom") in Czech, or ''Böhmen'' (Königreich) in German. Its mainly Czech-speaking inhabitants were called ''Čechové'' (in modern Czech ''Češi'').

In most other Western European vernaculars and in Latin (as ''Bohemi''), the word "Bohemian" or a derivate was used. If the Czech ethnic origin was to be stressed, combinations such as  "Bohemian of Bohemian language" (''Čech českého jazyka''), "a real Bohemian" (''pravý Čech''), etc. were used.

It was not until the 19th century that other European languages began to use words related to  "Czechs" (as in English, ''Tschechien'' in [[German language|German]], ''Tchèques'' in [[French language|French]]) in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to distinguish between ethnic Slavic-speaking Bohemians and other inhabitants of Bohemia. The latter were mostly [[ethnic Germans]], who identified as "German Bohemians" (''Deutschböhmen'') or simply as "Bohemians" (''Böhmen''). In many parts of Europe, state citizenship was not identical with ethnicity and language, and the various peoples were usually identified by their language. Ethnic boundaries in Bohemia were not always sharp, and people very often were bilingual. Intermarriages across language borders were also common. Native Czech speakers often spoke German and many native German speakers spoke Czech with varying fluency, particularly in areas with many Czech speakers.

Currently, the word "Bohemians" is sometimes used when speaking about persons from Bohemia of all ethnic origins, especially before the year 1918, when the Kingdom of Bohemia ceased to exist. It is also used to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part (Bohemia proper) of the state, and the eastern ([[Moravia]]) or north-eastern ([[Czech Silesia|Silesia]]) parts.

The different term "[[Bohemianism]]" was associated with "a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts", that comes from the French word ''bohémien.''&lt;ref name = Oxford/&gt;

The '''Canadian Broadcast Standards Council''' is an industry funded self-regulating organization created by the [[Canadian Association of Broadcasters]] to administer standards established by its own members, [[Canada]]'s private broadcasters.

The council's membership includes more than 760 private sector [[radio]] and [[television]] stations, specialty services and networks from across Canada, programming in English, French and third languages.  As such, the council allows the private broadcasting industry to be self-regulating; it acts as an intermediary in the regulatory process, which is governed by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC). The CRTC itself generally hears complaints against only the few CBSC non-members (most notably public broadcasters such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]), as well as reviews of CBSC decisions; the latter rarely lead to any additional action.

Although first suggested by private broadcasters as early as 1968, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council was not created until 1990.

==Council objectives==

The council has five primary objectives:

* Assist in the application of broadcast standards developed by the private broadcast industry.
* Inform the public of such standards and the council's role in self-regulation of the private broadcast industry.
* Provide a forum for public complaints should such standards be violated.
* Provide recommendations to private broadcasters and complainants, should complaint resolution not be achieved.
* Inform broadcasters of emerging societal trends and develop ways to adjust broadcast standards to meet them.

==Comparison with similar organizations==

Citations have been issued not only for violations of the content guidelines themselves but also for failing to provide sufficient information to viewers, i.e. missing or inadequate viewer advisories, or missing ratings icons.

==Complaints process==
If after receiving an unsatisfactory response from a broadcaster about concerns involving content broadcast by one the members of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, members of the public may file a complaint with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. The process takes some time after the complaint is raised.  There is no dialogue within their process as it is purely an administrative review based on the council's own Broadcast Standards and past decisions.  The exercise does not examine or re-examine the appropriateness of the current standards by the panel so community standards are not addressed. One of the many criticisms of the process is that it does not meet with stated objectives of the council as it fails to inform broadcasters of emerging and changing societal trends or develop ways to adjust broadcast standards to meet them.  A written decision is supplied to the complainant citing past decisions.

==Controversies==
In January 2011, the council's Atlantic Regional Panel ruled against [[CHOZ-FM]]&lt;ref name=money&gt;[http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2011/110112.php "Use of Derogatory Word for Gays in a Song Breaches Broadcast Codes, Says Canadian Broadcast Standards Council"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115075821/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2011/110112.php |date=2011-01-15 }}. Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, January 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in a complaint regarding the song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" by [[Dire Straits]] (CBSC Decision 09/10-0818).&lt;ref name=money/&gt; The council ruled that Canadian radio stations must mute or otherwise edit out the word "[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]" before airing the original version of the song. The CRTC has asked the council to review their ban after they received numerous complaints about the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vancouversun.com/news/CRTC+asks+review+Dire+Straits+song/4144591/story.html "CRTC asks for review of Dire Straits song ban"]. ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'', January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, the CBSC reiterated that it found the slur to be inappropriate; however, because of considerations in regard to its use in context, the CBSC has left it up to the stations to decide whether to play the original or edited versions of the song. Most of the CBSC panelists thought the slur was inappropriate, but it was used only in a satirical, non-hateful manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20110831/dire-straits-song-110831/ "'Money for Nothing' slur inappropriate, council says"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316230323/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20110831/dire-straits-song-110831/ |date=March 16, 2012 }}. [[CTV News]], August 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016-10-19, CBSC's French language panel ruled video clips showing dildos and macaroni and cheese being stirred in a pot and making 'squishy' noise from [[MusiquePlus]] program [[CTRL (program)|CTRL]] broadcast on 2015-11-11 were not considered as sufficiently explicit to be classified as 'explicit sexual content'. The original complaint claimed the CTRL episode exposed complainer's children to sexual material because MusiquePlus failed to provide viewer advisories, and the cable provider rated the material as 8+. The council ruled the macaroni video failed to meet the explicit sexual content standard, and the use of f-word in the dildo video did not have the vulgar connotation it can have in English, which allowed the word to be used if it was used only on occasion and was not used to insult or attack an individual or group. However, the council determined MusiquePlus didn't post a viewer advisory warning of explicit language and sexual content during the episode in question. But MusiquePlus has since established the proper advisories, according to the council. The council also found the episode should be rated 13+, but the 8+ rating was erroneously issued by the cable company, not MusiquePlus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsc.ca/musiqueplus-re-ctrl/ MusiquePlus re CTRL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsc.ca/dildo-scenes-require-viewer-advisories-says-canadian-broadcast-standards-council/ Dildo Scenes Require Viewer Advisories, Says Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://thestarphoenix.com/storyline/dildos-on-daytime-tv-no-problem-canadas-broadcast-regulator-said-in-a-recent-ruling-the-occasional-f-bomb-thats-ok-too Dildos on daytime TV?

'''Croats in Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sverigekroater}}) are citizens and residents of [[Sweden]] who are of [[Croatia]]n descent. As of 2017, they number approximately 28,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=11437&amp;rog3=SW&lt;/ref&gt; Croats mostly follow [[Catholicism]], but a small minority that have been living in Sweden for generations have converted to [[Evangelicalism]]. They mostly live in [[Stockholm]], the capital city, and in [[Malmö]], in [[Rosengård]] district. The most successful football club of Croats of Sweden is [[NK Croatia Malmö]], that played in 1988 the Swedish 2nd League, declared in 1989 with title "Best Immigrant Club of Europe"{{cn|date=July 2017}}, winner of Malmö Mästerskap four times  (1988, 1989, 1991 and 2016). [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], a half-Croat, can be considered a Croat of Sweden, because his mother is a Croat.

The '''Damara,''' plural '''Damaran''' ([[Khoekhoegowab]]: '''ǂNūkhoen''', ''Black people'', {{lang-de|Bergdamara}}, referring to their extended stay in hilly and mountainous sites, also called at various times the '''Daman''' or the '''Damaqua''') are an [[ethnic group]] who make up 8.5% of [[Namibia|Namibia's]] population. They speak the [[Khoekhoe language]] (like the [[Nama people]]) and the majority live in the northwestern regions of Namibia, however they are also found widely across the rest of the country. They have no known cultural relationship with any of the other ethnicities anywhere else in Africa,&lt;ref name="namibiatourism1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namibiatourism.com.na/people_damara.php |title=Damara Culture &amp;#124; Namibia Africa &amp;#124; Traditions, Heritage, Society &amp; People |publisher=Namibiatourism.com.na |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223113310/http://www.namibiatourism.com.na/people_damara.php |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and very little is known of their origin. It has been proposed that the Damara are a remnant population of South-Western Africa [[hunter-gatherer]]s, otherwise only represented by the [[Cimba people|Cimba]], [[Kwisi people|Kwisi]], and [[Kwadi people|Kwadi]], who adopted the [[Khoekhoe language]] of the immigrant [[Nama people]].&lt;ref name=Blench&gt;[http://www.rogerblench.info/Anthropology%20data/Text/Pygmies%20an%20ethnographic%20fiction.pdf Blench, Roger. 1999.

''Challenging Elusiveness: Central African Hunter-Gatherers in a Multidisciplinary Perspective''. Leiden.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent genetic studies have found that Damara are closely related to neighbouring [[Himba people|Himba]] and [[Herero people|Herero]] people, consistent with an origin from Bantu speakers who shifted to a different language and culture.&lt;ref name=Bajic&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bajic |first1=Vladimir |date=2018 |title = Genetic structure and sex-biased gene flow in the history of southern African populations |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajpa.23694 |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=656-671 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.23694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliveira&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oliveira |first1=Sandra |date=2018 |title = Matriclans shape populations: insights from the Angolan Namib Desert into the maternal genetic history of southern Africa |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=165 |issue=3 |pages=518-535 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.23378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their name in their own language is the ''"Daman"'' (where the ''"-n"'' is just the Khoekhoe plural ending). The name ''"Damaqua"'' stems from the addition of the Khoekhoe suffix ''"-qua/khwa"'' meaning "people" (found in the names of other Southern African peoples like the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] and the [[Griqua people|Griqua]]).&lt;ref name=Gamab&gt;{{Cite web

Prior to 1870 the hunter-gatherer Damaran occupied most of central Namibia they used to practice pastoralism with sheep and cattle, but were also agriculturalist planting pumpkins, corn, tobacco. The Damaran were also copper-smiths known for their ability to melt copper and used to make ornaments, jewellery, knives and spear heads out of iron. The Damaran just like the Sān believed in communal ownership of land meaning that no individual owned land as God had given land to everyone. Thus, rather than one person owning good grazing land and another seeking out an existence, all would live in harmony. It was for this reason that many were displaced when the Nama and [[Herero people|Herero]] began to occupy this area in search of better grazing. Thereafter the Damara were dominated by the Namaqua and the Herero, most living as servants in their households.&lt;ref name="namibiatourism1"/&gt;

In 1960, the South African government forced the Damara into the [[bantustan]] of [[Damaraland]], an area of poor soil and irregular rainfall. About half of their numbers still occupy Damaraland.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Mythology==

The supreme deity of the Damaran (ǂNūkhoen) is '''ǁGamab''', also referred to as ''ǁGammāb'' (provider of water), ''ǁGauna'' (Sān), ''ǁGaunab'' (Khoekhoe) and Haukhoin ({{lang-naq|foreigners}}) by the Khoekhoe.

He lives in a high heaven, even above the heaven of the stars. ǁGamab, from ǁGam, {{lang-naq|water}}, and mā, {{lang-naq|give}} is provider of the water and thus associated with the rising clouds, thunder, lightning and water. He ensured the annual renewal of nature being the cycle of the seasons and supplied game animals to the ǃgarob ({{lang-naq|veld}}) and the Damaran. One of his chief responsibilities is to warrant the growth of crops.

ǁGamab is also the God of Death, directing the fate of mankind. He shoots arrows at humans from his place above the skies and those struck fall ill and die. After death, the souls of the dead make their way to ǁGamab's village in the heaven above stars and gather around him at a ritual fire. Then he offers them a drink from a bowl of liquid fat to drink, as a reward.

ǁGamab's arch-enemy is the evil ǁGaunab.&lt;ref name="Gamab" /&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
Since time immemorial, before the Nama migration from Southern Africa into what is today known as Namibia, and even before the arrival of the Bantu groups from North and Eastern Africa to the present-day Namibia the Damaran were living in this south-western part of Africa.

According to written accounts of the history of the Damaran which dates back to the leadership of the Damaras as far back as the 14th century (1390), substantiated by archaeological and ethnological evidence reflected to those records, the Damaran next to the Sān, are the first inhabitants of what is today known as Namibia. Oral tradition has it that the Damaran came to Namibia from ǁKhaus (Equatorial Rainforest) through ǃĀǂkhib centuries ago.

The Damaran initially settled between Huriǂnaub ([[Kunene River]]) and ǃGûǁōb ([[Kavango River]]), before entering what later-on centuries long after became known as ǀNaweǃhūb ([[Ovamboland]]). The Damaran moved southwards and were living peacefully as a single group in the area that is a stone's throw and an eagle's flight in the surrounding of Dâureb ([[Brandberg Mountain]]), [[Paresis Mountains]], ǃHōb ([[Waterberg, (Namibia)|Waterberg]]), the [[Omatako Mountains]], [[Otavi Mountains]] and ǃOeǂgâb ([[Erongo Mountains]]). Oral and written historical records have it that intruders, reportedly under the leadership of a certain Mukumbi (Mûtsixubi) invaded that area in 1600, and clashed with the Damaran.

The Damaran dispersed in splinter groups as a result of the aftermath of this battle wherein the then Damara Gaob (King), Gaob ǀNarimab succumbed due to injuries sustained in the battle. The Damara, besides the ǀGowanîn, splinter groups then settled all over the country in areas where there was an abundant water and shelter in the form of mountains.

Remnants of the group that was led by Gaob ǀNarimab who dispersed moved eastwards and settled in the ǀGowas, also known as ǀŪmâs (Kalahari Desert) and got the name ǀGowanîn (Damaran of the Kalahari- later referred to as the Sand Kaffers by the imperialist Germans). Another group fled to mountainous central Namibia seeking shelter in ǀKhomas (Khomas Hochland), ǃAoǁaexas Mountains, ǂĒros (Eros Mountains) and ǀAu-ās (Auas Mountains) and became known as the ǀKhomanin (Damaran of the [ǀKhomas] mountains), later referred to as the Berg Damara.

The group that remained in and around ǃOeǂgâb (Erongo Mountains) and settled nearby present-day ǀÂǂgommes ([[Okombahe]]) got to be known as the ǃOeǂgân (Damaran of the Erongo Mountain).

There were also two other groups that moved down the Tsoaxub ([[Swakop River]]) and ǃKhuiseb ([[Kuiseb River]]) respectively, namely the Tsoaxudaman and the ǃKhuisedaman.

Another group, the |Gaiodaman, moved towards the area of ǃKhuidiǁgams ([[Omaruru River|Omaruru]]) and Parase!homgu (Paresis Mountains), and later-on moved back to area west of ǃHob (Waterberg). During the 1904 wars with the German colonial forces, some members of the ǀGaiodaman fled with the Ovaherero to Piriǃhūb (Botswana), whereas some settled at ǀŪgowas in the vicinity of ǃHob (Waterberg Mountain).

The major group of Damaras fled down towards the south, as far as the ǃGarib ([[Orange River]]) and settled in that area, and installed Gaob !Gariseb as their leader. This group moved back northwards around 1670, and settled at ǂKhanubes, wherefrom they moved and split into two groups, one of which settled in the vicinity of ǂAixorobes ([[Tsumeb]]) and the other one led by Gaob ǀNarirab settled at |Haigomab!gaus, south-east of [[Otjituuo]]. The latter-mentioned group split up in four (4) factions:

*One group moved to the ǃHoaruseb River, and systematically down towards the Atlantic Ocean following the said river and settling on its banks, and they became known as the ǃNaranin and ǃHoarusedaman respectively.
*The other group moved to the ǁHuanib River, and inhabited the area of ǃNani|audi ([[Sesfontein]]), and was called by the name ǁHuanidaman.
*The third faction moved towards the Dâureb (Brandberg) and got the name Dâuredaman and ǃNamidaman.
*The last faction moved towards Anibira-āhes ([[Fransfontein]]), and Aroǃhūb area, and they were later joined by the ǂAodaman who moved thereto from the Paresis Mountains.

The remainder of clans not mentioned above came into existence as a result of fractions in they already mentioned clans.

A separate group was created in the 1970s when Damara people living at [[Riemvasmaak]] in [[South Africa]] were expelled to Khorixas in the Damara [[bantustan]] in order to make space for a military installation. This group became known as the '''Riemvasmakers'''. They were given land by Damara King [[Justus ǁGaroëb]] to settle on. When in 1994 with the independence of South Africa a process of land restitution allowed the return of families and communities, some of the Riemvasmakers returned but a residual group founded their own traditional authority. They are {{As of|2014|alt=seeking}} recognition from the Namibian government to be recognised as a separate Damara clan.&lt;ref name="stev"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jo Ractliffe.

The Damara are divided into clans, each headed by a chief, with a King, [[Justus ǁGaroëb]], over the whole Damara people. Prince ǀHaihāb, Chief Xamseb, and ǁGuruseb were among the richest and most powerful chiefs.

Damara males were not [[circumcision|circumcised]]. However, groups of boys were initiated into manhood through an elaborate hunting ritual. This ritual is repeated twice, for teenagers and grown men, after which the initiates are considered clan elders.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Alan (1992) ''Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples''
Cambridge University Press [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nBx83jMc48C&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA210 pp 210–211]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their traditional clothing colors are green, white, and blue. Green and blue identify the different sub-groups. Some women may wear white and blue or white and green, the white representing peace and unity among all Damara-speaking people.

The women do household chores like cooking, cleaning, and gardening. Their primary duty is milking the cows in the morning and nurturing the young. Men traditionally hunt and herd the cattle, leaving the village as early as the sunrise, patrolling their area to protect their cattle and grazing ground as tradition dictates. Men can be very aggressive towards intruders if not notified of any other male presence in a grazing area.

Though many Damara people own and live on rural farms, the majority live in the small towns scattered across the Erongo region or in Namibia's capital city of [[Windhoek]]. Those that still live on farms tend to live in extended family groups of as many as one hundred, creating small villages of family members.

The Damara are rich in cattle and sheep. Some chiefs possess up to 8,000 head of horned cattle.

===Historic traditional attire===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
The Damara made use of animal hides for clothing. The principal animal hides that were used were those of springbok and goats for clothing and sheep and jackal for blankets. Damaran traditional attires differentiated between a girl, an unmarried or married woman and an elderly woman in the same manner that it differentiated between boys, unmarried and married men and men of age. Some outfits were reserved for special ceremonies in contrast to everyday garments.

A girl in a Damara context is any female that has not yet undergone the menstrual cycle while a boy is any male that has not yet undergone the first hunting ritual. A hunting ritual was performed in the Damara culture as Damara males were not circumcised. The first hunting ritual was performed by boys in order to become man and the second by man to become community elders. All Damara children regardless of sex wore a ''ǃgaes'', an apron like loin-cloth that covers genitalia. Girls would at a tender age undergo the ''ǂgaeǂnoas'' (have earring holes made) after which black thread would be inserted until such a time they will first start wearing ''ǃgamdi'' (earrings).

A man in the Damara context is any male that has undergone the first hunting ritual while a woman is any female that has experienced the menstrual cycle. The Damara culture would continue to differentiate between a married and unmarried man or woman. An unmarried man is called an ''axa-aob'' while a woman is an ''oaxaes''. An unmarried man would simply wear a ''ǁnaweb'' which is a loin-cloth that is tucked in between the legs while an unmarried woman wore a ''ǃgaes'' to cover genitalia and a ''ǀgâubes'' to cover the rears.

A married man that has a child or children is called an ''aob'', while a married woman with children is a ''taras''. Such a man would wear a ''sorab'' which is a strip of soft leather worn between legs. Both ends are tucked under thong around waist and flapped over at front and the back. They would also wear a ''danakhōb'' which is the skin of any smallish animal that the wife presents to her husband at their wedding to wear on his head. The men would were the "head hide" to ceremonies and on auspicious occasions to show that he is the head of a household. The hide would preferably be of a ''ǃnoreb'' (a [[common genet]]). Married women just like girls would wear a ''ǀgâubes'' (rear loincloth) and would wear a ''ǀawiǃgaes'' (loincloth consisting of strips) instead of a regular ''ǃgaes''. A ''ǁkhaikhōb'' would also be worn only to ceremonies and on auspicious occasions, but mostly during pregnancy and by elder women on a daily basis. The ǁkhaikhōb is the hide of a medium-sized antelope most preferably a ''ǀhauib'' (a [[Damara dik-dik]]) or a ''dôas'', ''ǀnâus'' ([[Duiker]]) that is worn to cover breast and the abdomen (during pregnancy).

An elderly man, ''kaikhoeb'', is any Damara male that has undergone the second and last hunting ritual. An elderly woman, a ''kaikhoes'', is a female that has concluded her menstrual cycle. All elderly men and women would wear a ''ǃgūb'', which is a skirt-like loin-cloth or traditional skirt for men and women. Elderly women would also wear a ''ǁkhaikhōb'' and sometimes a ''khōǃkhaib'' (headgear fashioned of soft hide).

Women being more aware of beautification would wear ''ǃgamdi'' (small traditional earrings made from iron and or copper) and wear necklaces made of ostrich egg shells known as a ǁnûib in Khoekhoegowab. Women wore ǃganudi (arm bangles) and ǃgoroǃkhuidi (ornamental anklets) they also originally made from iron and or copper later replaced by beads and or ostrich egg shells. An anklet made from moth larvae (ǀkhîs) was also worn but only during performances/dances along with a tussled apron known as a ǀhapis (for females) and or ǀhapib (for males)

ǃNau-i (traditional facial foundation) also played a significant part in Damara and the wider Khoekhoe cosmetics. Women would ǀīǃnâ (perfume) hides and blankets by stewing buchu on hot stones placed under a ǀīǃnâs (dome-shaped basket) after which they would boro themselves (smear red ochre on their faces) early in the morning. They would also sprinkle some sâ-i (buchu powder) on their hides and blankets with a ǃūro-ams (powder-puff made from a piece of hare fur used to pluck ǃūros (tortoise-shell container, carried by women for holding sâ-i) to power oneself.)

Man also wore arm bangles (ǃganugu) and ǃgoroǃkhuigu (anklets) which were unadorned in design and denser than those of women. A strand of beads that criss-crossed the chess known as a karab was also worn by men. Tsaob (ash) was used as an anti-perspiring agent by the Damaran as they believe that it is the purest substance on Earth.

===Contemporary traditional attire===
The replacement of animal hides with fabrics has also been visible in the Damara culture as the aforementioned outfits are mostly worn to cultural ceremonies and on auspicious occasions. Thus the Damaran sought for a perfect substitution for animal hides and introduced the Damarokoes (Damara dress). The Damarokoes was adopted form missionary wives in the mid-19th century and was introduced due to the Christianisation of the Damaran as missionaries saw the animal hides as "primitive and exposing". The dress adopted to cover up the "nude" Damara women ensured just that with its ankle-lengthiness and long sleeves and a ǃkhens (shawl) to ensure maximum coverage.

The Dama ǃkhaib (headgear) is a unique innovation of the Damara women as they shaped a headgear that can be fashionable yet work effective as they still could ǂkhao (carry/load something on head) water containers and firewood. It is not only the ǃkhaib that was fashionable and work effective but also the sleeves as the sleeves have a protruding elbow design allowing the elbow to contract and release without constrains. The length of the dress is also fashionable and work effective as it is not too long so as to be caught by twigs, branches and or thorns.

Damara men on the other hand were shirts, coats and or blazers with Damara colours being blue, white and green, sometimes with print or embroidery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4450">In [[Protestantism]], a '''day of humiliation''' or fasting was a publicly proclaimed day of [[fasting]] and [[prayer in Christianity|prayer]] in response to an event thought to signal [[God's judgement]]. A '''day of thanksgiving''' was a day set aside for public worship in thanksgiving for events believed to signal [[God's mercy]] and favor. Such a day might be proclaimed by the civil authority or the church.{{sfn|Hambrick-Stowe|1982|p=100}}

==History==
National days of prayer for specific occasions had been ordered in England as early as 1009 by King [[Æthelred the Unready]].{{sfn|Bates|2012|p=31}} Occasional days of fasting were held in [[England]] in the middle of the sixteenth century under [[Elizabeth I]] in response to [[Plague (disease)|plague]] outbreaks and the [[Armada Crisis]] of 1588. Puritans especially embraced occasional days of fasting.{{sfn|Durston|1992|p=129}} By the middle of the seventeenth century, days of thanksgiving were celebrated in [[New England]] annually in November.{{sfn|Hambrick-Stowe|1982|p=102}}

==Days of humiliation and fasting==
A day of humiliation or thanksgiving might be proclaimed in response to a drought, flood, fire, military defeat, or plague. They might also be held before the undertaking of a difficult endeavor. People were expected to search themselves for sin and to repent in order to appease God's wrath. Everyone between the ages of sixteen and sixty was expected to spend the entire day in fasting, church attendance, listening to sermons of exhortation and meditating on their sin.{{sfn|Baker|2010|p=21}} 

==Days of thanksgiving==
A day of thanksgiving might be held in response to signs of God's mercy, such as rain allowing a good harvest, arrival of needed supplies, or recovery from sickness. They might also be held after a long period of general success and lack of disaster. On days of thanksgiving, the faithful would also spend the day in church attendance, but would pray thankfully, sing psalms of praise, and feast. Puritan feast days were more solemn and demanding than traditional Christian feasts.{{sfn|Baker|2010|p=21}} Days of thanksgiving were celebrated with joy in thanks for recent blessing, but Puritans also saw them as days to look forward to the coming of the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Hambrick-Stowe|1982|p=102}}

==As replacements of traditional holidays==
Puritans rejected the traditional Christian [[liturgical calendar]] of holy days, including [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]], as well as [[saints' days]], but set aside special days in response to current events. However, natural cycles caused [[penance]] and [[regeneration (theology)|rebirth]] to continue to be associated with [[Spring (season)|Spring]], as had been the case with Easter. Thanksgiving days were normally celebrated in Autumn following the [[harvest]].{{sfn|Hambrick-Stowe|1982|p=101}}

'''Elias Canetti''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|i|,_|k|ɑː|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canetti "Canetti"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bg|Елиас Канети}}; 25 July 1905 – 14 August 1994) was a [[German-language]] author, born in [[Ruse, Bulgaria]] to a merchant family. They moved to [[Manchester, England]], but his father died in 1912, and his mother took her three sons back to the continent.  They settled in Vienna. 

Canetti moved to England in 1938 after the Anschluss to escape Nazi persecution. He became a British citizen in 1952.  He is known as a modernist novelist, playwright, memoirist, and non-fiction writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorenz|first=Dagmar C.G.|title=A Companion to the Works of Elias Canetti|date=2009|isbn=978-080-578-276-9|pages=350|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1981, "for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1981|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1981/|accessdate=8 April 2014 |author=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for his non-fiction book ''Crowds and Power'', among other works.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Born in 1905 to businessman Jacques Canetti and Mathilde ''née'' Arditti in [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], a city on the [[Danube]] in [[Bulgaria]], Canetti was the eldest of three sons.&lt;ref name="litenc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Dagmar C. G.|date=17 April 2004 |title=Elias Canetti|journal=Literary Encyclopedia|publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company Limited|issn=1747-678X|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=725|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestors were [[Sephardi Jews]]. His paternal ancestors settled in Ruse from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Edirne|Adrianople]].&lt;ref name="litenc"/&gt; The original family name was ''Cañete'', named after [[Cañete, Cuenca]], a village in [[Spain]].

In Ruse, Canetti's father and grandfather were successful merchants who operated out of a commercial building, which they had built in 1898.&lt;ref name="gesellschaft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eliascanetti.org/73.0.html?&amp;L=3 |title=The Canetti House&amp;nbsp;– a forum for alternative culture |publisher=Internationale Elias Canetti Gesellschaft |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324203226/http://eliascanetti.org/73.0.html?&amp;L=3 |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canetti's mother descended from the Arditti family, one of the oldest Sephardi families in Bulgaria, who were among the founders of the Ruse Jewish colony in the late 18th century. The Ardittis can be traced to the 14th century, when they were court physicians and astronomers to the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] royal court of [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso IV]] and [[Peter IV of Aragon|Pedro IV]]. Before settling in Ruse, they had migrated into Italy and lived in [[Livorno]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ohrenzeuge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Angelova|first=Penka|title=Elias Canetti: Der Ohrenzeuge des Jahrhunderts|publisher=Internationale Elias-Canetti-Gesellschaft Rousse|year=2006|chapter=Die Geburtsstadt von Elias Canetti|url=https://www.archives.government.bg/tda/docs/canetti_izlojba_ruse.pdf|language=German|access-date=29 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410202259/https://www.archives.government.bg/tda/docs/canetti_izlojba_ruse.pdf|archive-date=10 April 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elias Canettis fødested.JPG|right|thumb|Elias Canetti's native house in [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], [[Bulgaria]]]]

Canetti spent his childhood years, from 1905 to 1911, in Ruse until the family moved to Manchester, England, where Canetti's father joined a business established by his wife's brothers. In 1912, his father died suddenly, and his mother moved with their children first to [[Lausanne]], then [[Vienna]] in the same year. They lived in Vienna from the time Canetti was aged seven onwards. His mother insisted that he speak German, and taught it to him. By this time Canetti already spoke [[Judezmo|Ladino]] (his native language), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], English, and some French; the latter two he studied in the one year they were in Britain. Subsequently the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to [[Zürich]] and then (until 1924) to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where Canetti graduated from high school.

Canetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature. Introduced into the literary circles of [[First Austrian Republic|First-Republic]]-[[Vienna]], he started writing. Politically leaning towards the left, he was present at the [[July Revolt of 1927]] – he came near to the action accidentally, was most impressed by the burning of books (recalled frequently in his writings), and left the place quickly with his bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;Stieg, Gerard, ''Fruits de Feu - l'incendie du Palais du Justice de Vienne en 1927 et ses consequences dans la Littérature Autrichienne''.   Université de Rouen ({{ISBN|9782877750080}}), 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained a degree in chemistry from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1929, but never worked as a chemist.

He published two works in Vienna before escaping to Great Britain. He reflected the experiences of Nazi Germany and political chaos in his works, especially exploring mob action and group thinking in his novel ''Die Blendung'' (''[[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|Auto-da-Fé]]'', 1935) and non-fiction ''[[Crowds and Power]]'' (1960). He wrote several volumes of memoirs, contemplating the influence of his multi-lingual background and childhood.

==Personal life==
[[File:Canetti Peak.jpg|thumb|right|Canetti Peak, Antarctica, named after Elias Canetti]]

In 1934 in Vienna he married Veza (Venetiana) Taubner-Calderon (1897–1963), who acted as his muse and devoted literary assistant. Canetti remained open to relationships with other women. In 1938, after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Germany, the Canetti couple moved to [[London]]. He became closely involved with the painter [[Marie-Louise von Motesiczky]], who was to remain a close companion for many years. His name has also been linked with the author [[Iris Murdoch]] (see [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]]'s ''Iris, A Memoir of Iris Murdoch'', which has several references to an author, referred to as "the Dichter", who was a Nobel Laureate and whose works included ''Die Blendung'' [English title ''[[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|Auto-da-Fé]]'']). 

After Veza died in 1963, Canetti married Hera Buschor (1933–1988), with whom he had a daughter, Johanna, in 1972. Canetti's brother [[Jacques Canetti]] settled in Paris, where he championed a revival of French [[chanson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1997/06/10/jacques-canetti-le-decouvreur-de-brassens-et-de-brel_3787006_1819218.html | title=Jacques Canetti, Le découvreur de Brassens et de Brel | work=Le Monde | author=Patrick Labesse | date=1997-06-10 | accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a German-language writer, Canetti settled in Britain until the 1970s, receiving British citizenship in 1952. For his last 20 years, Canetti lived mostly in [[Zürich]].

===Career===
A writer in German, Canetti won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1981, "for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power". He is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss [[Vienna]]: ''Die Gerettete Zunge'' (The Tongue Set Free); ''Die Fackel im Ohr'' (The Torch in My Ear), and ''Das Augenspiel'' (The Play of the Eyes); for his modernist novel ''[[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|Auto-da-Fé]]'' (''Die Blendung''); and for ''[[Crowds and Power]]'', a psychological study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations. 

In the 1970s, Canetti began to travel more frequently to Zurich, where he settled and lived for his last 20 years. He died in Zürich in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/92556/Elias-Canetti ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[demographics of Chad|population of Chad]] has numerous ethnic groups. [[SIL Ethnologue]] reports more than 130 distinct [[Languages of Chad|languages spoken in Chad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/%5C/15/show_country.asp?name=TD Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition, online version]&lt;/ref&gt;

The population can be broadly divided between those in the east, north and west who follow [[Islam in Chad|Islam]], and the peoples of the south, by which is meant the five southernmost prefectures, who are mostly [[Christianity in Chad|Christian]] or [[African traditional religion|animist]].

==Muslim groups==
[[Islamization of the Sudan|Islamization]] began as early as the 8th century and was mostly complete by the 11th, when Islam became the official religion of the [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]]. The [[Beni Hassan|Arab invaders]] established an economy of [[Arab slave trade|slave trade]] across the [[Sudan region]], and in Chad there was a tradition of slave raids ([[ghazw]]) under the [[Ouaddai Empire|Ouaddai]] and [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]] which persisted well into the 20th century.

The Arabs of Chad form a relatively homogeneous group, localized in the regions of [[Chari-Baguirmi Region|Chari Baguirmi]] and [[Ouaddaï Region|Ouaddai]], but mostly seminomadic. 
Other Muslim  groups include the [[Toubou]], [[Hadjerai]], [[Fulbe|Fulbe/Fulani]], [[Kotoko people|Kotoko]], [[Kanembu people|Kanembou]], [[Baguirmi people|Baguirmi]], [[Boulala]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], and [[Maba people|Maba]]. 
Some indigenous groups, such as the [[Salamat people|Salamat]] and the [[Taundjor]], were largely Arabized by intermarriage over the years.

==Non-Muslim groups==
Among the non-Muslim indigenous peoples, the most important (and the largest single group in Chad) are the [[Sara people|Sara]], about 30 percent of the population. They live in the valleys of the [[Chari River|Chari]] and [[Logone River|Logone]] rivers and are farmers of considerable skill. Others include the [[Ngambaye]], [[Mbaye]], [[Goulaye]], [[Moundang]], [[Moussei]], and [[Massa]]. 

==Language and ethnic groups==
Ethno-linguistically, the groups may be divided into:
*[[Arabized]] groups, mostly [[Arabized Berber]]  
*[[Chadic]]: [[Azumeina language|Marba]], numerous minor groups
*[[Nilo-Saharan]]: 
** [[Maban people|Maban (Ouaddai)]]
** [[Saharan languages|Saharan]]: [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Tebu languages|Toubou]]
**[[Eastern Sudanic]]: [[Daju people|Daju]]
**[[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]]: [[Bagirmi language|Baguirmi]], [[Sinyar people|Sinyar]]
*[[Niger-Congo]]: 
**[[Bua languages|Bua]]
**[[Atlantic–Congo languages|Atlantic-Congo]]: [[Fula people]].

The '''Mfantsefo''' or '''Fante''' ("Fanti" is an older spelling) are an [[Akan people]]. The Fante subgroup is mainly gathered in the central coastal region of [[Ghana]], with some also in [[Ivory Coast]]. Originally, "Fante" referred to tiny states within a {{convert|50|mi|adj=on}} radius of [[Mankessim]]. The states that made up the Fante were Kurantsi, Abura,&lt;ref name="Incorporated2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Facts On File, Incorporated|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&amp;pg=PR4|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2676-0|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyan, Ekumfi, Nkusukum, Ajumako and Gomoa.

The main Fante city is [[Cape Coast]], [[Central Region (Ghana)|Central region]], and Mankessim is the traditional headquarters. The Fante people are one of the Akan group, along with the "Asantefo" or [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]]s, the [[Akuapem]], the [[Akyem]], the [[Baoule]], [[Nzema people|Nzema]], and others. Despite the rapid growth of the [[Ashanti Empire]] in historic times, the Fante have always retained their state to this day. Currently, they number about 3.5 million, the third largest grouping of Akan peoples. Inheritance and succession to public office among the Fante are traditionally determined by [[matrilineal]] descent, as is common among Akan peoples.

When the Portuguese arrived in the 15th century, the Fante prevented them from venturing inland and leased properties for Portuguese trading missions. But when the Portuguese objected to Fante rules and regulations, the Fante expelled them. Thereafter the Dutch arrived, followed by the British. The Fante served as middlemen in the commerce between the interior and British and Dutch traders on the coast.

In the early 18th century, the [[Fante Confederacy]] was formed, with the aim of establishing themselves as a nation to be taken seriously by their European counterparts. So in 1844 a bond was written between the Fante, on behalf of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], and the British, allowing the Gold Coast to gain independence without war one hundred years later. Several [[Ashanti-Fante War|Ashanti-Fante wars]] followed. On one occasion, the Fante were aided by the British, who, however, destroyed the strong Fante confederation established between 1868 and 1872, believing it a threat to their hegemony on the coast.

The Fante have produced numerous illustrious and prominent people, notable among whom are [[Kofi Annan]] (former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]]), [[Jacob Wilson Sey]] (first indigenous multimillionaire on the Gold Coast), British journalist and writer [[Ekow Eshun]], [[Ottobah Cugoano]] (abolitionist and natural rights philosopher), [[Sam Jonah]] (ex-CEO of [[AngloGold Ashanti]]), [[John Atta Mills]] (Ghana's late former president), and a number of the advocates of independence, not only in Ghana but also in the West African sub-region, such as [[John Mensah Sarbah]], [[James Kwegyir Aggrey]] and [[J. E. Casely Hayford]].

== Family names ==

One of the social contexts of names among the Akan, including the Fante, is that they are used as social tags to indicate personal and group identity. This is so with family names derived from the [[patrilineal]] clans of the fathers that are given to children. Each of the 12 patrilineal clans has its peculiar family names. It is thus possible to use one’s name to trace his/her patrilineal clan. Children who trace their [[genealogy]] to one patrilineal father may therefore share similar family names.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol15num2/agyekum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Typical family names include Yankah, Osam, Aidoo, etc. There have also been innovations as a result of westernisation, education and foreign religion.  Multiple names have also developed out of this phenomenon. Also, some Fante names are translated literally into English and such anglicised names have come to stay as family names. One can argue that the Fantes living on the coast were the first to be in contact with the Europeans. It is therefore possible that the trend is a western influence. Examples of such anglicised transformational name are:

*''Dua'' (lit tree/board) – Wood 
*''Kuntu'' (blanket ) – son of Kuntu Blankson 
*''Kumi ba'' (child of Kumi) – Kumson or Koomson
*''Kwei ba'' (child of Kwei) – Quayson, Quayeson, Kweison or Kwaeson
*''Akorɔma'' (hawk) – Hawkson 
*''Nyameba'' – Godson
*''ɛbo'' (stone) – Rockson 
Accordingly, some family names can also be identified by the suffix, for example:
*-son as in Yawson
*-ful, as in Arkorful, 
*-ney, as in Biney.
Otherwise, Fante (Akan) typological family names indicate various contexts. They may be circumstantial, manner of birth, theophorous, weird names, insinuating and proverbial names, gang  and nicknames, status, occupational, professional, religious, matrimonial, and western names.  There can be a combination of two or more of these typological names.

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

'''Feminist views on pornography''' range from condemnation of all of it as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of [[feminist pornography|some forms as a medium of feminist expression]]. This debate reflects larger concerns surrounding [[feminist views on sexuality]], and is closely related to [[feminist views on prostitution|those on prostitution]], [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], and other issues. [[Pornography]] has been one of the most divisive issues in [[feminism]], particularly in anglophone countries. This deep division was exemplified in the [[feminist sex wars]] of the 1980s, which pitted [[anti-pornography]] activists against [[sex-positive]] ones.

==Anti-pornography feminism==
{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:Gail Dines.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YpHNImNsx8  Growing Up in a Pornified Culture], [[Gail Dines]], [[TED (conference)|TEDx]] | accessdate =May 11, 2015}}
Feminist opponents of pornography—such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Diana E. H. Russell|Diana Russell]], [[Alice Schwarzer]], [[Gail Dines]], and [[Robert W. Jensen|Robert Jensen]]—argue that pornography is harmful to women, and constitutes strong causality or facilitation of violence against women.

Catharine McKinnon and Andrea Dworkin had separately staked out a position that pornography was inherently exploitative toward women, and they called for a [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] to make pornographers accountable for harms that could be shown to result from the use, production, and circulation of their publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dworkin|MacKinnon|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dworkin testified before the [[Meese Commission]] in 1986, she said that 65 to 75 percent of women in prostitution and hard-core pornography had been victims of incest or child sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989|loc=ch. [http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIVF2.html Pornography is a civil rights issue] pp.278, 300–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Dworkin's activism against pornography during the 1980s brought her to national attention.&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;{{harvnb|Rapp2009|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm to women during production===
Anti-pornography feminists, notably Catharine MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves.&lt;ref name=stanford-shrage&gt;[[Laurie Shrage|Shrage, Laurie]] (Fall 2015), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por Feminist perspectives on sex markets: pornography]", {{cite book | editor-last = Zalta | editor-first = Edward N. | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta | title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  | ref =  | title-link = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKinnon|1983|loc=pp. 321–345 "Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catharine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate = 2009-09-01| year = 1995| url = https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. [[Gail Dines]] holds that pornography, exemplified by [[Point of view pornography|gonzo pornography]], is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Gail Dines]] | date= 24 March 2007 | title= Pornography &amp; Pop Culture: Putting the Text in Context | medium= Video | publisher= [[Wheelock College]], Boston | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120207143019/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5003155114018800220 | archive-date = 7 February 2012 | url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5003155114018800220# }} Presentation at: ''Pornography &amp; Pop Culture - Rethinking Theory, Reframing Activism''.

Anti-pornography feminists point to the testimony of well known participants in pornography, such as [[Traci Lords]] and [[Linda Boreman]], and argue that most female performers are coerced into pornography, either by somebody else, or by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The feminist anti-pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of ''[[Ordeal (autobiography)|Ordeal]]'', in which Linda Boreman (who under the name of "Linda Lovelace" had starred in ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') stated that she had been beaten, raped, and [[pimp]]ed by her husband [[Chuck Traynor]], and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in ''Deep Throat'', as well as forcing her, by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence, to make other pornographic films. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman, and worked with her in public appearances and speeches.

===Social harm from exposure to pornography===

====Women reduced to sex objects====
On-face ejaculation and anal sex are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn.&lt;ref name="GailDines-JulieBindel-PornIndustry" /&gt; MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as "the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words".&lt;ref name=mackinnon-fu&gt;{{harvnb|MacKinnon|1987|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rxE8FQzjpYMC&amp;pg=PA176 p. 176]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects produced by those who view pornography are mixed and still widely debated. Generally, research has been focused around the effects of voluntary viewing of pornography. There have also been studies analyzing the inadvertent exposure to explicit sexual content, including: viewing naked photographs of people, people engaging in sexual acts, accidental web searches, or opening online links to pornographic material. It has been found that most exposure to pornography online is unsolicited and by accident. 42% of those who view online pornography are ages ranging between 10 and 17; 66% have experienced inadvertent exposure.&lt;ref name=Shim&gt;{{harvnb|Shim|Paul|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jae Woong Shim of Sookmyung Women's University along with Bryant M. Paul of Indiana University published a controlled study looking at such inadvertent exposure to pornography in regards to the feeling of anonymity titled "The Role of Anonymity in the Effects of Inadvertent Exposure to Online Pornography Among Young Adult Males." The study consisted of 84 male students, ages 18 and older, volunteering from a large American university in the Midwest. After completing an arbitrary survey, they were shown a 10-second pop-up clip consisting either of sexual or nonsexual content. Half of the subjects exposed to either clip believed they were viewing the content nonanonymously. The other half believed they were anonymous, and they were not being monitored. They were then asked if they would rather view hardcore pornography, softcore pornography, or nonsexual material. The hardcore pornography depicted women as sexual objects, and male-superiority. The softcore pornography was less graphic. The nonsexual material was a video of a professor's lecture unrelated to sexual content.&lt;ref name=Shim/&gt;

After being exposed to the inadvertent pop-up clip, researchers noted which of the three above content choices the subjects selected. Researchers then measured the participants’ sexist attitudes towards women using a questionnaire asking the agreeability of statements to women gaining more control over men. The higher the score, the higher the subjects are thought to hold sexist views. Those who believed they were anonymous were less likely to be conscious of their monitoring compared to the nonanonymous group. It turns out, those who were exposed to sexual content and believed they were anonymous, were the most likely to choose the hardcore pornography that depicts the most objectification of women. The next highest choice for the hardcore pornography was the group exposed to nonsexual material, yet believed to be anonymous. These two groups were the most likely to hold hostile sexist attitudes towards women after the 10 second inadvertent exposure to sexual content compared to before the study.&lt;ref name=Shim/&gt;

This indicates negative opinions towards women. It is concluded that being exposed to sexual content, even when it is unwanted, leads men to develop harsher sexist attitudes towards women. The greater intrigue for men to view hardcore and unusual pornography was greater when they believed to be doing so anonymously. This is most likely tied to the theory of deindividuation. The theory states that a person detaches his or her self from personal responsibility and awareness as an individual, and is more likely to act differently than when their behaviors are socially attached to his or her character. "When individuals perceive that no one knows what they are viewing, they are likely to experience reduced self-awareness, which, in turn, leads to being less considerate toward others".&lt;ref name=Shim/&gt; This implies that these men would be less likely to view the pornography which harshly objectifies women if they know others would be aware if they do so, due to the perceived social consequences.

Since the feeling of anonymity disregard social norms, there is a higher chance of pursuing more extreme stimuli. This study does not prove that the men willing to watch the hardcore pornography and hold more sexist views are more likely to act out these desires and beliefs toward women. Valerie Webber in her article "Shades of Gay: Performance of Girl-on-Girl Pornography and mobile authenticities" differentiates the sex depicted in porn and personal, private sexual encounters. At first, she argues that performing sex produces normative ideas about what makes sex authentic. These normative beliefs then transfer into personal experiences where people feel an obligation to perform sex as they have viewed it in pornography.&lt;ref name=Webber&gt;{{harvnb|Webber|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webber discovered that there is no true authenticity surrounding sex. Sex through the lens of pornography is still legitimate, yet most performers exaggerate the act to make it more rousing and intimate to the audience. She explains that "performance…does not preclude authenticity. Performance is the means by which ‘authenticity’ is established as a category".&lt;ref name=Webber/&gt; Yet the women interviewed had wide beliefs about what made sex authentic, most of which included a sense of intimacy. One interviewee pointed out that pornography is stigmatized for not being genuine, which is not true for all performers. Some are completely satisfied with the sex performed for porn, while others report low satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Webber/&gt; Those who perform in pornography have different intentions for doing so, much like any other job. Some performers do it because they like pleasing their audience, some do it for personal pleasure, and some feel they are creating something of artistic value. As Webber puts it, "if fake equals ‘bad’, then good must equal ‘real’. The motives can be ‘pure’, but what those motives are can differ dramatically".&lt;ref name=Webber/&gt; Performers are usually aware of what their audience expects from them and what viewers enjoy. Webber could theorize that women use this knowledge and personal intentions to produce pornography in which men anonymously consume, which then authenticates the normality of such depictions of sex as being appropriate and desirable.

====Enticement to sexual violence against females====
Anti-pornography feminists say that consumption of pornography is a cause of [[rape]] and other forms of [[violence against women]]. Robin Morgan summarizes this idea with her often-quoted statement, "Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1978|pp=163–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-pornography feminists charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]]. MacKinnon argued that pornography leads to an increase in sexual violence against women through fostering [[rape myth]]s. Such rape myths include the belief that women really want to be raped and that they mean yes when they say no. Additionally, according to MacKinnon, pornography desensitizes viewers to violence against women, and this leads to a progressive need to see more violence in order to become sexually aroused, an effect she claims is well documented.&lt;ref name=mackinnon-guardian&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffries|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rape of children=====
[[Child sexual abuse|Rape of a prepubescent child]] followed "habitual" consumption of [[child porn]] "within six months" although the men were previously "horrified at the idea", according to Gail Dines, that interviewed men in prison.&lt;ref name="GailDines-JulieBindel-PornIndustry"&gt;{{harvnb|Bindel|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Distorted view of the human body and sexuality====
[[Germany|German]] [[radical feminist]] [[Alice Schwarzer]] is one proponent of this point of view, in particular in the feminist magazine ''Emma''. Many opponents of pornography believe that pornography gives a distorted view of men and women's bodies, as well as the actual sexual act, often showing the performers with synthetic implants or exaggerated expressions of pleasure, as well as fetishes that are not the norm, such as [[urophilia|watersports]], being presented as popular and normal.

[[Harry Brod]] offered a [[Marxist feminist]] view, "I [Brod] would argue that sex seems overrated [to men] because men look to sex for fulfillment of nonsexual emotional needs, a quest doomed to failure. Part of the reason for this failure is the priority of quantity over quality of sex which comes with sexuality's commodification."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brod|1996|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7h_YL8_Etk4C&amp;pg=PT242 p. 242]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hatred of women====
Gail Dines said, "'[p]ornography is the perfect propaganda piece for patriarchy. In nothing else is their hatred of us quite as clear.'"&lt;ref name="GailDines-JulieBindel-PornIndustry" /&gt;

===Anti-pornography feminist organizations and campaigns===
From the mid 1970s into the early 1980s, public rallies and marches protesting pornography and prostitution drew widespread support among women and men from across the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ-2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Chenier|2004|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 1970s, anti-pornography [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] formed organizations such as [[Women Against Pornography]], [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]], [[Women Against Violence Against Women]], [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]], and like groups that provided educational events, including slide-shows, speeches, guided tours of the sex shops in areas like New York's [[Times Square]] and San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin District]], petitioning, and publishing newsletters, in order to raise awareness of the content of pornography and the sexual subculture in pornography shops and live sex shows.&lt;ref name="InOurTime-p360"&gt;{{harvnb|Brownmiller|2000|loc=p. 360 This citation may be limited to Women Against Pornography and Feminists Fighting Pornography; slide shows, speeches, and tours; and their work being sited in New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar groups also emerged in the United Kingdom, including legislatively focused groups such as [[Campaign Against Pornography]] and [[Campaign Against Pornography and Censorship]], as well as groups associated with [[radical feminism]] such as Women Against Violence Against Women and its [[direct action]] offshoot [[Angry Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Angry Wimmin| series = Lefties|network= [[BBC Four]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110121002704/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/lefties2.shtml | archive-date = 21 January 2011 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/lefties2.shtml| accessdate = 2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative and judicial efforts===

====Anti-pornography Civil Rights Ordinance====
Many anti-pornography feminists—Dworkin and MacKinnon in particular—advocated laws which defined pornography as a [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] harm and allowed women to sue pornographers in [[civil law (common law)|civil court]]. The [[Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance]] that they drafted was passed twice by the [[Minneapolis]] city council in 1983, but vetoed by Mayor Donald Fraser, on the grounds that the city could not afford the litigation over the law's [[constitutionality]].

The ordinance was successfully passed in 1984 by the [[Indianapolis]] city council and signed by Mayor [[William Hudnut]], and passed by a [[ballot initiative]] in [[Bellingham, Washington]] in 1988, but struck down both times as unconstitutional by the state and federal courts. In 1986, the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] affirmed the lower courts' rulings in the [[Indianapolis]] case without comment.

Many anti-pornography feminists supported the legislative efforts, but others objected that legislative campaigns would be rendered ineffectual by the courts, would violate principles of [[free speech]], or would harm the anti-pornography movement by taking organizing energy away from education and [[direct action]] and entangling it in political squabbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brownmiller|2000|pp=318–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dworkin and MacKinnon responded to the alleged violation of free speech principles by pointing out that the Ordinance was designed with an explicit goal of preventing its misinterpretation and abuse for the purpose of censorship or discrimination against sexual minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dworkin|MacKinnon|1988|loc=ch. [http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/other/ordinance/newday/T2c.htm The ordinance: definition] pp. 36–41 "The definition is closed, concrete, and descriptive, not open-ended, conceptual, or moral. It takes the risk that all damaging materials might not be covered in order to try to avoid misuse of the law as much as possible."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their publication ''[[Pornography and Civil Rights]]'' serves as a manifesto backing the law, providing an extensive self-analysis and explanation of its intended meaning, and declaring the exact circumstances under which the law would apply.

====Pornography Victims' Compensation Act====
Another feminist approach was designed to permit survivors of crime when the crime was the result of pornographic influence to sue the pornographers. The [[Pornography Victims Compensation Act|Pornography Victims' Compensation Act]] of 1991 (previously known as the Pornography Victims Protection Act) was supported by groups including [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]]. [[Catharine MacKinnon]] declined to support the legislation, though aspects of it were based on her legal approach to pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = MacKinnon | first = Catharine | author-link = Catharine MacKinnon | title = The rise of a feminist censor, 1983-1993 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091208023843/http://www.mediacoalition.org/reports/mackinnon_report.htm | archive-date = 8 December 2009 | url = http://www.mediacoalition.org/reports/mackinnon_report.htm | website = mediacoalition.org | publisher = Media Coalition }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced in Congress, thus, had it passed, it would have applied nationwide.

====''R. v. Butler''====
The [[Supreme Court of Canada]]'s 1992 ruling in ''[[R. v. Butler]]'' (the Butler decision) fueled further controversy, when the court decided to incorporate some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian [[obscenity]] law. In ''Butler'' the Court held that [[Canadian obscenity law]] violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law ''could'' be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality.

The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the [[Women's Legal Education and Action Fund]] (LEAF), with MacKinnon's support and participation. Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, arguing that feminists should not support or attempt to reform criminal obscenity law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mason-Grant|2004|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards''====
''Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards'' was a sexual harassment Federal district court case. It recognized as law that pornography could illegally contribute to sexual harassment through a workplace environment hostile to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc., 760 F.

:Short summary by counsel in case, Legal Momentum.&lt;/ref&gt; The court's order included a ban on "displaying pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, promotional materials, reading materials, or other materials that are sexually suggestive, sexually demeaning, or pornographic, or bringing into the JSI [the employer's] work environment or possessing any such material to read, display or view at work." "A picture will be presumed to be sexually suggestive if it depicts a person of either sex who is not fully clothed or in clothes that are not suited to or ordinarily accepted for the accomplishment of routine work in and around the shipyard and who is posed for the obvious purpose of displaying or drawing attention to private portions of his or her body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women and the law | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227055315/http://www.iso.gmu.edu/~weitzman/robinson.htm | archive-date = 27 February 2012 | url = http://www.iso.gmu.edu/~weitzman/robinson.htm | publisher = [[George Mason University]] | access-date = January 29, 2010 }}
:Details of decision including defendant's Statement of Prohibited Conduct, section C1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the decision was directly attributable to the anti-pornography feminist analysis, if the influence was indirect, or if the outcome was coincidental, but counsel [[Legal Momentum]] was historically associated with the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), a leading feminist organization, suggesting that counsel was likely to have had knowledge of the feminist theory.

==Sex-positive and anti-censorship feminist views==

===Sex-positive feminism===
[[File:Ellen willis.png|thumb|[[Ellen Willis]]]]
{{Main|Sex-positive feminism}}
In this view, pornography is seen as being a medium for women's sexual expression. Sex-positive feminists view many [[radical feminist]] views on sexuality, including views on pornography, as being equally oppressive as those of [[patriarchal]] religions and ideologies, and argue that anti-pornography feminist discourse ignores and trivializes women's sexual agency. [[Ellen Willis]] (who coined the term "pro-sex feminism") states "As we saw it, the claim that 'pornography is violence against women' was code for the neo-Victorian idea that men want sex and women endure it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| edition = 50th Anniversary special| last = Willis| first = Ellen.| title = Lust horizons: the 'voice' and the women's movement| work = [[Village Voice]]| accessdate = 2 September 2009 | date = 18 October 2005 | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-10-18/specials/lust-horizons/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-positive feminists take a variety of views towards existing pornography. Many of these feminists see pornography as subverting many traditional ideas about women that they oppose, such as ideas that women do not like sex generally, only enjoy sex in a relational context, or that women only enjoy [[vanilla sex]]. They also argue that pornography sometimes shows women in sexually dominant roles and presents women with a greater variety of body types than are typical of mainstream entertainment and fashion, and that women's participation in these roles allows for a fulfillment of their sexual identity and free expression.

===Feminist critique of censorship===
Many feminists regardless of their views on pornography are opposed on principle to censorship. Even the feminists who see pornography as a sexist institution, also see censorship (including MacKinnon's civil law approach) as an evil. In its mission statement, [[Feminists for Free Expression]] argues that censorship has never reduced violence, but historically been used to silence women and stifle efforts for social change. They point to the birth control literature of [[Margaret Sanger]], the feminist plays of [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]], and works like ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' and ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' as examples of feminist sexual speech which has been the target of censorship. FFE further argues that the attempt to fix social problems through censorship, "divert[s] attention from the substantive causes of social ills and offer a cosmetic, dangerous 'quick fix.'" They argue that instead a free and vigorous [[marketplace of ideas]] is the best assurance for achieving feminist goals in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = FFE: Mission | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026144507/http://www.ffeusa.org/html/mission/index.php | archive-date = 26 October 2013 | url = http://www.ffeusa.org/html/mission/index.php | website = ffeusa.org | publisher = Feminists for Free Expression (FFE) | accessdate = 2 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of anti-pornography feminism accuse their counterparts of selective handling of social scientific evidence. Anti-pornography feminists are also critiqued as intolerant of sexual difference and is characterized as often indiscriminately supporting state [[censorship]] policy and are accused of complicity with [[conservative]] sexual politics and [[Christian Right]] groups.

Several feminist anti-censorship groups have actively opposed anti-pornography legislation and other forms of censorship. These groups have included the [[Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce]] (FACT) and [[Feminists for Free Expression]] in the US and [[Feminists Against Censorship]] in the UK.

Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon responded with a statement claiming that the idea that these raids reflected the application of pre-''Butler'' standards and that it was actually illegal under ''Butler'' to selectively target LGBT materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = MacKinnon| first1 = Catharine A.| last2 = Dworkin | first2 = Andrea | author-link1 = Catharine MacKinnon | author-link2 = Andrea Dworkin | title = Statement by Catharine A.

Anti-censorship feminists{{Who|date=September 2015}} question why only some forms of sexist communication (namely sexually arousing/explicit ones) should be banned, while not advocating bans against equally misogynist public discourse. [[Susie Bright]] notes, "It's a far different criticism to note that porn is sexist.  So are all commercial media.  That's like tasting several glasses of salt water and insisting only one of them is salty.  The difference with porn is that it is people fucking, and we live in a world that cannot tolerate that image in public."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bright|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist pornography===
{{main|Feminist pornography}}
Pornography produced by and with feminist women is a small, but growing segment of the porn industry.

According to [[Tristan Taormino]], "Feminist porn both responds to dominant images with alternative ones and creates its own iconography."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Vogels | first = Josey | title = Female-friendly porn | url = http://metronews.ca/news/159072/female-friendly-porn | work = Metro | publisher = Free Daily News Group Inc. | location = Toronto, Canada | accessdate = 14 July 2012 | date = 21 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pornographic actresses such as [[Nina Hartley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartley|1998|pp=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovidie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ovidie|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madison Young]], and [[Sasha Grey]] are also self-described sex-positive feminists, and state that they do not see themselves as victims of sexism. They defend their decision to perform in pornography as freely chosen, and argue that much of what they do on camera is an expression of their sexuality. It has also been pointed out that in pornography, women generally earn more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faludi|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist porn directors include [[Candida Royalle]], [[Tristan Taormino]], [[Madison Young]], [[Shine Louise Houston]], and [[Erika Lust]]. Some of these directors make pornography specifically for a female or [[genderqueer]] audience, while others try for a broad appeal across genders and sexual orientations.

==Specific issues==

===Pornography ''vs.'' erotica===
Some anti-pornography feminists, such as [[Gloria Steinem]] and [[Feminists Fighting Pornography|Page Mellish]], distinguish between "pornography" and "[[erotica]]", as different classes of sexual media, the former emphasizing [[dominance hierarchy|dominance]] and the latter emphasizing [[Golden Rule|mutuality]]. Steinem holds that, "These two sorts of images are as different as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain." Feminists who subscribe to this view hold that [[Women's erotica|erotica]] promotes positive and pro-woman sexual values and does not carry the harmful effects of pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinem|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anti-pornography feminists are more skeptical about this distinction, holding that all sexual materials produced in a [[patriarchal system]] are expressions of male dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LeMoncheck|1997|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Dworkin]] wrote, "erotica is simply high-class pornography: better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dworkin|1981|loc=Preface p. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some feminists tend not to make a distinction between pornography and erotica, and those who have addressed the distinction made by Steinem and others find it problematic. [[Ellen Willis]] holds that the term 'erotica' is needlessly vague and euphemistic, and appeals to an idealized version of what kind of sex people should want rather than what arouses the sexual feelings people actually have. She also emphasizes the subjectivity of the distinction, stating, "In practice, attempts to sort out good erotica from bad porn inevitably comes down to 'What turns me on is erotica; what turns you on is pornographic.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminists{{Who|date=September 2015}} make an analogous distinction between mainstream pornography and feminist pornography, viewing mainstream pornography as problematic or even wholly misogynistic, while praising feminist pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McIntosh|1996|pp=333–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Valenti|2009|pp=81–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex workers===
{{Main|Feminist views on prostitution}}
The work of feminist pornography includes studying women, children and men in the industry. Some feminists{{Who|date=September 2015}} argue against pornography because it can be viewed as demeaning and degrading to women and men. Some{{Who|date=September 2015}} argue that pornography is used by men as a guide to hate, abuse, and control women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|Adams|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist pornographers==
In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Candida Royalle]], and [[Nina Hartley]] were some of the first feminist-identified performers in the porn industry.&lt;ref name=Vasquez2012&gt;{{harvnb|Vasquez|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Becky Goldberg produced the documentary "Hot and Bothered: Feminist Pornography," a look at women who direct, produce, and sell feminist porn. Feminist pornography is whenever the women is in control of the sexual situation, she is in control of what is being done to her and she enjoys it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg's views on feminism and pornography is, "if you don't like what you see make your own".

Courtney Trouble is a feminist performer and producer of queer porn. Her films feature "sexual and gender minorities." Trouble began in the business when she decided she did not see enough diversity in the business, and wanted to make a positive change.&lt;ref name=Vasquez2012/&gt;

Shine Louise Houston, owner of [[Pink and White Productions]], produces porn that features reflect different types of sexuality, different genders, and queer people of color.&lt;ref name=Vasquez2012/&gt;

Lorraine Hewitt is the creative director of the [[Feminist Porn Awards]] based in Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref name=Vasquez2012/&gt;

[[Tristan Taormino]] is both a sex educator and feminist pornographer who has helped produce films, written books, owns her own website and has published many articles on topics related to sexuality, gender and articles on sex positive relationships. Taormino views porn as a positive part of life.

'''''Friend Request''''' (released overseas as '''''Unfriend''''') is a 2016 English-language German [[supernatural]]-[[psychological horror]] film.

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=February 2018}} &lt;!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--&gt; 
Laura ([[Alycia Debnam-Carey]]) is one of the most popular students at her college and enjoys an active social life with many friends and family members. She is active on [[Social networking|social networks]] and has over 800 friends on [[Facebook]]. She lives with three friends, Olivia ([[Brit Morgan]]), Isabelle (Brooke Markham) and Gustavo ([[Sean Marquette]]). She is also close friends with Kobe ([[Connor Paolo]]) and is dating Tyler ([[William Moseley (actor)|William Moseley]]).

Laura receives a friend request from a student at her campus, Marina Mills. Seeing her talents in animation, she accepts the request and begins a friendship with the lonely girl. However she soon notices that Marina's Facebook profile is plastered in bizarre and disturbing images and her obsessive behavior begins to make Laura feel uncomfortable. When Laura shares pictures of herself at her birthday dinner – to which Marina was not invited – Marina publicly and angrily confronts her at her college campus. During the quarrel, Laura accidentally pushes Marina and her hood falls off, revealing her bald spot, a result of [[trichotillomania|hair pulling disorder]], causing Marina to run away. Laura notices Marina's several comments, who tries to apologize to her, Laura eventually unfriends Marina on Facebook. Seeing her number of friends once again down to zero, a heartbroken Marina angrily closes her laptop. That night, Laura notices a black mirror, which shows a forest where a dark figure is seen walking. As Laura is staring at it, a terrifying demonic face appears behind her, but quickly disappears when Olivia turns on the light. In the next morning, teacher reveals that Marina has committed suicide, much to Laura's astonishment.

Another night, Marina uploads a video, showing she burns the drawing of Laura and commits suicide by hanging herself, terrifying Laura.

The next morning, Laura receives a message from Marina containing the video of her suicide. Later on, it is posted to her Facebook page. Laura is unable to remove the video, and her friend count drops. Left with no choice, she tries to delete her account, but an unknown error occurs. Realizing that she is being stalked, Laura goes to Kobe's apartment for help. When Kobe and Laura investigate Marina's Facebook page, they realize that the source code where it has been written is not the normal code.

That night, Marina adds Gustavo as a friend and posts a distorted picture of his face. The lights suddenly cut off, he is then terrorized by a spirit, while seeing things that were posted on Marina's page. Gustavo rushes into the elevator for safety, only to be attacked by a swarm of wasps; as the elevator doors opens, he is seen smashing his face against the elevator walls by an unseen force, and is discovered by Isabelle, who was sent to a hospital and begins to blame Laura for Gustavo's death.

The recorded video of the elevator attack is posted on Laura's Facebook page. Her friends subsequently turn against her by posting angry and disgusted comments, effectively making her an outcast. Laura attempts to text her friends that she didn't, but to her confusion, the texts suddenly changes to "u will know what it feels to be lonely :)". Laura goes to the orphanage where she meets the woman, who reveals that Marina's real last name is Nedifar; Marina was ruthlessly bullied and tormented by some boys when she was seven-years old. However, they were murdered by an unknown assailant. Meanwhile, Kobe is looking for the [[scrying|black mirror]] on a website. He learns that they were used by witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-friend-request-review-20170921-story.html|title=Social media-themed horror film 'Friend Request' makes for dumb midnight movie fun|last=Walsh|first=Katie|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|language=English|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly, several faces of Marina appear on the monitors as the lights begin flickering, but everything quickly reverts when the custodian arrives.

A devastated Isabelle is going through pictures on her phone, she begins hallucinating and notices the burnt body of a woman and rushes to get help but finds that nobody is there. Horrified after seeing the two men with their mutilated faces coming toward her, she rushes into the bathroom and locks herself. To make matters worse, she finds the body of herself before being killed by Marina. Laura goes with Detective Cameron and his officer to watch the recorded footage of Isabelle which showed that the hospital staff were there revealing that she was hallucinating and slits her own throat out of madness, controlled by Marina. The footage was later posted on Laura's Facebook page. Tyler, Kobe and Olivia are unable to delete the videos, unfriend Laura or deactivate their account as unknown errors keep occurring, Laura's Facebook friend count continues to drop, while Tyler is looking for the address of Marina's home. Olivia turns off her phone, alongside laptop and moved out, fearing that she would share the same fate as Gustavo and Isabelle before bids farewell to Laura. Later, Laura notices the picture of Olivia from Marina's page, the picture slowly melts, implying that she is next. Laura and Tyler rushes in to save her, but Olivia is already attacked by Marina with wasps, hurled out of her window and hospitalized in stable condition. When Tyler and Detective Cameron are talking, Marina possesses Olivia through the heart monitor and lunges at Detective Cameron's officer, taking the gun from him. Instead of shooting the officer, she shoots herself in the head, killing Olivia.

Meanwhile, Laura hunts down the place where Marina committed suicide in order to destroy the black mirror that turned Marina into an [[unclean spirit|evil spirit]], she and Kobe go to Marina's house which was burnt down and attempt to look for her. While there, Kobe sees an ethereal entity come out of the basement and approaches him, but disappears when Laura bumps into him. Laura tells him that Marina is not there, but he suggests that they look in the basement.

Marina is not found in the basement, but while searching, Kobe is separated from Laura, who finds him staring into a black mirror. When she turns him around and asks what's wrong, he apologizes to Laura and says that she can't be lonely if she died. Kobe suddenly stabs her in the stomach, hoping to kill her in order to save himself and Tyler. Laura hits him with her flashlight and escapes from the basement as Kobe gives the chase but loses her. Laura then realizes through one of Marina's posts that Marina committed suicide in one of the nearby factories.

Meanwhile, Tyler finds a deranged Kobe looking for Laura. After getting a call, Tyler and Kobe head to the factories as well, but he tells Kobe to stay in the car while he tried to find Laura. Once getting to the factories, a wounded Laura starts looking for Marina's body, she receives a video call from her mother, Caroline, who informs that she's been seeing Marina too. Laura's video call begins to glitch out as her mother begins to act strangely, a sign that she may be attacked by Marina. Caroline takes a knife from the table and goes to the other room, presumably killing herself as the connection times out. Devastated by her mother's presumed death, Laura begins to cry after seeing everyone she's loved being taken away. Tyler soon finds her, only their reunion is cut short when Kobe appears and stabs Tyler in the throat, killing him. Laura attempts to escape Kobe once again but reaches a dead end. However, before he can kill Laura, Kobe is violently attacked and killed by the swarm of wasps.

Laura, feeling dazed, sees an apparition of two men (presumably the boys that bullied Marina in the orphanage). Laura yells at Marina, asking what she wants from her, the spirit of younger Marina appears and says that she wanted to be best friends with her as she leads Laura to Marina's rotten corpse and her laptop which transports Laura into one of Marina's earlier posts. Laura is then lunged at by a demonic Marina.
 
Some time has passed and there are fresh batch of students. Laura is seen looking at some girls in the same way that Marina looked at Laura and her friends in the beginning. Laura then faces her laptop (which actually is Marina's laptop) and is shown to have zero friends, just like Marina before she met Laura. Then her new account {{spaced ndash}}which shares the same dark, grotesque images and renamed as Lau Ra{{spaced ndash}} is revealed. The camera shows Laura's eyes are green and blue, implying that Marina has [[demonic possession|possessed]] Laura.

==Production==
Originally titled ''Unknown Error'', the film was later renamed to ''Friend Request'' internationally, to avoid confusion with the 2014 film ''[[Unfriended]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Becher|first1=Björn|title="Unfriend" – Deutscher Social-Media-Horrorfilm kommt 2016 in die Kinos|url=http://www.filmstarts.de/nachrichten/18494504.html|accessdate=4 December 2015|language=de|date=8 July 2015|work=Filmstarts|publisher=Webedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the film is titled ''Unfriend'', since ''Unfriended'' was released as ''Unknown User'' in Germany.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Filming===
The film was shot in [[Cape Town]] at the University of Cape Town, [[South Africa]].

The website's critical consensus reads, "''Friend Request''{{'}}s attempts to update old-school teen horror for the digital age do not, sadly, include memorable characters, fresh scares, or novel storytelling twists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friend_request/ |title=Friend Request (2017) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/friend-request|title=Friend Request Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the film for being "visually stylish and imaginative" but criticized it for becoming less interesting as the film went on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/friend-request-1041851|title='Friend Request': Film Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=22 September 2017|access-date=24 September 2017|first=Frank|last=Scheck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Kiang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was impressed by the practical effects, but criticized the way the film had little to do with the "technology that it ostensibly exists to critique".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/friend-request-review-unfriend-1202564734/|title=Film Review: ‘Friend Request’|last=Kiang|first=Jessica|date=21 September 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|access-date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ally Wybrew of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising Debnam-Carey, who "[stood] out [amongst] otherwise mediocre performances" in contrast to the poorly written character of Marina. Wybrew went on to criticize the clunky lines, overenthusiastic score, and the protracted final act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/friend-request/review/|title=Friend Request Review|last=Wybrew|first=Ally|website=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=24 September 2017 |date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Girl Germs''''' was a [[zine]] created by [[University of Oregon]] students [[Allison Wolfe]] and [[Molly Neuman]], both members of the band [[Bratmobile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia A.|title=Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-33908-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;ots=653Jnob1OP&amp;dq=%22girl%20germs%22&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminism]] was influential in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the early nineties:  ''Girl Germs'' identified feminist role models in its early issues and was one of the few [[Riot grrrl]] zines created by young white women to feature African American rappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearney|first=Mary Celeste|title=Girls Make Media|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-97278-9|pages=175, 179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOlz0HaIOqcC&amp;lpg=PA334&amp;ots=u2PWg5jmKw&amp;dq=%22girl%20germs%22&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q=%22girl%20germs%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of ''Girl Germs'' was completed by December 1990. While home in Washington, D.C. on winter break, Neuman made several hundred copies of the zine at the Capitol Hill offices of Arizona Representative [[Mo Udall]], who she had worked for during high school.&lt;ref name="Marcus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Sara|title=Girls to the Front|year=2010|publisher=Harper|isbn=978-0-06-180636-0|pages=59–60|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors to ''Girl Germs'' included Kathleen Hanna; [[Jean Smith]] of [[Mecca Normal]]; [[Sue P. Fox]]; [[Kaia Wilson]]; the editors of ''Double Bill'', [[G.B. Jones]], [[Jena von Brücker]], [[Caroline Azar]], Johnny Noxzema and Rex; [[Jen Smith]]; and [[Erin Smith]] of [[Bratmobile]]. Groups interviewed by ''Girl Germs'' editors include Calamity Jane, [[Unrest]], [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Jawbox]] and [[Fastbacks]].

''Girl Germs'' also documents the coming together of Bratmobile, during this time.  Allison would go on to play with [[Cold Cold Hearts]], [[Partyline]], and [[Hawnay Troof]] and Molly played with [[The Frumpies]] and [[The PeeChees]].

Archives that have copies of ''Girl Germs'' include the [[GLBT Historical Society]] in [[San Francisco, California]], the [[Independent Publishing Resource Center]] in [[Portland, Oregon]],  [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Sarah Dyer Zine Collection|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/sarahdyercollection/|publisher=David M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5957">'''  Imdad Hussain Chandio''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|   ﺍﻣﺪﺍﺩ  چانڈیو }}}}) Son of  Late Raees Juryal Khan Chandio is a [[politician]] and agriculturist from [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]].  Imdad Hussain Chandio popularly known as Imdad Khan Chandio is the leader of Cholyani-[[Chandio]]  tribe in Sindh. He has been a prominent leader of PML-N and held a diverse range of political and non-political appointments. In the year 1999, he was appointed as the Finance Minister of Sindh province; prior to that he was the Director of TVO (Trust for Voluntary Organisations), member Bait ul Maal-Pakistan; Chairman Khidmat Committee Larkana Division; Board member of Agriculture University Tando Jam and was the President of PML-N Sindh from 2001-2004 during the Musharraf era when the entire PML-N leadership was forced to be in exile; he led the party with utmost courage and resolve. Currently, he is the central Vice-President of [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]].

==Early life==
Imdad Hussain Chandio was born in the village of Shamo Khan Chandio District Larkana, Sindh     Pakistan.
He completed his primary education from Taluka Warah and then went to pursue his secondary education from Taluka Mehar from where he passed with flying colours. He was an avid reader from his childhood and used to read literary books, poetry, novels, autobiographies and was especially attracted towards the subject of history.  However, due to early death of his father he was not able to pursue his education further and was compelled by the circumstances to go back to his hometown and lead his tribe along with taking care of his agricultural lands, fish farms and other businesses. Nevertheless, his devotion for academics and books made him read rich literature ranging from socialism to economics; this led him to become a polite, humble and upright man. He never compromised on principles and is regarded as one of the most upright politicians in Larkana.

== Political activism==
His passion for books made him become discontent with the feudal mindset and prevailing wadera culture at that time. Hence, he joined Tehrik e Istiqlaal as a young leader and was appointed as member of Central working committee. He followed the footsteps of his father by revolting against the local feudals who used to suppress and exploit the masses. He went against the local feudals and protested against the dictatorial regime of Zia ul Haq; therefore, he embarked on a courageous journey to purge his area from feudals and as well as continued his struggle to revive democracy in Pakistan during the dictatorial regime of Zia ul Haq when he led the like minded people in protests. During the course of which it was discovered that he had dynamic oratory and was a passionate speaker. He was a leading member in the movement to restore democracy (MRD). For which, he was imprisoned in jail for one year without being given any right of trial. Unflinched by his resolve to restore democracy, all the cases against him were dismissed and he was freed following which he became a prominent local political leader in Larkana. His passion to serve people made him contest for the election of chairman baldia warah where he got elected unopposed. He served the people with utmost devotion and was called upon by the chief of PML-N, Mian Nawaz Sharif to join his party. Following which he formally joined the PML-N and was made the divisional president of Larkana and member central working committee of PML- N. From then onwards, there was no going back and Imdad Hussain Chandio emerged as one of the most prominent politicians of Sindh.

==Contribution==
Imdad Hussain Chandio is regarded as one of the most respected and humble politicians of Sindh. It is because of his crystal clear past record and good reputation among the locals and politicians that he is said to earn nothing but respect. He is humble yet vociferous which could be judged by the fact that he stood like a might oak tree during the times of turmoil in the Musharraf era when every effort was made to lure him to join the PML-Q, but he refused categorically. His unwavering stance to stand by his parent political party (PML-N) strengthened democratic culture and showed the young party workers the way to pursue one's political commitments and ideology even in the face of grave threats and hardships. His speeches in various conferences, seminars, public rallies, demonstrations and television talk shows elicit that he is an epitome of a true leader who stands by his principles. He continues to stand by the democratic values of statesmanship, humbleness and uprightness. Mr. Imdad Hussain Chandio is considered to be persevering, steadfast and patient as he is considered as a pillar of MPL-N in Sindh, despite all the hardships he has faced in his political life be they: political cases, financial problems caused by the opposition, or tribal entanglements caused by a few notorious people.

His main contribution is to unite a very large number of Sindhi workers under the banner of his party and making PML(N) a popular mass party is Sindh.He is also called as Chief of Cholyani tribe. He also contributed a lot to resolve the tribal feuds among different tribes, and set the tradition of taking delegations to rival groups to convince and encourage them to resolve their bloody feuds through traditional dispute resolution mechanisms through the involvement of notables.Such community based dispute resolution is one of the main alternate to rival groups in the absence of rule of law and very corrupt judiciary and administration.

The '''Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal''' is awarded every two years by the US [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] "for important contributions to the medical sciences." It was first awarded in 1952 and involves a prize of $25,000 plus $50,000 for research.&lt;ref name= "NASonline medal"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/kovalenko-medal.html |title= Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Prize|publisher= National Academy of Sciences| website= nasonline.org |accessdate= 24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kovalenko Fund was donated by Michael S. Kovalenko in 1949 to the National Academy of Sciences in memory of his wife, Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko.

==Etymology==
The term ''kuruba'', meaning ''shepherd'', is derived from ''kuri'', meaning ''sheep''.&lt;ref name="RCDhere_Vitthal"/&gt;

==History==
The Kurubas are said to have been connected to the [[Yadu]] or [[Yadava]] lineage mentioned in [[Purana]]s. Traditional sources claim that the Kurubas founded the [[Sangama Dynasty|Sangama dynasty]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].&lt;ref name="The YadavasGod"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jUeeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243 |title=Rise of a Folk God: Vitthal of Pandharpur,  South Asia Research |publisher=Oxford University Press, |first=Ramchandra Chintaman |last=Dhere |authorlink=Ramchandra Chintaman Dhere |others=Feldhaus, Anne (trans.) |year=2011 |page=243 |isbn=978-0-19977-764-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ramchandra Chintaman Dhere]], a scholar of the religious traditions of Maharashtra, {{quote|The history of South India shows clearly that all the southern royal dynasties who arose from pastoralist, cowherd groups gained Kshatriya status by claiming to be Moon lineage Kshatriya, by taking Yadu as their ancestor and by continually keeping alive their pride in being "Yadava". Many dynasties in South India from the Pallavas to Yadurayas were originally members of pastoralist, cowherd groups and belonged to Kuruba lineages.&lt;ref name="The YadavasGod"/&gt;}}

Laki is presently spoken in the areas south of [[Hamadan]] and including the towns of [[Nahavand]], [[Tuyserkan]], [[kuhdasht]], [[Nurabad, Lorestan|Nursbad]], [[Ilam Province|Ilam]], [[Lowshan|Gilan]], and [[Pahla]] (Pehle), as well as the countryside in the districts of [[Bayranshahr|Horru]], [[Selasele]], [[Silakhur]], and the northern [[Aleshtar]] in western Iran. It is also spoken in [[Kermanshah]] province including [[Harsin]], [[Bisotun]], [[Sahneh]], [[Zangane Tribe]] as well as the city of [[Kermanshah]]. 

The syntax and vocabulary of Laki have been profoundly altered by [[Lurish|Lurish language]], a Southwest Iranic language. The basic grammar and verb systems of Laki are, like other Northwestern Iranian languages, especially the [[Zaza–Gorani languages|Zaza–Gorani]] languages, clearly Northwest Iranian. This relationship is further affirmed by remnants in Laki of the Kurdish grammatical hallmark, the ergative construction. Despite this, Shahsavari based on his linguistics and semantics characteristics concluded that [[Laki]] is obviously different from Kurdish.&lt;ref&gt;Shahsavari, Faramarz, Source: Iran and the Caucasus, Volume 14, Number 1, 2010 , pp. 79-82(4)[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/ic/2010/00000014/00000001/art00007]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin James McSorley''' (born May 18, 1963) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey|hockey]] player, who played in the [[National Hockey League]] from 1983 until 2000. A versatile player, he was able to play both the forward and defense positions.

A former [[head coach]] of the Springfield Falcons of the [[American Hockey League]] (2002–04), aside from his hockey career, McSorley has  worked as an actor, appearing in several film and television roles. McSorley was a valued teammate of [[Wayne Gretzky]] during their years playing together for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] and [[Los Angeles Kings]], where he served as an [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]]. In [[1999–2000 NHL season|2000]], his on-ice assault of [[Donald Brashear]] with his stick, in which Brashear suffered a severe concussion, led to McSorley's suspension and eventual retirement from the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and hockey career===
McSorley was born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], but grew up near [[Cayuga, Ontario|Cayuga, Haldimand County, Ontario]]. He made his NHL debut in October 1983 with the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], but rose to fame after a trade in September 1985 brought him to the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. His arrival and physical presence soon made Edmonton's incumbent enforcer [[Dave Semenko]] expendable, and McSorley inherited the title of "[[Wayne Gretzky]]'s bodyguard".&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"/&gt;

This title would follow him to Los Angeles in 1988, when both he and Gretzky, along with [[Mike Krushelnyski]], were obtained by the [[Los Angeles Kings|Kings]]. With the Kings, McSorley's bruising style made him a fan favorite; but he strove to improve his game beyond being primarily known as an enforcer, earning great respect around the league for his hard work ethic, his fine team play, and his articulate intelligence off the ice.&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakingslegends.blogspot.com/2008/06/marty-mcsorley.html|first=Joe|last=Pelletier|title=Los Angeles Kings legends: Marty McSorley|work=Greatest Hockey Legends.Com|date=5 June 2011|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992–93 NHL regular season, McSorley led all defensemen in shorthanded goals with three.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1993_skaters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kings reached the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Montreal Canadiens]], but in Game 2 with the Kings up 2–1, McSorley was caught with an illegal stick, contributing to the Canadiens game-tying goal. Montreal ending up winning that game in overtime and ultimately took the series in five games. McSorley otherwise had ten points in the playoffs, and was the only King to score during the final game. Some suggested that he was the second most dominant King after Gretzky in the playoffs.&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"/&gt;

McSorley remained with the Kings until an August 1993 trade sent him to [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Pittsburgh]] in exchange for offensive forward [[Shawn McEachern]]; however, his stay in Pittsburgh would be brief (only 47 games). The Kings re-acquired him on February 16, 1994.&lt;ref name=melrose&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/blogpost.htm?id=14845|title=O'Reilly situation is nothing new|author=Barry Melrose|publisher=nhl.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back with the Kings, he assisted on Gretzky's goal which broke [[Gordie Howe]]'s all-time goal-scoring record. On March 14, 1996, McSorley left the Kings' organization for good, traded to the [[New York Rangers]] as part of a multi-player deal.

After completing the [[1995-96 NHL season|1995–96 season]] with the Rangers, McSorley returned to the West Coast after being acquired by the [[San Jose Sharks]] in August 1996. He spent two injury-plagued seasons with the Sharks before returning to Edmonton as a free agent in October 1998. Confined to a part-time role in his second stint in Edmonton, he left after one season and signed with the [[Boston Bruins]] in December 1999.  As a Bruin, his NHL career would come to a sudden and infamous end in a game against the [[Vancouver Canucks]] on February 21, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/19/sports/hockey-mcsorley-s-stormy-career-makes-track-change-in-springfield.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault conviction====
In a game between the Bruins and the [[Vancouver Canucks|Canucks]] in [[Vancouver]] on February 21, 2000, McSorley swung his stick and hit [[Donald Brashear]] in the head with 4.6 seconds left in the game. Brashear fell backwards and hit his head hard on the ice, losing consciousness and suffering a Grade III [[concussion]]. McSorley was charged with assault and suspended by the NHL for the remainder of the 1999–2000 season (including the playoffs) missing 23 games. On October 6, 2000, Judge William Kitchen of the [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]] found him guilty of [[aggravated assault|assault with a weapon]] for his attack on Brashear. He was sentenced to 18 months probation. The trial was the first for an on-ice attack by an NHL player since [[Dino Ciccarelli]]'s 1988 trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100318&amp;page=1#.T81P58WuXh5|title=NHL Player Found Guilty of Assault|work=ESPN Sports |publisher=ABCNews.com|date=6 October 2000|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his assault conviction, his NHL suspension was extended to one full year through February 21, 2001.&lt;ref name='ABCNews-Nov-7-2000'&gt;{{cite news|title=McSorley Suspended From NHL Until Feb.|date=2000-11-07|work=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100192&amp;page=1#.T81KPMWuXh4|accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   McSorley would never play in another NHL game.

====United Kingdom====
During his suspension, he attempted to continue playing hockey in the United Kingdom with the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]], where his elder brother Chris was coaching, but this move was blocked by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], in deference to the NHL suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/01/23/soice24.xml|title=Ice Hockey: McSorley foiled by ban|publisher=Telegraph|first=Paul|last=Newman|date=January 23, 2001|accessdate=February 23, 2015|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar intention to play in Germany for the [[Munich Barons]] also failed, but he then played for the [[Grand Rapids Griffins]] in their final [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|IHL]] season, dressing for 14 games.

In the autumn of 2001, following the completion of his suspension, McSorley again looked towards the other side of the Atlantic. He considered purchasing the then struggling [[Cardiff Devils]] team with his brother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1644089.stm|title=Hardman McSorley dices with Devils|publisher=BBC News|date=8 November 2001|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to pursue a new player-coach role and to develop interest in the sport in the UK.

McSorley appeared as a guest player for both [[Great Britain national ice hockey team|Great Britain]] and the Cardiff Devils during a series of games in November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/1640600.stm|title=Ice fans snap up tickets|publisher=BBC News|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the business deal failed to materialise.

===Coaching career===
McSorley coached the [[American Hockey League]] team the [[Springfield Falcons]] between 2002 and 2004.

===Film and TV career===
From 1995 to 1997, McSorley also appeared in four movies in small roles: ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' (1995), ''[[Forget Paris]]'' (1995), ''[[Con Air]]'' (1997) and ''[[Do Me A Favor (film)|Do Me A Favor]]'' (1997).

During the [[2005–06 NHL season]], McSorley worked for [[Fox Sports West]] in [[Los Angeles]], providing in-studio analysis of games involving the [[Los Angeles Kings]] or the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]. He provided color commentary for the [[San Jose Sharks]] games on FSN Bay Area during [[2006–07 NHL season]]. McSorley's time in that role ended mysteriously midway through the Sharks playoff series with Detroit, when the Sharks announced McSorley would not return for a Game 3 broadcast for personal reasons. No further explanation was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-213441.html|title=Popular Sharks TV analyst is back|work=San Jose Mercury News|first=David|last=Pollak|date=Aug 2, 2007|publisher=BARF-Bay Area Riders Forum-Community-Kitchen Sink blog|accessdate=2012-06-04}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in one episode of [[Urban Hellraisers (CSI Episode)|''CSI: Miami'']] in 2005 as rink manager Andrew Greven. On July 30, 2007, McSorley guest starred on [[ABC Family]]'s [[Greek (TV series)|''Greek'']] as himself playing a hockey goaltender. In February 2008, McSorley was featured as one of the pros on ''[[Pros vs Joes]]'' on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]].

Canadian singer-songwriter [[Kathleen Edwards]] referred to McSorley in her song "[[Asking for Flowers|I Make the Dough, You Get the Glory]]", with the lyric, "You're the [[Wayne Gretzky|Great One]], I'm Marty McSorley..., I make the dough, but you get the glory." McSorley appears in the song's [[music video]].&lt;ref name="nhl_ke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottawa singer Kathleen Edwards teams up with former NHL-ers for new video|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/ottawa-singer-kathleen-edwards-teams-up-with-former-nhl-ers-for-new-video/c-378371|website=NHL.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McSorley is currently a TV analyst for [[Sportsnet]] and occasionally ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''. He is a regular at [[Staples Center]] during Kings hockey games.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/kings/story/2012-05-27/marty-mcsorley-illegal-stick-curse/55238940/1 McSorley profile], usatoday30.usatoday.com; accessed February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
McSorley currently resides in [[Hermosa Beach, CA|Hermosa Beach]], [[California]]. He married beach volleyball player [[Leanne Schuster]] in August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvbinfo.com/player.asp?ID=1195 |title=Leanne Schuster: Career |work=Beach Volleyball Database |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223190455/http://www.bvbinfo.com/player.asp?ID=1195 |archivedate=February 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;

[[Image:RJ106016.jpg|thumb|[[Roberto Jefferson]] was the [[whistleblower]] of the corruption scheme.]]
The '''Mensalão scandal''' ({{lang-pt|'''Escândalo do Mensalão'''}}, {{IPA-pt|isˈkɐ̃dɐlu du mẽsɐˈlɐ̃w̃|IPA}}) was a vote-buying scandal that threatened to bring down the government of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=BBC |title=Q&amp;A: Brazil's 'big monthly' corruption trial |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19081519}} 21 November 2012. Retrieved on 10 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mensalão'' is a [[neologism]], a variant of the word for "big monthly payment" (''salário mensal'' or ''mensalidade'').

The scandal broke on June 6, 2005 when Brazilian deputy [[Roberto Jefferson]] told the [[Folha de S.Paulo]] newspaper that the ruling [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) had paid a number of deputies 30,000 [[Brazilian real|reais]] (around US$12,000 at the time) a month to vote for legislation favored by the ruling party. The funds allegedly came from state-owned companies' advertising budgets, funneled through an advertising agency owned by [[Marcos Valério]]. The investigation has since uncovered members of the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]], [[Democrats (Brazil)|DEM]], [[Brazilian Democratic Movement|Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] and seven other political parties also involved. Many key advisers to Lula resigned, and several deputies were faced with the choice of resignation or expulsion from congress, though the president himself went on to be [[Brazilian general election, 2006|re-elected in 2006]], and in [[Brazilian presidential election, 2010|2010]] Brazil elected his [[Chief of Staff of Brazil|chief of staff]], [[Dilma Rousseff]], as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/11/economist-explains-14|title=What is Brazil's "mensalão"?: A votes-for-cash scandal that touched some of the country's most senior politicians - and sent some of them to prison| author=&lt;!-- given as "H.J." --&gt; |publisher=The Economist|date=November 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=The Economist Explains|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of PT's leadership was affected in some way, with many resigning or failing to win re-election. Brazil's economy was widely perceived as not having been substantially impacted by the scandal.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

[[Roberto Jefferson]], who initially sparked the scandal, was expelled from the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] on September 14, 2005 for ethical violations determined by the Congressional Council of Ethics. Despite continued additional resignations, in October the scandal died down somewhat as Brazil held a contentious referendum on a banning gun sales, an initiative soundly rejected by voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/79366e3a-4298-11da-94c2-00000e2511c8.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4e6CaOmAg|title=Brazil's gun ban referendum misses its target|author=Jonathan Wheatley|date=October 22, 2005|accessdate=April 12, 2017|language=en|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4969877|title=Brazil Holds Contentious Vote on Gun Control Law|publisher=National Public Radio|author=Julie McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Image:José Dirceu.jpg|thumb|[[José Dirceu]] was the [[Chief of Staff of Brazil]] when the scandal broke. He was dropped after Jefferson described Dirceu as the ringleader of a plot to hand out illegal monthly payments to congressmen.]]
On September 18, 2004 Brazilian weekly magazine ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' printed a cover story entitled "Scandal: PT's buyout of PTB". The article described an alliance between the Workers Party (PT) and the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB). According to ''Veja'', PT promised to pay R$150,000 to each PTB deputy if they would support the executive branch {{when|date=July 2017}}. Allegedly because these promises were not kept, a storm of corruption allegations against PT began in May 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On September 24, 2004, the [[Rio de Janeiro]] newspaper ''[[Jornal do Brasil]]'' published an article citing ''Veja'' which also said that former Minister of Communications [[Miro Teixeira]] had revealed the monthly payments to the [[Public Prosecutor's Office (Brazil)|Ministry of Public Prosecution]].

''[[Jornal do Brasil]]'' then published another story saying that the president of the Chamber of Deputies [[João Paulo Cunha]] (PT) promised to fully investigate the claims and quoted president of the [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)]] [[Roberto Freire]] saying: "This subject has been circulating for months in Congress but nobody has the courage to approach it."

==The scandal emerges==

On May 14, 2005, ''Veja'' published a new story describing an apparent corruption scheme in the [[Correios|Brazilian Postal Service]], describing a 110-minute video recording, made with a hidden camera, that showed former Post Office Chief {{ILL|Maurício Marinho|pt}} apparently receiving a bribe from a businessman. The full bribery scheme involving government contracts was allegedly administered by Post Office administrative director Antônio Osório Batista and by Jefferson, a Post Office manager as well as a federal deputy. On the tape, Marinho receives then pockets R$3,000 (about $1,259 US) in cash. The recording was aired by the major Brazilian television stations.

Agents from the [[Brazilian Intelligence Agency]] (ABIN) investigated. As the scandal developed, it was argued{{who|date=April 2017}} that this was linked to an attempt to destroy PT's former allies without the scandal exploding upon the government. However, a major political battle began when the government tried to systematically obstruct the creation of a Parliamentary Commission of Investigation (CPI) to investigate the growing corruption scandal.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On June 3, 2005 the newspaper [[Folha de S.Paulo]] published a story saying that the government was tying funds for various projects to support for the creation of the CPI.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Because of these allegations, part of the government's base joined the opposition to support the creation of a Parliamentary Commission of Investigation. Abandoned by his allies, Jefferson began to counterattack. On June 6, ''Folha de S.Paulo'' published an interview with Jefferson claiming that [[Delúbio Soares]], treasurer of the Workers' Party, made monthly payments of R$30,000 to certain Congressional deputies, to influence them to vote with the government. Jefferson said that those who received the monthly payment called it '''mensalão''', derived from the Portuguese word for a monthly payment. "Mensalão" quickly became the adopted popular label for the scandal, now identified as the "escândalo do mensalão."

According to Jefferson, businessman [[Marcos Valério]], owner of the advertising agencies {{ILL|SMPB|pt|SMP&amp;B}} and DNA, which had large government contracts, operated the scheme. After the investigative commission was set up, the government allegedly tried to control it by installing government allies Senator [[Delcídio do Amaral]] (PT) as president of the commission and Deputy [[Osmar Serraglio]] ([[Brazilian Democratic Movement|PMDB]]) as the key ''[[rapporteur]]'', responsible for writing the final report. 

Although the investigation of the Post Office scandal was officially restricted in scope to irregularities in Post Office's administration, it began to investigate the expanding monthly payment claims because of apparent connections between the cases. An additional commission was created to investigate the broader scandal on July 20. Allies of the government occupied key posts. The president of the CPI was Senator {{ILL|Amir Lando|pt}} and the ''rapporteur'' was Deputy [[Ibrahim Abi-Ackel]]. Abi-Ackel was minister of justice in the government of [[João Baptista Figueiredo]], and was also accused of involvement in the corruption scandal.

José Dirceu, once a leftist student leader who organized against the right-wing military dictatorship after it took power in a 1964 coup, was arrested in 1968, then released at the demand of the kidnappers of the US ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rohter|first1=Larry|title=Behind Brazil's Leftist Leader, a Kindred Spirit Thrives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/16/world/behind-brazil-s-leftist-leader-a-kindred-spirit-thrives.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|publisher=NYTIMES|date=July 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was exiled to Cuba. Later, he secretly returned to Brazil, under a false identity and had plastic surgery to disguise his face. He hid in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and opened a shop. During this time, he became involved as a student union leader. He married but did not reveal his true identity even after he had a son with his wife. Only after 1979, when political amnesty was declared, did he openly return to political life, campaigning for democratic elections and the end of the dictatorship regime.

As a consequence of the ''mensalão scandal'', Dirceu resigned in 2005 as chief of staff to President Lula.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

== The scandal develops ==

[[Image:Maleta correios105387.jpeg|250px|right|thumb|The equipment used in the recording of the bribery negotiation in a [[Correios]] post office.]]
In early July 2005, an advisor to a Congressional deputy and brother of Workers’ Party President [[José Genoíno]], was stopped at an airport with $100,000 in his underwear and additional funds in his luggage. The wives and secretaries of key figures testified in the numerous and overlapping Congressional panels, including Valério's secretary, {{ILL|Fernanda Karina Somaggio|pt}}, and the ex-wife of [[Valdemar Costa Neto]], Maria Christina Mendes Caldeira, who later fled to the United States with nothing but her clothes and a support animal. She applied for [[right of asylum|asylum]] under a secret identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/01/1847917-ex-mulher-de-deputado-do-mensalao-pede-asilo-politico-nos-estados-unidos.shtml|date=January 8, 2017|accessdate=April 17, 2017|title=Ex-mulher de deputado do mensalão pede asilo político nos Estados Unidos|author=Wálter Nunes|publisher=Folha de S. Paulo|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressional hearings were often marked by fiery rhetoric and emotional outbursts, including numerous incidents of crying by witnesses and Workers' Party deputies. Although still murky and unclear, reported links between the scandal, its key figures, the murder of [[Santo André]]'s mayor [[Celso Daniel]] and various mafia and criminal figures only intensified its sensational tone and societal impact. One key event that broadened the scandal into a more general investigation of the Workers' Party history as whole was the testimony of [[Duda Mendonça]], public relations specialist and campaign manager for Lula's 2002 campaign, on August 11. He said he was paid using off-shore bank accounts and possibly illegal funds connected to Valério.

The scandal, which had at that time not yet involved Brazil's finance minister, said to be popular with the international finance community,{{cn|date=July 2017}} threatened [[Antonio Palocci]]'s standing after lawyer and former advisor {{ILL|Rogério Tadeu Buratti|pt}} testified that Palocci was involved in corrupt activities while he was mayor of [[Ribeirão Preto]] in the mid-90's.

Lula's popularity waxed and waned, but no definite proof emerged that he orchestrated or had knowledge of the payments.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/11/economist-explains-14|title=What is Brazil's "mensalão"?: A votes-for-cash scandal that touched some of the country's most senior politicians - and sent some of them to prison| author=&lt;!-- given as "H.J." --&gt; |publisher=The Economist|date=November 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=The Economist Explains|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of PT's leadership was affected in some way, with many resigning or failing to win re-election. Brazil's economy was widely perceived as not having been substantially impacted by the scandal.

Roberto Jefferson, who initially sparked the scandal, was expelled from the Chamber of Deputies on September 14, 2005 after the Congressional Council of Ethics determined that he had committed ethical violations. Despite continued resignations of those implicated, in October the scandal died down somewhat and Brazil had a referendum on gun sales that resulted in a loss for the government's position. At the end of October, ''Veja'' published a new story claiming that the Workers' Party had received illegal campaign funds from Cuba—threatening to re-intensify the scandal once again, though that was not ultimately the case.{{what|date=July 2017}}

==First joint preliminary CPI report==
[[Image:José Genoino.jpg|thumb|[[José Genoino]] was found guilty of bribery by the [[Supreme Federal Court]] for his involvement in the Mensalão scandal.]]
The investigations into Post Office corruption and vote-buying unanimously approved their first joint preliminary report on September 1, 2005.

The report accused 18 Brazilian deputies of involvement in the corruption scandal:
* {{ILL|Carlos Rodrigues (bishop)|lt=Carlos Rodrigues|pt|Carlos Rodrigues}} ([[Liberal Party (Brazil)|Liberal Party]] (PL)-[[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]])
* [[José Janene]] ([[Progressive Party (Brazil)|Progressive Party]] (PP)-[[Paraná (state)|Paraná]])
* {{ILL|Pedro Corrêa (Brazilian politician)|lt=Pedro Corrêa|pt|Pedro Corrêa}} (PP-[[Pernambuco]])
* {{ILL|Pedro Henry|pt}} (PP-[[Mato Grosso do Sul]])
* {{ILL|Sandro Mabel|pt}} (PL-[[Goiás]])
* {{ILL|João Magno|pt}} (PT-[[Minas Gerais]])
* [[João Paulo Cunha]] (PT-[[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]])
* {{ILL|José Borba|pt}} ([[Brazilian Democratic Movement|PMDB]]-Paraná)
* {{ILL|Josias Gomes|pt}} (PT-[[Bahia]])
* [[Paulo Rocha (politician)|Paulo Rocha]] (PT-Bahia)
* {{ILL|Professor Luizinho|pt}} (PT-São Paulo) - later acquitted and sufficiently angry about the accusation to take his underwear off in front of a group of reporters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/03/1746724-citado-no-mensalao-ex-deputado-professor-luizinho-reaparece-e-defende-pt-no-aeroporto.shtml|publisher=Folha de S. Paulo|date=May 3, 2016|accessdate=April 12, 2017|title=Citado no mensalão, ex-deputado Professor Luizinho reaparece e defende PT no aeroporto|author=Bruno Fávero}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{ILL|Vadão Gomes|pt}} (PP-São Paulo)
* Vanderval Santos (PL-São Paulo)
* {{ILL|José Mentor|pt}} (PT-São Paulo)
* {{ILL|Roberto Brant|pt}} ([[Democrats (Brazil)|Liberal Front Party]] (PFL)-Minas Gerais)
* [[José Dirceu]] (PT-São Paulo)
* [[Roberto Jefferson]] (PTB-Rio de Janeiro)

The report accused them of misdeeds ranging from illegal campaign finance activity, placing cronies in strategic positions in government-owned businesses in return for [[kickbacks]], to taking cash payments for voting with the government in the Brazilian Congress.

The report states that as to the charges initially made by deputy Roberto Jefferson (PTB):
* Everything he said that could be verified appeared to be valid, including his own confessions.
* Everything he said, when compared to other testimony, showed a great degree of validity.

The report added that several documents had been identified and validated which proved that large sums of money were withdrawn from agencies of the Rural Bank in [[Brasilia]] and [[Belo Horizonte]], as well as from the bank accounts of the enterprises {{ILL|SMPB|pt}} and DNA. According to the documents, the beneficiaries were federal deputies who received funds in person or through relatives, advisers, or individuals chosen by [[Marcos Valério]]. Some payments were made monthly, and others either more or less frequently. 
The report called the defense made by some parliamentarians that the funds were used to settle debts from electoral campaigns a "lame excuse".

==Congressional Committees of Investigation (CPIs)==

The following CPIs were involved in investigating issues related to the cash-for-votes scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/crisenogoverno/interna/0,,OI648487-EI5297,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Post Office CPI: Created June 9, 2005 to investigate alleged irregularities and corruption in the Brazilian Post Office following allegations made by Deputy Roberto Jefferson, this CPI focused on alleged payments made to Brazilian deputies by the ruling party. The scheduled end of the investigation was February 21, 2006.
* {{ILL|Bingo CPI|pt|Escândalo dos bingos}}: Created on June 19, 2005 to investigate [[money laundering]] through bingo parlours, and the relationship between bingo and organized crime. The CPI was proposed after a tape revealed that {{ILL|Waldomiro Diniz|pt}} (an advisor to José Dirceu) apparently extorted the gambling mafia of Rio de Janeiro to obtain funds for Workers' Party political campaigns. The end of this work was scheduled for October 26, 2005.
* Vote-buying CPI: Created July 20, 2005 to investigate alleged monthly payments to deputies. The Workers' Party requested a parallel investigation of the electoral reform that allowed a second term for ex-President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (PSDB). The end of this committee's work was scheduled for November 16, 2005.

Members of the opposition also wanted a fourth CPI to investigate off-book accounts held by all parties in during the most recent elections. Due to serial allegations of this kind of operation in many campaigns in 2002, including President Lula's, many believed this CPI could result in a legal and concrete reason to start his impeachment process. However this process was aborted.

==Ethics' Council==
The Council of Ethics and Parliamentary Decorum of the House is responsible for processing and disciplining members for behavior not in concordance with parliamentary decorum.

To expel a deputy, 257 votes out of 513 are needed. Expelled deputies lose their seats and also their parliamentary privileges and immunity. Members can also be barred from holding public office for eight years. Jefferson for example cannot run for office again until 2015.[http://www.radiobras.gov.br/materia_i_2004.php?materia=238245&amp;editoria=][https://web.archive.org/web/20051201154936/http://www2.camara.gov.br/conheca/eticaedecoro/index.html]

==Supreme Court indictment==

On August 24, 2007, the [[Supreme Federal Court]], responsible for criminal proceedings against parliamentarians due to [[parliamentary immunity]], accepted the indictments of 40 individuals related to the Mensalão scandal, most of them former or current federal deputies, and all of whom were or are allies of former Brazilian president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4676435.stm Q&amp;A: Brazil corruption scandal]. BBC News. September 4, 2007. Retrieved on October 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court trial==
The trial began in August 2012.

In the first 23 sessions{{what|date=July 2017}} of the trial the Supreme Court found that misuse of public money and bank loans did occur. Ten of the 37 defendants received sentences, including Marcos Valério, a ringleader. Three were acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brazilportal.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/stf-launches-core-policy-of-the-mensalao-trial/|title=STF launches ‘core policy’ of the mensalão trial|publisher=Brazil Institute|date=17 September 2012|access-date=20 March 2016}}. Brazil Portal. September 17, 2012. Retrieved on September 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|reason=Are these figures still correct?|date=March 2016}}

On 15 September 2012 ''Veja'' published a new story alleging that Valério had told friends that former president Lula masterminded the corruption scheme. José Dirceu's allies called this a lie and said Valério was out of his head and desperate, a convict facing prison.&lt;ref name=ojulgamento&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2012/ojulgamentodomensalao|title=O julgamento do mensalão|language=Portuguese|publisher=Folha de São Paulo|date=15 September 2012|access-date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17 the court began to examine the primary accusation, which included allegations that Dirceu led of the vote-buying scheme which laundered and then disbursed millions in public and private money to secure votes in Congress from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/08/201281510245048115.html|title=Brazil's 'trial of the century'|publisher=Aljazeera|date=17 September 2012|access-date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''rapporteur'' found clear evidence that such activities occurred, saying "there is no doubt that this scheme existed."&lt;ref name=ojulgamento/&gt;

On 9 October 2012, the court found Dirceu, [[José Genoino]] and Delúbio Soares guilty of bribery (''Corrupção Ativa''). On 15 November 2013 the STF president ordered them imprisoned. This coincided with the anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic so there was much debate about Barbosa's{{who|date=July 2017}} reasons for waiting until then. Some days later Genoino was transferred to house arrest out of concerns about his health.

==Timing of key withdrawals and votes==
Documents from the [[Council for Financial Activities Control|Conselho de Controle de Atividades Financeiras]] (COAF) indicate that between July and May 2003, withdrawals of 27 million reais were made from the accounts of businessman [[Marcos Valério]].

According to deputy [[Roberto Jefferson]], the money for the mensalão came from [[Banco Rural]] and the [[Banco do Brasil]]. Documents from COAF validate the withdrawals from Banco Rural; the withdrawals from the Banco do Brasil have not yet been traced.

The table below shows a side-by-side description of some of the withdrawals and allegedly connected votes in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.

The '''Museum of Tolerance''' ('''MOT'''), a [[multimedia]] [[museum]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]], is designed to examine [[racism]] and [[prejudice]] around the world with a strong focus on the history of [[the Holocaust]]. Established in 1993, as the educational arm of human rights organization, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoftolerance.com/site/c.tmL6KfNVLtH/b.4866005/k.C7BD/About_Us.htm About us]&lt;/ref&gt; MOT also deals with atrocities in [[Cambodia]] and [[Latin America]],&lt;ref name=nyt93&gt;{{cite news |title=Los Angeles Journal; Near Riots' Ashes, a Museum Based on Tolerance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/10/us/los-angeles-journal-near-riots-ashes-a-museum-based-on-tolerance.html |publisher=New York Times |date= February 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with issues like [[bullying]] and [[hate crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen court program tackles bullying, hate crimes |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/22/local/la-me-teencourt-20120723 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MOT has an associated museum and professional development multi-media training facility in [[New York City]].

==Los Angeles==
The original museum in [[Los Angeles, California]] opened in 1993, built at a cost of  $50 million by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], named after [[Simon Wiesenthal]],  Holocaust survivor.&lt;ref name=nyt93&gt;{{cite news |title=Los Angeles Journal; Near Riots' Ashes, a Museum Based on Tolerance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/10/us/los-angeles-journal-near-riots-ashes-a-museum-based-on-tolerance.html |publisher=New York Times |date= February 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum receives 350,000 visitors annually, about a third of which are school-age children. The museum's most talked-about exhibit is "The Holocaust Section", where visitors are divided into groups to take their own place in some of the events of [[World War II]]. These experiences are then discussed afterwards. The museum also features testimonies of Holocaust survivors, often from live volunteers who tell their stories and answer questions. People also get cards with pictures of Jewish children on them and at the end of the museum trip, it is revealed whether the child on the card survived or died in the Holocaust.

[[Image:Protest Signs over Museum of Tolerance Expansion.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Protesting L.A. museum expansion]]

In addition, the museum features a "Tolerancenter" that discusses issues of prejudice in everyday life, a Multimedia Learning Center, Finding Our Families – Finding Ourselves, a collection of archives and documents, various temporary exhibits such as Los Angeles visual artist Bill Cormalis Jr's "A" Game In The B Leagues," which documents through paintings, the Civil Rights movement during the segregation of colored people in [[Major League Baseball]], and an Arts and Lectures Program.

A classroom visit to the museum is featured in the 2007 movie ''[[Freedom Writers]]'', based on the real-life story of high school teacher [[Erin Gruwell]] and her students. The museum was parodied in an episode of ''[[South Park]]'' called "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]".

== History ==
The birth of the museum was related to the leadership of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights organization named in honor of famed Nazi hunter, the late Simon Wiesenthal. With the impetus to promote tolerance and understanding among today's world and to educate more young people, the Simon Wiesenthal Center made a decision to create a museum. In February 1993, the Museum of Tolerance opened to the public, which carries the mission to not only remind us of the past, but remind us to act. It soon received both national and international acclaims, and became a “must-see” attraction in Southern California. Today over 250,000 people visit the MOT annually, including 130,000 students.

== Exhibits ==
'''The Holocaust'''

A seventy minute dramatic presentation that takes visitors back to the period between 1920s and 1945 in Nazi-dominated Europe. Each visitor receives a photo passport card with the story of a child living during the Holocaust. As visitors explore different areas, such as a recreation of a Berlin Outdoor Café and a specially designed Hall of Testimony, the passport cards keep updating with the drastic changes in the children's lives. At the end of the tour, the ultimate fate of the child is revealed. Some artifacts of Auschwitz are displayed.

'''Tolerancenter'''

Visitors focus on the major issues of intolerance in daily life through seven exhibits: the Point of View Diner, the Millennium Machine, "Ain't You Gotta Right?", In Our Time, GlobalHate.com, We the People, Making Your Mark. These exhibits feature some recreations of historical places, films, visual walls, writing forums.

'''Anne'''

Exhibit of Anne Frank's life and legacies through rare artifacts, unique documents, and photographs presented with multi-media technology. Visitors can experience the 260-degree filmic dramatization of Anne’s room in the Secret Annex. In the Interactive Action Lab visitors can reflect on what they have learned, relate the historical issues back to today's world, and write a pledge to share on social media through multi-touch tables. A reproduction of Anne's original diary and facsimile of handwritten loose leaf sheets are displayed.

'''Finding Our Families, Finding Ourselves'''

The exhibit showcases several noted Americans with diverse personal histories. Their journeys examine those family members that inspired them, and encourages visitors to seek out their own histories, mentors and heroes.

'''Para Todos Los Niños / For All The Children'''

This exhibition shares the story of the landmark struggles of Latino families in Southern California and shows the history of segregation and discrimination in California that targeted all non-White citizens, in housing, jobs, and schools. Visitors can learn of those, including Mendez v. Westminster, who battled segregated schools for all.

== Education ==
Many major  corporations, educators, police agencies, and professionals from throughout the region have experienced the MOT’s [http://www.museumoftolerance.com/site/c.tmL6KfNVLtH/b.4866089/k.E83B/Education.htm '''specialized programs'''].

[[File:GreekMuslimMinority1991.png|right|thumb|300px|Map of the Greek Prefectures according to the 1991 census with the minority highlighted.]]

The '''Muslim minority of Greece''' is the only explicitly recognized [[Minority group|minority]] in [[Greece]]. It numbers 97,605 (0.91% of the population) according to the 1991 census,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/musmingr.htm|title=ΜΟΥΣΟΥΛΜΑΝΙΚΗ ΜΕΙΟΝΟΤΗΤΑ ΘΡΑΚΗΣ|website=www.hri.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  unofficial estimates ranged up to 140,000 people or 1.24% of the total population, according to the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71383.htm US Department of State - Religious Freedom, Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like other parts of the southern [[Balkans]] that experienced centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule the Muslim minority of mainly [[Western Thrace]] in [[Northern Greece]] consists of several ethnic groups, some being [[Turks of Western Thrace|Turkish]] and some [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]-speaking [[Pomaks]], with smaller numbers descended from Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam and [[Muslim Roma]]s. The precise identity of these groups is in contention with Turkey insisting that most Muslims in Western Thrace are ethnically Turkish, and Greece claiming many are Pomak and others of local origin who converted to Islam and adopted the Turkish language and identity in the Ottoman period. These arguments have territorial overtones, since the self-identity of the Muslims in Western Thrace could conceivably support territorial claims to the region by Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugh Poulton, 'The Balkans: minorities and states in conflict', Minority Rights Publications, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslims of [[Western Thrace]] were exempt from the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] (when all of the 1.5 million surviving [[Greeks in Turkey|Anatolian Greeks]] or [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]] were required to leave Turkey, and the 356,000 Muslims outside of Thrace were required to leave Greece, including the Muslim Greek [[Vallahades]] of western [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]. Consequently, most of the Muslim minority in Greece resides in the [[Administrative regions of Greece|Greek region]] of [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], where they make up 28.88% of the population. Muslims form the largest group in the [[Rhodope (regional unit)|Rhodope regional unit]] (41.77%) and sizable percentages in the [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi]] (31.19%) and [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros regional unit]]s (4.65%).&lt;ref name="Gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/musmingr.htm|title=ΜΟΥΣΟΥΛΜΑΝΙΚΗ ΜΕΙΟΝΟΤΗΤΑ ΘΡΑΚΗΣ|website=www.hri.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 300 [[Turks of the Dodecanese|Turks]] remain on the island of [[Rhodes]] and 200 on the island of [[Kos]], as the islands were part of the [[Italian Dodecanese]] when the population exchange between Turkey and Greece happened (and so were not included in it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turkishimage.blogspot.com/2008/03/lecturer-of-turkish-language-in-rhodes.html|title=Lecturer of Turkish language in Rhodes breaks old stereotypes|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], 1923, Greece and [[Turkey]] conducted a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]]: all the [[Greek Orthodox]] Christians of Turkey would be resettled in Greece apart from the Greeks of [[Istanbul]] ([[Constantinople]]), [[Imbros]] (Gökçeada) and [[Tenedos]] (Bozcaada), and all Turks of Greece would be resettled in Turkey apart from the Muslims of Greek Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Convention_Concerning_the_Exchange_of_Greek_and_Turkish_Populations|title=Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations|first=the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the Government of|last=Greece|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ernst-Ravenstein-Balkans-Ethnic-Map-1880.jpg|thumb|400px|Ethnic composition of the central Balkans (including present-day Greek Thrace) in 1870.]]
The exchanged populations were not homogenous; the Christians resettled in Greece included not only Greek speakers, but also Georgian speakers, Arabic speakers and even Turkish speakers. Similarly, the Muslims resettled in Turkey included not only Turkish speakers, but also Albanian speakers, Bulgarian speakers, [[Megleno-Romanians|Vlach speakers]] and also Greek speakers like the [[Vallahades]] from western Greek Macedonia (see also [[Greek Muslims]]). This was in correspondence with the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]] system of the Ottoman Empire, where religious and national allegiance coincided, and thus Greece and Turkey were considered the parent state of each group respectively.

In 1922, the Muslim minority left in Western Thrace, in [[Northern Greece]], numbered approximately 86,000 people,&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt; and consisted of three ethnic groups: [[Turkish people|Turks]] (here usually referred to as [[Western Thrace Turks]]), [[Pomaks]] ([[Muslim Slavs]] who speak [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), and [[Muslim Roma]],  each of these groups having its own language and culture. The official Greek text of the  Treaty of Lausanne refers to "muslim minorities" in article 45&lt;ref&gt;[http://imbrosunion.com/174-2/ Treaty of  Lausanne. Part 1, Peace Treaty. Article 45:] "Τα αναγνωρισθέντα δια των διατάξεων του παρόντος Τμήματος δικαιώματα εις τας εν Τουρκία μη μουσουλμανικάς μειονότητας, αναγνωρίζονται επίσης υπό της Ελλάδος εις τας εν τω εδάφει αυτής ευρισκομένας μουσουλμανικάς μειονότητας". &lt;br /&gt;
"The rights which are recognized hereby for the non-muslim minorities living in Turkey, are also recognized by Greece for the muslim minorities on Greek territory."&lt;/ref&gt; However, unofficial texts of the Greek State refer to one Muslim minority.&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt;  According to the Greek government, Turkish speakers form approximately 50% of the minority, Pomaks 35% and Muslim Roma 15%.&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The minority enjoys full equality with the Greek majority, and prohibition against discrimination and [[freedom of religion]] are provided for in [http://www.hri.org/MFA/syntagma/artcl25.html#A5 Article 5] and [http://www.hri.org/MFA/syntagma/artcl25.html#A13 Article 13] of the [http://www.hri.org/MFA/syntagma/ Greek constitution].&lt;ref name="GHM"&gt;[http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&amp;serial=1044526702223 Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030523145306/http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&amp;serial=1044526702223 |date=2003-05-23 }}, by the Greek Helsinki Monitor, 18 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In Thrace today there are 3 [[mufti]]s, approximately 270 [[imam]]s and approximately 300 [[mosque]]s.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;[http://www.ypex.gov.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Multilateral+Diplomacy/Global+Issues/Human+Rights/MUSLIM+MINORITY+OF+THRACE.htm Μuslim Minority of Thrace] by the Greek ministry of foreign affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
The minority is always represented in the Greek parliament,&lt;ref name="MFA" /&gt; and is currently represented by [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] members [http://www.parliament.gr/synthesh/mp.asp?MPID=881 Çetin Mandacı] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20090907201204/http://www.parliament.gr/synthesh/mp.asp?MPID=909 Ahmet Hacıosman]. During the 2002 local elections, approximately 250 Muslim municipal and prefectural councillors and mayors were elected, and the Vice-Prefect of Rhodope is also a Muslim.&lt;ref name="MFA" /&gt; The main minority rights activist organization of the Turkish community within the minority is the "Turkish Minority Movement for Human and Minority Rights" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Τούρκικη Μειονοτική Κίνηση για τα Ανθρώπινα και Μειονοτικά Δικαιώματα, ''Toúrkiki Meionotikí Kínisi yia ta Anthrópina kai Meionotiká Dikaiómata'', {{lang-tr|İnsan ve Azınlık Hakları için Türk Azınlık Hareketi}}).

== Education ==
[[File:pomak-village-sokaki.jpg|thumb|right|Pomak village in [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi regional unit]].]]
In Thrace today there are 235 minority primary schools, where education is in the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages,&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt; and there are also two minority secondary schools, one in Xanthi and one in Komotini, where most of the minority is concentrated.&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt; In the remote mountainous areas of Xanthi where the Pomak element is dominant, the Greek government has set up Greek language secondary education schools in which religious studies is taught in Turkish and the Quran is taught in Arabic.&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt; The Pomak language (which is essentially considered a dialect of [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), however, is not taught at any level of the education system.&lt;ref name="GHMPomaks"&gt;[http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/pomaks.html Report on the Pomaks], by the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|Greek Helsinki Monitor]]&lt;/ref&gt; The government finances the transportation to and from the schools for students who live in remote areas, and in the academic year 1997-98, approximately 195,000 USD was spent on transportation.&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt;

There are two Islamic theological seminaries, one in [[Komotini]], and one in [[Echinos]] (a small town in Xanthi regional unit inhabited almost exclusively by Pomaks), and under Law 2621/1998, the qualification awarded by these institutions has been recognized as equal to that of the Greek Orthodox seminaries in the country.&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt;

Finally, 0.5% of places in Greek higher education institutions are reserved for members of the minority.&lt;ref name="MFA" /&gt;

All the aforementioned institutions are funded by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of State]]: [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71383.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grievances ==
The main minority grievance regards the appointment of [[mufti]]s. The Greek government started appointing muftis instead of holding elections after the death of Mufti of Komotini in 1985, although the Greek government maintained that as the practice of state-appointed muftis is widespread (including in Turkey), this practice should be adhered to in Greece, and as the muftis perform certain judicial functions in matters of family and inheritance law, the state ought to appoint them.&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] alleges that this is against Lausanne Treaty which grants the Muslim minority the right to organize and conduct religious affairs free from government interference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/greece/Greec991-06.htm#P225_36797|title=THE TURKS OF WESTERN THRACE|website=www.hrw.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although it is unclear whether issues such as inheritance law are religious matters). As such, there are two muftis for each post, one elected by the participating faithful, and one appointed by Presidential Decree. The elected Mufti of Xanthi is Mr Aga and the government recognized one is Mr Sinikoğlu; the elected Mufti of Komotini is Mr Şerif and the government recognized one is Mr Cemali. According to the Greek government, the elections by which Mr Aga and Mr Şerif were appointed were rigged and involved very little participation from the minority.&lt;ref name="Gov" /&gt; As pretension of (religious) authority is a criminal offence against the lawful muftis under the Greek Penal Code, both elected muftis were prosecuted and on conviction, both were imprisoned and fined. When, however, the case was taken to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the Greek government was found to have violated the right to religious freedom of Mr Aga and Mr Şerif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114003545/http://www.mihenk.gr/english/religiousintolerance.htm|title=...: Mihenk Dergisi :...|date=14 January 2006|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversial issue was Article 19 of the Greek Citizenship Code, which allowed the government to revoke the citizenship of non-ethnic Greeks who left the country. According to official statistics 46,638 Muslims (most of them being of Turkish origin) from Thrace and the Dodecanese islands lost their citizenships from 1955 to 1998, until the law was non-retroactively abolished in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.greekhelsinki.gr/index.php?sec=194&amp;cid=693 Press Release of Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe] and [https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/europe/greece.html HRW World Report 1999: Greece:Human Rights Developments]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final controversial issue is the use of the ethnic terms "Turk" and "Turkish" when describing the religious minority as a whole. The [[Government of Greece|Greek government]] is not referring to the Muslim minority by a specific ethnic background such as Turks, as it is a multi-ethnic minority that includes [[Pomaks]] and [[Muslim Roma|Roma Muslims]] as well. However, a number of organizations which are doing so, including the "[[Turkish Union of Xanthi]]", have been banned for using those terms in their title.&lt;ref name="GHM" /&gt; In 2008 after a decision of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled the re-legalization of the association and convicted Greece of violating the [[freedom of association]], however, the Greek authorities refused to re-legalize it.&lt;ref name="USD"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136034.htm 2009 Human Rights Report: Greece] U.S Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2011}}

An '''old boy network''', or '''society''' (also '''old boys' club'''), can refer to social and business connections among [[Alumnus|former pupils]] of male-only private schools. The term originated from much of the British elite having attended certain public schools as boys, thus former pupils are "[[old boys]]".

This can apply to the network between the graduates of a single school regardless of their gender.  It is also known as an ''old boy society'' and is similar to an [[alumni association]]. It can also mean a network of social and business connections among the alumni of various prestigious schools. In popular language, ''old boy network'' or ''old boy society'' has come to be used in reference to the preservation of social elites in general; such connections within the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|British Civil Service]] formed a primary theme in the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]'s satirical comedy series ''[[Yes Minister]]''. The phrase "It's not what you know, it's who you know" is associated with this tradition.

==Australia==
In Australia, the term "Old Boy" is used to describe a male alumnus of some prestigious state and private schools. The term "Old Girl" is similarly used for a female alumna of such schools.

==Canada==
The term is also used in Canada, where the alumni of such schools as [[St. Andrew's College (Ontario)|St. Andrew's College]], [[Trinity College School]], Crescent School, [[St. George's School (Vancouver)|St George's School]], [[Bishop's College School]], [[Hillfield Strathallan College]], [[Lower Canada College]], and [[Upper Canada College]] are known as Old Boys.  Other influential private schools with powerful alumni networks may have become co-ed, such as [[Appleby College]] or [[University of Toronto Schools]], but operate similarly in which large numbers of alumni all work for the same organization. The old boy network of [[Upper Canada College]] has been so influential in the political and business realms of Canada that it became the focus of James Fitzgerald's 1994 book ''Old Boys: The Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College'' ({{ISBN|978-1551990057}}).

==Finland==

In [[Finland]], the Finnish term '''hyvä veli -verkosto''' (literally ''dear brother network'') is used to refer to the alleged informal network of men in high places whose members use their influence to pervert or circumvent official decision-making processes to the members' mutual benefit. As such, the term is pejorative.

The term derives from the salutation "Hyvä veli!", or "Dear brother!", traditionally used to open a letter to a not quite intimate friend. The implication is that since the elites of all fields are drawn from a fairly small pool of people who are mostly more or less acquainted with each other, they can and often do manage public and private affairs amongst themselves, off the record, and outside public scrutiny as they like. As the word "brother" implies, the network is usually presumed to be consisting of males, and thus the term is also sometimes used to refer to the [[marginalization]] of women and their exclusion from high positions in both the public and private spheres. There is an equivalent term, ''hyvä sisko'' ("dear sister"), used in reference to informal networks of women in high positions.

President [[Urho Kekkonen]] was notable for directly communicating with senior officials (past his [[Finnish Council of State|cabinet]]s) by means of letters, which famously began with the salutation "Hyvä veli". These have been published in three volumes.

==India==
[[File:Doon School Old Boys' Society.jpg|thumb|200px|Logo of [[The Doon School Old Boys' Society]].]]
[[The Doon School]] maintains its own old boys' society ([http://www.dsobs.net/ The Doon School Old Boys' Society]) for social connections and fundraising on behalf of the School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doonschool.com/info/ouroldboys.htm The Doon School: Our Old Boys] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308085008/http://www.doonschool.com/info/ouroldboys.htm |date=8 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates of The Doon School are known as ''Doscos'', or simply, as Old Boys. 

Former students of the [[Welham Boys School]] refer to their society as the Welham Old Boys Society. Though the school was founded in 1937, the society was not founded until 1983. The group is intended to encourage Welham graduates to aid in the school's success through their union; they have established scholarships and [[Bursary|bursaries]] for deserving students. The Welham Old Boys Network has established definite membership criteria, as well as requiring a subscription fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welhamoldboys.com/society.asp |title=Welham Old Boys Society |publisher=Welhamoldboys.com |date= |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812060935/http://www.welhamoldboys.com/society.asp |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly the Old Boys of [[Sainik School Rewa]] in Madhya Pradesh call their Old Boys Association as "Sainwinians."

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the "old boy network" is seen as existing primarily among those educated at the fee-paying independent schools of the [[Eton Group]] and the [[Rugby Group]] (including, but not limited to, [[Harrow School]], [[Eton College]], [[Shrewsbury School]], [[Charterhouse School]], [[Westminster School]], [[Winchester College]], [[Radley College]], [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]], and [[Rugby School]], as well as at the colleges of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], although to some extent such networks exist for all institutions producing large numbers of "old boys" and girls.  The existence of "old boy" networks is often blamed for the high proportion of former pupils of high-status schools and universities in high-status positions in government, business, and other professions. For instance, between them, [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Eton College|Eton]] have 26 British [[prime ministers]] among their old boys. In practice, attendance at certain educational institutions is typical of the British "[[ruling class]]" and [[upper middle class]], and where [[nepotism]] exists it may be driven more often by personal relationships than by educational networks.

An organisation called Future First promotes the use of such networks among those educated at state schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Future First |url=http://www.futurefirst.org.uk |title=Future First |publisher=Future First |date= |accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
The term can also refer to the networks that are set up in the more elite secondary schools, such as [[Diocesan Boys' School]], [[Queen's College, Hong Kong|Queen's College]], [[Ying Wa College]], [[La Salle College]] and [[St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong|Saint Joseph's College]].

== New Zealand ==
In New Zealand, many schools maintain old boys/girls/students associations, however the term 'Old boy network' is typically used in reference to the elite public and private secondary schools such as [[Auckland Grammar School]], [[King's College, Auckland|King's College]], [[Christ's College, Christchurch|Christ's College]] and [[Scots College, Wellington|Scots College]]

==Other term==
* The expression ''old school tie'' has essentially the same meaning as the ''Old Boy network''. This expression derives from the wearing of school [[necktie|tie]]s by former pupils, to indicate that the wearer is an [[alumnus]] or [[Alumnus|alumna]] of a particular school or university. This practice is less common now than in former times.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Introduced in 1987, Payroll Giving is a simple, [[tax efficiency|tax efficient]] scheme which allows employees to give money to the UK registered charity of their choice by having a [[Tax deduction|deduction]] taken straight from their [[gross pay]].  There is no tax for the charity to claim back, as no tax was deducted.

Some companies have put in place a [[matching gift]] programme to match or part match their employee donations via Payroll Giving.

==Administration==

More than 8,500 employers in the UK currently operate the scheme, and circa 2% of UK employees participate. Participating employers deduct agreed sums of money from their employees pay before calculating tax, and forward the money to a payroll giving agency; the agency then distributes the money to registered UK charities in accordance with the employees wishes (minus an administration fee, which may vary considerably between agencies). Approximately 40% of employers cover this administration fee on behalf of their employees.

Payroll giving is operated by several agencies which do the administration and processing to link the donations to the correct charities. Employers have to choose which agency to operate with and may not pay the charities directly.

Payroll Giving is promoted within workplaces by a number of Professional Fundraising Organisations or charities

==Advantages==

===For donors===

The UK has a progressive Income Tax system with a top rate in 2015 of 45%. For higher rate tax payers this is a simpler way to donate to charity tax effectively than [[Gift Aid]], as Gift Aid assumes all donations are from Basic rate Taxpayers (20% rate).

It is nonetheless possible to achieve the same result using Gift Aid, regardless of which tax band the donor is in, because the Gift Aid scheme allows higher rate taxpayers to reclaim the difference between higher and basic rate taxes.  For example, if a donor gives £80 via Gift Aid, this is equivalent to donating £100 via Payroll Giving.  In both cases, the benefit to the charity is £100 (disregarding the Transitional Relief payable until April 2011).  The cost to a basic rate taxpayer is £80 in both cases, as the £100 paid by Payroll Giving would otherwise have been taxed at 20%.  The cost to a higher rate taxpayer is £60 for the Payroll Giving donation (£100 less 40%), and initially £80 for the Gift Aid donation, although the higher rate taxpayer can later reclaim the £20 difference through his/her tax return.

===For employers===

As part of a broader corporate [[social responsibility]] policy, Payroll Giving offers employees the opportunity to channel their support for their social concerns whilst at the same time demonstrating the company’s credentials as a socially responsible business. Employers with high participation rates can win Bronze, Silver and Gold awards from the Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engagemutual.com/MediaCentre/PressReleases/030206.asp Engage wins Gold]&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2012 the Government is also introducing a Plantinum Quality Mark Award.

===For charities===
Charities benefit from their donations being tax free, and in some cases matched by employers.

&lt;!--

Please do not list individual payroll giving agencies unless you are prepared to list them all - and commit to maintain such a list.
It is not fair to list some here but not all of them. The link on the APGO website has a full list. It also seems that on their page the order is randomised every time you reload the page; again this is fairer, something that cannot be achieved with a list here.

{{Ranks of Nobility}}

A '''prince''' is a [[Monarch|male ruler]] ranked below a [[king]] and above a [[duke]] or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. ''Prince'' is also a title of  [[nobility]], often [[hereditary title|hereditary]], in some [[Europe]]an [[State (polity)|states]]. The feminine equivalent is a [[princess]]. The [[English language|English word]] derives, via the [[French language|French word]] ''prince'', from the [[Latin]] noun ''[[princeps]]'', from ''primus'' (first) + ''capio'' (to seize), meaning "the chief, most distinguished, [[monarch|ruler]], prince".&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant &amp; Charles, 260th thousand&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Cicero]] attacks [[Catiline]] in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] of the [[Roman Republic]].]]
The [[Latin]] word ''prīnceps'' (older Latin *prīsmo-kaps, literally "the one who takes the first [place/position]"), became the usual title of the informal leader of the [[Roman senate]] some centuries before the transition to [[Roman Empire|empire]], the ''[[princeps senatus]]''.

[[Emperor Augustus]] established the formal position of monarch on the basis of ''[[principate]]'', not ''[[Dominate|dominion]]''. He also tasked his grandsons as summer rulers of the city when most of the government were on holiday in the country or attending religious rituals, and, for that task, granted them the title of ''princeps''.

The title has generic and substantive meanings:
* generically, ''prince'' refers to a member of a family that [[monarchy|ruled by hereditary right]], the title referring either to sovereigns or to [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] of a sovereign's family. The term may be broadly used of persons in various cultures, continents or eras. In Europe, it is the title legally borne by [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]] [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] in monarchies, and borne by courtesy by members of formerly reigning dynasties.
* as a [[substantive title]], a ''prince'' was a monarch of the lowest [[Nobility|rank]] in post-[[Napoléon I of France|Napoleon]]ic Europe, e.g. Princes of, respectively, [[Andorra]], [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], [[Mingrelia]], [[Monaco]], [[Waldeck and Pyrmont]], [[Wallachia]], etc.
* also substantively, the title was granted by [[pope]]s and secular monarchs to specific individuals and to the [[agnatic primogeniture|heads]] of some high-ranking European families who, however, never exercised dynastic sovereignty and whose cadets are not entitled to share the princely title, ''viz'' the Princes de Beauvau-Craon, von [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Colonna]], von [[Dohna-Schlobitten]], von Eulenburg, de Faucigny-Lucinge, von [[Lichnowsky]], von [[Pless]], Ruffo di Calabria, (de [[Talleyrand]]) von [[Żagań|Sagan]], van [[Duke of Ursel|Ursel]], etc.
* generically, cadets of some non-sovereign families whose head bears the non-dynastic title of prince (or, less commonly, [[duke]]) were sometimes also authorized to use the princely title, e.g. von Carolath-Beuthen, de [[House of Broglie|Broglie]], Demidoff di San Donato, [[Lieven]], de [[House of Merode|Merode]], [[Pignatelli]], [[Radziwill]], von [[Wrede]], [[Prince Felix Yusupov|Yussopov]], etc.
* substantively, the [[heir apparent|heirs apparent]] in some monarchies use a specific princely title associated with a territory within the monarch's [[realm]], e.g. the Princes of, respectively, Asturias (Spain), Grão Pará (Brazil, formerly), Orange (Netherlands), Viana (Navarre, formerly), Wales (UK), etc.
* substantively, it became the fashion from the 17th century for the [[heir apparent|heirs apparent]] of the leading [[duke|ducal]] families to assume a princely title, associated with a ''[[fief|seigneurie]]'' in the family's possession. These titles were borne by courtesy and preserved by tradition, not law, e.g. the ''princes de'', respectively, Bidache (Gramont), Marcillac (La Rochefoucauld), Tonnay-Charente (Mortemart), Poix (Noailles), Léon (Rohan-Chabot),

==Prince as generic for ruler==
The original, but now less common use of the word, originated in the application of the Latin word ''[[princeps]]'', from [[Byzantine Empire|late Roman]] [[law]], and the classical system of government that eventually gave way to the European [[feudalism|feudal]] society.  In this sense, a prince is a ruler of a territory which is [[sovereignty|sovereign]], or [[quasi]]-sovereign, i.e.,  exercising substantial (though not all) prerogatives associated with monarchs of independent nations, as was common, for instance, within the historical boundaries of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In [[medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]], there were as many as two hundred such territories, especially in Italy, Germany, and [[Gaelic Ireland]]. In this sense, "prince" is used of any and all rulers, regardless of actual title or precise rank. This is the [[Renaissance]] use of the term found in [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s famous work, ''[[The Prince|Il Principe]]''.&lt;ref name="furst"&gt;"Fürst - Origins and cognates of the title", 2006, webpage: [http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Frst__Other_uses_in_German/id/5035795 EFest-Frst] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828052838/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Frst__Other_uses_in_German/id/5035795 |date=2011-08-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a title, by the end of the medieval era, ''prince'' was borne by rulers of territories that were either substantially smaller than or exercised fewer of the rights of sovereignty than did emperors and kings. A [[lord]] of even a quite small territory might come to be referred to as a ''prince'' before the 13th century, either from translations of a native title into the Latin ''princeps'' (as for the hereditary ruler of [[Wales]]), or when the lord's territory was [[allodial title|allodial]]. The lord of an [[allodial title|allodium]] owned his lands and exercised prerogatives over the subjects in his territory absolutely, owing no feudal homage or duty as a vassal to a [[feudalism|liege lord]], nor being subject to any higher jurisdiction. Most small territories designated as principalities during feudal eras were allodial, e.g. the [[Dombes|Princedom of Dombes]].

Lords who exercised lawful authority over territories and people within a feudal hierarchy were also sometimes regarded as ''princes'' in the general sense, especially if they held the rank of [[count]] or higher. This is attested in some surviving [[style (manner of address)|styles]] for e.g., British earls, [[marquess]]es, and [[duke]]s are still addressed by the [[The Crown|Crown]] on [[ceremony|ceremonial]] occasions as ''high and noble princes'' (cf. [[Royal and noble styles]]).

In parts of the Holy Roman Empire in which [[primogeniture]] did not prevail (e.g., Germany), all legitimate [[patrilineality|agnates]] had an equal right to the family's hereditary titles. While this meant that offices, such as [[emperor]], [[king]], and [[prince elector|elector]] could only be legally occupied by one dynast at a time, holders of such other titles as [[duke]], [[margrave]], [[landgrave]], [[count palatine]], and prince could only differentiate themselves by adding the name of their [[appanage]] to the family's original title. Not only did this tend to proliferate unwieldy titles (e.g. [[Catherine II of Russia|Princess Katherine of Anhalt-Zerbst]], or [[Charles X of Sweden|Karl, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken-Neukastell-Kleeburg]], or [[Prince Christian Charles of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön-Norburg]]), but as [[agnatic primogeniture]] gradually became the norm in the Holy Roman Empire by the end of the 18th century, another means of distinguishing the monarch from other members of his dynasty became necessary. Gradual substitution of the title of ''Prinz'' for the monarch's title of ''[[Fürst]]'' occurred, and became customary for cadets in all German dynasties except in the grand duchies of [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Oldenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;''Almanach de Gotha'' (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), pages 14–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Prinz'' and ''[[Fürst]]'' are translated into English as "prince", but they reflect not only different but mutually exclusive concepts.

This distinction had evolved before the 18th century (Liechtenstein long remained an exception, cadets and females using ''Fürst/Fürstin'' into the 19th century) for dynasties headed by a ''[[Fürst]]'' in Germany. The custom spread through the [[Continental Europe|Continent]] to such an extent that a renowned imperial general who belonged to a [[cadet branch]] of a reigning ducal family, remains best known to history by the generic dynastic title, "[[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]". Note that the princely title was used as a prefix to his Christian name, which also became customary.

Cadets of France's other ''[[Foreign Prince|princes étrangers]]'' affected similar usage under the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] kings. Always facing the scepticism of Saint-Simon and like-minded courtiers, these quasi-royal aristocrats' assumption of the princely title as a personal, rather than territorial, designation encountered some resistance. In writing ''Histoire Genealogique et Chonologique'', [[Père Anselme]] accepts that, by the end of the 17th century, the heir apparent to the [[House of la Tour d'Auvergne|House of La Tour d'Auvergne]]'s sovereign duchy bears the title, ''prince de Bouillon'', but he would record in 1728 that the heir's ''La Tour'' cousin, the Count of Oliergues, is "''known as'' the Prince Frederick" ("''dit'' le prince Frédéric").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Père Anselme|authorlink= Père Anselme|title= Histoire Genealogique et Chronologique de la Maison Royale de France|year = 1728|date=|publisher= Compagnie des Libraires|location= Paris|language= French|pages= 543, 545|chapter= Ducs de Bouillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-medieval rank of ''gefürsteter Graf'' (princely count) embraced but elevated the German equivalent of the intermediate French, English and Spanish nobles. In the Holy Roman Empire, these nobles rose to dynastic status by preserving from the Imperial crown (''[[de jure]]'' after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648) the exercise of such sovereign prerogatives as the [[mint (coin)|minting]] of money; the [[muster (military)|muster]] of military troops and the right to wage war and contract [[treaty|treaties]]; local judicial authority and [[constabulary|constabular]] enforcement; and the habit of inter-marrying with sovereign dynasties. By the 19th century, cadets of a ''[[Fürst]]'' would become known as ''Prinzen''.

==Prince of the blood==
{{confusing|section|date=June 2012}}

{{Main article|Prince du Sang}}
[[File:Grandconde.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Louis, Grand Condé|Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Condé]], was the ''premier prince du sang'' during his lifetime (painted by Joost van Egmont).]]

The husband of a [[queen regnant]] is usually titled "[[prince consort]]" or simply "prince", whereas the wives of male monarchs take the female equivalent (e.g., empress, queen) of their husband's title. In Brazil, Portugal and Spain, however, the husband of a female monarch was accorded the masculine equivalent of her title (e.g., emperor, king), at least after he fathered her heir. In previous epochs, husbands of queens regnant were often deemed entitled to the [[crown matrimonial]], sharing their consorts' regnal title and rank ''[[jure uxoris]]'',

However, in cultures which allow the ruler to have several wives (e.g., four in [[Islam]]) or official [[concubine]]s (e.g., [[Imperial China]], [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Thailand]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]]) these women, sometimes collectively referred to as a [[harem]], there are often specific rules determining their relative hierarchy and a variety of titles, which may distinguish between those whose offspring can be in line for the succession or not, or specifically who is mother to the heir to the throne.

To complicate matters, the style ''His/Her (Imperial/Royal) Highness'', a [[prefix]] often accompanying the title of a dynastic prince, may be awarded/withheld separately (as a compromise or consolation prize, in some sense, e.g., [[Duke of Cádiz#List of holders|Duke of Cádiz]], [[Duke of Windsor|Duchess of Windsor]], [[Lilian, Princess of Réthy#Titles|Princesse de Réthy]], [[Orléans-Braganza|Prince d'Orléans-Braganza]]).

Although the arrangement set out above is the one that is most commonly understood, there are also different systems. Depending on country, epoch, and translation, other usages of "prince" are possible.

Foreign-language titles such as [[Italian language|Italian]] ''principe'', [[French language|French]] ''prince'', [[German language|German]] ''[[Fürst]]'' and ''Prinz'' (non-reigning descendants of a reigning monarch),&lt;ref name="DDNP1"&gt;[[Duden]]; Definition of the German title ''Fürst'' (in German). [http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Fuerst]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DDNP2"&gt;[[Duden]]; Definition of the German title ''Prinz'' (in German). [http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Prinz]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian language|Russian]] ''[[knyaz]]'', etc., are usually translated as "prince" in English.

Some princely titles are derived from those of national rulers, such as [[tsarevich]] from [[tsar]]. Other examples are (e)[[mirza]](da), [[khanzada]], [[nawabzada]], [[sahibzada]], shahzada, [[sultanzada]] (all using the Persian patronymic suffix ''-zada'', meaning "son, descendant"). However, some princely titles develop in unusual ways, such as adoption of a style for dynasts which is not pegged to the ruler's title, but rather continues an old tradition (e.g., "[[grand duke]]" in [[Romanov]] Russia or "[[archduke]]" in Habsburg Austria), claims dynastic succession to a lost monarchy (e.g. ''prince de Tarente'' for the [[La Trémoille|La Trémoïlle heirs]] to the [[kingdom of Sicily|Neapolitan throne]]), or descends from a ruler whose princely title or sovereign status was not, ''de jure'', hereditary, but attributed to descendants as an international courtesy, (e.g., [[Brancovan|Bibesco]], [[Poniatowski]], [[Ypsilantis|Ypsilanti]]).

===Specific titles===
[[File:D. José, Príncipe da Beira e do Brasil.jpg|thumb|275px|[[José, Prince of Brazil]], [[Duke of Braganza]], died before he could ascend to the throne of Portugal.]]
In some dynasties, a specific style other than prince has become customary for dynasts, such as ''[[fils de France]]'' in the [[House of Capet]], and ''[[Infante]]''. ''Infante'' was borne by children of the monarch other than the [[heir apparent]] in all of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] monarchies. Some monarchies used a specific princely title for their heirs, such as [[Prince of Asturias]] in Spain and [[Prince of Brazil]] in Portugal.

Sometimes a specific title is commonly used by various dynasties in a region, e.g. [[Mian (surname)|Mian]] in various of the Punjabi princely [[Hill States]] (lower Himalayan region in British India).

European dynasties usually awarded [[appanage]]s to princes of the blood, typically attached to a feudal noble title, such as [[Prince of Orange]] in the Netherlands, Britain's [[royal duke]]s, the ''[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'' in France, the Count of Flanders in Belgium, and the Count of Syracuse in [[Two Sicilies|Sicily]]. Sometimes appanage titles were princely, e.g. [[Prince of Achaia]] (Courtenay), ''prince de Condé'' (Bourbon), [[Prince of Carignan]] (Savoy), but it was the fact that their owners were of princely ''rank'' rather than that they held a princely ''title'' which was the source of their pre-eminence.

For the often specific terminology concerning an heir apparent, see [[Crown prince]].

==Prince as a substantive title==

Other princes derive their title not from dynastic membership as such, but from inheritance of a title named for a specific and historical territory. The family's possession of prerogatives or properties in that territory might be long past. Such were most of the "princedoms" of France's ''[[ancien régime]]'', so resented for their pretentiousness in the memoirs of [[Louis de Rouvroy, Duke of Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. These included the princedoms of Arches-Charleville, Boisbelle-Henrichemont, Chalais, Château-Regnault, Guéménée, Martigues, Mercœur, Sedan, Talmond, Tingrey, and the "kingship" of Yvetot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/frprince.htm#list|title=The Rank/Title of Prince in France|first=Francois|last=Velde|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

====Extant principalities====
The current princely monarchies include:
* the [[co-principality]] of [[Principality of Andorra|Andorra]] (current reigning princes are the [[President of the French Republic|French President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] and [[Joan Enric Vives Sicília|HE Joan Enric Vives Sicília]])

====Micronations====
In the same tradition, some self-proclaimed monarchs of so-called [[micronation]]s style themselves as princes:
* [[Roy Bates]] called himself Prince Roy of the [[Principality of Sealand]]
* Leonard George Casley calls himself Prince Leonard I of the [[Principality of Hutt River]] (enclave in Australia)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hutt-river-province.com/PofHR_Naming.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507102818/http://www.hutt-river-province.com/PofHR_Naming.htm |archivedate=2011-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prince exercising head of state's authority====
Various monarchies provide for different modes in which princes of the dynasty can temporarily or permanently share in the style and / or office of the monarch, e.g. as [[regent]] or [[viceroy]].

Though these offices may not be reserved legally for members of the ruling dynasty, in some traditions they are filled by dynasts, a fact which may be reflected in the style of the office, e.g. "[[Napoleon III#Prince-President (1848–51)|prince-president]]" for [[Napoleon III]] as French [[head of state]] but not yet emperor, or "prince-lieutenant" in [[Luxembourg]], repeatedly filled by the [[crown prince]] before the grand duke's abdication, or in form of ''[[consortium imperii]]''.

Some monarchies even have a practice in which the monarch can formally abdicate in favor of his heir, and yet retain a kingly title with executive power, e.g. ''Maha Upayuvaraja'' ([[Sanskrit]] for ''Great Joint King'' in [[Cambodia]]), though sometimes also conferred on powerful regents who exercised executive powers.

===Non-dynastic princes===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:Bismarcks Wappen.gif|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of [[Otto von Bismarck|Otto, prince of Bismarck]] (German Empire).]]
In several countries of the European continent, such as France, prince can be an aristocratic title of someone having a high rank of [[nobility]] or as lord of a significant fief, but not ruling any actual territory and without any necessary link to the [[royal family]], which makes it difficult to compare with the British system of royal princes.

'''France and the Holy Roman Empire'''

The kings of France started to bestow the style of prince, as a title among the nobility, from the 16th century onwards. These titles were created by elevating a ''seigneurie'' to the nominal status of a principality—although prerogatives of sovereignty were never conceded in the letters patent. Princely titles self-assumed by the ''[[Prince du sang|princes du sang]] and by the [[Foreign prince|princes étrangers]]'' were generally tolerated by the king and used at the royal court, outside the [[Parlement of Paris]]. These titles held no official place in the hierarchy of the nobility, but were often treated as ranking just below [[French peerage|ducal peerages]], since they were often inherited (or assumed) by ducal heirs:
* French titles of prince recognized by the king
** Holy Roman Empire states annexed by France

** The princes of [[prince of Condé|Condé]] and [[prince of Conti|Conti]], heads of [[cadet branch]]es of the French royal [[House of Bourbon]]: used recognized princely titles, but the lordships of Condé and Conti were never formally created principalities by the King.
* Unrecognized titles of Prince
** Aigremont

** [[Carency]]: in [[Artois]]. Originally a lordship of the House of Bourbon. It was inherited by the Counts of La Vauguyon, who used the style of Prince of Carency for the heir.
** [[Chabanais]]: in [[Angoumois]]. Reduced to a marquisate in 1702
** [[Chalais, Dordogne|Chalais]]: in [[Périgord]]. Inherited by the elder branch of the [[Talleyrand]] family. Spanish [[Grandee]]ship attached to the title in 1714.
** [[Commercy]]: lordship of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Cadets of the [[House of Lorraine]] used the style of Prince of Commercy.
** Courtenay: the [[House of Courtenay]] legitimately descended from [[Louis VI of France]] but not recognized as ''princes du sang'' by France's kings. The last branch of the house used the style of Prince of Courtenay from the 17th century. The style passed to the Dukes of Bauffremont.
** [[Elbeuf]]: lordship of [[Normandy]]. Younger sons of the [[House of Guise]] used the style of prince d'Elbeuf; later a duchy.
** [[Lamballe]]: in [[Brittany]], used by the heir of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] Duke of Penthièvre.
** [[Lambesc]]: in [[Provence]], used by various cadets of the House of Guise, notably by the heirs of the Dukes of Elbeuf.

This can even occur in a monarchy within which an identical but real and substantive feudal title exists, such as ''[[Fürst]]'' in German.  An example of this is:
* [[Otto von Bismarck]] was created [[Prince of Bismarck|Prince von Bismarck]] in the empire of reunited Germany, under the Hohenzollern dynasty.
'''Spain, France and Netherlands'''
[[File:Duke of Wellington Arms.svg|thumb|115px|Coat of arms of the [[Prince of Waterloo|princes of Waterloo]] (the Netherlands).]]
In other cases, such titular princedoms are created in chief of an event, such as a treaty of a victory. An example of this is:
* The Spanish minister [[Manuel Godoy]] was created ''Principe de la Paz'' or ''Prince of Peace'' by his king for negotiating the 1795 double peace-treaty of Basilea, by which the revolutionary French republic made peace with Prussia and with Spain.
* The triumphant generals who led their troops to victory often received a [[victory title]] from Napoleon, both princely and ducal.
* King [[William I of the Netherlands]] bestowed the [[victory title]] of [[prince of Waterloo]] upon [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington]] after his victory over [[Napoleon I Bonaparte]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815.

'''Poland and Russia'''
[[File:Herb Pogon Litewska.jpg|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of the princes [[Pogoń Litewska|Sanguszko-Lubartowicz]] (Poland).]]
In Poland specifically, the titles of prince dated either to the times before the [[Union of Lublin]] or were granted to Polish nobles by foreign kings, as the law in Poland forbade the king from dividing nobility by granting them [[hereditary title]]s: see [[The Princely Houses of Poland]].

[[File:Armoiries de la famille Iousoupov (1799).jpg|thumb|250px| Coat of arms of the princes [[House of Yusupov|Youssoupoff]] ]]
In the Russian system, ''[[knyaz]]'', translated as "prince", is the highest degree of official nobility. Members of older dynasties, whose realms were eventually annexed to the [[Russian Empire]], were also accorded the title of ''knyaz'' — sometimes after first being allowed to use the higher title of [[tsarevich]] (e.g. the Princes [[Gruzinsky]] and [[Sibirsky (surname)|Sibirsky]]). The many surviving branches of the [[Rurik dynasty]] used the ''knyaz'' title before and after they yielded sovereignty to their kinsmen, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Princes of Muscovy]], who became [[Tsar]]s and, under the [[House of Romanov]], Emperors of Russia.

==Title in various Western traditions and languages==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2016}}
&lt;!-- This list is partially based on a page in Heraldica.org by Alexander Krischnig doing the same for various titles in 35 languages- but *it is not entirely reliable nor completely verified yet, and more languages can be added : handle with care, and amend if you know better for certain*. --&gt;

In each case, the title is followed (when available) by the female form and then (not always available, and obviously rarely applicable to a prince of the blood without a principality) the name of the territory associated with it, each separated by a slash. If a second title (or set) is also given, then that one is for a Prince of the blood, the first for a principality. Be aware that the absence of a separate title for a prince of the blood may not always mean no such title exists; alternatively, the existence of a word does not imply there is also a reality in the linguistic territory concerned; it may very well be used exclusively to render titles in other languages, regardless whether there is a historical link with any (which often means that linguistic tradition is adopted)

Etymologically, we can discern the following traditions (some languages followed a historical link, e.g. within the Holy Roman Empire, not their language family; some even fail to follow the same logic for certain other aristocratic titles):

===Romance languages===

==Title in other traditions and languages==
[[File:თავადი ყანწით (მელიტონ ჩხეიძის პორტრეტი). ნიკო ფიროსმანი. 1906.jpg|thumb|170px|Georgian prince, [[Tavadi]].]]
In Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Hungary the title of ''prince'' has also been used as the highest title of [[nobility]] (without membership in a ruling dynasty), above the title of ''duke'', while the same usage (then as ''fürst'') has occurred in Germany and Austria but then one rank below the title of ''duke'' and above ''count''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bonniers]] konversationslexikon I'' 1937 pp. 82-86&lt;/ref&gt;

The above is essentially the story of European, Christian dynasties and other nobility, also 'exported' to their colonial and other overseas territories and otherwise adopted by rather westernized societies elsewhere (e.g. Haiti).

Applying these essentially western concepts, and terminology, to other cultures even when they don't do so, is common but in many respects rather dubious. Different (historical, religious...) backgrounds have also begot significantly different dynastic and nobiliary systems, which are poorly represented by the 'closest' western analogy.

It therefore makes sense to treat these per civilization.

===Islamic traditions===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2016}}
*Arabian tradition since the [[caliphate]] – in several monarchies it remains customary to use the title [[Sheikh]] (in itself below princely rank) for all members of the royal family. In families (often reigning dynasties) which claim descent from [[Muhammad]], this is expressed in either of a number of titles (supposing different exact relations): sayid, sharif; these are retained even when too remote from any line of succession to be a member of any dynasty.
*Malay countries
*In the Ottoman Empire, the sovereign of imperial rank (incorrectly known in the west as ''(Great) sultan'') was styled ''[[padishah]]'' with a host of additional titles, reflecting his claim as political successor to the various conquered states. Princes of the blood, male, were given the style [[Şehzade]].
*Persia (Iran) – Princes as members of a royal family, are referred to by the title ''Shahzadeh'', meaning "descendant of the king". Since the word ''zadeh'' could refer to either a male or female descendant, ''Shahzadeh'' had the parallel meaning of "princess" as well. Princes can also be sons of provincial kings ([[Khan (title)|Khan]]) and the title referring to them would be the title of Khanzadeh. Princes as people who got a title from the King are called "[[Mirza]]", diminutive of "Amir Zadeh" (King's Son).
*In Indian Muslim dynasties, the most common titles were ''[[Mirza]]'' (from ''Amirzada'') and ''[[Shah#Shahzada|Shahzada]]''; while ''[[Nawabzada]]'' and ''[[Sahibzada]]'' were also given to younger blood princes.
*In [[Kazakh Khanate]] the title Sultan was used for lords from a ruling dynasty (direct descendants of [[Genghis Khan]]), that gives them a right to be elected as [[khan (title)|khan]], as an experienced ruler; and an honorific ''[[tore]]'' ([[:ru:Торе (род)]]) for ordinary members of a ruling dynasty.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Non-Islamic Asian traditions===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2016}}
====China====
In ancient China, the title of prince developed from being the highest title of [[Chinese nobility|nobility]] (synonymous with [[duke]]) in the [[Zhou Dynasty]], to five grades of princes (not counting the sons and grandsons of the emperor) by the time of the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]].The Chinese word for prince ''Wang'' ({{lang|ch|王}}, literally, King) as Chinese believe the emperor ''Huang Di'' ({{lang|ch|皇帝}}) is the ruler of all kings. The most accurate translations of the English word "prince" are ''Huang Zi'' ({{lang|ch|皇子}}, lit. Son of the Emperor) or ''Wang Zi'' ({{lang|ch|王子}}, lit. Son of the King). 

====Japan====
In Japan, the title ''Kōshaku'' ({{lang|ja|公爵}}) was used as the highest title of ''[[Kazoku]]'' ({{lang|ja|華族}} Japanese modern nobility) before the present constitution. ''Kōshaku'', however, is more commonly translated as "Duke" to avoid confusion with the following royal ranks in the Imperial Household: ''Shinnō'' ({{lang|ja|親王}} literally, Prince of the Blood); ''Naishinnō'' ({{lang|ja|内親王}} lit., Princess of the Blood in her own right); and ''Shinnōhi'' {{lang|ja|親王妃}} lit.,  Princess Consort); or ''Ō'' ({{lang|ja|王}} lit., Prince); ''Jyo-Ō'' ({{lang|ja|女王}} lit., Princess (in her own right)); and ''Ōhi'' ({{lang|ja|王妃}} lit., Princess Consort). The former is the higher title of a male member of the Imperial family while the latter is the lower.

====Korea====
In [[Joseon Dynasty]], the title "Prince" was used for the king's male-line descendant. Prince translated generally into three divisions. The king's legitimate son used title ''daegun'' (대군, 大君, literally '''Grand Prince'''). A son born of a concubine and king's great-great-grand son used title ''gun'' (군, 君, lit. '''Prince'''). But the title of ''gun'' wasn't limited to royal family. Instead, it was often granted as an honorary and non-hereditory title.
Presently, as noble titles are no more granted or even recognized by the people, the English word "Prince" is usually translated as ''wangja'' (왕자, 王子, lit. '''king's son'''), only rendering the usage in foreign royal families. Princes and principalities in continental Europe are almost always confused with dukes and duchies, both being translated as ''gong'' (공, 公, lit. '''duke''') and ''gongguk'' (공국, 公國, lit. '''duchy''').

====Sri Lanka====
The title 'Prince' was used for the [[Monarch|King's]] son in [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] generation in [[Sri Lanka]].

====India====
[[File:Weeks Edwin Indian Prince And Parade Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Indian Prince And Parade Ceremony (by [[Edwin Lord Weeks]])]] 
''See'' [[princely states]] for the often particular, mainly [[Hindu]] titles in former [[British Raj|British India]], including modern [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]], and [[Nepal]].

====Indochina====
''See'' [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Laos]]

====Philippines====
''See'' [[Principalia]], the Sultanate of [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Maguindanao]] and the Sultanate of [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]].

====Thailand====
In [[Thailand]] (formerly Siam), the title of Prince was divided into three classes depending on the rank of their mothers. Those who were born of a king and had a royal mother (a queen or princess consort) are titled ''[[Thai royal and noble titles#Chao Fa .28HRH Prince.29 .28HRH Princess.29|Chaofa Chai]]'' ({{lang-th|เจ้าฟ้าชาย}}: literally, "Male Celestial Lord"). Those born of a king and a commoner, or children of Chaofas, are tilted ''[[Thai royal and noble titles#Phra Ong Chao .28HRH Prince.29 .28HRH Princess.29 .2F.2F.2F .28HH Prince.29 .28HH Princess.29|Phra Ong Chao]]'' (พระองค์เจ้า). The children of Phra Ong Chaos are titled ''[[Thai royal and noble titles#Mom Chao .28His.2FHer Serene Highness Prince.2FPrincess.29|Mom Chao]]'' (หม่อมเจ้า), abbreviated as M.C. (or ม.จ.).

===African traditions===
{{unsourced|section|date=November 2016}}
A Western model was sometimes copied by emancipated colonial regimes (e.g. Bokassa I's short-lived [[Central-African Empire]] in Napoleonic fashion). Otherwise, most of the styles for members of ruling families do not lend themselves well to English translation. Nonetheless, in general the princely style has gradually replaced the [[colony|colonialist]] title of "[[tribal chief|chief]]", which does not particularly connote dynastic rank to Westerners, e.g. [[House of Dlamini|Swazi Royal Family]] and [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu#Children|Zulu Royal Family]]. Nominally [[Minister (government)|ministerial]] chiefly titles, such as the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ''[[Oba (ruler)#Oloye|Oloye]]'' and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] ''[[InDuna]]'', still exist as distinct titles in kingdoms all over Africa.

==Title in religion==
[[File:Bellarmine 3.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Bellarmine|Saint Robert Cardinal Bellarmine]] was a prince of the Roman Catholic Church during his lifetime.]]

In states with an element of [[theocracy]], this can affect princehood in several ways, such as the style of the ruler (e.g. with a secondary title meaning son or servant of a named divinity), but also the mode of succession (even reincarnation and recognition).

Furthermore, certain religious offices may be considered of princely rank, or imply comparable temporal rights. The Prince-Popes, [[Pope]], Hereditary Prince-Cardinals, [[Cardinal (Roman Catholic)|Cardinals]], Prince-Lord Bishops, [[Prince Bishop]]s, [[Lord Bishop]]s, [[Prince-Provost]], and [[Prince-abbot]]s are referred to as [[Prince of the Church|Princes of the Church]].  

Also in [[Christianity]], [[Jesus Christ]] is sometimes referred to as the ''Prince of Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;This is a title for [[Jesus Christ]] (among others) given in Isaiah 9:6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other titles for Jesus Christ are ''Prince of Princes'',&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Jesus Christ]] given in Daniel 8:25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prince of the Covenant'',&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Jesus Christ]] given in Daniel 11:22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prince of Life'',&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Jesus Christ]] given in Acts 3:15.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Prince of the Kings of the Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Jesus Christ]] given in Revelation 1:5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, [[Satan]] is popularly titled the ''Prince of Darkness'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost |last=Milton |first= John |title=Paradise Lost |edition=1st |location=London |publisher=Samuel Simmons |year=1667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Christian]] faith he is also referred to as the ''Prince of this World''&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Satan]] given in John 12:31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Satan]] given in John 14:30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Satan]] given in John 16:11.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Prince of the Power of the Air''.&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Satan]] given in Ephesians 2:2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another title for Satan, not as common today but apparently so in approximately 30 A.D. by the [[Pharisees]] of the day, was the title ''Prince of the Devils''.&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Satan]] given in Matthew 9:34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Satan]] given in Matthew 12:24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A title for [[Satan]] given in Mark 3:22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prince of Israel'', ''Prince of the Angels'',  and ''Prince of Light'' are titles given to the Archangel [[Saint Michael|Michael]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Some Christian churches also believe that since all Christians, like Jesus Christ, are children of God, then they too are princes and princesses of Heaven. [[Saint Peter]], a disciple of Jesus, is also known as the [[Prince of the Apostles]].

National Geographic Russia, April 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially known as ''Ruska Roma'', they live mostly in Russia and [[Belarus]], but also in Eastern and Central [[Ukraine]], France, Canada, and the United States.

The Ruska Romani language contains some [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] words, as well as a small amount of Ukrainian and Russian grammar. Most Ruska Roma are [[Orthodox Christians]], while those living in predominantly [[Muslim]] areas (such as the [[Caucasus]]) tend to be Muslim.&lt;ref name="NGR" /&gt;

Their traditional [[profession]]s include [[horse trading]], [[music]], dancing, and fortune-telling.&lt;ref name="NGR" /&gt; {{As of | 2016}} most Romani singers, actors, dancers, and musicians in Russia are of the Ruska Roma. Their musical culture is considered{{by whom|date=February 2016}} to be the leading Romani culture in Russia, and is copied by other Roma.

The Ruska Roma traditional clothing is based on Russian and [[Kalderash]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=_wQtDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=ruska+roma+clothing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRlfz0t7HaAhWE5IMKHZpCCicQ6AEIJDAA&lt;/ref&gt; traditional clothing, and is used actively by singers and dancers.

Modern Ruska Roma are one of the most educated Romani groups in Russia. They have many professions.&lt;ref name="NGR" /&gt;

==Ruska Roma in Russian history==

At the beginning of the 19th century there already existed several Romani choruses consisting of Ruska Roma who were servants. They were considered to be so talented that their owners emancipated them. Romani choruses of Moscow and Saint-Petersburg were very popular during the 19th century. Russian noblemen sometimes married Romani chorus girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=mkf7di7DdiUC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Ruska+Roma+19th+century+married+gypsy+chorus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju6OyI1-3ZAhUJurwKHe8zBagQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruska+Roma+19th+century+married+gypsy+chorus&amp;f=true|title=Russian Gypsy Folk Songs|first=BIBS|last=EKKEL|date=7 October 2010|publisher=Mel Bay Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, Ruska Roma were mostly nomadic horse traders and singers. They traveled during the summer and stayed in cottages of Russian peasants during the winter. They paid for their lodging with money or with work on the horses. Ruska Roma were very popular among peasants who liked their music and dances and considered Roma to be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=UEQ8bwAACAAJ&amp;dq=ruska+roma&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiey4TDt7HaAhWQ14MKHRWzDWMQ6AEIJDAA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, when [[Napoleon I]] invaded Russia, the Romani diaspora of Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]] gave large sums of money and good horses for the Russian [[army]]. Many young Romani men took part in the war as [[uhlan]]s.
[[Image:The Gypsy Theatre.jpg|thumb|The Romani theater]]
At  the end of the 19th century Rusko Rom [[Nikolai Shishkin]] created a Romani [[theater]] troupe. One of its plays was in the [[Romani language]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=_wQtDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=ruska+roma&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiey4TDt7HaAhWQ14MKHRWzDWMQ6AEILTAC&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[October Revolution]], some Romani families left Russia. Some young Romani men took part in the [[civil war]].
In the 1920s and '30s, Roma of the [[Soviet Union]] produced a literary norm of the Romani language that was based on a dialect of Ruska Roma.

Romani [[literature]] and [[News media|press]] appeared; most of the poets, writers and journalists were from the Ruska Roma.
In the 1930s the Roma of the U.S.S.R. were subjected to mass repressions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Romani press and literature were forbidden.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

During World War II some of the Ruska Roma entered the army, by conscription and as volunteers. They took part in the war as soldiers, officers, infantrymen, tankmen, artillerymen, aviators, drivers, paramedics and doctors. Some teenagers, old men and adult men were also partisans. Romani actors, singers, musicians, dancers (mostly women) performed for soldiers in the front line and in hospitals. A huge number of Roma, including many of the Ruska Roma, died or were murdered in territories occupied by the enemy, in battles, and in the siege of Leningrad.

After World War II Ruska Roma's music became very popular. [[Romen Theatre]], Romani singers and ensembles prospered. All Roma of the U.S.S.R. began to perceive Ruska Roma's culture as the basic Romani culture. After the Decree of nomadic life interdiction (1956), the second wave of Ruska Romani settling happened.

In the 1980s, some representatives of artistic Ruska Romani families made a considerable contribution to "informal" music: [[jazz]] ([[Valentina Ponomaryova (singer)|Valentina Ponomaryova]]), [[Rock music|rock]] ([[Valentina Ponomaryova (singer)|Valentina Ponomaryova]], [[Mikhail Zhemchuzhny Junior]]), ''Russian chanson'' ([[Alexei Dulkevich Junior]]).

In the 1990s, Ruska Roma's music lost its popularity and now have quite a small audience, but is still popular at Russian weddings and birthday celebrations.

{{Financial risk types}}
In [[finance]], '''systemic risk''' is the risk of collapse of an entire financial system or entire market, as opposed to risk associated with any one individual entity, group or component of a system, that can be contained therein without harming the entire system.&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031006100654/http://www1.worldbank.org/economicpolicy/managing%20volatility/contagion/documents/3qep2.pdf Banking and currency crises and systemic risk], George G. Kaufman (World Bank), [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2009/11/what-is-systemic-risk-anyway.html What is systemic risk anyway?], Gerald P. Dwyer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ilin" /&gt; It can be defined as "financial ''system'' instability, potentially catastrophic, caused or exacerbated by idiosyncratic events or conditions in financial intermediaries".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorkfed.org/registration/research/risk/Daula_slides.ppt Systemic Risk: Relevance, Risk Management Challenges and Open Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305000018/https://www.newyorkfed.org/registration/research/risk/Daula_slides.ppt |date=2009-03-05 }}, Tom Daula&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the risks imposed by ''interlinkages'' and ''interdependencies'' in a system or market, where the failure of a single entity or cluster of entities can cause a [[cascading failure]], which could potentially bankrupt or bring down the entire system or market.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarcz, Steven L. (2008). Systemic Risk. {{ssrn|1008326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes erroneously referred to as "[[systematic risk]]".

==Explanation==
Systemic risk has been associated with a [[bank run]] which has a cascading effect on other banks which are owed money by the first bank in trouble, causing a [[cascading failure]].  As depositors sense the ripple effects of default, and [[liquidity]] concerns cascade through money markets, a panic can spread through a market, with a sudden [[flight to quality]], creating many sellers but few buyers for illiquid assets.  These interlinkages and the potential "clustering" of [[bank run]]s are the issues which policy makers consider when addressing the issue of protecting a system against systemic risk.&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRMPG3"&gt;[http://www.crmpolicygroup.org/docs/CRMPG-III.pdf Containing Systemic Risk], CRMPG III, August 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Governments and market monitoring institutions (such as the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), and [[central banks]]) often try to put policies and rules in place with the justification of safeguarding the interests of the market as a whole, claiming that the trading participants in financial markets are entangled in a web of dependencies arising from their interlinkage. In simple English, this means that some companies are viewed as too big and too interconnected to fail. Policy makers frequently claim that they are concerned about protecting the resiliency of the system, rather than any one individual in that system.&lt;ref name="CRMPG3" /&gt; Systemic risk arises because of the interaction of market participants, and therefore can be seen as a form of [[endogenous risk]].  See also {{YouTube|UzW195qWHYg|What is systemic risk?}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|UzW195qWHYg|What is systemic risk?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk management literature offers an alternative perspective to notions from economics and finance by distinguishing between the nature of systemic failure, its causes and effects, and the risk of its occurrence&lt;ref name= "Ilin"&gt;Ilin, T. &amp; Varga, L. Risk Manag (2015) "The uncertainty of systemic risk." 17: 240. {{doi|10.1057/rm.2015.15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. It takes an "operational behaviour" approach to defining systemic risk of failure as: "A measure of the overall probability at a current time of the system entering an operational state of systemic failure by a specified time in the future, in which the supply of financial services no longer satisfies demand according to regulatory criteria, qualified by a measure of uncertainty about the system’s future behaviour, in the absence of new mitigation efforts." This definition lends itself to practical risk mitigation applications, as demonstrated in recent research by a simulation of the collapse of the Icelandic financial system in circa 2008.

Systemic risk should not be confused with market or price risk as the latter is specific to the item being bought or sold and the effects of market risk are isolated to the entities dealing in that specific item. This kind of risk can be mitigated by hedging an investment by entering into a mirror trade.

Insurance is often easy to obtain against "systemic risks" because a party issuing that insurance can pocket the premiums, issue dividends to shareholders, enter insolvency proceedings if a catastrophic event ever takes place, and hide behind limited liability.  Such insurance, however, is not effective for the insured entity.

One argument that was used by financial institutions to obtain special advantages in bankruptcy for derivative contracts was a claim that the market is both critical and fragile.&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRMPG3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_07_3_scott.pdf What is Systemic Risk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/media/4014 The Economics of Legal Tender Laws], [[Jorg Guido Hulsmann]] (includes detailed commentary on systemic risk inherent in [[fractional reserve banking|FRB]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Systemic risk can also be defined as the likelihood and degree of negative consequences to the larger body. With respect to federal [[financial regulation]], the systemic risk of a financial institution is the likelihood and the degree that the institution's activities will negatively affect the larger economy such that unusual and extreme federal intervention would be required to ameliorate the effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pciaa.net/web/sitehome.nsf/lcpublic/392/$file/PCI_Systemic_Risk_Definition.pdf Systemic Risk], Property Casualty Insurers Association of America&lt;/ref&gt;

A general definition of systemic risk which is not limited by its mathematical approaches, model assumptions or focus on one institution, and which is also the first operationalizable definition of systemic risk encompassing the systemic character of financial, political, environmental, and many other risks, was put forth in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Boran, M. (2010). Market Dynamics &amp; Systemic Risk. ''23rd Australasian Finance and Banking Conference''. {{ssrn|1620495}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Systemic Risk Centre]] at the [[London School of Economics]] is focused on the study of systemic risk. It finds that systemic risk is a form of [[endogenous risk]], hence frustrating empirical measurements of systemic risk.

==Measurement==

=== TBTF/TICTF ===
According to the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, there are two key assessments for measuring systemic risk, the "[[too big to fail]]" (TBTF) and the "too interconnected to fail" (TICTF) tests.  First, the TBTF test is the traditional analysis for assessing the risk of required government intervention.  TBTF can be measured in terms of an institution's size relative to the national and international marketplace, market share concentration, and competitive barriers to entry or how easily a product can be substituted.  Second, the TICTF test is a measure of the likelihood and amount of medium-term net negative impact to the larger economy of an institution's failure to be able to conduct its ongoing business.  The impact is measure beyond the institution's products and activities to include the economic multiplier of all other commercial activities dependent specifically on that institution.  The impact is also dependent on how correlated an institution's business is with other systemic risks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pciaa.net/web/sitehome.nsf/lcpublic/392/$file/PCI_Systemic_Risk_Definition.pdf PCI Definition of Systemic Risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== TBTF ====
'''[[Too Big to Fail]]:''' The traditional analysis for assessing the risk of required government intervention is the "Too Big to Fail" Test (TBTF).  TBTF can be measured in terms of an institution's size relative to the national and international marketplace, market share concentration (using the [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] for example), and competitive barriers to entry or how easily a product can be substituted.  While there are large companies in most financial marketplace segments, the national insurance marketplace is spread among thousands of companies, and the barriers to entry in a business where capital is the primary input are relatively minor.  The policies of one homeowners insurer can be relatively easily substituted for another or picked up by a state residual market provider, with limits on the underwriting fluidity primarily stemming from state-by-state regulatory impediments, such as limits on pricing and capital mobility.  During the recent financial crisis, the collapse of the American International Group (AIG) posed a significant systemic risk to the financial system.  There are arguably either no or extremely few insurers that are TBTF in the U.S. marketplace.

==== TICTF ====
'''[[Too connected to fail|Too Interconnected to Fail:]]''' A more useful systemic risk measure than a traditional TBTF test is a "Too Interconnected to Fail" (TICTF) assessment.  An intuitive TICTF analysis has been at the heart of most recent federal financial emergency relief decisions.  TICTF is a measure of the likelihood and amount of medium-term net negative impact to the larger economy of an institution's failure to be able to conduct its ongoing business.
Network models have been proposed as a method for quantifying the impact of interconnectedness on systemic risk.&lt;ref&gt;R Cont, A Moussa and E. B. Santos (2013) [https://cib.epfl.ch/images/website/ContMoussaSantos.pdf Network structure and systemic risk in banking systems].

The impact is measured not just on the institution's products and activities, but also the economic multiplier of all other commercial activities dependent specifically on that institution.  It is also dependent on how correlated an institution's business is with other systemic risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pciaa.net/web/sitehome.nsf/lcpublic/392/$file/PCI_Systemic_Risk_Definition.pdf Too Big to Fail], Property Casualty Insurers Association of America&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms of systemic risk measurements====
''Criticisms of systemic risk measurements:'' Danielsson et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danielsson|first=J.|author2=James, K. |author3=Valenzuela, M.| author4=Zer, I. |year=2016|title=Can we prove a bank guilty of creating systemic risk? A minority report|journal=Money Credit and Banking |volume=48|issue=4|pages=795–812 |doi=10.1111/jmcb.12318|url=http://www.riskresearch.org/papers/DanielssonJamesValenzuelaZer2015b/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danielsson|first=J.|author2=James, K. |author3=Valenzuela, M.| author4=Zer, I. |year=2016|title=Model risk of risk models |journal=Journal of Financial Stability|volume=23|pages=79–91 |doi=10.1016/j.jfs.2016.02.002|url=http://www.riskresearch.org/papers/DanielssonJamesValenzuelaZer2015a/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  express concerns about systemic risk measurements, such as SRISK and CoVaR,  because they are based on market outcomes that happen multiple times a year, so that the probability of systemic risk as measured does not correspond to the actual systemic risk in the financial system. Systemic financial crises happen once every 43 years for a typical OECD country and measurements of systemic risk should target that probability.

=== SRISK ===
A financial institution represents a systemic risk if it becomes undercapitalized when the financial system as a whole is undercapitalized. In a single risk factor model, Brownlees and Engle,&lt;ref&gt;Brownlees, C.T., Engle, R.F., 2010. Volatility, correlation and tails for systemic risk measurement, {{ssrn|1611229}}.&lt;/ref&gt; build a systemic risk measure named SRISK. SRISK can be interpreted as the amount of capital that needs to be injected into a financial firm as to restore a certain form of minimal capital requirement. SRISK has several nice properties: SRISK is expressed in monetary terms and is, therefore, easy to interpret. SRISK can be easily aggregated across firms to provide industry and even country specific aggregates. Last, the computation of SRISK involves variables which may be viewed on their own as risk measures, namely the size of the financial firm, the leverage (ratio of assets to market capitalization), and a measure of how the return of the firm evolves with the market (some sort of time varying conditional [[Beta (finance)|beta]] but with emphasis on the tail of the distribution). Because these three dimensions matter simultaneously in the SRISK measure, one may expect to obtain a more balanced indicator than if one had used either one of the three risk variables individually.

Whereas the initial Brownlees and Engle model is tailored to the US market, the extension by Engle, Jondeau, and Rockinger&lt;ref&gt;Engle, R.F., Jondeau, E., Rockinger, M., 2012. Systemic Risk in Europe. {{ssrn|2192536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; allows for various factors, time varying parameters, and is therefore more adapted to the European market. One factor captures worldwide variations of financial markets, another one the variations of European markets. Then this extension allows for a country specific factor. By taking into account different factors, one captures the notion that shocks to the US or Asian markets may affect Europe but also that bad news within Europe (such as the news about a potential default of one of the countries) matters for Europe. Also, there may be country specific news that do not affect Europe nor the USA but matter for a given country. Empirically the last factor is found to be less relevant than the worldwide or European factor.

Since SRISK is measured in terms of currency, the industry aggregates may also be related to [[Gross Domestic Product]]. As such one obtains a measure of domestic systemically important banks.

The SRISK Systemic Risk Indicator is computed automatically on a weekly basis and made available to the community. For the US model SRISK and other statistics may be found under the [http://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/ Volatility Lab of NYU Stern School] website and for the European model under the [http://www.crml.ch/ Center of Risk Management (CRML)] website of HEC Lausanne.

==== Pair/Vine Copulas ====
A vine copula can be used to model systemic risk across a portfolio of financial assets.  One methodology is to apply the Clayton Canonical Vine Copula to model asset pairs in the vine structure framework.  As a Clayton copula is used, the greater the degree of asymmetric (i.e., left tail) dependence, the higher the Clayton copula parameter.  Therefore, one can sum up all the Clayton Copula parameters, and the higher the sum of these parameters, the greater the impending likelihood of systemic risk.  This methodology has been found to detect spikes in the US equities markets in the last four decades capturing the Oil Crisis and Energy Crisis of the 1970s, Black Monday and the Gulf War in the 1980s, the Russian Default/LTCM crisis of the 1990s, and the Technology Bubble and Lehman Default in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Low|first=Rand |date=2017-05-11|title=Vine copulas: modelling systemic risk and enhancing higher-moment portfolio optimisation.|journal=Accounting &amp; Finance|volume=0|pages=423–463|doi=10.1111/acfi.12274 |issn=1467-629X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation of assets and derivatives under systemic risk==

===Inadequacy of classic valuation models===
One problem when it comes to the valuation of derivatives, debt, or equity under systemic risk is that financial interconnectedness has to be modelled. One particular problem is posed by closed valuations chains, as exemplified here for four firms A, B, C, and D:

:B might hold shares of A, C holds some debt of B, D owns a derivative issued by C, and A owns some debt of D.&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014b)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Tom|title=Valuation in the structural model of systemic interconnectedness|journal=Presentation at the Frankfurt MathFinance Colloquium, November 27, 2014|year=2014|url=http://www.statistik-mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/fileadmin/10040800/user_upload/Fischer/Frankfurt_Fischer_handout.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the share price of A could influence all other asset values, including itself.

====The Merton (1974) model====
Situations as the one explained earlier, which are present in mature financial markets, cannot be modelled within the single-firm [[Merton model]],&lt;ref name="Merton (1974)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=R.C.|title=On the pricing of corporate debt: the risk structure of interest rates|journal=Journal of Finance|year=1974|volume=29|issue=2|pages=449–470|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1974.tb03058.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but also not by its straightforward extensions to multiple firms with potentially correlated assets.&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014b)"/&gt; To demonstrate this, consider two financial firms, &lt;math&gt;i = 1, 2&lt;/math&gt;, with limited liability, which both own system-exogenous assets of a value &lt;math&gt;a_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; at a maturity &lt;math&gt;T \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and which both owe a single amount of zero coupon debt &lt;math&gt;d_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, due at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. "System-exogenous" here refers to the assumption, that the business asset &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is not influenced by the firms in the considered financial system.
In the classic single firm Merton model,&lt;ref name="Merton (1974)"/&gt; it now holds at maturity for the equity &lt;math&gt;s_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and for the recovery value &lt;math&gt;r_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; of the debt, that

:&lt;math&gt;r_i = \min\{d_i, a_i\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;s_i = (a_i - d_i)^+.&lt;/math&gt;

Equity and debt recovery value, &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;, are thus uniquely and immediately determined by the value &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; of the exogenous business assets. Assuming that the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are, for instance, defined by a Black-Scholes dynamic (with or without correlations), risk-neutral no-arbitrage pricing of debt and equity is straightforward.

====Non-trivial asset value equations====
Consider now again two such firms, but assume that firm 1 owns 5% of firm two's equity and 20% of its debt. Similarly, assume that firm 2 owns 3% of firm one's equity and 10% of its debt. The equilibrium price equations, or liquidation value equations,&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014a)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Tom|title=No-arbitrage pricing under systemic risk: Accounting for cross-ownership|journal=Mathematical Finance|year=2014|volume=24|issue=1|pages=97–124|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9965.2012.00526.x|arxiv=1005.0768}}&lt;/ref&gt; at maturity are now given by

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \min\{d_1, a_1 + 0.05s_2 + 0.2r_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_2 = \min\{d_2, a_2 + 0.03s_1 + 0.1r_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_1 = (a_1  + 0.05s_2 + 0.2r_2 - d_1)^+&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;s_2 = (a_2 + 0.03s_1 + 0.1r_1 - d_2)^+.&lt;/math&gt;

This example demonstrates, that systemic risk in the form of financial interconnectedness can already lead to a non-trivial, non-linear equation system for the asset values if only two firms are involved.

====Over- and underestimation of default probabilities====
It is known that modelling credit risk while ignoring cross-holdings of debt or equity can lead to an under-, but also an over-estimation of default probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karl|first=S.|author2=Fischer, T. |year=2014|title=Cross-ownership as a structural explanation for over- and underestimation of default probability|journal=Quantitative Finance|volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=1031–1046 (Published online: 18 Nov 2013)|doi=10.1080/14697688.2013.834377|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14697688.2013.834377#.VJXtVeAA|arxiv=1301.6069|citeseerx=10.1.1.768.3101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for proper structural models of financial interconnectedness in quantitative risk management – be it in research or practice – is therefore obvious.

===Structural models under financial interconnectedness===
The first authors to consider structural models for financial systems where each firm could own debt of any other firm were Eisenberg and Noe in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenberg|first=L.|author2=Noe, T.H. |year=2001|title=Systemic Risk in Financial Systems|journal=Management Science|volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=236–249|doi=10.1287/mnsc.47.2.236.9835}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their model, no equity could be cross-owned, and debt had to be of one seniority level, only. In 2002, Suzuki published a model in which equity could be cross-owned as well.&lt;ref name="Suzuki (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=T.|title=Valuing Corporate Debt: The Effect of Cross-Holdings of Stock and Debt|journal=Journal of the Operations Research Society of Japan|year=2002|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123–144|url=http://www.orsj.or.jp/~archive/pdf/e_mag/Vol.45_2_123.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His model was developed independently of Eisenberg and Noe's. Elsinger's publication of 2009&lt;ref name="Elsinger (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elsinger|first=H.|title=Financial Networks, Cross Holdings, and Limited Liability|year=2009|journal=Working Paper 156, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Wien|url=http://www.oenb.at/Publikationen/Volkswirtschaft/Working-Papers/2009/Working-Paper-156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first in which debt could be of different seniorities, hence allowing to model, for instance, senior and junior debt, while correctly accounting for the order of priority. His model allowed equity cross-ownership, too. With Fischer (2014), the first model which also allowed derivatives was introduced.&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014a)"/&gt; The fact that Elsinger was unaware of Suzuki's publications, Fischer was unaware of Elsinger's, and the fact that other authors re-discovered parts of Suzuki's and Elsinger's results&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014b)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gouriéroux|first=C.|author2=Héam, J.-C. |author3=Monfort, A. |year=2012|title=Bilateral exposures and systemic solvency risk|journal=Canadian Journal of Economics|volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=1273–1309 (Published online: 09 Nov 2012)|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5982.2012.01750.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gouriéroux|first=C.|author2=Héam, J.-C. |author3=Monfort, A. |year=2013|title=Liquidation equilibrium with seniority and hidden CDO|journal=Journal of Banking &amp; Finance|volume=37|issue=12|pages=5261–5274|doi=10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.04.016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426613001994}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that
the research in this field is still somewhat unconsolidated.

===Risk-neutral valuation: price indeterminacy and open problems===
Generally speaking, risk-neutral pricing in structural models of financial interconnectedness requires unique equilibrium prices at maturity in dependence of the exogenous asset price vector, which can be random.
While financially interconnected systems with debt and equity cross-ownership without derivatives are fairly well understood in the sense that relatively weak conditions on the ownership structures in the form of ownership matrices are required to warrant uniquely determined price equilibria,&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014b)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki (2002)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsinger (2009)"/&gt; the Fischer (2014) model needs very strong conditions on derivatives – which are defined in dependence on any other liability of the considered financial system – to be able to guarantee uniquely determined prices of all system-endogenous liabilities. Furthermore, it is known that there exist examples with no solutions at all, finitely many solutions (more than one), and infinitely many solutions.&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014b)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014a)"/&gt; At present, it is unclear how weak conditions on derivatives can be chosen to still be able to apply risk-neutral pricing in financial networks with systemic risk. It is noteworthy, that the price indeterminacy that evolves from multiple price equilibria is fundamentally different from price indeterminacy that stems from market incompleteness.&lt;ref name="Fischer (2014a)"/&gt;

==Factors==
Factors that are found to support systemic risks&lt;ref name="Factors of Systemic Risk"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuWRmiB3QRMC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=causes+of+systemic+risk#PPA27,M1 |title=Risk management and capital adequacy  |accessdate=2008-09-18 |author=Reto R. Gallati|isbn=9780071425582  |date=2003-03-22  }}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
# Economic implications of models are not well understood. Though each individual model may be made accurate, the facts that (1) all models across the board use the same theoretical basis, and (2) the relationship between financial markets and the economy is not known lead to aggravation of systemic risks.
# Liquidity risks are not accounted for in pricing models used in trading on the financial markets. Since all models are not geared towards this scenario, all participants in an illiquid market using such models will face systemic risks.

==Diversification==
Risks can be reduced in four main ways: avoidance, diversification, hedging and insurance by transferring risk. Systematic risk, also called [[market risk]] or un-diversifiable risk, is a [[risk]] of a [[security (finance)|security]] that cannot be reduced through [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]]. Participants in the market, like [[hedge fund]]s, can be the source of an increase in systemic risk&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/systemic2.pdf Systemic risk and hedge funds]&lt;/ref&gt; and the transfer of risk to them may, paradoxically, increase the exposure to systemic risk.

Until recently, many theoretical models of finance pointed towards the stabilizing effects of a
diversified (i.e., dense) financial system. Nevertheless, 
some recent work has started to
challenge this view, investigating conditions under which diversification may have ambiguous effects on systemic risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/archive/Documents/historicpubs/speeches/2009/speech386.pdf Rethinking the Financial Network]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diversification and Financial Stability"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1878596 |title=Diversification and Financial Stability |author=[[Paolo Tasca]] and Stefano Battiston|date=2011-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within a certain range, financial interconnections serve as a
shock-absorber (i.e., connectivity engenders robustness and risk-sharing prevails). But beyond the tipping
point, interconnections might serve as a shock-amplifier (i.e., connectivity engenders fragility and risk-spreading
prevails).

==Regulation==
One of the main reasons for regulation in the marketplace is to reduce systemic risk.&lt;ref name="CRMPG3" /&gt; However, regulation arbitrage – the transfer of commerce from a regulated sector to a less regulated or unregulated sector – brings markets a full circle and restores systemic risk. For example, the banking sector was brought under regulations in order to reduce systemic risks. Since the banks themselves could not give credit where the risk (and therefore returns) were high, it was primarily the insurance sector which took over such deals. Thus the systemic risk migrated from one sector to another and proves that regulation of only one industry cannot be the sole protection against systemic risks.&lt;ref name="Systemic Risk and Regulation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~allenf/download/Vita/systemicriskrevised.pdf |title=Systemic Risk and Regulation  |accessdate=2008-09-18 |author=Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project risks==
In the fields of [[project management]] and [[cost engineering]], systemic risks include those risks that are not unique to a particular project and are not readily manageable by a project team at a given point in time. These risks may be driven by the nature of a company's project system (e.g., funding projects before the scope is defined), capabilities, or culture. They may also be driven by the level of technology in a project or the complexity of a project's scope or execution strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c4ce.com/AACE_Risk_Hollmann_paper.pdf Systemic Risks in Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systemic risk and insurance ==
In February 2010, international insurance economics think tank, The Geneva Association, published a 110-page analysis of the role of insurers in systemic risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.genevaassociation.org/media/99228/ga2010-systemic_risk_in_insurance.pdf Systemic Risk in Insurance—An analysis of insurance and financial stability (2010) The Geneva Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the report, the differing roles of insurers and banks in the [[global financial system]] and their impact on the crisis are examined (See also CEA report, "Why Insurers Differ from Banks").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cea.eu/uploads/DocumentsLibrary/documents/1277383780_cea-report-insurance-a-unique-sector.pdf CEA (June 2010) Insurance: a unique sector—Why Insurers Differ from Banks]&lt;/ref&gt; A key conclusion of the analysis is that the core activities of insurers and reinsurers do not pose systemic risks due to the specific features of the industry:
* Insurance is funded by up-front premia, giving insurers strong operating cash-flow without the requirement for wholesale funding;
* Insurance policies are generally long-term, with controlled outflows, enabling insurers to act as stabilisers to the financial system;
* During the hard test of the financial crisis, insurers maintained relatively steady capacity, business volumes and prices.

Applying the most commonly cited definition of systemic risk, that of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), to the core activities of insurers and reinsurers, the report concludes that none are systemically relevant for at least one of the following reasons:
* Their limited size means that there would not be disruptive effects on financial markets;
* An insurance insolvency develops slowly and can often be absorbed by, for example, capital raising, or, in a worst case, an orderly wind down;
* The features of the interrelationships of insurance activities mean that contagion risk would be limited.

The report underlines that supervisors and policymakers should focus on activities rather than financial institutions when introducing new regulation and that upcoming insurance regulatory regimes, such as Solvency II in the European Union, already adequately address insurance activities.

However, during the financial crisis, a small number of quasi-banking activities conducted by insurers either caused failure or triggered significant difficulties. The report therefore identifies two activities which, when conducted on a widespread scale without proper risk control frameworks, have the potential for systemic relevance.
* Derivatives trading on non-insurance balance sheets;
* Mis-management of short-term funding from commercial paper or securities lending.

The industry has put forward five recommendations to address these particular activities and strengthen financial stability:
* The implementation of a comprehensive, integrated and principle-based supervision framework for insurance groups, in order to capture, among other things, any non-insurance activities such as excessive derivative activities.
* Strengthening liquidity risk management, particularly to address potential mis-management issues related to short-term funding.
* Enhancement of the regulation of financial guarantee insurance, which has a very different business model than traditional insurance.
* The establishment of macro-prudential monitoring with appropriate insurance representation.
* The strengthening of industry risk management practices to build on the lessons learned by the industry and the sharing experiences with supervisors on a global scale.

Since the publication of The Geneva Association statement, in June 2010, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) issued its position statement on key financial stability issues. A key conclusion of the statement was that, "The insurance sector is susceptible to systemic risks generated in other parts of the financial sector. For most classes of insurance, however, there is little evidence of insurance either generating or amplifying systemic risk, within the financial system itself or in the real economy."&lt;ref&gt;IAIS (June 2010) [http://www.iaisweb.org/__temp/IAIS_Position_Statement_on_Key_Financial_Stability_Issues.pdf International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) position statement on key financial stability issues]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organisations such as the CEA and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI)&lt;ref&gt;PCI (2009) [http://www.pciaa.net/web/sitehome.nsf/lcpublic/392/$file/PCI_Systemic_Risk_Definition.pdf Systemic Risk Defined]&lt;/ref&gt; have issued reports on the same subject.

== Discussion ==
Systemic risk evaluates the likelihood and degree of negative consequences to the larger body.  The term "systemic risk" is frequently used in recent discussions related to the economic crisis, such as the [[Subprime mortgage crisis]].  The systemic risk of a financial institution is the likelihood and the degree that the institution's activities will negatively affect the larger economy such that unusual and extreme federal intervention would be required to ameliorate the effects.  The failing of [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|financial firms in 2008]] caused systemic risk to the larger economy.  Chairman Barney Frank has expressed concerns regarding the vulnerability of highly leveraged financial systems to systemic risk and the US government has debated how to address financial services regulatory reform and systemic risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pciaa.net/Publish/Web/webpress.nsf/lookupwebcontent/F885A1302118898E8625755A007BC48?opendocument Systemic Risk Focus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pciaa.net/Publish/Web/webpress.nsf/lookupwebcontent/BDACACC7FE8E86B28625755A005C8C5?opendocument Addressing Systemic Risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">The '''Thai Zig zag scam''' is a [[confidence trick]] where one is falsely accused of shoplifting, and then held by police, or those claiming to be police, until "bail" is paid for the alleged theft. At times those fleeced are shown faked [[closed-circuit television]] footage as corroboration. In several cases in Thailand, this confidence trick has occurred at the airport, and thus is sometimes called the "Thai airport scam". Most reports of this scam are dated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Duty free shop 'theft' scam a case of recycled news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/aec/30325091 |accessdate=15 October 2018 |work=The Nation |agency=Asia News Network |date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trials in Burma''''' is a memoir by [[Maurice Collis]], an English author of Irish origin who served in [[Burma]] in the [[Indian Civil Service]] under the [[British Empire]] written in 1937 describing events in 1929-30.

After postings at [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], [[Sagaing]] and elsewhere, Collis was district magistrate in [[Rangoon]] in 1929-1930, a period when relations between Burmese, Indians and British became particularly difficult. In ''Trials in Burma'' he gives special attention to the political trial of [[J. M. Sen Gupta]], [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation|mayor]] of [[Calcutta]], for [[sedition]] in impromptu speeches made during a brief visit to Rangoon in 1930; also to two criminal trials which became politically charged because they brought to light underlying attitudes of British merchants and army officers to Burmese people (the same attitudes that were soon to be exposed in a fictional context in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Burmese Days]]''). Collis's judgments were (according to his own analysis) too independent to be pleasing to the then British Government of Burma, arousing the particular disapproval of his superior, [[Booth Gravely]], Commissioner of the [[Bago Division|Pegu Division]]. After giving judgment in the last of these trials Collis was hastily moved to the post of Excise Commissioner.

''Trials in Burma'' was reviewed by [[George Orwell|Orwell]] in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', published 9 March 1938:

:This is an unpretentious book, but it brings out with unusual clearness the dilemma that faces every official in an empire like our own. Mr Collis was District Magistrate of Rangoon in the troubled period round about 1930. He had to try cases which were a great deal in the public eye, and he soon discovered the practical impossibility of keeping to the letter of the law and pleasing European opinion at the same time. Finally, for having sentenced a British Army officer to three months' imprisonment for criminal negligence in driving a car, he was reprimanded and hurriedly transferred to another post. For the same offence a native would have been imprisoned as a matter of course.

:The truth is that every British magistrate in India is in a false position when he has to try a case in which European and native interests clash. In theory he is administering an impartial system of justice; in practice he is part of a huge machine which exists to protect British interests, and he has often got to choose between sacrificing his integrity and damaging his career. Nevertheless, owing to the exceptionally high traditions of the Indian Civil Service, the law in India is administered far more fairly than might be expected -- and, incidentally, far too fairly to please the business community.

A new edition of the book was published in 1945. It contains an introduction written by the author dated 14 May 1945, and commenting on events in Burma since the book was originally published.

The correlation between '''wealth and religion''' has been subject to academic research. [[Wealth]] is the status of being the beneficiary or proprietor of a large accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[economic power]]. [[Religion]] is a [[cultural system]] that often involves belief in [[supernatural]] forces and may intend to provide a moral system or a meaning of life.

The [[GDP]] of countries generally correlates negatively with their religiosity, i.e. the wealthier a population is the more secular it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Survey Reports |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=258 |title=World Publics Welcome Global Trade — But Not Immigration &amp;#124; Pew Global Attitudes Project |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

=== Global ===
According to a study from 2015, [[Christians]] hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by [[Muslims]] (5.0%), [[Hindus]] (3.3%), and [[Jews]] (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification [[Irreligion]] or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/453467/christians-hold-largest-percentage-global.html6 |title=Christians hold largest percentage of global wealth: Report|publisher=deccanherald.com|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by the nonpartisan wealth research firm New World Wealth found that 56.2% of the 13.1 million millionaires in the world were Christians,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/14/the-religion-of-millionaires-.html The religion of millionaires]&lt;/ref&gt; while 6.5% were Muslims, 3.9% were Hindu, and 1.7% were Jewish; 31.7% were identified as adherents of "other" religions or "not religious".

=== United States ===
[[File:Income Ranking by Religious Group - 2000.png|thumb|550px|A chart illustrating income by religious grouping in the US in 2001]]

A study in the [[United States]] (based on data from 1985–1998), conducted by the sociologist Lisa A. Keister and published in the ''[[Social Forces]]'' journal, found that adherents of [[Judaism]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalianism]]{{sfn|Allen|1975}} accumulated the most wealth, believers in [[Catholicism]] and mainline [[Protestants]] were in the middle, while conservative Protestants accumulated the least; in general, people who attend religious services accumulated more wealth than those who do not (taking into account variations of education and other factors).&lt;ref name="ohio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/relgwlth.htm |title=Religion Helps Shape Wealth Of Americans, Study Finds |publisher=Researchnews.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keister suggested that wealth accumulation is shaped by [[family]] processes.{{sfn|Keister|2003}}

In the United States, 48% of [[Hindu]]s have a [[household income]] of $100,000 or more, and 70% make at least $75,000, which is the highest among all religions in United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/hinds_most_educated_highest_earning_religion/1449355.html|title=Hindu-Americans Rank Top in Education, Income|accessdate=Dec 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The median [[net worth]] of people believing in [[Judaism]] is calculated at 150,890 [[USD]], while the median net worth of conservative [[Protestants]] (including [[Baptists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Christian Scientists]]) was 26,200 USD. The overall median in the dataset was 48,200 USD.&lt;ref name="ohio"/&gt;

According to a 2014 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], Jewish ranked as the most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 44% of Jewish living in households with incomes of at least $100,000, followed by [[Hindu]] (36%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (35%), and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (32%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/11/how-income-varies-among-u-s-religious-groups/|title=How income varies among U.S. religious groups|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst Jews, in 2016, [[Modern Orthodox Jews]] had a median household income of $158,000, while [[Open Orthodoxy]] Jews had a median household income of $185,000 (compared to the American median household income of $59,000 in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/5-key-takeaways-some-surprising-from-new-survey-of-us-modern-orthodox-jews 5 key takeaways, some surprising, from new survey of US Modern Orthodox Jews] By BEN SALES
30 September 2017, JTA&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the same study there is correlation between education and income, about 77% of American Hindus have an [[Academic degree|undergraduate]] degree, followed by Jews (59%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (56%), and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (47%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
A study published in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' by Lisa Keister, found that "religion affects wealth indirectly through educational attainment, fertility, and female labor force participation" but also found some evidence of direct effects of religion on wealth attainment.{{sfn|Keister|2008}} Keister notes that certain religious beliefs ("one should have many children", "women should not work") lower wealth accumulation, both on the micro- and macro-scale.{{sfn|Keister|2008}}&lt;ref name="Keister2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Keister |first=Lisa A. |date=2 November 2011 |title=How Religion Contributes to Wealth and Poverty |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-a-keister/religion-contributes-wealth-poverty_b_1069766.html |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"What happens on tour, stays on tour"''' is a notorious [[Phrase|phrase or saying]] agreed to by men who get together and travel either interstate or overseas for sporting tours. In essence, the phrase means that all exploits during the tour must be kept strictly confidential, never to be discussed with anyone outside the group.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Keith (2005, p. 70). [https://books.google.com/books?id=nmCBAAAAMAAJ&amp;q Sexuality, sport and the culture of risk]. Published by Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport. {{OCLC|249643487}}. {{ISBN|978-1-84126-160-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, the phrase has also been applied to men attending music gigs, going on business trips and fishing holidays. The term is commonly used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and the United States and is also known as '''"what goes on tour stays on tour"''',&lt;ref name=Syed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/opinion/196755 What goes on tour no longer always stay on tour] (2009).

[http://www.osan.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123122187 Diamond Talk: What happens at Osan doesn’t stay at Osan] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The phrase has been described by Samantha Brett, a writer for ''[[The Age]]'', as an "unspoken male pact that for centuries can never be broken".&lt;ref name=Age/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=August 2009}} In essence, if you were there you may discuss the events, but if you were not there, you get nothing. In contrast, ''[[For Dummies|Rugby for Dummies]]'' describes the phrase as meaning that particularly funny, embarrassing, or debauched moments are for consumption only by the tourists themselves and not casual listeners back home.&lt;ref name=Dummies/&gt;

It is believed that the phrase originated in 1970 during an overseas [[rugby union]] trip, and quickly cascaded into many other sporting codes such as [[cricket]] and football.&lt;ref name=Syed&gt;Syed, Matthew (26 June 2008). [http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/relationships/article4213032.ece Why does what happens on tour stay on tour?]. [[The Times|Times Online]]. Retrieved on 19 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has subsequently evolved into a "[[Honor code|code of honour]]" amongst those males participating in the trip or tour. Many groups or teams travelling interstate or overseas have adopted the phrase, that mainly relates to [[Cruising for sex|sexual conquests]] and [[binge drinking]]. However, the phrase can also relate to other forms of unacceptable behaviour and [[etiquette]].&lt;ref name=Syed/&gt;

It has been stated that there are two rules embedded in the code. Firstly, it must be a group of males in team environment, travelling away from home, where they are unconstrained from the usual forms of acceptable behaviour.&lt;ref name=Syed/&gt; The second rule is that all exploits must be kept strictly confidential, never to be discussed with anyone outside the group, particularly wives and girlfriends (also known as WAGs).&lt;ref name=Age&gt;Brett, Samantha (2006).

The phrase however, is not restricted to males. Australian [[Hockeyroos|Hockeyroo]] player [[Sarah Taylor (field hockey)|Sarah Taylor]] when asked what her most memorable thing to ever happen whilst away on tour responded, "What goes on tour stays on tour".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hockey.org.au/Default.aspx?tabid=313 Sarah YOUNG (née Taylor)] (2006). Hockey Australia. Retrieved on 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Coogan, a writer for the ''[[Evening Herald]]'' in Ireland, stated that the code of honour also applied to women as much as men.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Anna (17 July 2008).

==="What happens on the road..."===
In the United States, the term has close connotations among touring musicians and their road crews and is expressed as "what happens on the road, stays on the road".&lt;ref&gt;Trewin, Simon and Moran, Michael (2006, p. 268).

Published by John Murray. {{OCLC|70765020}}. {{ISBN|978-0-7195-6138-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; American singer [[Mike Doughty]] listed the concept as number four of his "Rules of the Road", and the reason he wasn't going to tell stories of debauchery, drug abuse, and sexual exploits.&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;Kaufman, Gil.

Retrieved on 24 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the professional gigger should never "destroy the trust" of coworkers by telling tales of their "crazy and out-of-character" activities. Wilkins emphasized that it was easy to ruin not only another's career but one's own, when the trust of gigging companions disappears.&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt;

==="What happens in Vegas..."===
American heavy-metal musician [[Tommy Lee]] wrote in 2005 that the phrase "what happens on the road stays on the road" was "an old saying that's been said many ways" and he expressed his view that its origin lay in rock concert touring by writing "[[Las Vegas]] stole that shit from us...".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tommy Lee|Lee, Tommy]]; Anthony Bozza.

Retrieved on 24 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was referring to the catch phrase "[[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority#"What happens here, stays here"|what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas]]", which was in common circulation before [[Billy Crystal]] used it to close the [[76th Academy Awards]] show in 2004 and was spoken variously by people such as [[Laura Bush]] and [[Ben Affleck]] on television broadcasts.&lt;ref name=usatoday2005&gt;''USA Today'', Advertising &amp; Marketing.

'''Women in Portugal''' received full legal equality with Portuguese men as mandated by Portugal's constitution of 1976, which in turn resulted from the [[Carnation Revolution|Revolution of 1974]]. Because of this, Portuguese women received the right to vote and full equality in marriage. By the early part of the 1990s, many women of [[Portugal]] became professionals, including being medical doctors and lawyers, a leap from many being merely office employees and factory workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portugal-Women (data as of 1993)|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/portugal/portugal-women.html|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Estado Novo regime (1932 - 1974)==
During the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], a [[conservative]] authoritarian political regime which was in place in Portugal from 1932 to 1974, women's rights were restricted. The Concordat of 1940 between the government and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] meant that women's role was legally and socially subservient to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/portugal/50.htm|title=Portugal - Women|work=countrystudies.us|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
As a country where the predominant religion is Roman Catholicism, Portugal has traditionally been conservative with regards to family life. Divorce was legalized in 1975. [[Adultery]] was decriminalized in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.pt/destaque/jornal/aborto-nao-deve-ser-uma-prioridade-da-investigacao-criminal-209113|title="Aborto não deve ser uma prioridade da investigação criminal"|work=publico.pt|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce laws were overhauled in October 2008, when a new divorce law liberalized the process (see [[Divorce_law_by_country#Portugal]]).
In the 21st century, family dynamics have become more liberal, with [[cohabitation]] growing in popularity, and the link between fertility and [[marriage]] decreasing. In 2017, 54.9% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pordata.pt/en/Portugal/Live%20births%20outside%20of%20marriage%20%20with%20parents%20co%20habiting%20or%20not%20(percentage)-620|title=PORDATA - Live births outside of marriage, with parents co-habiting or not (%) in Portugal|work=pordata.pt|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like most Western countries, Portugal has to deal with low fertility levels: the country has experienced a [[sub-replacement fertility rate]] since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cefage.uevora.pt/en/producao_cientifica/projectos/projectos_financiados_por_instituicoes_nacionais_de_apoio_a_investigacao/fertility_in_portugal_a_macro_micro_economic_perspective|title=Fertility in Portugal: a Macro/Micro Economic Perspective / Projects funded by national science agencies / Projects / Research output / Welcome - CEFAGE|website=Uevora.pt|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[age at first marriage]] in 2012 was 29.9 years for women and 31.4 years for men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/Dialog/Saveshow.asp?lang=1 ]{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohabitants have rights under laws dealing with [[De facto union in Portugal|''de facto'' unions in Portugal]].

==Abortion==
{{Main|Abortion in Portugal}}
Abortion laws in Portugal were liberalized on April 10, 2007, after the [[Portuguese abortion referendum, 2007]]. Abortion can be performed on-demand during the first ten weeks of pregnancy, and at later stages only for specific reasons (rape, risk of birth defects, risk to woman's health). However, obtaining a legal abortion is often difficult in practice, because many doctors refuse to perform abortions (which they are allowed to do under a conscientious objection clause) as Portugal remains a country where the Catholic tradition has a significant influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/episode-segments/2011-08-10/here-there-portugal-abortion-legal-many-doctors-refuse-perform-them-9005|title=In Portugal, abortion legal but many doctors refuse to perform them|work=wbez.org|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
The maternal [[mortality rate]] in Portugal is  8.00 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010). This is low by global standards, but is still higher than many other Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal's [[HIV/AIDS]] rate is, at 0.6% of adults (aged 15-49), one of the highest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, immigrants in Portugal are entitled to free health care, including free care during [[pregnancy]] and [[postnatal period]], as well as use of [[family planning]] facilities, regardless of their legal immigration status - this policy is deemed important because HIV/AIDS is prevalent among some immigrant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/26444.pdf |format=PDF |title=HIV/AIDS Among Immigrants in Portugal: Socio-Demographic and Behavioural Correlates of Preventive Practices |website=Cdn.intechoppen.com |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Education==
The [[literacy rate]] is still lower for women compared to men: the literacy rate is 94% for females  (aged 15 or older, data from 2011), while for males it is  97%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
==Domestic violence==
[[Domestic violence]] is illegal in Portugal. It is specifically addressed by Article 152 of the Criminal Code of Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ministry of Justice | author-link = Ministry of Justice (Portugal) | title = “''Breaking the silence – united against domestic violence''”: 29th Council of Europe Conference of Ministers of Justice - Report from Portugal | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170223160914/https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680694552 | archive-date = 23 February 2017 | url = https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680694552 | publisher = Direção-Geral da Política de Justiça | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article, which has been amended several times throughout the years, reads: "Whoever, whether in a repetitive manner or not, inflicts physical or mental maltreatment, including bodily punishments, deprivation of liberty and sexual abuses: a) On the spouse or ex-spouse; b) On a person of the same or another gender with whom the offender maintains or has maintained a union, even if without cohabitation; c) On a progenitor of a common descendant in first degree; or d) On a particularly helpless person  by reason of age, disability, disease, pregnancy or economic dependency, who cohabitates with the offender; shall be punished (...)".&lt;ref&gt; Article 152 reads in Portuguese: Artigo 152.º Violência doméstica 1 — Quem, de modo reiterado ou não, infligir maus tratos físicos ou psíquicos, incluindo castigos corporais, privações da liberdade e ofensas sexuais: a) Ao cônjuge ou ex -cônjuge; b) A pessoa de outro ou do mesmo sexo com quem o agente mantenha ou tenha mantido uma relação análoga à dos cônjuges, ainda que sem coabitação; c) A progenitor de descendente comum em 1.º grau; ou d) A pessoa particularmente indefesa, em razão de idade, deficiência, doença, gravidez ou dependência económica, que com ele coabite; é punido (...) [https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/2007/09/17000/0618106258.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Portugal has also ratified the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Liste complète|work=coe.int|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate data on [[violence against women]] is difficult to obtain, but according to a study published in 2008, 38% of women have experienced physical, psychological and/or sexual violence since the age of 18. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wave-network.org/sites/default/files/05%20PORTUGAL%20END%20VERSION.pdf|title=WAVE Network|work=wave-network.org|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in politics==
Traditionally, in Portugal, as in other countries, politics was considered the domain of men. However, in recent years more women have been involved. As of 2014, there were 31.3% women in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm|title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification|work=ipu.org|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''World Wide Views on Global Warming''''': A global project initiated by [[The Danish Board of Technology]] on the occasion of the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) held in [[Copenhagen]] December 2009.

World Wide Views on Global Warming (or just WWViews) was an international citizens involvement project based on methods developed by The Danish Board of Technology for the purpose of involving citizens in the political decision-making processes.

== The WWViews Method ==

The World Wide Views project meetings were carried through on September 26, 2009 simultaneously in all the participating countries and on this day the citizens debated the same topics issued at the actual December [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]. On the basis of an informed and structured dialogue and expert presentations the citizens – 100 in each country – made up their minds about a range of questions and dilemmas concerning different aspects of the climate debate. The results were uploaded throughout the day and are publicly available on the projects website (se link below). Some answers are quantifiable, permitting statistical comparison, but contrary to regular surveys the methods used for WWViews also gave the participants the option of discussing questions externally and further qualifying the answers.

World Wide Views on Global Warming gave citizens across the globe the possibility of influencing political decisions in regard to [[Earth]]’s climate, because the meetings presented citizens with the opportunity to express how far they were willing to let politicians go in the struggle to reduce [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emission.

== The WWViews Partners ==

More than 4000 citizens, representing 38 countries across the world joined the World Wide Views on Global Warming.

== WWViews on Biodiversity==
Leading up to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on [[biodiversity]] in India 2012, 34 citizen meetings in 25 countries across the world was held on September 15, 2012, involving 42 old and new partners and building on the experiences from the World Wide View on Global Warming as part of the newest World Wide Views project, World Wide Views on Biodiversity.

The population in the mid-1990s was estimated at 190,000, of whom 90% were Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;James S.
