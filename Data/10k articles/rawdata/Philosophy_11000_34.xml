== Life ==
Very little is known about his life. His Arabic name ([[Nisba (onomastics)|Nisba]]) indicates that he lived in Kalabadh (a district of Bukhara) and was probably of Persian ancestry. Depending on the source, he died in 990, 994 or 995. His grave in Bukhara still receives many visitors.

Kalabadhi studied Sufism under Abu al-Husayn al-Farisi and [[Fiqh]] under Muhammad ibn Fadl.

== Works ==
Of his six or seven works, two in Arabic survive:
*''Bahr al-fawa´id fi ma´ani al-akhar''. Short moral commentaries on 222 of the [[Hadith]].
*''Kitab at-ta'arruf'' (the English translation by  [[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]] is called ''The Doctrine of the Sufis''.)

Al-Kalabadhi's fame rests on the ''Kitab at-ta'arruf''. The work itself consists of 75 relatively short chapters, but several long commentaries have been appended. The work was written primarily for two purposes: to advocate the Sahu ("sober") school of Sufi thought and to assure adherents of orthodox Islam that Sufism does not contradict their beliefs. The second point was of special importance, as Sufism was in danger of being declared a [[Bid‘ah|heresy]].

Not long before, in 922, the famous Sufi [[al-Hallaj]] had been publicly executed on allegations of heresy. This must have had a significant effect on al-Kalabadhi. He quotes al-Hallaj frequently in his works, but never by name. He is simply referred to as "one of the great Sufis".

The book is still understandable for modern readers and preserves many important quotes from the first three hundred years of Islam.

{{Rabbinical Literature}}

'''Aggadah''' ([[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] אַגָּדְתָא‎ "tales, lore"; pl. ''aggadot'', Ashkenazi pronunciation ''aggados'') refers to non-legalistic [[pardes (Jewish exegesis)|exegetical texts]] in the classical [[rabbinic literature]] of [[Judaism]], particularly as recorded in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]. In general, Aggadah is a compendium of rabbinic texts that incorporates folklore, historical anecdotes, moral exhortations, and practical advice in various spheres, from business to medicine.

In terms of [[etymology]], the [[cognate]] {{lang-he-n|הַגָּדָה}} means "telling", while the Aramaic [[Semitic root|root]] אגד (as well as נגד, from which אגדה may arise) has the dual implication of “expanding” / “drawing out” and “binding” / “drawing in”.&lt;ref&gt;See corresponding entries in [[Marcus Jastrow]]: [http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/jastrow/ ''A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419223729/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/jastrow/ |date=2009-04-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, the Aggadah may be seen as those teachings which communicate Rabbinic traditions to the reader, simultaneously expanding their understanding of the text, while strengthening their religious experience and spiritual connection.&lt;ref&gt;See Rabbi Moshe Weissman, ''The Midrash Says'' (Benei Yakov Publications, 1980), introduction to Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The root also has the meaning "flow",&lt;ref&gt;See [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] [http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t3407.htm 7:10] and [[Rashi]] ''ad loc'' ([http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%96_%D7%99 Hebrew orig.], [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16490/showrashi/true English transl.]).&lt;/ref&gt; and here relates to the transmission of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;See Rabbi Nathan Cardozo, ''The Infinite Chain: Torah, Masorah, and Man'', ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As part of the Jewish oral law==
The Aggadah is part of [[Judaism]]'s [[Oral Torah|Oral law]] ({{hebrew|תורה שבעל פה}})—the traditions providing the authoritative interpretation of the [[Written Law]]. In this context, the widely held view in [[rabbinic literature]] is that the aggadah is in fact a medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings—{{hebrew|מאמרים לימודיים}}) or for explanations of verses in the [[Tanakh]] ([[Exegesis|Exegetic]] Sayings—{{hebrew|מאמרים ביאוריים}}). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: "We are told to use our common sense to decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not" (Carmell, 2005).

===Literal-allegorical teachings===
Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the ''Ramchal'', discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known ''Discourse on the Haggadot''. He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component ({{hebrew|חלק המצוות}}), discussing the [[mitzvah|mitzvot]] and [[Jewish law|halakha]]; and "the secret" component ({{hebrew|חלק הסודות}}), discussing the deeper teachings. The aggadah, along with the [[Kabbalah]], falls under the latter. The rabbis of the [[Mishnah]]ic era believed that it would be dangerous to record the deeper teachings in explicit, mishnah-like, medium. Rather, they would be conveyed in a "concealed mode" and via "paradoxes". (Due to their value, these teachings should not become accessible to those "of bad character" and due to their depth they should not be made available to those "not schooled in the ways of analysis".) This mode of the transmission was nevertheless based on consistent rules and principles such that those "equipped with the keys" would be able to unlock their meaning; to others they would appear as non-rational or fantastic.

===Interpretation of the Aggadah===
In line with the above, [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], in his "Introduction to the Talmud", states that "Aggadah comprises any comment occurring in the Talmud on any topic which is not a [[mitzvah|commandment]] (i.e. which is not [[halakha|halachic]]) and one should derive from it only that which is reasonable." As regards this, [[Maimonides]], in his preface to the eleventh chapter of [[Mishnah|Tractate]] [[Sanhedrin]] (''Perek Chelek''), describes three possible approaches to the interpretation of the Aggadah.&lt;ref&gt;Summary per [http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/vayechi/elkayam.html discussion] by Dr. Avraham Elkayam, Department of Philosophy, [[Bar Ilan University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first approach is to accept the Aggadah as literally true, without admission of any hidden, allegorical explanation—even where a literal interpretation runs counter to common sense. Maimonides is dismissive of this approach.
* The second approach is to assume that anything said by the Sages was intended literally, and to therefore reject, as impossible, non-rational or fantastic teachings (and to consequently consider the Sages as "simpletons and ignoramuses"). Maimonides does not entirely reject rationalist interpretation, but he opposes an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] approach which denies the Aggadah a hidden rationality. "The sages presented their ''drashot'' in a style by which the mind of a fool will reject them because of his way of thinking; it is improper to assign any deficiency to the ''drash''—one may rather suspect that the deficiency is a result of his intellectual shortcomings" (''Commentary on the Mishnah'': Introduction).
* The third approach is to recognise that many Aggadot are intended to teach profound truths, and that the teachings thus operate on two levels: "overt" and "hidden". Thus any impossible assertion was, in fact, intended as a parable; further, where aggadot can be understood literally, they may be taken on this level. This is, in general, the view of the Rabbis. "It is proper…to carefully analyse [the aggadot]…when any of these seem far-fetched we must immerse ourselves in the various branches of knowledge until we understand the concepts." (Maimonides, [[op cit]].)

Note that Maimonides' approach is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, [[kabbalah|mystical]] streams of Judaism—thus, for example, Rabbi [[Isaiah Horowitz]], the ''Shlah HaKodosh'' holds that "none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; if anyone is devoid of understanding, it is the reader" (''Shnei Luchos HaBris'', introduction).

===In the Talmud and Midrash===
The aggadah is today recorded in the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]].

In the Midrash, the aggadic and halakhic material are compiled as two distinct collections: 1) The Aggadic Midrashim, generally, are explanatory aggada, deriving the "sermonic implications" from the biblical text; and 2) the [[Midrash halakha|Halakhic Midrashim]] derive the laws from the text. Many of the [[meforshim|Torah commentaries]], and the [[Targum]]im, interpret the Torah text in the light of Aggadic statements, particularly those in the Midrash, and hence contain much material on Aggadah interpretation.

Throughout the Talmud, aggadic and halakhic material are interwoven—legal material comprises around 90%. (Tractate [[Avoth]], which has no [[gemara]], deals exclusively with non-halakhic material, though it is not regarded as aggadic in that it is focused, largely, on character development.) The Talmudic aggada, generally, convey the "deeper teachings"—though in concealed mode, as discussed. The aggadic material in the Babylonian Talmud is also presented separately in ''[[Ein Yaakov]]'', a compilation of the Aggadah together with commentaries.

Well-known works interpreting the Aggadot in the Talmud include:

* ''Chiddushei Aggados'' (Novellae on the Aggadot) by [[Samuel Edels]] "the Maharsha."
* ''Chiddushei Aggados'' (Novellae on the Aggadot) by [[Judah Loew]] "the Maharal" (as well as many other works by Loew, esp. ''Be'er ha-Golah'').
* ''Yehoyada'' and ''MeKabtziel'' (names based on [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 23:20) by [[Yosef Hayyim]] "the Ben Ish Chai."
* ''Beur Aggados'' (Clarification of the Aggadot) and ''Perush al Kamma Aggadot'' (Commentary on several Aggadot) by the [[Vilna Gaon]].
* ''Ayin Ayah'' Commentary on [[Ein Yaakov]] by [[Rav Kook]]
* ''En Jacob ([[Ein Yaakov]])'' Agada of the Babylonian Talmud by Rabbi [[Jacob ibn Habib]], Revised and Translated into English by Rabbi S. H. (Zvi Hirsch) Glick, Copyright 1916.

==Development==
{{hatnote|The [[Midrash]]im are mostly derived from, and based upon, the teachings of the [[Tannaim]].}}
{{Rabbinical eras timeline|150|1200|Dates_of_the_Aggadic_Compositions}}
The Aggadah has been preserved in a series of different works, which, like all works of traditional literature, have come to their present form through previous collections and revisions. Their original forms existed long before they were reduced to writing.

The first traces of the midrashic exegesis are found in the Bible itself; while in the time of the [[Sofer]]im the development of the Midrash Aggadah received a mighty impetus, and the foundations were laid for public services which were soon to offer the chief medium for the cultivation of Bible exegesis.

Much Aggadah, often mixed with foreign elements, is found in the [[Apocrypha]], the [[Pseudepigrapha]], the works of [[Josephus]] and [[Philo]], and the remaining Judæo-Hellenistic literature; but aggadic exegesis reached its highest development in the great epoch of the Mishnaic-Talmudic period, between 100 and 550 CE.

The Aggadah of the Amoraim (sages of the Talmud) is the continuation of that of the Tannaim (sages of the Mishna). The final edition of the Mishnah, which was of such signal importance for the Halakah, is of less significance for the Aggadah, which, in form as well as in content, shows the same characteristics in both periods.

===Exegetic and homiletic Aggadah===
It is important to emphasize the fundamental difference in plan between the midrashim forming a running commentary (מאמרים ביאוריים) to the Scripture text, and the homiletic midrashim (מאמרים לימודיים). When the scholars undertook to edit, revise, and collect into individual midrashim the immense array of haggadot, they followed the method employed in the collections and revisions of the halakhot and the halakhic discussions.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The form which suggested itself was to arrange in textual sequence the exegetical interpretations of the Biblical text as taught in the schools, or the occasional interpretations introduced into public discourses, etc., and which were in any way connected with Scripture. Since the work of the editor was often merely that of compilation, the existing midrashim show in many passages the character of the sources from which they were taken. This was the genesis of the midrashim which are in the nature of running haggadic commentaries to single books of the Bible, as Bereshit Rabbah, Eikah Rabbati, the midrashim to the other Megillot, etc. See [[Midrash]] for more details.

==Modern compilations==
The ''[[Ein Yaakov]]'' is a compilation of the aggadic material in the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] together with commentary. It was compiled by [[Jacob ibn Habib]] and (after his death) by his son Rabbi [[Levi ibn Habib]], and was first published in [[Saloniki]] (Greece) in 1515. It was intended as a text of aggadah, that could be studied with "the same degree of seriousness as the Talmud itself".&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Lehman (1999). The Ein ya'aqov: A Collection of Aggadah in Transition. ''[[Prooftexts (journal)|Prooftexts]]'', Vol. 19, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mainstream|Popularized]] [[anthology|anthologies]] did not appear until more recently—these often incorporate "aggadot" from outside of classical [[Rabbinic literature]]. The major works include:

*''Sefer Ha-Aggadah'' (''The Book of Legends'') is a classic compilation of aggadah from the [[Mishnah]], the two Talmuds and the [[Midrash]] literature. It was edited by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Yehoshua Hana Ravnitzky]]. Bialik and Ravnitzky worked for three years to compile a comprehensive and representative overview of aggadah. When they found the same aggadah in multiple versions, from multiple sources, they usually selected the later form, the one found in the Babylonian Talmud. However, they also presented some aggadot sequentially, giving the early form from the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], and later versions from the Babylonian Talmud, and from a classic midrash compilation. In each case every aggadah is given with its original source. In their original edition, they translated the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] aggadot into modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Sefer Ha-Aggadah was first published in 1908-11 in [[Odessa]], Russia, then reprinted numerous times in [[Israel]]. In 1992 it was translated into English as ''The Book of Legends'', by William G. Braude.
*''Legends of the Jews'', by Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], is an original synthesis of a vast amount of aggadah from the Mishnah, the two Talmuds and Midrash. Ginzberg had an encyclopedic knowledge of all rabbinic literature, and his masterwork included a massive array of aggadot. However he did not create an anthology which showed these aggadot distinctly. Rather, he paraphrased them and rewrote them into one continuous narrative that covered five volumes, followed by two volumes of footnotes that give specific sources.
*''Mimekor Yisrael'', by [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]]. Berdichevsky was interested in compiling the folklore and legends of the [[Jew]]ish people, from the earliest times up until the dawn of the modern era. His collection included a large array of aggadot, although they were limited to those he considered within the domain of folklore.
* The collected works of Dov Noy.&lt;ref&gt;According to Peninnah Schram, "Dov Noy is the fourth major figure in the renaissance of preserving and perpetuating the Jewish oral tradition. While he has published many books and important essays (including the entry "Folklore" in The [[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]), his two main contributions are: 1) he applied an international classification system to Jewish traditional narrative; and 2) he established the Israel Folktale Archives"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Noy established the [http://www.folklore.org.il/asai.html Israel Folktale Archives and Ethnological Museum] at the [[University of Haifa]], an archive containing over 23,000 folktales collected from all the [[Jewish ethnic divisions|various ethnic communities]] who live in [[Israel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="924">The '''Bagnolians''' were a [[sect]] in the 8th century, deemed [[heresy|heretical]], who rejected the Old Testament and part of the New Testament. They held the world to be [[eternity|eternal]], and affirmed that God did not create the soul, when he infused it into the body. They derived their name from Bagnols,&lt;ref&gt;There are several places in France called [[Bagnols (disambiguation)|Bagnols]]. All are in or close to the Languedoc. It may be impossible to determine the Bagnolians' place of origin with any certainty.&lt;/ref&gt; a city in [[Languedoc]], France. Their doctrine generally agreed with that of the [[Manicheans]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4999">{{Mongolian shamanism}}
'''Black shamanism''' is a kind of [[shamanism]] practiced in [[Mongolia]], [[Siberia]] and [[Romania]]. It is specifically opposed to [[yellow shamanism]], which incorporates rituals and traditions from [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pegg|2001|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shimamura&gt;{{harvnb|Shimamura|2004|pp=649–650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism entered Mongolia in the sixteenth century after the conversion of [[Altan Khan]]. In 1691, after [[Outer Mongolia]] had been annexed by the [[Qing Dynasty]], Buddhism became the dominant religion of the entire area and shamanism began incorporating Buddhist elements. Violent resistance in the eighteenth century by the hunting tribes of Northern Mongolia against the (Buddhist) ruling group, the [[Khalka Mongols]], led to the foundation of black shamanism.&lt;ref name=shimamura/&gt;

==Spirit world and class==
Klaus Hesse described the complex spiritual hierarchy in clan-based Mongolian society based on sources that go back to the 13th century. The highest group in the pantheon consisted of 99 ''[[tngri]]'' (55 of them benevolent or "white" and 44 terrifying or "black"), 77 ''natigai'' or "earth-mothers", besides others. The ''tngri'' were called upon only by leaders and great shamans and were common to all the clans. After these, three groups of ancestral spirits dominated. The "Lord-Spirits" were the souls of clan leaders to whom any member of a clan could appeal for physical or spiritual help. The "Protector-Spirits" included the souls of great shamans (''ĵigari'') and shamanesses (''abĵiya''). The "Guardian-Spirits" were made up of the souls of smaller shamans (''böge'') and shamanesses (''idugan'') and were associated with a specific locality (including mountains, rivers, etc.) in the clan's territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hesse|1987|p=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between great, white and small, black (in shamans, ''tngri'', etc.) was also formative in a class division of three further groups of spirits, made up of "spirits who were not introduced by shamanist rites into the communion of ancestral spirits" but who could nonetheless be called upon for help—they were called "'the three accepting the supplications' (''jalbaril-un gurban'')". The whites were of the nobles of the clan, the blacks of the commoners, and a third category consisted of "the evil spirits of the slaves and non-human goblins". White shamans could only venerate white spirits (and if they called upon black spirits they "lost their right in venerating and calling the white spirits"), black shamans only black spirits (and would be too terrified to call upon white spirits since the black spirits would punish them). Black or white was assigned to spirits according to social status, and to shamans "according to the capacity and assignment of their ancestral spirit or spirit of the shaman's descent line."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hesse|1987|pp=405–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black shamanism in Mongolia==
According to Otgony Purev, the practice goes back to [[Genghis Khan]] and was practiced by the [[Darkhad]] people in defiance of the Buddhism introduced to the area by the [[Khalka Mongols|Khalka]].&lt;ref name=shimamura/&gt; During the Soviet domination of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], all varieties of shamanism were repressed; after 1991, when the era of Soviet influence was over, religion (including Buddhism and shamanism) made a comeback.&lt;ref name=shimamura/&gt;

The '''brahmavihāras''' (sublime attitudes, lit. "abodes of brahma") are a series of four [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] virtues and the meditation practices made to cultivate them. They are also known as the '''four immeasurables''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''apramāṇa'', [[Pali|Pāli]]: ''appamaññā'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistethics.org/9/wetle021.html Jon Wetlesen, Did Santideva Destroy the Bodhisattva Path?

''Abhidhammattha Sangaha: A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma''. BPS Pariyatti Editions, 2000, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahma-viharas'' are: 
# [[metta|loving-kindness or benevolence]] (metta)
# [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (karuna)
# [[Mudita|empathetic joy]] (mudita)
# [[Upekkha|equanimity]] (upekkha)

According to the ''[[Metta Sutta]]'', cultivation of the four immeasurables has the power to cause the practitioner to be reborn into a "[[Brahmā (Buddhism)|Brahmā]] realm" (Pāli: ''Brahmaloka'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html AN 4.125, ''Metta Sutta'']. See note 2 on the different kinds of Brahmas mentioned.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Brahma-viharas'', along with meditative tradition associated with ''Brahma-vihara'', are also found in pre-Buddha and post-Buddha [[Vedic]] and [[Sramanism|Sramanic]] literature.

* {{lang-sa|चत्वारि ब्रह्मविहाराः}} ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''{{IAST|catvāri brahmavihārāḥ}}'')

''Brahmavihāra'' may be [[parsing|parsed]] as "Brahmā" and "[[vihara|vihāra]]"; which is often rendered into English as "sublime" or "divine abodes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.208.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Apramāṇa'', usually translated as "the immeasurables," means "boundlessness, infinitude, a state that is illimitable".&lt;ref name=PaliDic&gt;[[Thomas William Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] &amp; Stede, 1921-25, ''Pali-English Dictionary'', [[Pali Text Society]].&lt;/ref&gt; When developed to a high degree in meditation, these attitudes are said to make the mind "immeasurable" and like the mind of the loving ''Brahmā'' (gods).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, "An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics."

===Early Buddhism===
The ''Brahma-vihara'' are a pre-Buddhist concept, to which the Buddhist tradition gave its own interpretation.&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google247"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZCvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247|year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-4726-4 |page=247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' asserts the Buddha to be calling the Brahmavihara as "that practice", and he then contrasts it with "my practice" as follows:&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;
{{quote|...that practice [namely, the mere cultivation of love and so forth, according to the fourfold instructions] is conducive not to turning away, nor to dispassion, nor to quieting, nor to cessation, nor to direct knowledge, nor to enlightenment, nor to nirvana, but only to rebirth in the world of Brahma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...my practice is conducive to complete turning away, dispassion, cessation, quieting, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and nirvana – specifically the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold noble path]] (...)
|The Buddha, Digha Nikaya II.251|Translated by Harvey B. Aronson&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey B. Aronson |title=Love and Sympathy in Theravāda Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYn7WsDccU0C&amp;pg=PA71 |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1403-5 |page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Gombrich, the Buddhist usage of the ''brahma-vihāra'' originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to "living with Brahman" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as "living with Brahman" by rebirth in the Brahma-world.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=84-85}} According to Gombrich, "the Buddha taught that kindness - what Christians tend to call love - was a way to salvation.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=62}}

In the ''Tevijja Sutta'', [[Buddhism and Hinduism#Vedas|The Threefold Knowledge]] of the ''Digha Nikaya'' set of scriptures, Buddha Shākyamuni is asked the way to fellowship/companionship/communion with Brahma. He replies that he personally knows the world of Brahma and the way to it, and explains the meditative method for reaching it by using an [[analogy]] of the resonance of the [[conch shell]] of the ''[[Ashtamangala|aṣṭamaṅgala]]'':
{{quote|A monk suffuses the world in the four directions with a mind of benevolence, then above, and below, and all around – the whole world from all sides, completely, with a benevolent, all-embracing, great, boundless, peaceful and friendly mind … Just as a powerful conch-blower makes himself heard with no great effort in all four [cardinal] directions, so too is there no limit to the unfolding of [this] heart-liberating benevolence. This is a way to communion with Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;''Majjhimanikaya'', tr. by Kurt Schmidt, Kristkeitz, Berlin, 1978, p.261, tr. by Tony Page.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Buddha then says that the monk must follow this up with an equal suffusion of the entire world with mental projections of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity (regarding all beings with an eye of equality).

In the two ''Metta Suttas'' of the ''[[Anguttara Nikaya|Aṅguttara Nikāya]],''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html AN 4.125], [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.126.than.html AN 4.126]&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha states that those who practice radiating the four immeasurables in this life and die "without losing it" are destined for rebirth in a heavenly realm in their next life.  In addition, if such a person is a Buddhist disciple (Pāli: ''[[sravaka|sāvaka]]'') and thus realizes the [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]] of the [[Skandha|five aggregates]], then after his heavenly life, this disciple will reach ''[[nirvana|nibbāna]]''.  Even if one is not a disciple, one will still attain the heavenly life, after which, however depending on what his past deeds may have been, one may be reborn in a hell realm, or as an animal or [[Preta|hungry ghost]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.nymo.html  AN 4.125: ''Metta Sutta: Loving-kindness'', Ñanamoli's translation] (accessed March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In another sutta in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the laywoman Sāmāvatī is mentioned as an example of someone who excels at loving-kindness.{{sfn|Bodhi|2012|p=112}} In the Buddhist tradition she is often referred to as such, often citing an account that an arrow shot at her was warded off through her spiritual power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sāmāvatī|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|date= |year=1938 |publisher=Pali Text Society |location=Wilts|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Visuddhimagga''===
The four immeasurables are explained in [[Visuddhimagga|''The Path of Purification'']] (''Visuddhimagga''), written in the fifth century CE by the scholar and commentator [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]].  They are often practiced by taking each of the immeasurables in turn and applying it to oneself (a practice taught by many contemporary teachers and monastics that was established after the Pali Suttas were completed), and then to others nearby, and so on to everybody in the world, and to everybody in all universes.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

===''A Cavern of Treasures'' (''mDzod-phug'')===
''A Cavern of Treasures'' ({{bo|t=མཛོད་ཕུག|w=mdzod phug}}) is a Bonpo ''[[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]'' uncovered by Shenchen Luga ({{bo|t=གཤེན་ཆེན་ཀླུ་དགའ|w=gshen-chen klu-dga'}}) in the early eleventh century. A segment of it enshrines a Bonpo evocation of the four immeasurables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/the-four-immeasurables-in-hinayana-mahayana-and-bon Berzin, Alexander (2005).

==Origins==
Prior to the advent of the Buddha, according to Martin Wiltshire, the pre-Buddhist traditions of ''Brahma-loka'', meditation and these four virtues are evidenced in both early Buddhist and non-Buddhist literature.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G. Wiltshire |title=Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism: The Emergence of Gautama as the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXmmkYQf4RwC&amp;pg=PA248 |year=1990|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-009896-9 |pages=248–264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Buddhist texts assert that pre-Buddha ancient Indian sages who taught these virtues were earlier incarnations of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt; Post-Buddha, these same virtues are found in the Hindu texts such as verse 1.33 of the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras of Patañjali]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: '''मैत्री करुणा मुदितोपेक्षाणां''' सुखदुःखपुण्यापुण्यविषयाणां भावनातश्चित्तप्रसादनम् ॥ ३३॥ - Yogasutra 1.33; [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_yoga/yogasuutra.html?lang=sa Source], SanskritDocuments.Org&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the four immeasurables, namely Maitri, Karuna and Upeksha, are found in the early Upanishads of Hinduism, while all four are found with slight variations – such as ''pramoda'' instead of ''mudita'' –  in Jainism literature, states Wiltshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G. Wiltshire |title=Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism: The Emergence of Gautama as the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXmmkYQf4RwC&amp;pg=PA248 |year=1990|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-009896-9 |pages=241–242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Indian ''Paccekabuddhas'' mentioned in the early Buddhist [[Sutra|Suttas]], those who lived before the Buddha, mention all "four immeasurables" and Brahmavihara, and they are claimed in the Suttas to be previous incarnations of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt;

According to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the four ''Brahmavihara'' meditation practices "did not originate within the Buddhist tradition".&lt;ref name="google247"/&gt; The Buddha never claimed that the "four immeasurables" were his unique ideas, in a manner similar to "cessation, quieting, nirvana".&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;

The pre-Buddha [[Chandogya Upanishad]], states Jayatilleke, in section 8.15 teaches metta and ahimsa to all creatures claiming that this practice leads to ''Brahmaloka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K N Jayatilleke |title=Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pBTAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-54287-1|pages=477–479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in Vedic ideas, from rituals to virtues, is particularly discernible in the early Upanishadic thought, and it is unclear as to what extent and how early Upanishadic traditions of Hinduism and Sramanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism influenced each other, on ideas such as "four immeasurables", meditation and Brahmavihara.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt;

In an authoritative Jain scripture, the [[Tattvartha Sutra]] (Chapter 7, sutra 11), there is a mention of four right sentiments: Maitri, pramoda, karunya, madhyastha:
{{quote|Benevolence towards all living beings, joy at the sight of the virtuous, compassion and sympathy for the afflicted, and tolerance towards the insolent and ill-behaved.}}

==Professional life==

In 1968 he graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy,  [[University of Iasi]], Romania with a master's degree in Philosophy. Between 1968 and 1990 he worked as a researcher at the Research Centre on Youth in Bucharest, Romania. In 1980, he earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the [[University of Bucharest]].

He was a Visiting Scholar at [[Boston University]], United States and [[Berkeley University]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cshe.berkeley.edu/events/csheat50/cshe-affiliates.pdf CSHE@50 list of affiliates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517174647/http://cshe.berkeley.edu/events/csheat50/cshe-affiliates.pdf |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (February–May 1981).
He has presented papers at international scientific congresses and conferences organized in [[Romania]], France, [[England]], China, Denmark, Israel, Germany, Italy, Russia, Hungary, [[Bulgaria]], [[Cuba]], Belgium.
He is member of [[European Sociological Association]] and [[International Sociological Association]].
Dean and Founder of the Political Sciences Department at ''Dimitrie Cantemir'' University in [[Bucharest]].
Between 1990 and 1994 he was part of the [[Government of Romania]] as General Director in Ministry of Culture, Bucharest.
Schifirneţ is Professor of Sociology at the [[National School of Administration and Political Science of Bucharest]], Romania.
In 2007, he was awarded the [[Romanian Academy]] Prize for his work ''C. Rãdulescu-Motru. His Life and Activities''.
His scientific interests are [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], Romanian [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], modernisation, sociology of [[Ageing|age]] and [[generation]]s, [[communication]].
He has coordinated „Ethnos”' collection of Albatros Printing House. He has republished 30 titles of Romanian works - a lot of them for the first time since first edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has contribution in modernisation and development sociology, in age and generations sociology, in the study of Romanian thinkers, and especially [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]. For instance, he has examined the outlook of Rădulescu-Motru about philosophy of Kant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kant.uni-mainz.de/bibliographie/bid_3305.html Kant-Studien - Bibliographischer Informationsdienst Nr. 33&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schifirneţ is one of the first Romanian researchers who have scientifically researched the topic of mass media and brought a valuable contribution to the development of this subject in the Romanian research literature before 1989. Since 1968, he has conducted several academic studies on the impact of mass communication on public opinion formation. Schifirneţ has coordinated in 1969, empirical research 'Opinions of students', first sociological research in Romania on a national sample.  A summary of the findings of this research was published in the volume 'Student and Society' (coordinators F. Mahler, A. Mihu, C. Schifirnet), 1973. In 1971, together with Ovidiu Bădina, he coordinated the volume Youth and Mass Media.

In his book, “Generaţie şi cultură” (Generation and Culture, 1985), Schifirneţ defined culture through a series of antagonist categories such as: classic culture - modern culture, traditional culture - mass media culture, and generation culture - global culture. He identified the interferences between different levels of culture and also the multiple relationships between the cultural behavior of a social group and various types of culture. His approach on the term of generation allowed him to develop the sociology of age and generations that was lacking from the Romanian sociological literature of that time. In his works, he demonstrated the existence of a conflict between generations in the socialist society.
His scientific studies on subculture and counterculture (1981, 1985) were the first in the Romanian sociology to approach these two notions. During those years, these concepts were rejected by the Romanian sociologists because of their bourgeois belongings and were considered to be irrelevant in the analysis of the communist society.
Through the analysis of the works of major Romanian thinkers, he succeeds in updating relevant concepts related to the term of nation such as: ethnic identity and agents of modernization in the Romanian society. He elaborated a monograph of the “forms without substance” theory in his book Formele fără fond, un brand românesc (The Forms without Substance, a Romanian Brand), 2007.

Schifirneţ has studied historical particularities the modern evolution of [[Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[modernisation]] has begun with political institutional construction and not with the building of  [[capitalist economy]]. The Romanian modernization was against boyars and social traditional structures. But a lot of traditional elements had outlived the new capitalist political-juridical organism from Romanian society. Romania is still a country which faced a late modernization; in the same time it has got many elements of modernity which fail to coagulate stable modern structures in all departments of society. Schifirneţ launched and developed the concept of tendential modernity. This concept explains the role of modernity for building political and legal institutional framework necessary to develop modern nation in a society with underdeveloped economy. Throughout its history, the Romanian state gave priority to the national construction and the problems related to the economic and social development were postponed or subordinated to the national issue. Tendential modernity describes the evolution of modernization processes within the societies that are only partially functional.  Schifirneţ thinks that it is useful to analyze the Romanian modernization processes under the notion of''' tendential modernity'''. This means the development in the opposite direction: from the affirmation of national spirit and political construction towards economical development. In Romanian society modernity is a trend, which coexists with obsolete institutional  forms and ancient substance. Tendential modernity penetrates slowly and hard through the complicated network of socio-institutional structures of the traditional and patriarchal Romanian society. Since it has no clear dominant form, it is a mosaic modernity. Modernity is the framework and the element which supports the Romanian nation, but not by means of economical way, as a basis of a national state.  [[Modernity]] is a tendency, an ideal in the construction of a  [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schifirnet|first=C.|title=Tendential Modernity|journal=Social Science Information|year=2012|volume=51|issue=1|pages=22–51|doi=10.1177/0539018411426518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} and, to some also as "Dianism," "Dianic Feminist Witchcraft," or simply "Feminist Witchcraft"'&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[neopagan]] religion of female-centered [[goddess]] ritual and tradition. While some adherents identify as [[Wicca]]n, it differs from most traditions of Wicca in that only goddesses are honored (whereas most Wiccan traditions honor both female and male deities).&lt;ref name=Budapest1&gt;Budapest, Zsuzsanna. ''Holy Book of Women's Mysteries'', The. 1980 (2003 electronic). {{ISBN|0-914728-67-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler1&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]].

Chapter 8: Women, Feminism, and the Craft".&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is more than one tradition that calls itself Dianic,&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt; the best known is the female-only variety,&lt;ref name="River May 2004"/&gt; founded by [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]] in the United States in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt; It is notable for its worship of a single [[Goddess movement|Goddess]] and focus on egalitarian, matriarchal [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt; It is named after the [[Roman goddess]] [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], but Dianics worship goddesses from many cultures, seeing them as "aspects" of a [[monotheistic]] goddess.&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt;  Dianic Wicca is an [[Wicca#Eclectic Wicca|eclectic]] combination of elements from [[British Traditional Wicca]], Italian folk-magic as recorded by [[Charles Leland]] in ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches|Aradia]]'', [[Second-wave feminism|feminist]] values, folk magic and healing practices from a variety of different cultures.&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
[[File:Diana with a Stag and a Dog LACMA M.78.77.jpg|thumb|250px|Diana (or Artemis, by her Greek name) as a protector of women and wild nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeofdiana.org/dwt.htm|title=Temple of Diana - The Tradition of Dianic Wicca|work=templeofdiana.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194250/http://www.templeofdiana.org/dwt.htm|archivedate=2013-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Dianic Wiccans of the Budapest lineage worship the [[Goddess]], who they see as containing all goddesses, from all cultures; she is seen as the source of all living things and containing all that is within her.&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt; Dianic covens practice [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] in the form of [[mediation]] and visualization in addition to spell work. They focus especially on healing themselves from the wounds of the [[patriarchy]] while affirming their own womanhood.

Rituals can include reenacting religious and spiritual lore from a feminist standpoint, celebrating the female body, and mourning society's abuses of women.&lt;ref name=Foltz&gt;Foltz, Tanic G. “Women's Spirituality Research: Doing Feminism,” Sociology of Religion 64.4 (2000): 409-418.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of magic is rooted in the belief that energy or 'life force' can be directed to enact change.&lt;ref name=SmithHorne&gt;Smith, Brandy and Sharon Horne. "Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (GLBT) Experiences with Earth-Spirited Faith." The Journal of Homosexuality, 52.3/4 (2007): 235-248.&lt;/ref&gt; However it is important to note that rituals are often improvised to suit individual or group needs and vary from coven to coven.&lt;ref name=Warwick&gt;Warwick, Lynda L. "Feminist Wicca: Paths to Empowerment." Women &amp; Therapy 16.2-3 (1995): 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Dianic Wiccans eschew manipulative [[Spell (paranormal)|spellwork]] and [[Curse|hexing]] because it goes against the [[Wiccan Rede]]. However, many other Dianic witches (notably Budapest) do not consider hexing or binding of those who attack women to be wrong, and actively encourage the binding of [[rape|rapists]].&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt;

===Differences from mainstream Wicca===
Like other Wiccans, Dianics may form [[coven]]s, attend [[festival]]s, celebrate the eight major [[Sabbat|Wiccan holidays]], and gather on [[Esbat]]s.&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt; They use many of the same [[Magical tools in Wicca|altar tools]], rituals, and vocabulary as other Wiccans. Dianics may also gather in less formal Circles.&lt;ref name="Velkoborska 2010"/&gt; The most noticeable difference between the two are that Dianic covens of Budapest lineage are composed entirely of women.&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt;

When asked why "men and gods" are excluded from her rituals, Budapest stated:

{{Quote|It's the natural law, as women fare so fares the world, their children, and that's everybody. If you lift up the women you have lifted up humanity. Men have to learn to develop their own mysteries. Where is the order of Attis? Pan? Zagreus? Not only research it, but then popularize it as well as I have done. Where are the Dionysian rites? I think men are lazy in this aspect by not working this up for themselves. It's their own task, not ours.|during a 2007 interview&lt;ref name="Velkoborska 2010"&gt;{{citation

There is therapeutic value inherent in Dianic ritual—many women use it to overcome personal trauma and raise awareness about violence towards women, earning comparisons to feminist [[consciousness-raising]] groups in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name=FoltzGriffin1&gt;Foltz, Tanic G. and Wendy Griffin. "Ethnographic Journeys of Self Discovery", ''Composing Ethnography: Alternative Forms of Qualitative Writing''. (1996): 301–330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FoltzLozano&gt;Lozano, Wendy G. and Tanic G. Foltz. "An Ethnographic Study of Witchcraft and Death", ''Qualitative Sociology'', Vol. 13, No. 13. (1990): 211–234.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some groups develop rituals specifically to confront gendered personal trauma, such as battery, rape, incest, and partner abuse. In one ethnographic study of such a ritual, women shifted their understanding of power from the hands of their abusers to themselves. It was found that this ritual had improved self-perception in participants in the short-term, and that the results could be sustained with ongoing practice.&lt;ref name=Jacobs1&gt;Jacobs, Janet L. "The Effects of Ritual Healing on Female Victims of Abuse: A Study of Empowerment and Transformation". ''Sociological Analysis'', 50.3 (1989): 265–279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobs2&gt;Jacobs, Janet L. "Women, Ritual, and Power". ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'', 11.2–3 (1990): 39–44.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Dianics pride themselves on the inclusion of [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]] members. It is a goal within many covens to explore female sexuality and sensuality outside of male control, and many rituals function to affirm lesbian sexuality,&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;Barrett, Ruth Rhiannon. "Lesbian Rituals and Dianic Tradition". ''Journal of Lesbian Studies'', 7.2 (2003): 15–28. Web. 12 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; making it a popular tradition for women who have come out.&lt;ref name="SmithHorne"/&gt; Some covens exclusively consist of same-sex oriented women and advocate [[lesbian separatism]].

Dianic Wicca developed from the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] and covens traditionally align themselves with [[radical feminism]]. These covens reject trans people who were [[sex assignment|born male]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt; Some groups also directly challenge [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="FoltzLozano"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Triple-Goddess Wiccan Symbol (modified).png|thumb|modified Triple-Goddess Wiccan symbol]]
[[Aradia]], or The Gospel of the Witches claims that ancient Diana, [[Aphrodite]], Aradia, and [[Herodius]] cults linked to the [[Sacred Mysteries]] are the origin of the all-female [[coven]] and many witch myths as we know them.
Dianic Wicca began on the [[Winter Solstice]] of 1971, when Budapest led a ceremony in Hollywood, California.&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt; Self-identifying as a "hereditary witch,"&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt; and claiming to have learned folk magic from her mother,&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt; Budapest is frequently considered the mother of modern Dianic Wiccan tradition.&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt; Dianic Wicca itself is named after the Roman goddess of the same name.&lt;ref name="Oswald 2003"&gt;{{cite book

==Denominations and related traditions==
* Traditions derived from Zsuzsanna Budapest - Female-only covens run by priestesses trained and initiated by Budapest.
* Independent Dianic witches - who may have been inspired by Budapest, her published work (such as ''The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries'') or other woman's spirituality movements, and who emphasize independent study and self-initiation.

===McFarland Dianic===
McFarland Dianic is a Neopagan tradition of goddess worship founded by Morgan McFarland and Mark Roberts which, despite the shared name, has a different theology and in some cases accepts male participants.&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFarlandSite1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcfarlanddianic.org/a-chronology.php| archive-date=27 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727074227/http://www.mcfarlanddianic.org/a-chronology.php | title= The McFarland Dianics -- A Chronology - Spring Equinox, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; McFarland largely bases their tradition on the work of [[Robert Graves]] and his book ''[[The White Goddess]]''.&lt;ref name=McFarlandSite1 /&gt; While some McFarland covens will initiate men, the leadership is limited to female priestesses.&lt;ref name=McFarlandSite1 /&gt; Like other Dianic traditions, "McFarland Dianic covens espouse feminism as an all-important concept."&lt;ref name=McFarlandSite1 /&gt; They consider the decision whether to include or exclude males as "solely the choice of [a member coven's] individual High Priestess."&lt;ref name=McFarlandSite1 /&gt;

The '''''Dictionnaire philosophique''''' ('''''Philosophical Dictionary''''') is an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] published by [[Voltaire]] in 1764. The alphabetically arranged articles often criticize the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and other institutions. The first edition, released in June 1764, went by the name of ''Dictionnaire philosophique portatif''. It was 344 pages and consisted of 73 articles. Later versions were expanded into two volumes consisting of 120 articles.&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire (translated by Gay), p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; The first editions were published anonymously in [[Geneva]] by Gabriel Grasset. Due to the volatile content of the ''Dictionnaire'', Voltaire chose Grasset over his usual publisher to ensure his own anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many editions and reprints of the ''Dictionnaire'' during Voltaire's lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;See [https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Discussion:Dictionnaire_philosophique#Recensement_des_.C3.A9ditions.2C_existantes_et_en_ligne here] for an accurate list. Many books can be consulted on-line.&lt;/ref&gt; but only four of them contained additions and modifications.&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Dizionario filosofico'', Garzanti Editore, 1981, page 2. See them in the [[Dictionnaire philosophique#External links|external links section]].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, another work published in 1770, ''Questions sur l'Encyclopédie'', which contained reshaped and modified articles from the [[Encyclopédie]] always in alphabetical order, led many following editors to join this and the ''Dictionnaire'' (plus other minor works) in a unique opus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Le Dictionnaire philosophique: œuvre "à part entière" ou "fatras de prose"?|author=Marc Hersant|journal=Littérales|volume=49|date=2009|url=http://www.fabula.org/colloques/document1093.php|p=21–32}}. See also [http://www.montesquieu.it/biblioteca/Testi/Dictionnaire_philosophique.pdf here] for an italian translation with missing notes.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Dictionnaire'' was a lifelong project for Voltaire. It represents the culmination of his views on [[Christianity]], [[God]], [[morality]] and other subjects.

==History and origins==
[[File:Voltaire - Philospohical dictionary.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Voltaire; ''A Philosophical Dictionary''. 2nd ed., London: Printed for J. and H.L. Hunt, 1824]]
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] saw the creation of a new way of structuring [[information]] in [[book]]s. The first work to employ this method was the ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' (1697) by [[Pierre Bayle]], in which the information is ordered alphabetically. Other important works using a similar structure followed, such as the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' by [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|Jean d'Alembert]]. Having witnessed first-hand the popularity and many advantages of this form, Voltaire used this information while preparing the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' in 1752, although it was not completed until 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Having had the opportunity to write his ''Dictionary'' at a later point in time, Voltaire saw that there were certain problems with previous dictionaries, chiefly that they were all lengthy, and thus very expensive and unaccessible for much of the population. Voltaire sought to create a text which would fit in one's pocket and be affordable because "revolutionary material must be small enough for people to carry with them".&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; What he created is a text which educated and amused at the same time.&lt;ref name="Voltaire p. 56"&gt;Voltaire (translated by Gay), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire's motivations for writing the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' can be seen as serendipitous. The idea was spawned at a dinner party in the court of Prince [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]] in 1752, during which he and other guests each agreed to write an article and share them the next morning. Voltaire consequently was the only guest to take the game seriously and the idea cascaded to form the ''Philosophical Dictionary''.&lt;ref name="Voltaire p. 56"/&gt;

==Structure==
The ''Philosophical Dictionary'' is structured in the tradition of Bayle, Diderot and d'Alembert — that is to say, alphabetically ordered. Although this order helps readers more easily find articles, this was not meant to be a dictionary or encyclopaedia in the same totalizing way of d'Alembert's project. Voltaire's writing is neither objective nor varied in opinion; the same arguments are made throughout the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' emphasizing the point of his discontent.

==Themes==
Many of the themes addressed by Voltaire in this book are addressed or touched upon in his work ''L'Infame''. In this and other works, Voltaire is very concerned about the injustices of the Catholic Church, which he sees as intolerant and fanatical. At the same time, his work espouses deism, tolerance and freedom of the press.

==Influences==
Because this work was written late in the author's life, coupled with the fact that it is compiled of articles written over an extended period of time, the work had many influences, which noticeably change, depending on the theme which the article addresses.
 
The first major influence on the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' is Voltaire's visit to England, which gave him the opportunity to compare the problems in France with a place that had free press and to become better acquainted with important and influential thinkers such as Locke and Newton. Newtonian theory is influential in many of the articles that deal with tolerance stating that if we "do not know the essence of things we will not persecute others",&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire (translated by Gay), p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; for those things.

The [[Jean Calas|Calas affair]] was an event that shaped Voltaire during the creation of the ''Philosophical Dictionary''. Jean Calas was a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] who was wrongfully convicted of killing his son. This occurred because there had been a rumour that the murder was fueled by Calas' son conversion to Catholicism. David de Beaudrige, who was in charge of the case, upon hearing this rumour, had the Calas family arrested without inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Orieux, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire used this theme in the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' to fight against the Catholic Church.

==Reception==
The reception of the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' at the time was mixed. On one hand, the book saw a very strong reception on the part of the general public. The first edition was quickly sold out;&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire (translated by Gay), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; many more editions were needed to keep up with the demand. Enlightened rulers such as [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] both have been recorded as supporters of the book.

On the other hand, the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' was despised by religious authorities, who had a very important influence over what works were to be censored. The ''Philosophical Dictionary'' was censored in many countries, including Switzerland ([[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]]) and France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86179374 ''Arrest de la cour de Parlement, qui condamne deux Libelles (...): Dictionnaire Philosophique portatif; (...) Lettres écrites de la Montagne, par Jean-Jacques Rousseau (...). Extrait des registres du Parlement. Du 19 Mars 1765''].&lt;/ref&gt; In these countries, all available copies of the book were collected and burned in the town square.&lt;ref name="Orieux, p. 409"&gt;Orieux, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire, who remained an anonymous author, was repeatedly asked if he minded that the ''Portatif'' was being burned, but he calmly replied that he had no reason to be upset.&lt;ref name="Orieux, p. 409"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">The '''Earth immune system''' is a controversial proposal, claimed to be a consequence of  the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. The Gaia hypothesis holds that the entire earth may be considered a single organism (Gaia). As a self-maintaining organism, Earth would have an [[immune system]] of some sort in order to maintain its health.

Some proponents of this speculative concept, for example, hold that [[human|humankind]] can be considered an "[[infection]]" of Gaia, and that [[AIDS]] is an attempt by this immune system to reject the infection. 
"[[Cancer]]" might be a more accurate term, as humans [[evolution|evolved]] within Gaia, and are not external invaders.
An opposite view is that humankind is Gaia's immune system itself, perhaps evolved to avert future catastrophes such as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|Permian]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous]] [[mass extinction]]s of species.

[[James Lovelock]]'s book "[[The Revenge of Gaia]]" suggests that Gaia has many mechanisms for eliminating [[civilization]]s that do harm through [[greenhouse gas emission]]s and [[global warming]], but suggests that with increasing heat being received from the sun, Gaia's ability to "bounce back" as it did after the [[Permian]] and [[Cretaceous]] [[extinction]] events, may be increasingly compromised.

[[Paul Hawken]] suggests in ''[[Blessed Unrest]]'' that when Earth is considered a living system then Earth's immune system is made up of the million or so organizations all around the globe that are working for social justice, the environment, and indigenous people's rights. Many of these groups are linked through the Internet and other means so there is a vast network of interconnected people and groups working to protect the planet, its people, and all beings. For example, one organization that serves to link groups working on sustainable energy is Inforse in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inforse.org/ |title=International Network for Sustainable Energy |work=INFORSE |year=2015 |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Fredkin''' (born 1934) is a distinguished career professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU), Pennsylvania, and an early pioneer of [[Digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;See Fredkin's [http://www.digitalphilosophy.org Digital Philosophy web site.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredkin's primary contributions include his work on [[reversible computing]] and [[cellular automata]]. While [[Konrad Zuse]]'s book, ''[[Calculating Space]]'' (1969), mentioned the importance of reversible computation, the [[Fredkin gate]] represented the essential breakthrough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information about Edward Fredkin|url=http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Edward+Fredkin|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent work, he uses the term [[Digital philosophy]] (DP).

During his career, Fredkin served on the faculties of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Computer Science, was a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at Caltech, and was Research Professor of Physics at Boston University, Massachusetts.

==Early life==
At age 19, Fredkin left [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) college after a year to join the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) to become a fighter pilot.&lt;ref name = PDP-1&gt;{{cite web|title=PDP-1|url=http://pdp-1.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/index.php?f=theme&amp;s=3&amp;ss=4|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredkin has worked with a number of companies in the computer field and has held academic positions at a number of universities. He is a computer programmer, a pilot, an advisor to businesses and governments, and a physicist. His main interests concern digital computer-like models of basic processes in physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~raj-symposium/fredkin.html |title=ED FREDKIN Bio|publisher=CMU |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Fredkin's field was physics; however, he became involved with computers in 1956 when he was sent by the Air Force, where he had trained as a jet pilot, to the [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=CMU&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=http://www.iment.com/maida/tv/computer/johncocke.htm#ed|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On completing his service, in 1958, Fredkin was hired by [[J. C. R. Licklider]] to work at the research firm, [[Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman]] (BBN).  After seeing the [[PDP-1]] prototype at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Boston, Massachusetts, in December 1959, Fredkin recommended that BBN purchase the very first [[PDP-1]] to support research projects at BBN. The PDP-1 came with no software whatsoever.

Fredkin wrote a PDP-1 assembler called FRAP (Free of Rules Assembly Program); also sometimes called Fredkin's Assembly Program, and the first operating system (OS).  He organized and founded a user group called [[DECUS]], and he participated in early projects using the PDP-1.  Working with Ben Gurley, the designer of the PDP-1, Fredkin designed significant modifications to the [[PDP-1]].  He invented and designed the first modern [[interrupt]] system, which Digital called the "Sequence Break".  He went on to become a contributor in the field of [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PDP-1|url=http://pdp-1.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/index.php?f=showitem&amp;id=26.44&amp;l=1&amp;popupwin=1|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Fredkin returned to academia, starting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([[MIT]]) as a full professor. From 1971 to 1974, Fredkin was the Director of [[Project MAC]] at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calteches Library - Robotics PDF |url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/360/3/robotics.pdf |publisher=Caltech|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent a year at Caltech as a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar, working with [[Richard Feynman]], and was a Professor of [[Physics]] at [[Boston University]], Massachusetts, for 6 years.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|title=About Edward|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/050126.html|publisher=Stanford|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Fredkin has been a Distinguished Career Professor of Computer Science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU).&lt;ref name=CMU /&gt; and also a Visiting Scientist at [[MIT Media Lab]]oratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Visiting Scientist|url=http://www.media.mit.edu/events/lecture-fredkin.html|publisher=MIT|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently associated with CMU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visiting Research Professor|url=http://www.isri.cmu.edu/people/other-faculty.html|publisher=CMU|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredkin founded [[Information International Inc.]] in 1961, and has served as the founder or CEO of a diverse set of companies, including Information International, [[Three Rivers Computer Corporation]], and New England Television Corporation (owner of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]'s then [[CBS]] affiliate, WNEV, channel 7), The Reliable Water Company (manufacturer of advanced Sea Water Desalination Plants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Channel 7|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/stations/72145|publisher=Boston Radio|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredkin has been broadly interested in computation: hardware and software. He is the inventor of the [[trie]] data structure, radio transponders for vehicle identification, the concept of computer navigation for automobiles, the [[Fredkin gate]] and the [[Billiard-Ball Computer]] Model for [[reversible computing]]. He has also been involved in [[computer vision]], chess, and other areas of Artificial Intelligence research.&lt;ref name = PDP-1 /&gt; Fredkin also works at the intersection of theoretical issues in the physics of computation and computational models of physics. He invented the SALT Cellular Automata family. Dan Miller designed and programmed the Busy Boxes implementation of Salt, with assistance from Suresh Kumar Devanathan.  The early SALT models are 2+1 dimensional quasi-physical, reversible, universal cellular automata, that are 2nd order in time and that follow rules that model CPT reversibility.{{harv|Miller|Fredkin|2005}}.&lt;ref name=Stanford /&gt;

While at MIT, Fredkin served as the Director of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS), which later merged with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to become [[CSAIL]]. Fredkin has also had an association with Carnegie Mellon for a number of years. His current academic interests are in the area Digital Mechanics, which is the study of discrete models of fundamental process in Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Biography|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/news/dls/fredkin.html|publisher=CMU|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A profile of Fredkin, along with a readable explanation of some of his theories, can be found in the first part of ''Three Scientists and Their Gods'' by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]] (1988). The section of the book covering Fredkin was excerpted in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in April 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Scientists and Their Gods in The Atlantic Monthly|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/unifiedtheory.htm|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2004, only seven months after the start of the PDP-1 Restoration Project, chaired by Edward Fredkin, a team of Computer History Museum volunteers flipped the 'on' switch on a 1963 Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer. Nearly 45 years after it was made, the machine jumped to life!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PDP-1 Restoration Project|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/restoration/|date=19 May 2004|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mouse That Roared: PDP-1 Celebration Event|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8zU8WQO-PY|publisher=YouTube.com|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fredkin's version of digital philosophy==
[[Digital philosophy]] (DP) is one type of [[digital physics]]/[[pancomputationalism]]. The school of philosophy called pancomputationalism claims that all the physical processes of nature are forms of computation or information processing at the most fundamental level of reality. Pancomputationalism is related to several larger schools of philosophy: [[atomism]], [[determinism]], [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[monism]], [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[philosophical realism]], [[reductionism]], and [[scientific empiricism]].

Pancomputationalists believe that biology reduces to chemistry reduces to physics reduces to the computation of information. Fredkin's career and achievements have much of their motivation in digital philosophy, a particular type of pancomputationalism described in Fredkin's papers: ''Introduction to Digital Philosophy'', ''On the Soul'', ''Finite Nature'', ''A New Cosmogony'', and ''Digital Mechanics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/Ed_Fredkin |title=Fredkin's papers|publisher=World News |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredkin's Digital philosophy contains several fundamental ideas: Everything in physics and physical reality must have a digital informational representation. All changes in physical nature are consequences of digital informational processes. Nature is finite and digital. The traditional Judaeo-Christian concept of the soul has a counterpart in a static/dynamic soul defined in terms of digital philosophy.

===WarGames===
According to biographer [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], the character Stephen Falken in the film, ''[[WarGames]]'', was modeled after Fredkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=War Games|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1988/10/15/in-the-country-of-the-blind/|publisher=Stanford Crimson Article|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1984, Edward was awarded the [[Dickson Prize#Dickson Prize in Science|'Dickson Prize in Science']], which is awarded annually to the person who has been judged by Carnegie Mellon University to have made the most progress in the scientific field in the United States during that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Dickson Prize Winners|url=http://www.cmu.edu/dickson-prize/past-winners/|publisher=CMU|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fredkin Professorship===
In Fredkin's honor, Carnegie Mellon University has established the Fredkin professorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer Science Professor Tom Mitchell Named Carnegie Mellon's Fredkin Professor of AI and Learning|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./scsnews/mitchell.html|publisher=CMU|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethical codes''' are adopted by organizations to assist members in understanding the difference between 'right' and 'wrong' and in applying that understanding to their decisions. An ethical code generally implies documents at three levels: codes of [[business ethics]], [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]] for employees, and codes of professional practice.

==Code of ethics or code of conduct? (corporate or business ethics)==

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Many companies use the phrases ''ethical code'' and ''code of conduct'' interchangeably but it may be useful to make a distinction. A code of [[ethics]] will start by setting out the values that underpin the code and will describe a company's obligation to its stakeholders. The code is publicly available and addressed to anyone with an interest in the company's activities and the way it does business. It will include details of how the company plans to implement its values and vision, as well as guidance to staff on ethical standards and how to achieve them. However, a code of conduct is generally addressed to and intended for employees alone. It usually sets out restrictions on behavior, and will be far more compliance or rules focused than value or principle focused.

==Code of practice (professional ethics)==
{{See also|Professional ethics}}
A code of practice is adopted by a profession or by a governmental or non-governmental organization to regulate that profession. A code of practice may be styled as a code of [[professional responsibility]], which will discuss difficult issues, difficult decisions that will often need to be made, and provide a clear account of what behavior is considered "ethical" or "correct" or "right" in the circumstances.  In a membership context, failure to comply with a code of practice can result in expulsion from the professional organization. In its 2007 International Good Practice Guidance, ''Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations'', the [[International Federation of Accountants]] provided the following working definition:
"Principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that guide the decisions, procedures and systems of an organization in a way that (a) contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and (b) respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=PAIB Committee |date=31 May 2007 |title=Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations |series=International Good Practice Guidance |publisher=The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) |isbn=978-1-931949-81-1 |url=http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/defining-and-developing-effective-code-conduct-organizations |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

==General notes==
Ethical codes are often adopted by management, not to promote a particular moral theory, but rather because they are seen as pragmatic necessities for running an organization in a complex society in which moral concepts play an important part.

They are distinct from [[moral code]]s that may apply to the culture, education, and religion of a whole society. It is debated whether the politicians should apply a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/2064759/Elementi_di_deontologia_politica |language=Italian |first=Giampiero |last=Buonomo |title=Elementi di deontologia politica |journal=Nuovi studi politici |date=April–September 2000 |pages=3-66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or whether it is a profession entirely discretionary, just subject to compliance with the law: however, recently codes of practice have been approved in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/qui/code_deontologie.asp|title=Déontologie à l'Assemblée nationale |author=Assemblée Nationale |author-link=National Assembly (France) |language=French |date=2 August 2017 |website=Assemblée Nationale|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, acts that violate ethical codes may also violate a law or regulation and can be punishable at law or by government agency remedies.

Even organizations and communities that may be considered criminal in nature may have ethical codes of conduct, official or unofficial. Examples could include [[Black-hat hacker|hacker communities]], bands of thieves, and [[street gang]]s.

The Jewish [[Written Torah]] and [[Oral Torah]] comprise the earliest and best preserved ethical code. Adapted to every field of actual day-to-day life for thousands of years, Jewish [[Halakha]] is the oldest collective body of [[religious law]]s, [[law]]s and [[jurisdiction]]s still in use.

Codes seek to define and delineate the difference between conduct and behavior that is [[malum in se]], [[malum prohibitum]], and good practice.  Sometimes ethical codes include sections that are meant to give firm rules, but some offer general guidance, and sometimes the words are merely aspirational.

In sum, a code of ethics is an attempt to codify "good and bad behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/code%20of%20ethics |title=Code of Ethics |work=[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]] |access-date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthroposophy}}
'''Eurythmy''' is an expressive [[performing art|movement art]] originated by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in conjunction with [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers|Marie von Sivers]] in the early 20th century. Primarily a performance art, it is also used in [[pedagogy|education]], especially in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]], and&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; as part of [[anthroposophic medicine]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for claimed therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref name=qw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt;

The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''.

==Movement repertoire==
The [[gesture]]s in the eurythmist's movement repertoire relate to the sounds and rhythms of speech, to the tones and rhythms of music and to "soul experiences", such as joy and sorrow. Once these fundamental repertoire elements are learned, they can be composed into free artistic expressions. The eurythmist also cultivates a feeling for the qualities of straight lines and curves, the directions of movement in space (forward, backward, up, down, left, right), contraction and expansion, and color. The element of color is also emphasized both through the costuming, usually given characteristic colors for a piece or part and formed of long, loose fabrics that accentuate the movements rather than the bodily form, and through the lighting, which saturates the space and changes with the moods of the piece.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

Eurythmy's aim is to bring the artists' expressive movement and both the performers' and audience's feeling experience into harmony with a piece's content;&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädogogik'', Böhlau Verlag, {{ISBN|3-412-01898-8}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; eurythmy is thus sometimes called "visible music" or "visible speech", expressions that originate with its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], who described eurythmy as an "art of the soul".

Most eurythmy today is performed to [[European classical music|classical (concert) music]] or texts such as [[poetry]] or stories. Silent pieces are also sometimes performed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

===Eurythmy with music===
When performing eurythmy with music (also called ''tone eurythmy''), the three major elements of music, [[melody]], [[harmony]] and [[rhythm]], are all expressed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;  The melody is primarily conveyed through expressing its rise and fall; the specific [[pitch (music)|pitches]]; and the [[interval (music)|intervallic qualities]] present.  Harmony is expressed through movement between tension and release, as expressions of dissonance and consonance, and between the more inwardly directed minor mood and the outwardly directed major mood.  Rhythm is chiefly conveyed through livelier and more contoured movements for quick notes, slower, dreamier movements for longer notes; in addition, longer tones move into the more passive (listening) back space, quicker tones into the more active front space.

Breaths or pauses are expressed through a larger or smaller movement in space, giving new impulse to what follows.  Beat is conveyed through greater emphasis of downbeats, or those beats upon which stress is normally placed.  Beat is generally treated as a subsidiary element. Eurythmy has only occasionally been done to popular music, in which beat plays a large role.

The timbre of individual instruments is brought into the quality both of the tonal gestures and of the whole movement of the eurythmist.  Usually there will be a different eurythmist or group of eurythmists expressing each instrument, for example in chamber or symphonic music.

A piece's [[choreography]] usually expresses elements such as the major or minor key, the shape of the melody line, the interplay between voices or instruments and the relative dominance of one or another voice or instrument.  Thus, musicians can often follow even the finest details of their part in the movements of the eurythmists on stage.  Particular musical forms (e.g. the [[sonata]]) can have special characteristic choreographic expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurythmy with spoken texts===
Eurythmy is often performed with spoken texts such as poetry, stories or plays. ''Speech eurythmy'' includes such elements as the [[phoneme|sounds of speech]], [[rhythm]]s, poetic [[meter (poetry)|meter]]s, [[grammar]] and mood. In speech eurythmy, all the sounds of language have characteristic gestural qualities: the sound of an 'A' is open due to the position of the articulators during the vowel. A 'k' sounds sharper due to the manner of articulation of the consonant, that it is a plosive. Note that it is the audible sounds themselves, not the letters of the written language, that are expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{npsn|date=April 2014}}[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Steiner on eurythmy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eurythmy was conceived in 1911 when a widow brought her young daughter, Lory Smits, who was interested in movement and dance, to the [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]] [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Due to the recent loss of her father, it was necessary for the girl to find a career. Steiner's advice was sought; he suggested that the girl begin working on a new art of movement. As preparation for this, she began to study human anatomy, to explore the human step,  to contemplate the movement implicit in Greek sculpture and dance, and to find movements that would express spoken sentences using the sounds of speech. Soon a number of other young people became interested in this form of expressive movement.

During these years, Steiner was writing a new drama each year for performance at the [[Anthroposophical Society]]'s summer gatherings; beginning in 1912, he began to incorporate the new art of movement into these dramas. When the Society decided to build an artistic center in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]] (this later became known as the [[Goetheanum]]) a small stage group began work and offered weekly performances of the developing art. [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], Steiner's wife, who was a trained actress and speech artist, was given responsibility for training and directing this ensemble. This first eurythmy ensemble went on tour in 1919, performing across [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Alan Stott, ''Eurythmy: its Birth and Development'', {{ISBN|0-9541048-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner saw eurythmy as a unique expression of the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] impulse:
{{quote|It is the task of Anthroposophy to bring a greater depth, a wider vision and a more living spirit into the other forms of art. But the art of Eurythmy could only grow up out of the soul of Anthroposophy; could only receive its inspiration through a purely Anthroposophical conception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Rudolf Steiner's "Lecture on Eurythmy" August 26, 1923]&lt;/ref&gt;|Rudolf Steiner}}

According to Steiner: ''In eurythmy we present in the form and movement of the human organism a direct external proof of a man's share in the life of the supersensible world. When people do eurythmy they are linked directly with the supersensible world. Whenever art is formed from a truly artistic conviction it bears witness to the connection of the human being with the supersensible world.'' (Dornach, 12 September 1920) &lt;ref&gt;Biesantz/Klingborg, The Goetheanum: Rudolf Steiner's Architectural Impulse (London, 1979), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Steiner gave two intensive workshops on different aspects of eurythmy; transcripts of his talks during these workshops are published as ''Eurythmy as Visible Speech'' and ''Eurythmy as Visible Singing''.

Eurythmy ensembles in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] and at the Goetheanum soon became established parts of the cultural life of Europe. The Goetheanum ensemble was recognized with a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris Expo]] of 1937/8. The Stuttgart training and ensemble, led by [[Else Klink]], had to close in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] period but reopened shortly after the close of [[World War II]]. There are now training centers and artistic ensembles in many countries.&lt;ref name="Stott"/&gt;

===Etymology===
The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''. The term was used by Ancient Greek and Roman architects to refer to the harmonious proportions of a design or building;&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka, ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', Sheen and Ward, NY 1946, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''eurythmy'' was used from the 17th to 19th century to refer not only to harmonious architectural proportions, but also to "rhythmical order or movement" and "a graceful proportion and carriage of the body".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/65086 "Eurhythmy"], Oxford English Dictionary, accessed 1/14/14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurythmy as a performing art==
There are notable eurythmy ensembles in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]]; [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]; [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]; [[London]], [[England]]; [[Järna]], [[Sweden]], and [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] (near [[New York City]]). All of these groups both perform locally and tour internationally. Many smaller performing groups also exist [http://www.eurythmie-info.de/Buehnen.htm (see list)]. High schools that have their own performing ensembles include the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120313232919/http://www.sfwaldorf.org/high-school/arts/eurythmy-troupe San Francisco Waldorf High School ensemble].

==Pedagogical eurythmy==
When the first [[Waldorf School]] was founded in 1919, eurythmy was included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Stockmeyer, ''Rudolf Steiner's Curriculum for Waldorf Schools'', Steiner Schools Fellowship, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly recognized as a successful complement to [[gymnastics]] in the school's movement program and is now taught in most Waldorf schools, as well as in many non-Waldorf pre-school centers, kindergartens and schools. It is taught to all ages from pre-schools through high school and into college. Its purpose is to awaken and strengthen the expressive capacities of children through movement, stimulating the child to bring [[imagination]], [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] and [[concept]]ualization to the point where they can manifest these as "vital, moving forms" in physical space.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; It is also thought to improve balance, coordination, concentration, rhythm, and form an awareness of patterns.

Eurythmy pedagogical exercises begin with the straight line and curve and proceed through successively more complicated geometric figures and choreographed forms, developing a child's coordination and concentration. An extensive set of special exercises has also been developed for pedagogical purposes.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; These include metamorphosing geometric patterns and dynamic movement sequences.

Rods or balls are sometimes used in exercises to develop precision in movement, to expand the experience of space, develop precise balance, and to objectify the movement experience. The rods are usually approximately the length of an arm; the balls are of a size to fit comfortably in one hand. Both are generally made of copper, a material receptive to warmth.

Though there are some independent post-graduate trainings for pedagogical eurythmy, this aspect is frequently included in courses focusing on artistic work.

A 2008 review in ''BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' said that eurythmy was a "potentially relevant add-on" to a therapeutic program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Büssing A, Ostermann T, Majorek M, Matthiessen PF |title=Eurythmy Therapy in clinical studies: a systematic literature review |journal=BMC Complement Altern Med |volume=8 |issue= |pages=8 |year=2008 |pmid=18377647 |pmc=2322948 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but though the studies reviewed reported improvement in symptoms, limitations in the underlying data and in the review methods means these conclusions "warrant cautious interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |entry=Eurythmy Therapy in clinical studies: a systematic literature review |publisher=[[Centre for Reviews and Dissemination]] |date=7 April 2009 |url=http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/ShowRecord.asp?AccessionNumber=12008103765#.U0Yu14XePN0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''Frank McEachran''' (1900–1975), sometimes known as '''Kek''', was a [[British people|British]] [[schoolmaster]] and author. He taught at English public schools and the [[University of Leipzig]] and wrote on [[philosophy]], but his most commercially successful books were his anthologies ''Spells for Poets'' and ''More Spells'' which appeared in the 1950s.

==Life==
The son of an engineer from [[Wolverhampton]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Davenport-Hines, ''Auden'' (1996), p. 39: "In his final year at the school he was impressed by a young master called Frank McEachran, an engineer's son from Wolverhampton..."&lt;/ref&gt; McEachran was educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]] and then at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=archiveshub&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20140206004829/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb206ms593 On Translating Nietzsche into English] at archiveshub.ac.uk, accessed 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After taking the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Bachelor of Literature|BLitt]], he began to teach at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], in September 1924. Among the boys he influenced while there was the future poet [[W. H. Auden]],&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Bucknell &amp; Nicholas Jenkins, ''W. H. Auden, The Map of All My Youth. Early Works, Friends, and Influences'' (Auden Studies 1, Clarendon Press, 1990, p. 117)&lt;/ref&gt; and one writer on Auden detects traces of McEachran's "humanist world-view" in Auden's poetry until it was overtaken by the [[existentialism]] of [[Kierkegaard]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;John Bridgen, 'Frank McEachran' in Bucknell &amp; Jenkins, ''W. H. Auden, The Map of All My Youth. Early Works, Friends, and Influences''&lt;/ref&gt; McEachran also taught the future communist [[James Klugmann]], and the writer [[Alan Bennett]] used him as the model for the character of the schoolmaster Hector in his play ''[[The History Boys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Andrews, [http://www.opendemocracy.net/geoff-andrews/james-klugmann-complex-communist James Klugmann, a complex communist] dated 27 February 2012 at opendemocracy.net, accessed 1 May 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; He also taught now Salopian House Master Richard Hudson.

He was also a lecturer at the [[University of Leipzig]]&lt;ref name=archiveshub/&gt; and a master at [[Shrewsbury School]].&lt;ref&gt;'Frank McEachran', obituary in ''Books and Bookmen'', vol. 20 (Hanson Books, 1975), pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; There he taught [[Martin Wainwright]], who has recalled that "Frank McEachran stood us on chairs at school reciting poetry we’d learned by heart. Probably child abuse these days, but he called it Spells and I can still remember them all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libdemvoice.org/listen-baroness-williams-on-her-moral-and-religious-beliefs-27977.html Listen Baroness Williams on her moral and religious beliefs] at libdemvoice.org, accessed 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He is remembered in Shrewsbury School through the McEachran room in the English faculty where the student-run Creative Writing Society meets, some still influenced by his writings.

McEachran's anthology ''Spells'' (1953), later re-issued as ''Spells for Poets'', is divided into eight parts: 'Sheer', 'Queer', 'Fear', 'Love', 'Death', 'Odd', 'God', and 'Postscript'.&lt;ref&gt;Frank McEachran, ''Spells for Poets: an Anthology of Words and Comment'' (Basil Blackwell, 1955; Garnstone Press paperback edition, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

When he died in 1975 McEachran's address was Kingsland House, The Schools, Shrewsbury, and he left an estate valued at £15,062.&lt;ref&gt;[https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk probatesearch.service.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4439">Dr. '''Heydar Najaf oglu Huseynov''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]: ''Heydər Hüseynov'') (3 April 1908, [[Erivan]] – 15 August 1950, [[Baku]]) was an [[Azerbaijan]]i philosopher and academician.

==Life==
Huseynov was born in [[Erivan]] (present-day Yerevan, Armenia) into the [[petty bourgeois]] family of Haji Najaf Karbalai Huseynoglu and his wife Mashadi Gulsum, being the youngest of their six children. His father died shortly after Heydar's birth. After their eldest son Yusif was killed in an ethnic conflict in 1918, the family moved first to [[Batumi]], then to [[Stavropol]], until they finally settled in [[Baku]] where he received secondary education, graduated from the Azerbaijan State Pedagocical Institute with a degree in linguistics in 1931 and a [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree in philosophy.&lt;ref name="zerkalo"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.zerkalo.az/rubric.php?id=36196&amp;dd=20&amp;mo=9&amp;yr=2008 Philosophers Leave First] by Elmira Almasova. ''Zerkalo''. 20 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was fluent in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Beginning in 1932, Huseynov taught philosophy at various postsecondary institutions and published his works ''Dialectical Materialism'' (1935) and ''Dialects and metaphysics'' (1939) in Azeri.&lt;ref name="zerkalo"/&gt; From 1936 on, he was involved in the publishing of the Azerbaijani Soviet Encyclopædia and in 1940 he became head of the project. He was the editor of the four-volume Russian-Azeri Dictionary, for which he was awarded [[Stalin Prize]],&lt;ref name="zerkalo"/&gt; the highest ranking award in the [[Soviet Union]] at the time. In 1944, he was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan]]. Almost simultaneously Huseynov wrote his fundamental 733-page work entitled ''On the history of Azerbaijani phisolophical and sociopolitical thought in the nineteenth century'' (it was published in 1948).&lt;ref name="fnkaa"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.fnkaa.ru/pnhtml/100_gus2.htm Huseynov, Heydar Najaf oglu]. ''FNKAA.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; His work was recognised with him being granted a doctoral degree along with being promoted to Professor of [[Marxism-Leninism]]. In addition, he was awarded with his second Stalin Prize in March 1950.&lt;ref name="zerkalo"/&gt; Overall Huseynov wrote around 100 scientific works, mostly having to do with Azerbaijani literary thought.&lt;ref name="fnkaa"/&gt;

==Criticism and death==
Despite immediate positive recognition of his prize-winning work, Huseynov's work was met with criticism by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] organs in May 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.ihst.ru/projects/sohist/repress/113-124.pdf Purged Orientalism: Orientalists Who Were Subject to Repressions in the 1920–50s]&lt;/ref&gt; Huseynov was accused of presenting [[murid]]ism, a philosophical [[Sufi]] movement in the [[Caucasus]] in the mid-19th century, and specifically its propagator [[Imam Shamil]], in the preface to his book as a "progressive democratic national liberation phenomenon (...) contrary to Marxist ideas and (...) the movement's reactionist and nationalist nature that served the interests of the English capitalism and the Turkish sultan."&lt;ref&gt;''On the history of the foreign agent schemes in the Caucasian wars''. Voprosy istorii. #2. 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reviewing the monograph, the Committee for Stalin Prize in the field of literature and arts forwarded its observations to the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union]] and as a result, Huseynov was stripped off his award. Huseynov was excluded from the Communist Party and laid off from the Academy of Sciences. Unable to deal with criticism from the state organs and his own colleagues and foreseeing his arrest, Huseynov committed suicide by slicing his veins on 15 August, 1950.&lt;ref name="fnkaa"/&gt;

'''Hugh of Saint-Cher''', [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] (c. 1200 – 19 March 1263) was a [[French people|French]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] who became a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and noted [[Bible|biblical]] commentator.

==Life==
Hugh was born at Saint-Cher, a suburb of [[Vienne]], [[Dauphiné]], around the beginning of the 13th century. After completing his early 
studies at a local monastery near his home, at about the age of fourteen, he went to the [[University of Paris]] to study [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[jurisprudence]], which latter subject he later taught in the same city.&lt;ref name=Gigot&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07521b.htm Gigot, Francis. "Hugh of St-Cher." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1225, he entered the Dominican [[priory]] there and took the [[religious habit]] of the recently founded Order. Soon after his admission, he was appointed as [[provincial superior|Prior Provincial]] of the Order for France. In 1230 he became Master of Theology and was elected prior of the Paris monastery. During those years, he contributed largely to the Order's success, and won the confidence of [[Pope Gregory IX]], who sent him as a [[papal legate]] to Constantinople in 1233.&lt;ref name=Gigot/&gt;

==Cardinalate==
[[Pope Innocent IV]] made Hugh a [[Cardinal Priest]] in 1244, with his [[titular church]] being [[Santa Sabina]], the mother church of the Dominican Order. He then played an important part in the [[First Council of Lyons]], which took place the following year. He contributed to the institution of the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]] on the [[General Roman Calendar]]. In 1247, upon instructions of Pope Innocent, Hugh revised the [[Carmelite Rule of St. Albert]], which the [[beatification|Saint]] [[Albert Avogadro]], [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], had given the first [[Carmelites|Carmelite friars]] on [[Mount Carmel]]. The Holy See felt it necessary to mitigate some of the Rule's more demanding elements to make it more compatible with conditions in Europe. The same pope approved these changes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmelites.net/blog/carmelite-chroniclesthe-mitigation-of-the-rule-1247/ Smet O.Carm., Joachim. "The Mitigation of the Rule, 1247", ''The Mirror of Carmel'', Carmelite Media, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-936742-01-1}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and this revision remains the Rule for the Carmelite Order. After the death in 1250 of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], Pope Innocent sent Hugh to Germany as his legate for the election of a successor.&lt;ref name=Gigot/&gt;

Under the authority of [[Pope Alexander IV]], in 1255 Hugh supervised the commission that condemned the ''Introductorius in Evangelium aeternum'' of [[Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino]], which promoted the teachings of [[Abbot]] [[Joachim of Fiore]]. These teachings worried the bishops as they had become widespread among the [[Fraticelli|"Spiritual"]] wing of the Franciscan friars, to which Gherardino belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalcyclopedia.com/H/hugo-of-sancto-caro.html "Hugo of Sancto Caro", ''The Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature'', (James Strong and John McClintock, eds.) Harper and Brothers. New York. 1880]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also supervised the condemnation of [[William of St Amour]]'s ''De periculis novissimorum temporum''. This work was an expression of the attack on the [[mendicant Orders]], who were becoming so successful in the lives of the universities, by the [[secular clergy]] who had previously had unchallenged authority there. Hugh served as [[Apostolic Penitentiary|Major Penitentiary]] of the Catholic Church from 1256 to 1262. He was named [[Cardinal Bishop of Ostia]] in December 1261, but resigned a few months later and returned to his title of Santa Sabina.

Hugh was in residence in [[Orvieto]], Italy, with [[Pope Urban IV]], who had established a long-term residence there, when he died on 19 March 1263.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx4jWCTsqsQC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=hugh+of+saint+cher&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cr16V4ph5o&amp;sig=rmbjvHlMAD5zwEdsfc0EkQKQNIg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLs42qmLTbAhVPzlkKHXGTDNw4FBDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=hugh%20of%20saint%20cher&amp;f=false Principe C.S.B., Walter Henry.

Hugh of St-Cher (or, possibly, a team of scholars under his direction) was the first to compile a so-called "correctorium", a collection of variant readings of the Bible. His work, entitled "Correctio Biblie", survives in more than a dozen manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;For the chronological order of the correctoria, see [[Gilbert Dahan]], ‘Sorbonne II. Un correctoire biblique de la seconde moitié du XIIIe siècle’, in ''La Bibbia del XIII secolo: Storia del testo, storia dell’esegesi. Convegno della Società Internazionale per lo Studio del Medioevo Latino (SISMEL). Firenze, 1-2 giugno 2001'', ed. G. Cremascoli and F. Santi, Florence 2004, pp. 113-153, at pp. 113-114. For the influence of the Correctio Biblie on later correctoria, see Heinrich Denifle, ‘Die Handschriften der Bibel-Correctorien des 13. Jahrhunderts’, ''Archiv für Literatur- und Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters'' 4 (1888), pp. 263-311 and 471-601, at p. 544. See ibid., p. 264, for a list of manuscripts; another three have been added by Thomas Kaeppeli and Emilio Panella, ''Scriptores Ordinis Praedicatorum Medii Aevii'', 4 vols, Rome 1970-1993, II, p. 273 (no. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface to the "Correctio Biblie", Hugh writes that he has collated various Latin versions, biblical commentaries and as well as the Hebrew manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;The preface has been edited by Gilbert Dahan, ‘La critique textuelle dans les correctoires de la Bible du XIIIe siècle’, in ''Langages et philosophie: hommage à Jean Jolivet'', ed. A. de Libera, A. Elamrani-Jamal, A. Galonnier, Paris 1997, pp. 365-392, at pp. 386-387.&lt;/ref&gt; For his approach to the text of the Bible, he was criciticsed by [[William de la Mare]], author of another ''correctorium''.&lt;ref&gt;See Denifle, ‘Die Handschriften’, p. 296, n. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the aid of many of his Order, he edited a [[concordance of the Bible]] (''Concordantiae Sacrorum Bibliorum'' or ''Concordantiae S. Jacobi'') more thorough than the one attempted by [[Anthony of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/it-happened-today/3/19 "Hugh of St. Cher’s Concordance", ''Christian History'']&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion that we owe the present division of the chapters of the Vulgate to him is false.

His commentary on [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Book of Sentences]]'' exercised significant influence over subsequent generations of theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Bieniak, Magdalena. "The Sentences Commentary Of Hugh Of St.-Cher", ''Mediaeval Commentaries on the Sentences of Peter Lombard'', vol.2, Brill, 2009, {{ISBN|9789004181434}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote the ''Postillae in sacram scripturam juxta quadruplicem sensum, litteralem, allegoricum, anagogicum et moralem,'' published frequently in the 15th and 16th centuries. His ''Sermones de tempore et sanctis'' are apparently only extracts. His [[exegesis|exegetical]] works were published at [[Venice]] in 1754 in eight volumes.

'''Humility''' is the quality of being '''humble'''. Dictionary definitions accentuate humility as a low self-regard and sense of unworthiness.&lt;ref name="SnyderLopez2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. R. Snyder|author2=Shane J.

Humility is an outward expression of an appropriate inner, or self regard, and is contrasted with [[humiliation]] which is an imposition, often external, of [[shame]] upon a person.  Humility may be misappropriated as ability to suffer humiliation through self-denouncements which in itself remains focus on self rather than low self-focus.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer 2012"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schwarzer | first=Ralf | title=Personality, human development, and culture : international perspectives on psychological science | publisher=Psychology | location=Hove | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-415-65080-9 | pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Greenberg|author2=Sander L.

Humility, in various interpretations, is widely seen as a [[virtue]] which centers on low self-preoccupation, or unwillingness to put oneself forward, so it is in many religious and philosophical traditions, it contrasts with [[narcissism]], [[hubris]] and other forms of [[pride]] and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.

==Term==
The term "humility" comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:humilitas#Latin|humilitas]]'', a noun related to the adjective ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:humilis#Latin|humilis]]}}'', which may be translated as "humble", but also as "grounded", or "from the earth", since it derives from ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:humus#Latin|humus]]}}'' (earth). See the English ''[[humus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/humble "Humble" from Merriam-Webster], m-w.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "humble" may be related to feudal England where the lowest cuts of meat, or 'umbles' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallow-deer-project.net/img/upload/370/documents/1066%20and%20all%20that.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;,' that is to say whatever was left over when the upper classes had taken their parts, were provided to the lowest class of citizen.  The term 'humble pie,' meaning to exist in a lowly station, may derive from this definition.

==Mythology==
[[Aidos]], in Greek mythology, was the ''daimona'' (goddess) of shyness, shame, and humility.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Scheff and Suzanne Retzinger, Emotions and Violence: shame and rage in destructive conflicts, {{ISBN|0-595-21190-9}}, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; She was the quality that restrained human beings from wrong.

==Religious views of humility==

===Abrahamic===

====Judaism====
Rabbi Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]] states that in Judaism humility is an appreciation of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues.  It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher.  Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness of what one is and what one can achieve.  Rabbi [[Pini Dunner]] discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important.  In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, "And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man on the face of the earth." How is it possible to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater.  It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/160968/jewish/What-is-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1932762/jewish/Greatness-is-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/83807/jewish/On-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1218750/jewish/Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As illustrated in the person of [[Moses]], who leads the nation of [[Hebrews]] out of slavery in Egypt and to the “Promised Land”, humility is a sign of Godly strength and purpose, not weakness. Of this great leader, the Bible states, “For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth" ({{bibleref|Numbers|12:3}}).  Moses is venerated by Jewish, Christian and Muslim adherents alike.

Amongst the benefits of humility described in the [[Old Testament]], that is shared by many faiths, are [[honor]], [[wisdom]], [[prosperity]], the protection of the Lord and [[peace]]. In addition, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the  humble" ({{bibleref|Proverbs|3:34}})

====Christianity====

{{Quote box|quote=Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
Who, being in very nature God,
did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
rather, he made himself nothing
by taking the very nature of a servant,
being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man,
he humbled himself
by becoming obedient to death—
even death on a cross!
|source=Philippians 2:3-8, NIV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippians 2|url=http://biblehub.com/niv/philippians/2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;| align=right|width=30%}}

New Testament exhortations to humility are found in many places, for example "Blessed are the meek" ({{bibleref|Matthew|5}}), "He who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted" ({{bibleref|Matthew|23:12}}), as well as ({{bibleref|Philippians|2:1-17}}) and throughout the [[Epistle of James|Book of James]]. Also in [[Jesus|Jesus Christ's]] behavior in general and submission to unjust torture and execution in particular, are held up as examples of righteous humility: "Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him justly."{{bibleref|1 Peter|2:23}},&lt;ref name="Humility 1860, pp 598-599"/&gt;

[[C.S. Lewis]] writes, in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', that pride is the "anti-God" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: "Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind."&lt;ref&gt;Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis, {{ISBN|978-0-06-065292-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Lewis contends that, in Christian moral teaching, the opposite of pride is humility.  This is popularly illustrated by a  phrase wrongly attributed to Lewis, "Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less." This is an apparent paraphrase, by Rick Warren in "The Purpose Driven Life", of a passage found in "[[Mere Christianity]]:" Lewis writes, regarding the truly humble man, {{block quote|Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man he will be what most people call "humble" nowadays: he will not be a sort of greasy, smarmy person, who is always telling you that, of course, he is nobody. Probably all you will think about him is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who took a real interest in what you said to him. If you do dislike him it will be because you feel a little envious of anyone who seems to enjoy life so easily. He will not be thinking about humility: he will not be thinking about himself at all.}}

[[St. Augustine]] stresses the importance of humility in the study of the Bible, with the exemplars of a barbarian Christian slave, the apostle Paul, and the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8 (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'', prooem. 4–7 [hereafter ''DDC'']).  Both learner and teacher need to be humble, because they learn and teach what ultimately belongs to God (''DDC'', prooem. 7–8; 1 Cor. 4:7). Humility is a basic disposition of the interpreter of the Bible. The confidence of the exegete and preacher arises from the conviction that his or her mind depends on God absolutely (''DDC'', 1.1.1). Augustine argues that the interpreter of the Bible should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (''DDC'', 2.41.62).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine’s Hermeneutics and Homiletics in ''De doctrina christiana'' | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314/_Augustines_Hermeneutics_and_Homiletics_in_De_doctrina_christianae_Humiliation_Love_Sign_and_Discipline_Journal_of_Christian_Philosophy_17_2013_97-117 |pages=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humility is said to be a fit recipient of grace; according to the words of St. James, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" ({{bibleref|Proverbs|3:34}}, {{bibleref|1Peter|5:5}},{{bibleref|James|4:6}}.)

"True humility" is distinctly different from "false humility" which consists of deprecating one's own sanctity, gifts, talents, and accomplishments for the sake of receiving praise or adulation from others, as personified by the [[fictional character]] [[Uriah Heep]] created by [[Charles Dickens]]. In this context legitimate humility comprises the following behaviors and attitudes:
*Submitting to God and legitimate authority 
*Recognizing virtues and talents that others possess, particularly those that surpass one's own, and giving due honor and, when required, obedience
*Recognizing the limits of one's talents, ability, or authority.

The vices opposed to humility are: 
*[[Pride]]  
*Too great [[obsequiousness]] or abjection of oneself; this would be considered an excess of humility, and could easily be derogatory to one's office or holy character; or it might serve only to pamper pride in others, by unworthy flattery, which would occasion their sins of tyranny, arbitrariness, and arrogance. The virtue of humility may not be practiced in any external way that would occasion vices in others.&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

=====Catholicism=====

[[File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|thumb|240px| This ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[Domenico di Bartolo]] expresses the symbolic duality of an earthly woman with humility, as well as a [[Queen of Heaven|heavenly queen]].&lt;ref Name =Trinchieri&gt;''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&amp;pg=PA15 page 15]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Catholic]] texts view humility as annexed to the [[cardinal virtue]] of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name="Humility 1910, pp 543-544"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, " Humility"], newadvent.org&lt;/ref&gt; It is viewed as a potential part of temperance because temperance includes all those virtues that restrain or express the inordinate movements of our desires or appetites.&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

[[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] defines it as, "A virtue by which a man knowing himself as he truly is, abases himself. Jesus Christ is the ultimate definition of Humility."&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

Humility was a virtue extolled by Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], and this form of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety led to the artistic development of the ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' first used by them for [[Christian contemplation|contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iconography of Christian Art'' by Gertrud Schiller 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madonna (art)|Virgin]] of humility sits on the ground, or upon a low cushion, unlike the ''Enthroned Madonna'' representations.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt; This style of painting spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany and it became the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.&lt;ref name=Meiss&gt;''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pages 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], a 13th-century philosopher and theologian in the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] tradition, defines humility similarly as "the virtue of humility" that "consists in keeping oneself within one's own bounds, not reaching out to things above one, but submitting to one's superior" (Summa Contra Gent., bk. IV, ch. lv, tr. [[Joseph Rickaby]]).

====Islam====
In the [[Qur'an]], various Arabic words conveying the meaning of "humility" are used.  The very term "[[Islam]]" can be interpreted as "surrender (to God), humility”, from the triconsonantal root [[S-L-M]]; other words used are ''tawadu'' and ''khoshou'': &lt;!-- the word "humility" is a noun but the 2 Arabic words used before were verbs, so I changed these to nouns.  In order not to have a discussion about this, I will explain that I know what the previous editor had in mind. The person who used the verbs (which were the past tense of a male 3rd person singular) used what is customarily considered a "root" of the verb, which, for example, is used in finding a word in a dictionary.  This, however, was not warranted here because we just needed to have the exact translation of the noun "humility" --&gt;

{{quote|“The loftiest in status are those who do not know their own status, and the most virtuous of them are those who do not know their own virtue."

====Buddhism====
{{see also|Anatta}}
Buddhism is a religion of self-examination.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt; The natural aim of the Buddhist life is the state of [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], gradually cultivated through meditation and other spiritual practices. Humility, in this context, is a characteristic that is both an essential part of the spiritual practice, and a result of it.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|180, 183}} As a quality to be developed, it is deeply connected with the practice of Four Abodes ([[Brahmavihara]]): love-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} As a result of the practice, this cultivated humility is expanded by the wisdom acquired by the experience of ultimate emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) and non-self ([[Anatta]]).&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|181}} Humility, compassion, and wisdom are intrinsic parts of the state of enlightenment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} On the other hand, not being humble is an obstacle on the path of enlightenment which needs to be overcome.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|180}} In the [[Tipitaka]] (the Buddhist scriptures), criticizing others and praising oneself is considered a vice; but criticizing oneself and praising others is considered a virtue.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|date=1992|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=070070230X|edition=[Facsim. ed.].|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}} Attachment to the self, apart from being a vice in itself, also leads to other evil states, that create suffering.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|182}}

In the Tipitaka, in the widely known "[[Mangala Sutta]]", humility (''{{lang-pi|nivato}}'', literally: 'without air') is mentioned as one of the thirty-eight blessings in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|translator-last=Ñāṇamoli|translator-first=Bhikkhu|translator-link=Nanamoli Bhikkhu|title=The Minor Readings and The Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning|date=1960|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FCToAEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pali tradition, examples of humility that are often raised are the monk [[Sariputta|Sariputta Thera]], a leading disciple of the Buddha, and Hatthaka, a leading lay disciple. In later Pali texts and [[Atthakatha|Commentaries]], Sariputta Thera is depicted as a forgiving person, who is quick to apologize and accepting of criticism. In the ''[[suttas]]'' (discourses of the Buddha) Hatthaka is praised by the Buddha when he was unwilling to let other people know his good qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malalasekera|author-link= G P Malalasekera|first1=G.P.|title=Dictionary of Pāli proper names|volume=2|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1937|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass Publishers]]|location=Delhi|isbn=8120830229|edition=1st Indian|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/dic_idx.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhist practice]], humility is practiced in a variety of ways. For example, Japanese [[Soto Zen]] monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves to remind them of the connection of the monk's robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This in itself is a practice of humility.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|178}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tanabe|first1=Willa Jane|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|title=Robes and clothing|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|date=2004|publisher=[[Thomson Gale|Macmillan Reference USA, Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|page=732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Dharma / Sanathana Dharma====
In Sanskrit literature, the virtue of humility is explained with many terms, some of which use the root word, ''neti'' (sometimes spelled ''nati'', ''nti'', Sanskrit: नति).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=humility+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit translations for Humility] English-Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/132.html Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary], see explanation under the term नति [ nati ], France&lt;/ref&gt; "नति" comes from "न ति" or 'No "Me" / I am not'. Related words include ''viniti'' (विनति), ''samniti'' (संनति, humility towards), and the concept ''amanitvam'', listed as the first virtue in the [[Bhagwad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-13-06.html Bhagwad Gita 13.8-12] See transliteration, and two commentaries.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amanitvam'' is a fusion word for "pridelessness" and the virtue of "humility".&lt;ref&gt;''Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern'' edited by K. R. Sundararajan, Bithika Mukerji; {{ISBN|978-8120819375}}; see pages 403-405&lt;/ref&gt; Other related concepts are ''namrata'' (नम्रता), which means ''modest and humble behavior''.

Different scholars have varying interpretations for the concept of ''amanitvam'', humility, as virtue in the Bhagwad Gita.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS. Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373-395.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others.&lt;ref&gt;''BHAGAVAD GITA AS IT IS'' - By His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.&lt;/ref&gt; The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. Jopson explains ''amanitvam'', humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty-six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Jopson, ''Human Energy-Body Awareness: How Our Energy Body &amp; Vibrational Frequency Create Our Everyday Life'', {{ISBN|978-1466333413}}, see Divine Qualities under Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhawuk, D. P. (2011). Epistemology and Ontology of Indian Psychology. In Spirituality and Indian Psychology (pp. 163-184). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eknath Easwaran]] writes that the Gita's subject is "the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious",&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran, ''The Bhagavad Gita'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-58638-019-9}} p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow".&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran, ''The End of Sorrow: The Bahagavad Gita for Daily Living (vol 1)'' (1993), {{ISBN|978-0-915132-17-1}}  p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; To get in touch with your true self, whether you call that [[God]], [[Brahman]], etc., one has to let go of the ego.  The [[Sanskrit]] word [[Ahamkara]] literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.

[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] interprets the concept of ''humility'' in Hindu Dharma much more broadly, where humility is an essential virtue that must exist in a person for other virtues to emerge. To Mahatma Gandhi, Truth can be cultivated, as well as Love, but Humility cannot be cultivated. Humility has to be one of the starting points. He states, "Humility cannot be an observance by itself. For it does not lend itself to being practiced. It is however an indispensable test of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence)." Humility must not be confused with mere manners; a man may prostrate himself before another, but if his heart is full of bitterness for the other, it is not humility. Sincere humility is how one feels inside, it's a state of mind. A humble person is not himself conscious of his humility, states Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/swmgandhi/chap02.htm Humility The Gita and Satyagraha; The Philosophy of Non-violence and The Doctrine of the Sword], SELECTED WRITINGS OF MAHATMA GANDHI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen S. Hall, Wisdom, {{ISBN|978-0-307-26910-2}}; see Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swami Vivekananda|Swami Vivekananda]], one of the scholars of Hindu Dharma in the 19th century, argues that the concept of humility does not mean "crawling on all fours and calling oneself a sinner." In Vivekananda's Hindu Dharma, each human being being the Universal, recognizing and feeling oneness with everyone and everything else in the universe, without inferiority or superiority or any other bias, is the mark of humility.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Vivekananda, The Complete Works of the Swami Vivekananda, Volume 1 (1915); see page 343&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Dr. S Radhakrishnan]], humility in Hindu Dharma is the non-judgmental state of mind when we are best able to learn, contemplate and understand everyone and everything else.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan &amp; Muirhead, Contemporary Indian Philosophy (1936), Allen 7 Sons (London)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sikhism====
{{Quote box|quote=*Make contentment your ear-rings, humility your begging bowl, and meditation the ashes you apply to your body.

*Listening and believing with love and humility in your mind.
*In the realm of humility, the Word is Beauty.
*Modesty, humility and intuitive understanding are my mother-in-law and father-in-law. |source=Sayings of Guru Granth Sahib,  [[Guru Nanak]], First Guru Of Sikhism| align=right|width=30%}}

[[Guru Nanak]], the first [[Sikh gurus|Sikh guru]] was the prophet of humility.&lt;ref name="sggs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srigurugranthsahib.org/guru-nanak/prophet-of-humility.htm|title=Guru Nanak Dev Ji - Greatest Prophet of Humility|website=www.srigurugranthsahib.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Neecha Andar Neech Jaat Neechi Hu At Neech Nanak Tin Kai Sang Saath Vadian Sio Kia Rees. ''Translated it means Nanak is the companion of the lowest of the low and of the condemned lot. He has nothing in common with the high born''.|sign=[[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], 15|source=&lt;ref name="sggs" /&gt;}}

Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj said about Guru Nanak that Garibi, Nimrata, Humility is the Divine Flavour, the most wonderful fragrance of the Lotus Feet of Lord Guru Nanak.&lt;ref name="sggs1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babanandsinghsahib.org/rosary/fragrance.htm|title=Rosary of Divine Wisdom - Fragrance of The Holy Feet of Guru Nanak|website=www.babanandsinghsahib.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no place for Ego (referred to in Sikhism as Haumain) in the sphere of Divine Love, in the sphere of true Prema Bhagti. That is why in the House of Guru Nanak one finds Garibi, Nimrata, Humility reigning supreme. Guru Nanak was an Incarnation of Divine Love and a Prophet of True Humility.

According to Sikhism all people, equally, have to bow before God so there ought to be no hierarchies among or between people.  According to Nanak the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with [[Akal]] (The Timeless One), however, egotism is the biggest barrier in doing this. Using the guru's teaching remembrance of ''[[Nām Japō|nām]]'' (the divine Word)&lt;ref name="NaamSimran"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paths-Divine-Ancient-Indian-12/dp/1565182480/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385026816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=1565182480 | title=Paths to The Divine: Ancient and Indian: 12 | publisher=Council for Research in Values &amp; | author=McLean, George | date=15 Jun 2008 | location=1565182480 | pages=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;  leads to the end of egotism.  The immediate fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure. With humility they continue to meditate on the Lord, the treasure of excellence. The God-conscious being is steeped in humility. One whose heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility. Sikhism treats humility as a begging bowl before the god.

Sikhs extend this belief in equality, and thus humility, towards all faith:  "all religious traditions are equally valid and capable of enlightening their followers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sikhism|edition= |last= Singh Kalsi|first= Sewa|year= 2007|publisher= Bravo Ltd.|location= London|isbn= 978-1-85733-436-4|page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Vaṇḍ Chakkō|sharing]] with others Guru Nanak inspired people to earn an honest living without exploitation and also the need for [[Naam Japna|remembrance]] of the divine name (God). Guru Nanak described living an "active, creative, and practical life" of "truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity" as being higher than a purely contemplative life.&lt;ref name="Marwha"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROtEr_QdB3sC&amp;pg=PA205 | title=Colors of Truth, Religion Self and Emotions | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | author=Marwha, Sonali Bhatt | year=2006 | location=New Delhi | pages=205 | isbn=818069268X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baba Nand Singh Ji====
Baba Nand Singh Sahib is renowned as the most humble Sikh Saint in the history of Sikhism. Once the disciples of Baba Harnam Singh Ji, the spiritual preceptor of Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj asked him how much power He had transmitted to Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj to which He replied&lt;ref name="sggs2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babanandsinghsahib.org/powers/index.htm|title=Repository of Infinite Divine Powers|website=www.babanandsinghsahib.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=''"Rikhi Nand Singh holds in His hand Infinite Divine Powers. By just opening His fist He can create as many such-like universes as He likes and by closing the same fist can withdraw all those universes unto Himself.''

''But the whole beauty is that being the supreme Repository of all the Infinite Divine Powers, He claims to be nothing and is so humble."''|sign=Baba Harnam Singh Ji Maharaj}}

Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj was humbler than the humblest in spirit and He outshines everyone at the pinnacle of all spiritual glory.

Sri Guru Arjan Sahib says in Sukhmani Sahib:

{{Quote|text="Brahm Giani Sab Shresht Ka Karta
Brahm Giani Sad Jiwe Nahin Marta
...
Brahm Giani Ka Sagal Akar
Brahm Giani Aap Nirankar."''Translated it means: A true Brahm Giani is the creator of the whole universe. Brahm Giani lives through eternity; He never dies.Brahm Giani pervades the whole manifest creation. Brahm Giani is Himself the formless Universal Lord.''|sign=[[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], 273|source=&lt;ref name="sggs2" /&gt;}}

{{Quote|text=He who is the Highest is the Lowest. Highest in the Lowest is the Real Highest.|sign=Baba Narinder Singh Ji}}

====Meher Baba====
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] held that humility is one of the foundations of devotional life: "Upon the altar of humility we must offer our prayers to God."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''3'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 129. {{ISBN|978-1-880619-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baba also described the power of humility to overcome hostility: "True humility is strength, not weakness. It disarms antagonism and ultimately conquers it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1957). ''Life at Its Best''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 25-26. {{ISBN|978-0-525-47434-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Baba emphasized the importance of being humble when serving others: "''One of the most difficult things to learn is to render service without bossing, without making a fuss about it and without any consciousness of high and low. In the world of spirituality, humility counts at least as much as utility''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1933). ''The Sayings of Shri Meher Baba.'' London: The Circle Editorial Committee. pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taoism====
{{Quote box|quote=Here are my three treasures.&lt;br/&gt;
Guard and keep them! &lt;br/&gt;
The first is pity; the second, frugality; the third, refusal to be "foremost of all things under heaven". &lt;br/&gt;
For only he that pities is truly able to be brave; &lt;br/&gt;
Only he that is frugal is able to be profuse. &lt;br/&gt;
Only he that refuses to be foremost of all things &lt;br/&gt;
Is truly able to become chief of all Ministers. &lt;br/&gt;
At present your bravery is not based on pity, nor your profusion on frugality, nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death. |source=(translation of the [[Tao Te Ching]]) by [[Arthur Waley]] 1958:225| align=right|width=25%}}

Humility, in Taoism, is defined as a refusal to assert authority or a refusal to be first in anything and that the act of daring, in itself, is a refusal of wisdom and a rush to enjoin circumstances before you are ready.  Along with [[compassion]] and [[frugality]], humility is one the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|three treasures]] (virtues) in the possession of those who follow the  [[Tao]].&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"/&gt;

The treasure of humility, in Chinese is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: ''Bugan wei tianxia xian'' 不敢為天下先 "not dare to be first/ahead in the world". 
Ellen Chen notes&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"&gt;Lao Tzu, Jane English, and Gia-Fu Feng (1997), Tao Te Ching, Vintage Books, {{ISBN|978-0679776192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Chen, Ellen M., 1989, ''The Te Tao Ching: A New Translation with Commentary'', Paragon House.&lt;/ref&gt; that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, also according to the [[Tao Te Ching]] (77.4) a wise person acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it: – he does not wish to display his superiority.&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"/&gt;

===Wicca===

In the numerous traditions of initiatory Wicca, called in the U.S.A. '''British Traditional Wicca''', four paired &amp; balanced qualities are recommended in liturgical texts as having come from the Wiccan Goddess:

{{Quote|text=''"…let there be beauty and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, mirth and reverence within you."''|sign=Doreen Valiente, ''The Charge of the Goddess,'' prose version}}

In the matter of humility, this deific instruction appropriately pairs being honorable with being humble. Characteristically, this Wiccan "virtue" is balanced by its partner virtue.

==Philosophical views of humility==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s view of humility has been defined as "that meta-attitude that constitutes the moral agent's proper perspective on himself as a dependent and corrupt but capable and dignified rational agent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=4881|title=Kant and the Ethics of Humility|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's notion of humility relies on the centrality of truth and rational thought leading to proper perspective and can therefore be seen as [[emergence|emergent]].

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] is attributed as suggesting that attempting to sustain [[truth]] without humility is doomed to become an "arrogant caricature" of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060630013653/http://www.geocities.com/rkvenkat/chastity.html Gandhi on Brahmacharya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], geocities.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/epigrams/h.htm Epigrams from Gandhiji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], mkgandhi.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Cohon, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/ Hume's Moral Philosophy] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;André Vauchez (2002), Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, see article on ''Humility'', James Clarke &amp; Co, {{ISBN|9780227679319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many religions and philosophers view humility as a virtue, some have been critical of it, seeing it as opposed to [[individualism]].

[[Nietzsche]] views humility as a [[strategy]] used by the weak to avoid being destroyed by the strong.  In ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' he writes: "When stepped on, a worm doubles up. That is clever. In that way he lessens the probability of being stepped on again. In the language of morality:  humility."{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} He believed that his idealized [[Übermensch]] would be more apt to roam around unfettered by pretensions of humility, proud of his stature and power, but not reveling idly in it, and certainly not displaying [[hubris]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  But, if so, this would mean the pretension aspect of this kind of humility is more akin to [[obsequiousness]] and to other kinds of pretentious humility.

==Humility and leadership==
Recent research suggests that humility is a quality of certain types of leaders. For example, [[James Collins (bioengineer)|Jim Collins]] and his colleagues found that a certain type of leader, whom they term "level 5", possesses humility and fierce resolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Collins |first=J. |year=2001 |title= Level 5 leadership: The triumph of humility and fierce resolve |work=Harvard Business Review |pages= 66–76 |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |url=http://www.hr-newcorp.com/articles/Level5%20Leadership_Jim%20Collins.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229150239/http://www.hr-newcorp.com/articles/Level5%20Leadership_Jim%20Collins.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humility is being studied as a trait that can enhance leadership effectiveness. The research suggests that humility is multi-dimensional and includes self-understanding and awareness, openness, and perspective taking.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J. A., Brotheridge, C. M., &amp; Urbanski, J. C. (2005). Bringing humility to leadership: Antecedents and consequences of leader humility. Human Relations, 58, 1323-1350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, R., Marrone, J.

{{Anthropology}}

'''Inalienable possessions''' (or '''immovable property''') are things such as land or objects that are symbolically identified with the groups that own them and so cannot be permanently severed from them. [[Landed estate]]s in the [[Middle Ages]], for example, had to remain intact and even if sold, they could be reclaimed by blood kin. As a legal classification, inalienable possessions date back to Roman times. According to Barbara Mills, "Inalienable possessions are objects made to be kept (not exchanged), have symbolic and economic power that cannot be transferred, and are often used to authenticate the ritual authority of corporate groups".&lt;ref name="Mills 2004 238"/&gt; 

[[Marcel Mauss]] first described inalienable possessions in ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'', discussing [[potlatch]]es, a kind of gift-giving feast held in communities of many [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is even incorrect to speak in these cases of transfer. They are [[loans]] rather than sales or true abandonment of possessions. Among the [[Kwakiutl]] a certain number of objects, although they appear at the [[potlatch]], cannot be disposed of. In reality these pieces of "property" are [[wikt:sacrum#Latin|sacra]] that a family divests itself of only with great reluctance and sometimes never.&lt;ref name="Mauss2000"&gt;Mauss 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Annette Weiner]] broadened the application of the category of property outside the European context with her book ''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'', focussing on a range of Oceanic societies from [[Polynesia]] to [[Papua New Guinea]] and testing existing theories of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and marriage exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=131–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also applies the concept to explain examples such as the [[Kula ring]] in the [[Trobriand Islands]], which was made famous by [[Bronisław Malinowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explores how such possessions enable hierarchy by establishing a source of lasting social difference. She also describes practices of loaning inalienable possessions as a way of either "temporarily making kin of non-kin" or garnering status.

== ''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'' ==
''Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving'' is a book by anthropologist [[Annette Weiner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner was a Professor of Anthropology and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts at [[New York University]], and served as president of the [[American Anthropological Association]]. She died in 1997.

The book focuses on a range of Oceanic societies from Polynesia to Papua New Guinea to test existing theories of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] (gift-giving) and marriage exchange. The book is also important for introducing a consideration of gender in the [[Gift economy|gift-giving debate]] by placing women at the heart of the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=Barbara|title=The establishment and defeat of hierarchy: Inalienable possessions and the history of collective prestige structures in the Pueblo Southwest|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2004|volume=106|issue=2|pages=239–41|doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.2.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finds inalienable possessions at the root of many Polynesian kingdoms, such as [[Hawaii]] and [[Samoa]]. She also credits the original idea of "inalienable possessions" to Mauss, who classified two categories of goods in Samoa, ''Oloa'' and ''le'Tonga''─immovable and movable goods exchanged through marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Mills praised her investigation of how "inalienable possessions are simultaneously used to construct and defeat hierarchy", saying it "opens a boxful of new theoretical and methodological tools for understanding [[social inequality]] in past and present societies."&lt;ref name="Mills 2004 238"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=Barbara|title=The establishment and defeat of hierarchy: Inalienable possessions and the history of collective prestige structures in the Pueblo Southwest|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2004|volume=106|issue=2|page=238|doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.2.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cosmological authentication==
[[File:Maori cloak.jpg|left|thumb |Young Maori woman wearing a high status feather cloak indicating nobility]]
Weiner states that certain objects become inalienable only when they have acquired "cosmological authentication"; that is,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What makes a possession inalienable is its exclusive and cumulative identity with a particular series of owners through time.  Its history is authenticated by fictive or true genealogies, origin myths, sacred ancestors, and gods.  In this way, inalienable possessions are transcendent treasures to be guarded against all the exigencies that might force their loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She gives the example of a [[Māori people|Māori]] Sacred Cloak and says that when a woman wears it "she is more than herself – that she is her ancestors." Cloaks act as conduits for a person's hau or life giving spirit.  The hau can bring strength or even knowledge potentially but a person may also have the risk of losing their hau. "An inalienable possession acts as a stabilizing force against change because its presence authenticates cosmological origins, kinship, and political histories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the Cloak actually stands for the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These possessions then are the most potent force in the effort to subvert change, while at the same time they stand as the corpus of change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Sillitoe queries the supposed identification of these objects with persons. He states that these objects are "durable wealth [that] is collective property that is continually in circulation among persons who have temporary possession of it. In this view, transactable objects belong to society as a whole and are not inalienable possessions associated with certain persons. An analogy in Western culture is sporting trophies, such as championship boxing belts owned by all the clubs comprising the association that controls the competition in which constituent club members compete, and which pass for agreed periods of time into the possession of particular champions, changing hands as new champions emerge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sillitoe|first=Paul|title=Why Spheres of Exchange|journal=Ethnology|year=2006|volume=45|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/4617561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theuws argues that "Over time, objects acquire new meanings and what was once a humble pot may become a sacred vessel." This transformation in the object is the result of [[ritualization]] or a change in cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Topographies of Power in the Early Middle Ages Maastricht as a center of power in the early Middle Ages|year=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Amsterdam|pages=201–2|author=Theuws, Frans|authorlink=Maastricht as a centre of power|editors=Theuws, Frans, Van Rhijn, Carine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, "[[Ritual Knowledge]] is often a source of political power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spielmann|first=K.A.|title=Feasting, Craft Specialization, and the Ritual Mode of Production in Small-Scale Societies|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2002|volume=104|issue=1|pages=195–207|doi=10.1525/aa.2002.104.1.195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these possessions may also become destabilizing, as elites reconstruct those sacred histories to identify themselves with the past; for example, [[Gandhi]] invoked the traditional hand spinning traditional cloth, khadi, to contest British rule, which [[Nehru]] referred to as Gandhi's "livery of freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keeping-while-giving==

Inalienable possessions are nonetheless frequently drawn into exchange networks. The subtitle of Weiner's book is "The paradox of keeping-while-giving"; they are given as gifts (not sold) yet still retain a tie to their owners. These gifts are not like those given in regular [[gift giving]] in the West on birthdays for example.  Rather, these gifts can't be re-sold for money by the receiver because the value and the significance of the gift cannot be alienated or disengaged from its relationship to those whose inalienable possession it is.

=== Property value, obligations and rights ===

These inalienable possessions are a form of property that is inalienable, yet they can be exchanged. Property can be thought of as a [[bundle of rights]] – the right to use something, the right to collect rent from someone, the right to extract something (as in oil drilling), the right to hunt within a particular territory.  That ownership may be a bundle of rights held in common by groups of individuals or lineages. The property thus becomes impossible to separate from the group owning it.   "To give in this instant means to transfer without alienating, or to use the language of the West, to give means to cede the right of use without ceding actual ownership".  In other words, Weiner is contending that an economy built around the moral code of gift giving provides the giver rights over what he/she has given and in turn "subsequently benefits from a series of advantages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when one accepts a gift one also accepts that the giver now has rights over the receiver.

=== Reconfiguring exchange theory ===
Weiner begins by re-examining Mauss' explanation for the return gift, the "spirit of the gift." The "spirit of the gift" was a translation of a Maori word, ''hau''. Weiner demonstrates that not ''all'' gifts must be returned. Only gifts that are "immoveable property" can become inalienable gifts. She further argues that inalienable possessions gain the "mana" (spirit) of their possessors, and so become associated with them. These goods are frequently produced by women, like the feather cloak above. The more prominent the woman, the more mana the object is thought to inherit. The longer the kin group can maintain the object in their possession, the more valuable it becomes; but it must also be periodically displayed to assert the group's status, and thus becomes an object of desire for outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=44–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The sibling incest taboo ===
Weiner argues that the role of women in the exchange of inalienable possessions has been seriously underestimated. [[Kinship]] theory as developed by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], used the "[[incest taboo|sibling incest taboo]]" to argue that women themselves are [[Alliance theory|objects of exchange]] between lineage groups. Men had to find women outside their kin groups to marry hence they "lost" their sisters in order to gain wives. Weiner shows that the focus on women as wives ignores the importance of women as sisters (who are not "lost" as a result of becoming wives). Women produce inalienable possessions which they may take with them when they marry out; the inalienable possession, however, must be reclaimed by her brother after her death in order to maintain the status of the kin group. In comparing Hawaii, Samoa and the Trobriands, she argues that the more stratified a society is by ranked differences, the more important inalienable possessions produced by sisters become. The more stratified a society becomes (as in Hawaii), the closer the sibling bond ("sibling intimacy"). In these cases, women are critical to the "cosmological authentication" of inalienable possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=66–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The defeat of hierarchy ===
A critical part of Weiner's argument is that the ability to keep inalienable possessions outside of exchange is a source of difference, and hence brings high status. The development of Polynesian kingdoms is an example. She points to the inalienable possessions of the Australian aborigines, however, to demonstrate how the creation of hierarchy can be defeated. Australian inalienable possessions are given  cosmological authentication through their religious beliefs in the [[Dreamtime|Dreaming]].

{{quote|As an [[ideology]], The Dreaming is [[Subjective idealism|immaterial]] but in another sense, The Dreaming flourishes because it consists of material and verbal possessions—myths, names, songs, ceremonies, and sacred objects inherited from one generation to the next. In this way, The Dreaming itself encompasses vast inalienable possessions that are authenticated by the very cosmology under which they are produced. These possessions created in and authenticated by The Dreaming circulate from one person or group to another in a limited way. The possibilities of transmission in the face of the canon for guardianship establish for ritual leaders a domain of authority that in certain situations leads to a formalized position of rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Weiner points out that the same gender relations of "sibling intimacy" affect the exchange of these inalienable objects. Women as sisters and women as wives provide the conduit for the gifting and return gifting of these goods, allowing the givers to build prestige. However, insofar as these inalienable possessions lose their cosmological authentication, these social hierarchies lose intergenerational longevity. Because the Dreaming itself is an inalienable possession kept secret by clan elders, it can be lost and hierarchy defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=98–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The paradox of keeping-while-giving ===
[[File:Kula bracelet.jpg|thumbnail|A Kula bracelet from the Trobriand Islands.]]
Weiner has used the term to categorize the many [[Kula ring|Kula]] valuables of the [[Trobriand]] islanders who view those objects as culturally imbued with a spiritual sense of the gift giver.  Thus, when they are transferred from one individual or group to another the objects reserve meaningful bonds associated with that of the giver and their lineage. The shell bracelets and necklaces given in exchange each have their own histories, and are thus ranked on the basis of who they have been exchanged to. There were, as well, less well known shells called ''kitomu'' which were individually owned (rather than being part of lineage history), which would be given to temporarily please a disappointed trade partner expecting a more valuable shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kula trade was organized differently in the more hierarchical parts of the Trobriand islands. There, only chiefs were allowed to engage in Kula exchange. In hierarchical areas, individuals can earn their own kitomu shells, whereas in less hierarchical areas, they are always subject to the claims of matrilineal kin. And lastly, in the hierarchical areas, Kula necklaces and bracelets are saved for external exchange only; stone axe blades are used internally. In less hierarchical areas, exchange partners may lose their valuables to internal claims. As a result, most seek to exchange their kula valuables with chiefs, who thus become the most successful players. The chiefs have saved their Kula valuables for external trade, and external traders seek to trade with them before they lose their valuables to internal claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kula exchange is the only way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. It is for this reason that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Godelier on ''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''==
[[Maurice Godelier]] has further elaborated on Annette Weiner's ideas on inalienable possessions in ''The Enigma of the Gift''. He derived two theses from Weiner, to which he adds a third.

'''First Thesis:''' As discussed above, even in a society that is dominated by a gift-giving economic and moral code, the interplay of gift and counter-gift doesn't completely dominate the social sphere, as there must be some objects which are kept and not given. These things, such as valuables, [[talismans]], knowledge, and rites, confirm  identities and their continuity over time.  Moreover, they acknowledge differences of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of individuals or groups linked by various kinds of exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second Thesis:'''  Women or the feminine element also exercise power by providing legitimation and redistributing  of political and religious power among groups in a society.  Godelier contends that Weiner refocuses attention on the role of women in constructing and legitimizing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=33–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While women, as wives, are frequently lowered in status, as sisters, they frequently retain equal status to their brothers.  For example, in [[Polynesia]], the woman as a sister appears to control those goods associated with the [[sacred]], the ancestors, and the gods.

To this, Godelier adds a third thesis.

'''Third thesis:''' The social is not just the sum of alienable and inalienable goods, but is brought into existence by the difference and inter-dependence of these two spheres of exchange. Maintaining society thus requires not ''keeping-while-giving'', but "''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''."&lt;ref name="Godelier 1999 36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related anthropologists on exchange theory ==
*[[Emile Durkheim]] "describes how exchange involves an intensive bonding more formidable than mere economic relations.  [[Social cohesiveness]] occurs because one person is always dependent on another to achieve a feeling of completeness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This comes into being via the domain of the sacred [[ritual]] that involves communal participation even as it encompasses the moment in a higher order of sacredness.
*[[Bronisław Malinowski]] wrote ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]''.  Malinowski was a pioneer of ethnographic fieldwork in  the Trobriand Islandes and researched [[Kula ring|Kula]] exchange.  His work was later re-analyzed by Mauss and subsequently by other anthropologists.
*[[Marcel Mauss]] wrote ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]''.  He was a pioneer in the study of gift exchange. Mauss was concerned only with the relations formed by the circulation of things that men produce, and not with the relations that men form while they produce things. He is concerned, in particular, with why people give gifts, and why they feel the obligation to make a return.  In fact, he contended that [[inalienable right|inalienability]] is based on or legitimized by the [[belief]] that there is present in the object a power, a spirit, a spiritual reality that binds it to the giver, and which accompanies the object wherever it goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This spirit then wishes to return to its source the original giver.
*[[Marshall Sahlins]] wrote ''Stone Age Economics''.  Sahlins disagreed with Mauss on several points and contended that "the freedom to gain at others' expense is not envisioned by the relations and forms of exchange."  Moreover, "The material flow underwrites or initiates social relations…. Persons and groups confront each other not merely as distinct interests but with the possible inclination and certain right to physically prosecute these interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahlins|first=Marshall|title=Stone Age Economics|year=1972|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|pages=149–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] applauded Marcel Mauss for his efforts even as he criticized him of not perceiving that "the primary fundamental phenomena (of social life) is exchange itself."  He believed that "society is better understood in terms of [[language]] than from the standpoint of any other [[paradigm]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, he thought that [[anthropologists]] and [[ethnographers]], particularly Mauss, were becoming confused by the languages of those they ethnographically studied, resulting in obscure theories that didn't really make sense.  He advocated [[Structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] analysis in an attempt to clear up certain confusions caused by Mauss' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Maurice Godelier]] wrote ''The Enigma of the Gift.''  Godelier expanded on Weiner's work  by maintaining that society requires not ''keeping-while-giving'', but "''keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping''."&lt;ref name="Godelier 1999 36"/&gt;

== Importance ==

[[Economist]]s have often shunned the idea of pondering exactly why people want goods.&lt;ref name="Douglas1979"&gt;Douglas 1979&lt;/ref&gt; [[Good (economics)|Goods]] serve many purposes beyond what classical economists might theorize. Goods can serve as systems of [[social communication]] according to [[Mary Douglas]], a prominent anthropologist.&lt;ref name="Douglas1979"/&gt; In fact, [[anthropology]] in general is important to [[economics]] because it talks about the socio-cultural relationships in [[economy]] and economy itself as a [[cultural system]] that is not just market-based.&lt;ref name="Erem2007"&gt;Erem 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, entire industries are often based on gift giving such as the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, gift-giving plays an important role in the [[cultural development]] of how social and [[business]] relations evolve in major economies such as in the case of the Chinese.

'''John Anderson''' (1 November 1893 – 6 July 1962) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] philosopher who occupied the post of [[Challis Professor]] of Philosophy at [[Sydney University]] from 1927 to 1958. He founded the empirical brand of philosophy known as [[Australian realism]] (see [[Scottish realism]]).

Anderson's promotion of '[[Freethought|free thought]]' in all subjects, including politics and morality, was controversial and brought him into constant conflict with the august senate of the university. However, he is credited with educating a generation of influential 'Andersonian' thinkers and activists—some of whom helped to place Sydney in the forefront of the '[[sexual revolution]]' of the 1950s and 1960s.

To Anderson, an acceptable philosophy must have significant 'sweep' and be capable of challenging and moulding ideas in every aspect of intellect and society.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in [[Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire|Stonehouse]], Lanarkshire, Scotland and educated at the former [[Hamilton Academy]] from which school he won a bursary to attend the [[University of Glasgow]] in the university's Bursary Competition of 1911.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070060b.htm Online Dictionary of Australian Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/anderson/album.html University of Sydney – John Anderson Archive – photograph – winners of the University of Glasgow Bursary competition, Hamilton Academy 1911]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 20 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson was listed among notable former pupils of Hamilton Academy in a 1950 magazine article on the school.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association Magazine, February 1950, feature on Hamilton Academy in the article series 'Famous Scottish Schools'&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother was William Anderson, Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University College]], 1921 to his death in 1955, and described as "the most dominant figure in New Zealand philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Weblin, Mark "[http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/anderson/contributors/weblin/tnl/tnl03.pdf Idealism in Australia and New Zealand]" ''The Northern Line'' No. 3 May 2007, p 6. Retrieved 17 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson graduated [[MA (Scotland)|MA]] from Glasgow University in 1917, with first-class honours in Philosophy (Logic and Moral Philosophy), and first-class honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. After graduation, he was awarded the Ferguson Scholarship in Philosophy and the Shaw Philosophical Fellowship, the examinations for which were open to graduates of any of the four Scottish universities.&lt;ref name=smhdec1926&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16338321?searchTerm=%22Professor%20John%20Anderson%22%20&amp;searchLimits= The Challis Chair: Prof John Anderson's Appointment] ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 7 December 1926, p 12&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as Assistant in Philosophy at the [[University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire|University College, Cardiff]] (Cardiff) (1917–19), in Moral Philosophy and Logic in the University of Glasgow (1919–20) and lectured in Logic and Metaphysics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1920–26).&lt;ref name=smhdec1926/&gt;

==Social theory==
After arriving in Sydney in 1927 he associated with the [[Communist Party of Australia]] and contributed to their journals, sometimes under a nom de plume&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; but, by about 1932 he began to believe that communism under [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]] was a dictatorship with no room for workers' control or participation. He then became aligned with the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] movement for a period of time. But "[h]e could not put up any longer with dialectical materialism or with the servile state which he saw was being imposed by the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49425870 Russia: Is She Approaching a Crisis?] ''[[The Northern Standard]]'', 2 August 1935, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson later abandoned authoritarian forms of socialism and became what would today be called a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]]—an opponent of all forms of [[authoritarianism]]. Sometimes he described himself as an [[anarchism|anarchist]] but, after the 1930s, he gave up his earlier political [[Utopian socialism|utopianism]].

==Advocacy of academic freedom==
As Sydney University's Challis Professor of Philosophy, Anderson was a formidable champion of the principle of academic freedom from authoritarian intervention. For example, he fought a successful battle to end the role of the [[British Medical Association]] in setting course standards and student quotas in the medical school. He also railed against the presence on campus of a military unit—the [[Sydney University Regiment]]—and lived to see the day in 1960 when the regiment's campus HQ was destroyed by fire. (The regiment was subsequently rehoused at a new facility on university-owned land at [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://regimental-books.com.au/sydney-university-regiment-presentation-of-the-queens-and-regimental-colours-p-2700.html Sydney University Regiment Presentation of the Queen's and Regimental Colours] Historical exposition at Regimental Books website&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson was censured by the [[Sydney University]] Senate in 1931 after criticising the role of war memorials in sanctifying war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21703627 University professor censured] ''The Brisbane Courier'' 22 July 1931, p.19, at Trove, National Library of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson's [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28040568 reply to the Senate] was published the same week. (''Sydney Morning Herald'', 24 July 1931, p.10, at Trove, National Library of Australia)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he was censured by the Parliament of [[New South Wales]] after arguing that religion has no place in schools. He founded the Sydney University Free Thought Society&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16792550 No Political Freedom. Professor Anderson's Address.]" ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 11 July 1931, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; which ran from 1931 to 1951. He was president of the society throughout that period.

It is legendary that the university's Senate, accepting that it could not realise its desire to sack the controversial Challis Professor, sought to reduce Anderson's stature and influence by creating a new chair of "Moral and Political Philosophy" to which [[Alan Stout (philosopher)|Alan Stout]] was appointed.&lt;ref name=Stoutobit&gt;Armstrong D. M. [http://www.humanities.org.au/Resources/Downloads/Fellows/Obituaries/AlanKerStout.pdf Obituary: Alan Ker Stout (1900–1983)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912210501/http://www.humanities.org.au/Resources/Downloads/Fellows/Obituaries/AlanKerStout.pdf |date=12 September 2009 }} in Australian Academy of the Humanities [http://www.humanities.org.au/Portals/0/documents/Fellows/Obituaries/AlanKerStout.pdf Obituary: Alan Ker Stout, 1900–1983] at Australian Academy of the Humanities, [http://www.humanities.org.au/Portals/0/documents/Publications/Proceedings/Proc1983.pdf Proceedings 1982-3] pp.106–109&lt;/ref&gt; This purpose was not achieved, as Anderson continued to lecture on ethics and politics. Stout (who had been urged by Anderson to apply for the position) was a steady admirer and supporter of the Challis Professor and declined to undercut his prestige in any way. The result was that Sydney gained a second prestigious and personable philosopher who "brought a quick intelligence, intellectual grasp, a flair for putting things simply and clearly, together with a genuine respect for the views of others and readiness to appreciate their point of view". On Anderson's retirement, the two departments were merged under Stout as 'the Professor of Philosophy'.&lt;ref name=Stoutobit/&gt;

==Thought and influence==

As a committed empiricist, Anderson argued that there is only one realm of "being" and it can be best understood through science and naturalistic philosophy. He asserted that there is no supernatural god and that there are no non-natural realms along the lines of Platonic ideals. He rejected all notions that knowledge could be obtained by means other than descriptions of facts and any belief that revelation or mysticism could be sources for obtaining truth. He was arguing that traditional Christian concepts of good and evil were only meant for slaves and that, in actuality, the idea of morality was empty. For Anderson, the term "good" was valid when applied objectively to human activities which were free, critical and creative but the more common subjective applications were to be avoided or exposed as deceptive. Not surprisingly, Anderson's influence was both extensive and controversial as he constantly examined and fearlessly criticised hallowed beliefs and institutions.
&lt;blockquote&gt;He is, arguably, the most important philosopher who has worked in Australia. Certainly he was the most important in both the breadth and depth of influence. Among the philosophers who got their original intellectual formation from Anderson are [[John Passmore]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], [[A. J. Baker|A.J. ('Jim') Baker]], [[David Stove]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|myself]]. There are lots more. But for every student who became a philosopher there were far, far, more in the law, in medicine, in journalism, in other academic disciplines, that were profoundly influenced by him. I am inclined to think that, especially in the thirties and forties of the last century, Anderson was the person who set the agenda, and set the tone, for intellectual discussion in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong D M Address on 9 July 2005 [http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=597 ''John Anderson Remembered'']&lt;/ref&gt; – David Armstrong (2005)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anderson's influence has spread through his personal impact on several generations of students, the "Andersonians", who include the philosophers named above, together with [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Eugene Kamenka]]; the [[World War II]] organiser [[Alfred Conlon|Alf Conlon]], many members of the [[Sydney Push]], Tonga's 'I. [[Futa Helu]], and jurist [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]], later to be Australia's best-remembered governor-general.

==Free Thought Society and the Sydney Libertarians==
Anderson's insistence on unceasing inquiry and criticism became central to the intellectual principles of the university's Libertarian Society which supplanted the Free Thought Society in the early 1950s and provided a philosophic platform for the much broader subculture known as "[[Sydney Push|the Push]]" throughout the 1960s. He was a defender of free speech and was critical of the Australian government's bans on certain political publications (1928). He advocated religious and sexual freedoms and free discussion of issues in an era when mention of [[taboo]] subjects commonly resulted in angry public condemnation by prominent moralists.

After the Second World War, however, Anderson began exhibiting more conservative views. Jim Baker interprets this latter stage not so much as "a definite change in his overall thinking than ... an alteration of emphasis and interest".&lt;ref name=bakerasp&gt;{{cite book|title=Anderson's Social Philosophy: The Social Thought and Political Life of Professor John Anderson|last=Baker|first=A J|publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson 1979|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p130}} In other words, according to Baker, while Anderson's political positions changed over time his philosophy remained constant. To many, however, it seemed that Anderson was departing from his pluralism. During the 1949 coal miners' strike, for instance, he supported the government's action in using troops as strikebreakers.&lt;ref name=bakerasp/&gt; At a Free Thought Society meeting in August 1950 he refused to oppose conscription for the war in Korea.&lt;ref name=Coombs&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex and Anarchy: The Life and Death of the Sydney Push|last=Coombs|first=Anne|publisher=Viking 1996|location=Ringwood, Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p12}} In 1951 he refused to allow students to use the Free Thought Society to canvass the 'No' case for [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]]' attempt to ban the Communist Party in the [[referendum]] of that year.&lt;ref name=Coombs/&gt;{{rp|p130}} This was the last straw for many Freethinkers; Anderson's apparent authoritarianism caused most to abandon the Free Thought Society and to establish the Libertarian Society. (It must be pointed out that Anderson did not support the banning of the Communist Party—in fact he attacked the proposal.&lt;ref name=Weblin&gt;Weblin, Mark (ed.), ''A Perilous and Fighting Life: From Communist to Conservative: The Political Writings of Professor John Anderson'' (North Melbourne: Pluto Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p18}}) The Free Thought Society held its last meeting in 1951.&lt;ref name=bakerasp/&gt;{{rp|p130}} The Libertarian Society functioned from 1952 to 1969.&lt;ref name=bakerasp/&gt;{{rp|p144}}

Anderson broke off contact with the former disciples who formed the Libertarian Society and never associated with [[Sydney Push|"Push"]] people who routinely sang his praises along with the bawdy songs he had imported to his new country.&lt;ref&gt;''Ballad of Professor John Glaister'' is one example, some of the words of which have been published in ''Snatches &amp; Lays'' (Sun Books, Melbourne, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; However, even after retirement in 1958 and to the brink of his death in 1962, he was seen daily in his study, continuing his work and reviewing earlier work. Among his last publications were ''Classicism'' (1960), ''Empiricism and Logic'' (1962) and ''Relational Arguments'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.

[[File:Kazimierz Łyszczyński.jpg|Belarusian stamp in honor of the 375th anniversary of the birth of Kazimierz Łyszczyński (artist: N. Ryzy)|thumb]]

'''Kazimierz Łyszczyński''' ({{IPA-pl|kaˈʑimjɛʂ wɨˈʂt͡ʂɨɲskʲi}}; March 4, 1634  – March 30, 1689), also known in English as '''Casimir Liszinski''', was a [[szlachta|Polish-Lithuanian nobleman]], landowner in [[Brest Litovsk Voivodeship]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[philosopher]], and soldier in the ranks of the [[Sapieha]] family, who was accused, tried, and executed for [[atheism]] in 1689.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleksander Gieysztor]], ''et al.'' 1979, ''History of Poland'', page 261: A Lithuanian nobleman, Kazimierz Lyszczynski, was even beheaded for his alleged, or real, atheism (1689)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Kłoczowski, 2000, ''A History of Polish Christianity'', page 155: The most famous episode was the sentencing to death of Kazimierz Lyszczynski, a nobleman accused of atheism, by the Sejm court in 1689.&lt;/ref&gt;

For eight years he studied philosophy as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] and then became a [[podsędek]] (supply judge) in legal cases against the Jesuits concerning estates. He wrote a treatise entitled ''On the non-existence of God'' and was later executed on charges of atheism. His trial has been criticized&lt;ref name="Skorobohaty"/&gt; and is seen as a case of legalized religious murder in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spirit of Polish History'' by Antoni Chołoniewski. Translated by Jane (Addy) Arctowska. Published by The Polish Book Importing Co., inc., 1918. p. 38 "The execution of the nobleman Lyszczynski, accused of atheism, religious murder ordered by the Diet of 1689, remained an isolated case."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life, trial, and execution==
Kazimierz Łyszczyński was a nobleman, landowner, [[philosopher]], and soldier in the service of the [[Sapieha]] family. For eight years he studied philosophy as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] and then became a supply judge ([[podsędek]]) in legal cases against the Jesuits concerning estates. He was born in Łyszczyce, in what is now [[Brest District]], [[Brest Region]], Belarus.

Łyszczyński had read a book by [[Henry Aldsted]] entitled ''[[Theologia Naturalis]]'', which attempted to prove the existence of divinity. But its arguments were so confused that Łyszczyński was able to infer many contradictions. Ridiculing Aldsted, Łyszczyński wrote in the book's margins the words "''ergo non est Deus''" ("therefore God does not exist").

This was discovered by one of Łyszczyński's debtors, [[Jan Kazimierz Brzoska]], who was the [[nuncio]] of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] in [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] or a [[Stolnik]] of Bracławice or [[Łowczy]] of Brześć. Brzoska, reluctant to return a great sum of money to him lent by Łyszczyński, accused the latter of being an atheist and gave the aforementioned work as evidence to [[Witwicki]], [[bishop]] of [[Poznań]]. Brzoska also stole and delivered to the court a handwritten copy of ''De non existentia Dei'', which was the first Polish philosophical treatise presenting reality from an atheistic perspective, and which Łyszczyński had been working on since 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Janusz Tazbir, 1966, ''Historia Kościoła Katolickiego w Polsce. 1460-1795'': Catholics who were suspected of being atheists were treated much more severely than Protestants who openly proclaimed their beliefs. An example is given by a trial of nobleman Kazmierz Łyszczyński, who was sentenced to death for atheism in 1689. Łyszczyński is thought to have written a longer treatise on the existence of God, where he expressed his affection for atheism. The manuscript of this treatise was stolen by his personal foe, Jan Kazimierz Brzóska, who sent it to Poznań bishop Stanisław Witwicki, who accused the blasphemer in court. Other bishops supported this accusation. In effect the diet sentenced Łyszczyński to death by beheading and cutting of his tongue. King Jan Sobieski is said to have expressed his discontent by saying that the inquisition would not have undertaken a more severe decision. After the king's appeal the execution was limited to beheading only. The body of the blasphemer was burned. The trial was not well regarded in Rome. The pope thought that the bishops had abused their entitlements and that the sentence had been too severe. It is however worth noting that Łyszczyński's trial is the only known example in the 17th century of a noblemen being executed because of his beliefs. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Witwicki along with Załuski, bishop of Kiev, took up this case with zeal. The King attempted to help Łyszczyński by ordering that he should be judged at Wilno, but this could not save Łyszczyński from the clergy. Łyszczyński's first privilege as a Polish noble, that he could not be imprisoned before his condemnation, was violated. The Łyszczyński case was brought before the [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] of 1689 where he was accused of having denied the [[existence of God]] and having [[blasphemy|blasphemed]] against the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[saints]]. He was [[death penalty|condemned to death]] for [[atheism]]. The sentence was carried out before noon in the Old Town Market in [[Warsaw]], where his tongue was pulled out followed by a [[beheading]].&lt;ref name="Skorobohaty"&gt;{{Harv|Skorobohaty|1840|loc="Chapter XV"|pp=412–415}} Cazimir Lyszczynski, a noble and landowner of Lithuania, a man of a very respectable character, was perusing a book entitled Theologia Naturalis, by Henry Aldsted, a Protestant divine, and finding that the arguments which the author employed in order to prove the existence of divinity, were so confused that it was possible to deduce from them quite contrary consequences, he added on the margin the following words — "ergo non est Deus," evidently ridiculing the arguments of the author. This circumstance was found out by Brzoska, nuncio of Brest in Lithuania, a debtor of Lyszczynski, who denouned him as an atheist, delivering, as evidence of his accusation, a copy of the work with the above-mentioned annotation to Witwicki, bishop of Posnania, who took up this affair with the greatest violence. He was zealously seconded by Zaluski, bishop of Kiod, a prelate known for his great learning and not devoid of merit in other respects, which however proved no check to religious fanaticism. The king, who was very far from countenancing such enormities, attempted to save the unfortunate Lyszczynski, by ordering that he should be judged at Wilno; but nothing could shelter the unfortunate man against the fanatical rage of the clergy represented by the two bishops; and the first privilege of a Polish noble, that he could not be imprisoned before his condemnation, and which had theretofore been sacredly observed even with the greatest criminals, was violated. On the simple accusation of his debtor, supported by the bishops, the affair was brought before the diet of 1689, before which the clergy, and particularly the bishop Zaluski, accused Lyszczynski of having denied the existence of God, and uttered blasphemies against the blessed Virgin and the saints. The unfortunate victim, terrified by his perilous situation, acknowledged all that was imputed to him, made a full recantation of all he might have said and written against the doctrine of the Roman Catholic church, and declared his entire submission to its authority. This was, however, of no avail to him, and his accusers were even scandalized that the diet permitted him to make a defence, and granted the term of three days for collecting evidence of his innocence, as the accusation of the clergy ought, in their judgment, to be sufficient evidence on which to condemn the culprit. The fanaticism of the diet was excited in a most scandalous manner by the blasphemous representation that divinity should be propitiated by the blood of its offenders. The diet decreed that Lyszczynski should have his tongue pulled out, and then be beheaded and burnt. This atrocious sentence was executed, and the bishop Zaluski himself gives a relation of what he considered an act of piety and justice! The king was horror-struck at this news and exclaimed that the Inquisition could not do any thing worse. It is necessary, on this occasion, to render justice to Pope Innocent XI., who, instead of conferring a cardinal's hat on the bishop of Posnania, bitterly censured this disgraceful affair.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, his corpse was transported beyond the city borders and cremated.

Bishop Załuski gave the following account of the execution:

{{quote|After recantation the culprit was conducted to the scaffold, where the executioner tore with a burning iron the tongue and the mouth, ''with which he had been cruel against God''; after which his hands, the instruments of the abominable production, were burnt at a slow fire, the sacrilegious paper was thrown into the flames; finally himself, that monster of his century, this deicide was thrown into the expiatory flames; expiatory if such a crime may be atoned for.&lt;ref name="Skorobohaty"/&gt;}}

==''De non existentia Dei''==
Łyszczyński wrote a treatise, ''De non existentia Dei'' (''On the non-existence of God''), stating that God does not exist and that religions are  inventions of man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ptta.pl/pef/angielski/hasla/a/atheism.pdf ATHEISM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002073719/http://www.ptta.pl/pef/angielski/hasla/a/atheism.pdf |date=2008-10-02 }} Polskie Towarzystwo Tomasza z Akwinu, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of a public denunciation, a trial was conducted before a [[Sejm]] commission. There is an actual transcript of the proceedings at the  [[Kórnik]] library, including a speech by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ''[[Instigator Regni]]'' Szymon Kurowicz Zabistowski, citing fragments of ''De non existentia Dei''. The treatise itself was destroyed by the Sejm, but the surviving cited fragments are as follows:

:I - we beseech you, o' theologians, by your God, if in this manner do you not extinguish the light of Reason, do you not oust the sun from this world, do you not pull down your God from the sky, when attributing to him the impossible, whereof the characteristics and attributes contradict themselves.

:II - Man is the creator of God, and God is a concept and creation of Man. Hence people are the architects and engineers of God, and God is not a true being but a being existing only within the mind; being chimeric by its nature, because a God and a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] are the same thing.

:III - Religion was constituted by people without religion, so they could be worshipped although the God is not existent. Piety was introduced by the unpietic. The fear of God was spread by the unafraid so that the people were afraid of them in the end. Devotion named godly is a design of Man. Doctrine, be it logical or philosophical, bragging to be teaching the truth of God, is false, and on the contrary, the one condemned as false, is the very true one.

:IV - simple folk are cheated by the more cunning with the fabrication of God for their own oppression; whereas the same oppression is shielded by the folk in a way, that if the wise attempted to free them by the truth, they would be quelled by the very people.

:V - nevertheless we do not experience within us and within any other such an imperative of reason, which would ensure us of a truth of divine revelation. Alas if they were present in us, then everyone would have to acknowledge them and would have no doubts and would not contradict the Writings of Moses and the Gospels - which is not true - and there would be no different congregations and their followers as [[Muhammad|Mahomet]] etc. Such an imperative is not known and there are not only doubts, but there are some who deny a revelation, and they are not fools, but wise men, who with a proper reasoning prove what? the very contrary, what I also prove here. Concluding, that God does not exist".''&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Nowicki, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

During his trial, Łyszczyński claimed that the work was to be about a Catholic and an atheist having a debate, in which the Catholic would eventually win (he told the diet that the work would have had a different title from ''De non existentia Dei''). The atheist was to speak first followed by the Catholic. He claimed that he only wrote the first half of the work (that is only the atheist's argument) and then stopped writing at the advice of a priest.

==Status in modern Poland==
Regardless of whether Łyszczyński was genuinely an atheist, in [[communist Poland]] he came to be celebrated as a martyr to the atheist cause. In a series of papers, the philosopher [[Andrzej Nowicki (philosopher)|Andrzej Nowicki]] presented a romanticized view of Łyszczyński, stating that "in terms of breadth of intellectual horizons, thoroughness of philosophical erudition, and boldness of thought, he was beyond doubt the most eminent Polish mind of the age."&lt;ref name="MPS"&gt;{{Harv|Pomian-Srzednicki|1982|pp=103–104}} It appears that Łyszczyński was sentenced to death for writing a treatise entitled 'De non existentia Dei' ... and all that remains are a few notes which were made during the trial. Apart from this and also the fact that his execution caused some controversy at the time on account of his being a member of the gentry, next to nothing is known about Łyszczyński. Łyszczyński's importance as a martyr of the atheist cause has led to his romanticization by Nowicki and to his rescue from a murky cell in the obscure by-ways of history. A copious amount of writing has appeared concerning both what is not known about him and what the content of his thought might have been. Nowicki writes boldly: 'Polish intellectual life cannot boast of any one figure who could compare with Łyszczyński in terms of breadth of intellectual horizons, the thoroughness of philosophical erudition and the boldness of thought. He was beyond doubt the most eminent Polish mind of the epoch.' What a pity that no one knows what the content of his thought was. According to the notes made at the trial, Łyszczyński, was curiously 'modern', even to the point of incongruity, in his critique of religion: all of his remarks might have been made by Marx or Lenin ... Łyszczyński clearly states his disbelief in God. The incongruity of this idea, however, lies in an inability to understand its genesis in the context of Polish society at that time ...  there is no independent or clear evidence of other individuals with similar inclinations during Łyszczyński's time. To say that Łyszczyński was simply ahead of his time means nothing: it is an admission of the unavailability of an explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, his persona and ideas were the key theme in a public performance during the 2014 Procession of Atheists in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marsz Ateistów w Warszawie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54449">This is a '''list of [[paradox]]es''', grouped thematically. The grouping is approximate, as paradoxes may fit into more than one category. This list collects only scenarios that have been called a paradox by at least one source and have their own article. Although considered paradoxes, some of these are simply based on fallacious reasoning ([[falsidical]]), or an unintuitive solution ([[Veridical paradox|veridical]]). Informally, the term ''paradox'' is often used to describe a counter-intuitive result. 

However, some of these paradoxes qualify to fit into the mainstream perception of a paradox, which is a self-contradictory result gained even while properly applying accepted ways of [[Reason|reasoning]]. These paradoxes, often called ''[[antinomy]],'' point out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of [[truth]] and [[Definite description|description]].

== Logic ==

* {{bl|Barbershop paradox}}: The supposition that if one of two simultaneous assumptions leads to a contradiction, the other assumption is also disproved leads to paradoxical consequences. Not to be confused with the [[Barber paradox]].

* {{bl|What the Tortoise Said to Achilles}}: "Whatever Logic is good enough to tell me is worth ''writing down''...", also known as ''Carroll's paradox'', not to be confused with the "Achilles and the tortoise" paradox by [[Zeno of Elea]].
* {{bl|Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22}}: A situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. A soldier who wants to be declared insane in order to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason, and will therefore not be declared insane.
* {{bl|Drinker paradox}}: In any pub there is a customer of whom it is true to say: if that customer drinks, everybody in the pub drinks.
* {{bl|Paradox of entailment}}: Inconsistent premises always make an argument valid.
* {{bl|Lottery paradox}}: If there is one winning ticket in a large lottery, it is reasonable to believe of any particular lottery ticket that it is not the winning ticket, but it is not reasonable to believe that no lottery ticket will win.
* {{bl|Raven paradox}}: (or Hempel's Ravens): Observing a green apple increases the likelihood of all ravens being black.
* {{bl|Ross' paradox}}: Disjunction introduction poses a problem for imperative inference by seemingly permitting arbitrary imperatives to be inferred.
* {{bl|Unexpected hanging paradox}}: The day of the hanging will be a surprise, so it cannot happen at all, so it will be a surprise. The ''surprise examination'' and [[The Bottle Imp|Bottle Imp paradox]] use similar logic.

=== {{vanchor|Self-reference|Self–reference}} ===
These paradoxes have in common a contradiction arising from either [[self-reference]] or [[circular reference]], in which several statements refer to each other in a way that following some of the references leads back to the starting point.

* {{bl|Barber paradox}}: A barber (who is a man) shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves. Does he shave himself? (Russell's popularization of [[Russell's paradox|his set theoretic paradox]].)
* {{bl|Bhartrhari's paradox}}: The thesis that there are some things which are unnameable conflicts with the notion that something is named by calling it unnameable.
* {{bl|Berry paradox}}: The phrase "the first number not nameable in under ten words" appears to name it in nine words.
* {{bl|Crocodile dilemma}}: If a crocodile steals a child and promises its return if the father can correctly guess exactly what the crocodile will do, how should the crocodile respond in the case that the father guesses that the child will not be returned?
* {{bl|Paradox of the Court}}: A law student agrees to pay his teacher after (and only after) winning his first case. The teacher then sues the student (who has not yet won a case) for payment.
* {{bl|Curry's paradox}}: "If this sentence is true, then Santa Claus exists."
* {{bl|Epimenides paradox}}: A Cretan says: "All Cretans are liars". This paradox works in mainly the same way as the [[Liar paradox]].
* {{bl|Grelling–Nelson paradox}}: Is the word "heterological", meaning "not applicable to itself", a heterological word? (Another close relative of [[Russell's paradox]].)
* {{bl|Hilbert-Bernays paradox}}: If there was a name for a natural number that is identical to a name of the [[successor function|successor]] of that number, there would be a natural number equal to its successor.
* {{bl|Kleene–Rosser paradox}}: By formulating an equivalent to [[Richard's paradox]], [[untyped lambda calculus]] is shown to be inconsistent.
* {{bl|Knower paradox}}: "This sentence is not known."
* {{bl|Liar paradox}}: "This sentence is false." This is the canonical self-referential paradox. Also "Is the answer to this question 'no'?", and "I'm lying."
** {{bl|Card paradox}}: "The next statement is true. The previous statement is false." A variant of the liar paradox in which neither of the sentences employs (direct) self-reference, instead this is a case of circular reference.
** {{bl|No-no paradox}}: Two sentences, each saying of the other it is not true.
** {{bl|Pinocchio paradox}}: What would happen if [[Pinocchio]] said "My nose grows now"?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eldridge-Smith | first = Peter | last2 = Eldridge-Smith | first2 = Veronique | date = 13 January 2010 | title = The Pinocchio paradox | journal = Analysis | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–215 | issn = 1467-8284 | doi = 10.1093/analys/anp173 | url = https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/70/2/212/94162|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;{{As of|2010}}, an image of Pinocchio with a speech bubble "My nose will grow now!" has become a minor Internet phenomenon ([https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pinocchio+paradox%22 Google search], [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pinocchio+paradox%22 Google image search]). It seems likely that this paradox has been independently conceived multiple times.&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{bl|Quine's paradox}}: "'Yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation' yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation." Shows that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not self-referring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals.
** {{bl|Yablo's paradox}}: An ordered infinite sequence of sentences, each of which says that all following sentences are false. While constructed to avoid self-reference, there is no consensus whether it relies on self-reference or not.
* {{bl|Opposite Day}}: "It is opposite day today." Therefore, it is not opposite day, but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day, which contradicts the fact that it has previously been stated that it is an opposite day.
* {{bl|Richard's paradox}}: We appear to be able to use simple English to define a decimal expansion in a way that is self-contradictory.
* {{bl|Russell's paradox}}: Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?
* {{bl|Socratic paradox}}: "All I know is that I know nothing."

=== Vagueness ===

* {{bl|Ship of Theseus}}: It seems like you can replace any component of a ship, and it is still the same ship. So you can replace them all, one at a time, and it is still the same ship. However, you can then take all the original pieces, and assemble them into a ship. That, too, is the same ship you began with.
: See also {{bl|List of Ship of Theseus examples}}
* {{bl|Sorites paradox}} (also known as the [[paradox of the heap]]): If you remove a single grain of sand from a heap, you still have a heap. Keep removing single grains, and the heap will disappear. Can a single grain of sand make the difference between heap and non-heap?

== Mathematics ==
{{See also|Category:Mathematics paradoxes|Paradoxes of set theory}}

* {{bl|All horses are the same color}}: A proof by induction that all horses have the same color.
* {{bl|Ant on a rubber rope}}: An ant crawling on a rubber rope can reach the end even when the rope stretches much faster than the ant can crawl.
* {{bl|Cramer's paradox}}: The number of points of intersection of two higher-order curves can be greater than the number of arbitrary points needed to define one such curve.
* {{bl|Elevator paradox}}: Elevators can seem to be mostly going in one direction, as if they were being manufactured in the middle of the building and being disassembled on the roof and basement.
* {{bl|Interesting number paradox}}: The first number that can be considered "dull" rather than "interesting" becomes interesting because of that fact.
* {{bl|Potato paradox}}: If you let potatoes consisting of 99% water dry so that they are 98% water, they lose 50% of their weight.
* {{bl|Russell's paradox}}: Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?

=== Statistics ===
{{See also|Category:Statistical paradoxes}}

* {{bl|Abelson's paradox}}: Effect size may not be indicative of practical meaning.
* {{bl|Accuracy paradox}}: Predictive models with a given level of accuracy may have greater predictive power than models with higher accuracy.
* {{bl|Berkson's paradox}}: A complicating factor arising in statistical tests of proportions.
* {{bl|Freedman's paradox}}: Describes a problem in [[model selection]] where predictor variables with no explanatory power can appear artificially important.
* {{bl|Friendship paradox}}: For almost everyone, their friends have more friends than they do.
* {{bl|Inspection paradox}}: Why one will wait longer for a bus than one should.
* {{bl|Lindley's paradox}}: Tiny errors in the null hypothesis are magnified when large data sets are analyzed, leading to false but highly statistically significant results.
* {{bl|Low birth weight paradox}}: Low birth weight and mothers who smoke contribute to a higher mortality rate. Babies of smokers have lower average birth weight, but low birth weight babies born to smokers have a lower mortality rate than other low birth weight babies. This is a special case of Simpson's paradox.
* {{bl|Simpson's paradox}}, or the '''{{bl|Yule–Simpson effect}}''': A trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined, and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data.
* {{bl|Will Rogers phenomenon}}: The mathematical concept of an average, whether defined as the [[mean]] or [[median]], leads to apparently paradoxical results—for example, it is possible that moving an entry from an [[encyclopedia]] to a [[dictionary]] would increase the average entry length on ''both'' books.

=== Probability ===

[[File:Monty open door.svg|thumb|right|The [[Monty Hall problem]]: which door do you choose?]]

{{See also|Category:Probability theory paradoxes}}

* {{bl|Bertrand's box paradox}}: A paradox of conditional probability closely related to the Boy or Girl paradox.
* {{bl|Bertrand's paradox (probability)|Bertrand's paradox}}: Different common-sense definitions of randomness give quite different results.
* {{bl|Birthday problem}}: What is the chance that two people in a room have the same birthday?
* {{bl|Borel's paradox}}: Conditional probability density functions are not invariant under coordinate transformations.
* {{bl|Boy or Girl paradox}}: A two-child family has at least one boy. What is the probability that it has a girl?
* '''Dartboard Puzzle:''' If a dart is guaranteed to hit a dartboard and the probability of hitting a specific point is positive, adding the infinitely many positive chances yields infinity, but the chance of hitting the dartboard is one. If the probability of hitting each point is zero, the probability of hitting anywhere on the dartboard is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=Infinity Paradoxes - Numberphile|date=2013-07-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDl7g_2x74Q|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bl|False positive paradox}}: A test that is accurate the vast majority of the time could show you have a disease, but the probability that you actually have it could still be tiny.
* {{bl|Grice's paradox}}: Shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination.
* {{bl|Monty Hall problem}}: An unintuitive consequence of conditional probability.
* {{bl|Necktie paradox}}: A wager between two people seems to favour them both. Very similar in essence to the [[Two-envelope paradox]].
* {{bl|Nontransitive dice}}: You can have three dice, called A, B, and C, such that A is likely to win in a roll against B, B is likely to win in a roll against C, and C is likely to win in a roll against A.
* {{bl|Proebsting's paradox}}: The [[Kelly criterion]] is an often optimal strategy for maximizing profit in the long run. Proebsting's paradox apparently shows that the Kelly criterion can lead to ruin.
* {{bl|Sleeping Beauty problem}}: A probability problem that can be correctly answered as one half or one third depending on how the question is approached.
* {{bl|Three cards problem}}: When pulling a random card, how do you determine the color of the underside?
* {{bl|Three Prisoners problem}}: A variation of the [[Monty Hall problem]].
* {{bl|Two-envelope paradox}}: You are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each of which contains a positive sum of money. One envelope contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains. You pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead.

=== Infinity and infinitesimals ===

* {{bl|Burali-Forti paradox}}: If the [[ordinal number]]s formed a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it would be an ordinal number that is smaller than itself.
* {{bl|Cantor's paradox}}: The [[set of all sets]] would have its own [[power set]] as a subset, therefore its [[cardinality]] would be at least as great as that of its power set. But [[Cantor's theorem]] proves that power sets are strictly greater than the sets they are constructed from. Consequently, the set of all sets would contain a subset greater than itself.

'''Livy A. Visano''' {{post-nominals|country=UK|FRSA}} is a professor of human rights at [[York University]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. He is   Director of the Undergraduate Program in the Department of Equity Studies; former Dean, Atkinson College, York University (July 1997–December 1, 1998) Chair, Department of Sociology, Atkinson College, York University (1996–7). He was an invited scholar to the Centre for Contemporary Culture ([[University of Jyvaskyla]], [[Finland]]), and is currently an associate editor of the [[International Journal of Comparative Sociology]]. He serves on the boards of numerous community-based organizations. He has also served as consultant to federal, provincial and local governments and agencies.

==Biography==
Livy A. Visano received B.A. (Honours, in Social and Philosophical Studies), [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (Criminology, Centre of Criminology), and   [[Ph.D.]] [[Sociology]], (Comprehensives: [[Criminology]]; [[Urban Sociology]]) from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1973, 1974, and 1986, respectively.

==Affiliations==
•Vice President (External), YUFA, York University

•Chair, University Safety Audit Committee, [[York University]]

•Vice Chair, Board of Regents, [[Huntington University (Canada)|Huntington University]]

•Member, Board of Directors, [[OCUFA]]

•Advisor and Research Consultant, Vita Nova Foundation

•Editorial Board, [[International Journal of Comparative Social Studies]], [[Brill Academic Publishers]]

•Member, Editorial Board, [[International Journal of Comparative Sociology]] ([[Sage Publications]])

•Member, International Research Linkages Panel (IRLP), Institute of Social Sciences, Academy of Social Sciences [[Ho Chi Minh City]]

==Scholarship==
He is the author of numerous books, and has published over 75 articles and book reviews. He has written extensively on delinquency and [[critical criminology]], critical legal [[hermeneutics]], critical [[cultural theory]], critical legal studies, [[cultural criminology]], youth, and ethnographies, [[penology]], anti-racism and law, law and inequality. His books include:

'''Crime and Culture: refining the traditions'''

A book examines the underlying structures of [[political economy]] that produce current [[crime]] ideologies. An overview and critique of classical perspectives on crime is followed by a discussion on the interrelationship of concepts that are basic to a critical cultural alternative--[[ideology]], [[hegemony]], political economy and the [[State (polity)|state]]. The criminal practices of institutions are highlighted, emphasizing how they interact to effectively discipline, dominate and devalue certain elements of the population.

'''What do they know?": Youth, crime and culture'''

In this book Visano takes an unconventional approach to understanding the phenomenon of [[youth crime]]. His analysis focuses on the impact of the dominant [[culture]] on youth in terms of the often- overlooked issue of youth reflexivity—an interpretive processes through which youths organize their thoughts, feelings, and motives. In particular, he looks at the roles played by ideologies (such as [[modernity]] and [[liberalism]]) and institutions (such as the [[Mass media|media]]) in shaping youth identity. He also contends that youth crime actually serves the interests of [[capitalism]].

[[File:Marko Pogačnik.jpg|thumb|Marko Pogačnik (1969)]]
'''Marko Pogačnik''' (born 11 August 1944 in [[Kranj]], [[Slovenia]], [[Yugoslavia]]) is a [[Slovenia]]n artist and author.

==Background==
[[File:Sankt Paul Lithopunktur Marko Pogacnik 10052008 64.jpg|thumbnail|Relief by Pogačnik in [[Sankt Paul im Lavanttal]]]]
Pogačnik studied at the [[Academy of Arts, Ljubljana|Academy of Arts]] in [[Ljubljana]], the capital of Slovenia, where he graduated in 1967. He was a co-founder of the [[neo-avantgarde]] artistic movement [[OHO (art group)|OHO]],&lt;ref name="Delo2011-09-11" /&gt; members of which were also [[Tomaž Šalamun]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. From the 1980s, he embraced a [[holistic]] vision of art. He claims to have developed a method of earth healing similar to [[acupuncture]] by using pillars and positioning them on so called 'lithopuncture' points of the landscape.&lt;ref name="Delo2011-09-11" /&gt;

In 1991, he designed the official [[Coat of arms of Slovenia|coat of arms]] of the newly constituted Republic of Slovenia. In the year 2006, he joined the [[Movement for Justice and Development (Slovenia)|Movement for Justice and Development]] led by [[Janez Drnovšek]], the [[President of Slovenia]] at the time.

He lives and works in the village of [[Šempas]] in the lower [[Vipava Valley]]. In the last decade, the town of [[Nova Gorica]], in which municipal territory he resides, has commissioned a number of public monuments from Pogačnik, most notably the monument to the 1000 years of the first mention of [[Gorizia|Gorica]] and [[Solkan]], which stands in the town's central public square.

Since 2008, a group of his monuments and [[birch|birch trees]], titled the ''[[Holography|Hologram]] of Europe'' ({{lang-sl|Hologram Evrope}}), stands at the crossroad of [[Tivoli Street]] ({{lang|sl|Tivolska cesta}}) and [[Slovene Street]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenska cesta}}) in Ljubljana.&lt;ref name="Delo2011-09-11" /&gt;

==Awards==
In 1991, Marko Pogačnik received the [[Prešeren Fund Award]] for his work.&lt;ref name="Delo2011-09-11" /&gt; In 2008, he received the [[Jakopič Award]], the central Slovenian fine arts award.&lt;ref name="Delo2011-09-11" /&gt; He was nominated two times for the [[Right Livelihood Award]].&lt;ref name="Delo2011-09-11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/kultura/lov-na-carovnike-poziv-k-lincu-umetnika-marka-pogacnika.html |title=Lov na čarovnike: poziv k linču umetnika Marka Pogačnika |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Witch-hunt: An Appeal to Lynch the Artist Marko Pogačnik |newspaper=Delo.si |first=Maja |last=Megla |date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Campbell Cornforth''' (28 October 1909 – 31 December 1980) was a British [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosopher.

==Life==
Cornforth was born in [[Willesden]], London, in 1909, and educated at [[University College School]],&lt;ref name="TimesObit"&gt;{{cite news|author1=ALM|author2=NMJ|title=Mr Maurice Cornforth|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=oxford&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS220563496&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=2 September 2016|work=The Times|issue=60820|date=8 January 1981|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was friends with [[Stephen Spender]].&lt;ref name="c20phil"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Stuart|title=The Dictionary of Twentieth-Century British Philosophers|date=2005|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=184371096X|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 he went up to [[University College, London]], graduating in 1929, and then went on to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was the only student on a specialised course in logic, taught by [[G. E. Moore|Moore]], [[R. B. Braithwaite|Braithwaite]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref name="TimesObit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c20phil" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Edwin A.|title=The Anglo-Marxists: A Study in Ideology and Culture|date=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0847683966|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, after graduating, Cornforth was awarded a three-year research scholarship at Trinity.&lt;ref name="TimesObit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c20phil" /&gt; In the summer of the same year he joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]], setting up the party's first organisation at [[Cambridge]]; and in the autumn married a fellow Cambridge student, Kitty Klugmann, sister of [[James Klugmann|James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Geoff|title=The Shadow Man: At the Heart of the Cambridge Spy Circle|date=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=1784531669|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933 Cornforth worked full-time for the Communist Party in East Anglia.&lt;ref name="TimesObit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c20phil" /&gt; 

Rejected for military service on medical grounds, during the [[Second World War]] Cornforth worked as a farm labourer.&lt;ref name="TimesObit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c20phil" /&gt; He published his first work, ''Science Versus Idealism'', in 1946.&lt;ref name="TimesObit" /&gt; In 1950 he was appointed as managing director of [[Lawrence &amp; Wishart]], a post he held until 1975, during which period he was responsible for the publishing of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'s ''Collected Works''.&lt;ref name="TimesObit" /&gt; 

Cornforth died aged 71 in [[Islington]],&lt;ref name="c20phil" /&gt; London, in 1980, leaving a widow, Kathleen Elliott, his second wife.&lt;ref name="TimesObit" /&gt;

==Philosophy==
When Cornforth began his career in philosophy in the early 1930s, he was a follower of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], writing in the then current style of [[analytic philosophy]]. Cornforth later became a leading ideologist of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. He vigorously opposed the aesthetic theories of fellow Marxist [[Christopher Caudwell]].

''In Defense of Philosophy'' attacks [[empiricist]] philosophies of many kinds, such as those of [[Rudolf Carnap]] ([[linguistic analysis]]) and [[William James]] ([[pragmatism]]), on the "[[dialectical materialism|materialist]]" grounds that they divorce science and scientific investigation from the search for truer understanding of the really existing universe. {{clarify|date=October 2013}} In this book there is a combination of Marxism with deep insights into the interrelations of the various sciences and the philosophical conundrums produced by the empiricist attempt to reduce science to the collection and correlation of data. Both the insights are based on the theory of the primacy of physical work and tools (thus, "materialism") in the development of specifically human traits such as [[language]], abstract thought, and [[social organisation]], and the essential role of the external world in the increasingly complex development of forms of life. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Cornforth's multi-volume book ''Dialectical Materialism'' was originally published in 1953 by the International Publishers, Co., Inc. The first US edition of this work was printed in 1971. The text originated from lectures that Cornforth received funding for from the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1950. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The first volume, ''Materialism and the Dialectical Method'', provides a good introduction to several important sociological principles: [[idealism]], [[metaphysics]], [[materialism]], mechanical materialism, and [[dialectical materialism]], in addition to Marxist philosophy. Volume 2 of this text is entitled ''Historical Materialism'', and Volume 3 is ''Theory of Knowledge''.

'''Maurice Solovine''' (21 May 1875 in [[Iași]] – 13 February 1958 in [[Paris]]) was a [[Romania]]n [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]].

==Biography==
As a young student of philosophy in [[Bern]], Solovine applied to study [[physics]] with [[Albert Einstein]] in response to an advert. The two men struck up a close relationship, and Einstein was to say to Solovine a few days after meeting him: "It is not necessary to give you lessons in physics. The discussion about the problems which we face in physics today is much more interesting; simply come to me when you wish. I am pleased to be able to talk to you."

Solovine one day suggested reading and debating the works of great authors. Einstein agreed enthusiastically and soon mathematician [[Conrad Habicht]] (1876&amp;ndash;1958) became involved in what was to be known as the "Akademie Olympia" ([[Olympia Academy]]). Often their meetings, held in Einstein's flat, would last until the early morning hours.

On one occasion Solovine missed a scheduled meeting in his flat, preferring to listen to a concert in the city. He had prepared a meal for his friends with a note: "Amicis carissimis ova dura et salutem." (To the beloved friends, hard-boiled eggs and greetings). However Einstein and Habicht turned his flat upside down after they had eaten the meal. Every piece of furniture was moved and plates, cups, forks, knives and books were scattered all over the flat. The rooms were also covered in smoke from Einstein’s pipe and Habicht’s cigar. They left a "worthy warning" on the wall. There you could read: "Amico carissimo fumum spissum et salutem." (To the dearest friend, thick smoke and greetings). Einstein is reputed to have greeted Solovine the next evening with the following words: "You lousy guy, how, you were cheeky enough to stay away from a meeting of the Akademie to listen to the violin? Barbarian, idiot, stupid one, if you ever let us down this way again you’ll be expelled from the Akademie with shame." This meeting lasted until the morning to make up for lost time.

Solovine remained in contact with Einstein into the fifties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5754">'''Max Loreau''' (7 June 1928, Brussels – 7 January 1990) was a 20th-century Belgian philosopher, poet and [[art critic]]

== Biography ==
Max Loreau is interested in the aesthetics of the [[Renaissance]] before publishing the complete catalog of works by [[Jean Dubuffet]]. He became close to the members of the [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]] movement. He devotes various articles to painters like [[Corneille Guillaume Beverloo|Guillaume Corneille]] or [[Asger Jorn]], before drafting a more comprehensive study of the [[logogram]]s by [[Christian Dotremont]] in 1975. He also worked with [[Pierre Alechinsky]] who helped him to publish one of his last texts, ''L'Épreuve''.

His philosophy takes root in [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], from which he tries to rehabilitate the body. He starts from a genetic approach in which he tries to rethink the origin of the phenomenon as the genesis of the apparition. In ''Cri'' (Shout), he inaugurates a radical style from which he describes the effect of rupture, tearing and the void that emerges from the shout. This uncovering of the experience of language invites us to redefine the emergence of the apparition and show how the view resumes its bearings and reconstitutes a world. Starting from a critique of the Platonic vision, which fundamentally denies the body, since it is idealized as a vision of ideas, this path leads Loreau to rethink a new beginning of the body, vision and language.

Max Loreau also published various poems under the titles ''Cerceaux s'orcellent'', ''Chants de la perpétuelle venue'' and  ''Florence portée aux nues''.

'''Parmenides of Elea''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɑːr|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|ɪ|d|iː|z|...|ˈ|ɛ|l|i|ə}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Παρμενίδης ὁ Ἐλεάτης}}; {{fl.|late sixth or early fifth century BC}}) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[ancient Greek|Greek]] [[philosopher]] from [[Velia|Elea]] in [[Magna Graecia]] (Greater Greece, which included Southern Italy). He was the founder of the [[Eleatic school]] of [[philosophy]]. 

The single known work by Parmenides is a [[poem]], ''On Nature'', only fragments of which survive. In it, Parmenides prescribes two views of [[reality]]. In "the way of truth" (a part of the poem), he explains how reality (coined as "what is-is") is one, [[Change (philosophy)|change]] is impossible, and [[existence]] is timeless, uniform, necessary, and unchanging. This is generally considered one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of [[being]], and has been contrasted with [[Heraclitus]]'s statement that "No man ever steps into the same river twice" as one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]].  

Parmenides and Heraclitus are therefore generally considered two of the founders of [[ontology]]. Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, or Heraclitus to Parmenides, though opinion on who was responding to whom changed over the course of the 20th century. In "the way of opinion", Parmenides explains the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. He has been considered the founder of [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]].&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides|title=Parmenides|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=John Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Parmenides was born in the [[Greek colony]] of [[Velia|Elea]] (now [[Ascea]]), which, according to [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, i.164&lt;/ref&gt; had been founded shortly before 535 BC. He was descended from a wealthy and illustrious family.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

His dates are uncertain; according to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], he flourished just before 500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 23&lt;/ref&gt; which would put his year of birth near 540 BC, but [[Plato]] has him visiting [[Athens]] at the age of 65, when [[Socrates]] was a young man, c. 450 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Parmenides'', 127a–128b&lt;/ref&gt; which, if true, suggests a year of birth of c. 515 BC. He was said to have been a pupil of [[Xenophanes]],&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', i. 5; [[Sextus Empiricus]], ''adv. Math.'' vii. 111; [[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'', i. 301; Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and regardless of whether they actually knew each other, Xenophanes' philosophy is the most obvious influence on Parmenides.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''Physics'', 22.26–23.20; Hippolytus, i. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes Laërtius also describes Parmenides as a disciple of "Ameinias, son of Diochaites, the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]"; but there are no obvious Pythagorean elements in his thought.

However, according to [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]], in ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870):&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book |last=William |first=Sir Smith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pr8_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=cosmogony+of+Parmenides,+which+was+carried+out+very&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8oBpVcvrAa2v7AaezoP4Dg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cosmogony%20of%20Parmenides%2C%20which%20was%20carried%20out%20very&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology |year=1870 |pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Others content themselves with reckoning Parmenides as well as [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] as belonging to the Pythagorean school, or with speaking of a ''Parmenidean life'', in the same way as a ''Pythagorean life'' is spoken of; and even the censorious Timon allows Parmenides to have been a high-minded man; while Plato speaks of him with veneration, and Aristotle and others give him an unqualified preference over the rest of the Eleatics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
The first [[hero cult]] of a philosopher we know of was Parmenides' dedication of a [[heroon]] to his teacher Ameinias in Elea.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece'' by Nigel Guy Wilson (2006), p. 353, {{ISBN|978-0-415-97334-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parmenides was the founder of the [[School of Elea]], which also included [[Zeno of Elea]] and [[Melissus of Samos]]. Of his life in Elea, it was said that he had written the [[laws]] of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Speusippus]] in Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 23, comp. Strabo, vi.; Plutarch, ''adv. Colot.'' 1126AB&lt;/ref&gt; His most important pupil was [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], who according to Plato was 25 years his junior, and was regarded as his ''[[eromenos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Parmenides'', 127a: "Zeno and Parmenides once came [to Athens] for the festival of the Great Panathenaea. Parmenides was already a very old man, white-haired but of distinguished appearance — he was about 65. Zeno was then nearly 40, tall and pleasant to look at — he was said to have been Parmenides' lover."&lt;/ref&gt; Parmenides had a large influence on Plato, who not only named a dialogue, ''[[Parmenides (Plato)|Parmenides]]'', after him, but always wrote about him with veneration.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Plato, ''Theaetetus'', 183e; ''Sophist'', 237a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
William Smith also wrote in ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'':&lt;blockquote&gt;On the former reason is our guide; on the latter the eye that does not catch the object and re-echoing hearing. On the former path we convince ourselves that the existent neither has come into being, nor is perishable, and is entirely of one sort, without change and limit, neither past nor future, entirely included in the present. For it is as impossible that it can become and grow out of the existent, as that it could do so out of the non-existent; since the latter, non-existence, is absolutely inconceivable, and the former cannot precede itself; and every coming into existence presupposes a non-existence. By similar arguments divisibility, motion or change, as also infinity, are shut out from the absolutely existent, and the latter is represented as shut up in itself, so that it may be compared to a well-rounded ball; while thought is appropriated to it as its only positive definition. Thought and that which is thought of (Object) coinciding; the corresponding passages of Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and others, which authenticate this view of his theory.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Parmenides cosmology==
{{See also|Spherical Earth}}
[[Cosmology]] originally comprised the greater part of his poem, him explaining the world’s origins and operations. John Palmer notes "Parmenides’ distinction among the principal modes of being and his derivation of the attributes that must belong to what must be, simply as such, qualify him to be seen as the founder of metaphysics or ontology as a domain of inquiry distinct from theology."&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt; Some idea of the sphericity of the Earth seems to have been known to both Parmenides and [[Empedocles]].&lt;ref name="kahn53"&gt;Charles H. Kahn, (2001), ''Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans: a brief history'', page 53. Hackett&lt;/ref&gt;

Parmenides also outlined the phases of the moon, highlighted in a rhymed translation by [[Karl Popper]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/13410|title=Velia and the Cilento|author=C Almon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;Bright in the night with the gift of his light,
Round the earth she is erring,
Evermore letting her gaze
Turn towards Helios' rays&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Smith stated:&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the [[cosmogony]] of Parmenides, which was carried out very much in detail, we possess only a few fragments and notices, which are difficult to understand, according to which, with an approach to the doctrines of the ''Pythagoreans'', he conceived the spherical mundane system, surrounded by a circle of the pure light (Olympus, Uranus); in the centre of this mundane system the solid earth, and between the two the circle of the milkyway, of the morning or evening star, of the sun, the planets, and the moon; which circle he regarded as a mixture of the two primordial elements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fragments read:&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;
{{Quote|You will know the aether’s nature, and in the aether all the/ signs, and the unseen works of the pure torch/ of the brilliant sun, and from whence they came to be,/ and you will learn the wandering works of the round-eyed moon/ and its nature, and you will know too the surrounding heaven,/ both whence it grew and how Necessity directing it bound it/ to furnish the limits of the stars. (Fr. 10)

…how the earth and sun and moon/ and the shared aether and the heavenly milk and Olympos/ outermost and the hot might of the stars began/ to come to be. (Fr. 11)}}

==''On Nature''==
Parmenides is one of the most significant of the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;According to Czech philosopher Milič Čapek "[Parmenides'] decisive influence on the development of Western thought is probably without parallel", ''The New Aspects of Time'', 1991, p. 145. That assessment may overstate Parmenides' impact and importance, but it is a useful corrective to the tendency to underestimate it.&lt;/ref&gt; His single known work, a poem conventionally titled ''On Nature'', has survived only in fragments. Approximately 160 verses remain today from an original total that was probably near 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides/#LifWri | title=Parmenides - Life and Writings - Stanford  Encyclopedia of Philosophy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was originally divided into three parts:
* A [[proem]] (Greek: προοίμιον),&lt;!--Do not "correct" this by writing "poem"; the proem (from Latin "pr(ο)oemium" from Greek "προ-οίμιον") is the first part of, and prologue to, the rest of the poem. (Poem derives from Latin "poëma" from Greek "ποίημα".)--&gt; which introduced the entire work,
* A section known as "The Way of Truth" (''aletheia'', ἀλήθεια), and
* A section known as "The Way of Appearance/Opinion" (''doxa'', δόξα).

The proem is a narrative sequence in which the narrator travels "beyond the beaten paths of mortal men" to receive a revelation from an unnamed goddess (generally thought to be [[Persephone]] or [[Dike (mythology)|Dikē]]&lt;!-- See Popper, or Aetius as quoted in this article. --&gt;) on the nature of reality. ''Aletheia'', an estimated 90% of which has survived, and ''doxa'', most of which no longer exists, are then presented as the spoken revelation of the goddess without any accompanying narrative.

Parmenides attempted to distinguish between the unity of nature and its variety, insisting in the ''Way of Truth'' upon the reality of its unity, which is therefore the object of knowledge, and upon the unreality of its variety, which is therefore the object, not of knowledge, but of opinion. In the ''Way of Opinion'' he propounded a theory of the world of seeming and its development, pointing out, however, that, in accordance with the principles already laid down, these cosmological speculations do not pretend to anything more than mere appearance.

===Proem===
In the proem,&lt;!--Do not "correct" this by writing "poem"; the proem (from Latin "pr(ο)oemium" from Greek "προ-οίμιον") is the first part of and prologue to the rest of the poem. (Poem derives from Latin "poëma" from Greek "ποίημα".)--&gt; Parmenides describes the journey of the poet, escorted by maidens ("the daughters of the Sun made haste to escort me, having left the halls of Night for the light"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schofield |first=G. S. Kirk, J. E. Raven, M. |title=The presocratic philosophers : a critical history with a selection of texts |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-27455-5 |edition=2nd |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the ordinary daytime world to a strange destination, outside our human paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Exegesis and Argument: Studies in Greek Philosophy presented to Gregory Vlastos |last=Furley |first=D.J. |publisher= |year=1973 |isbn= |location= |pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carried in a whirling [[chariot]], and attended by the daughters of [[Helios]] the Sun, the man reaches a temple sacred to an unnamed goddess (variously identified by the commentators as [[Nature]], [[Sophia (wisdom)|Wisdom]], [[Ananke (mythology)|Necessity]] or [[Themis]]), by whom the rest of the poem is spoken. The goddess resides in a well-known mythological space: where Night and Day have their meeting place. Its essential character is that here all opposites are undivided, or one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=Eleatic Conventionalism and Philoaus on the Conditions of Thought |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha |date=1979 |journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |doi= |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He must learn all things, she tells him – both truth, which is certain, and human opinions, which are uncertain – for though one cannot rely on human opinions, they represent an aspect of the whole truth.

=== The Way of Truth ===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Parmenides.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Parmenides. Detail from ''[[The School of Athens]]'' by [[Raphael]].]]
The section known as "the way of truth" discusses that which is real and contrasts with the argument in the section called "the way of opinion," which discusses that which is illusory. Under the "way of truth," Parmenides stated that there are two ways of inquiry: that it ''[[Being|is]]'', on the one side, and that it ''[[Meontology|is not]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frag. B 8.11&lt;/ref&gt; on the other side. He said that the latter argument is never feasible because there is no thing that can ''not be'': "For never shall this prevail, that things that are not '''are'''." (B 7.1)

There are extremely delicate issues here. In the original Greek the two ways are simply named "that Is" (ὅπως ἐστίν) and "that Not-Is" (ὡς οὐκ ἐστίν) (B 2.3 and 2.5) without the "it" inserted in our English translation. In ancient Greek, which, like many languages in the world, does not always require the presence of a subject for a verb, "is" functions as a grammatically complete sentence. Much debate has been focused on where and what the subject is. The simplest explanation as to why there is no subject here is that Parmenides wishes to express the simple, bare fact of existence in his mystical experience without the ordinary distinctions, just as the Latin "pluit" and the Greek ''huei'' (ὕει "rains") mean "it rains"; there is no subject for these impersonal verbs because they express the simple fact of raining without specifying what is doing the raining. This is, for instance, [[Hermann Fränkel]]'s thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Fränkel, ''Dichtung und Philosophie des frühen Griechentums'', New York: American Philological Association, 1962; see also Lawrence C. Chin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027130159/http://www.geocities.com/therapeuter2002/presocratics333.html "Xenophanes and Parmenides"].&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars still reject this explanation and have produced more complex metaphysical explanations. Since existence is an immediately intuited fact, non-existence is the wrong path because a thing cannot disappear, just as something cannot originate from nothing. In such mystical experience (''unio mystica''), however, the distinction between subject and object disappears along with the distinctions between objects, in addition to the fact that if nothing cannot be, it cannot be the object of thought either:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thinking and the thought that it is are the same; for you will not find thinking apart from what is, in relation to which it is uttered. (B 8.34–36)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For to be aware and to be are the same. (B 3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is necessary to speak and to think what is; for being is, but nothing is not. (B 6.1–2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Helplessness guides the wandering thought in their breasts; they are carried along deaf and blind alike, dazed, beasts without judgment, convinced that to be and not to be are the same and not the same, and that the road of all things is a backward-turning one. (B 6.5–9)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, he concluded that "Is" could not have "come into being" because "[[nothing comes from nothing]]". Existence is necessarily eternal. That which truly is [x], has always been [x], and was never becoming [x]; that which is becoming [x] was never nothing (Not-[x]), but will never actually be. Parmenides was not struggling to formulate the laws of [[conservation of mass]] and [[conservation of energy]]; he was struggling with the metaphysics of change, which is still a relevant philosophical topic today.

Moreover, he argued that movement was impossible because it requires moving into "[[The Void (philosophy)|the void]]", and Parmenides identified "the void" with nothing, and therefore (by definition) it does not exist. That which does exist is ''The Parmenidean One'', which is timeless, uniform, and unchanging:&lt;blockquote&gt;How could what is perish? How could it have come to be? For if it came into being, it is not; nor is it if ever it is going to be. Thus coming into being is extinguished, and destruction unknown. (B 8.20–22)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nor was [it] once, nor will [it] be, since [it] is, now, all together, / One, continuous; for what coming-to-be of it will you seek? / In what way, whence, did [it] grow? Neither from what-is-not shall I allow / You to say or think; for it is not to be said or thought / That [it] is not. And what need could have impelled it to grow / Later or sooner, if it began from nothing? Thus [it] must either be completely or not at all. (B 8.5–11)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[What exists] is now, all at once, one and continuous... Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike; nor is there any more or less of it in one place which might prevent it from holding together, but all is full of what is. (B 8.5–6, 8.22–24)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And it is all one to me / Where I am to begin; for I shall return there again. (B 5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Perception vs. Logos====
Parmenides claimed that there is no truth in the opinions of the mortals. Genesis-and-destruction, as Parmenides emphasizes, is a false opinion, because to be means to be completely, once and for all. What exists can in no way not exist. &lt;blockquote&gt;For this view, that That Which Is Not exists, can never predominate. You must debar your thought from this way of search, nor let ordinary experience in its variety force you along this way, (namely, that of allowing) the eye, sightless as it is, and the ear, full of sound, and the tongue, to rule; but (you must) judge by means of the Reason ([[Logos]]) the much-contested proof which is expounded by me. (B 7.1–8.2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Way of Opinion (''doxa'')===
After the exposition of the ''[[arche]]'' (ἀρχή), i.e. the origin, the necessary part of reality that is understood through reason or logos (''that [it] Is''), in the next section, ''the Way of Appearance/Opinion/Seeming'', Parmenides proceeds to explain the structure of the becoming cosmos (which is an illusion, of course) that comes from this origin.
 
The structure of the cosmos is a fundamental binary principle that governs the manifestations of all the particulars: "the aether fire of flame" (B 8.56), which is gentle, mild, soft, thin and clear, and self-identical, and the other is "ignorant night", body thick and heavy.&lt;blockquote&gt;The mortals lay down and decided well to name two forms (i.e. the flaming light and obscure darkness of night), out of which it is necessary not to make one, and in this they are led astray. (B 8.53–4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The structure of the cosmos then generated is recollected by [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] (II, 7, 1):
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Parmenides says that there are circular bands wound round one upon the other, one made of the rare, the other of the dense; and others between these mixed of light and darkness. What surrounds them all is solid like a wall. Beneath it is a fiery band, and what is in the very middle of them all is solid, around which again is a fiery band. The most central of the mixed bands is for them all the origin and cause of motion and becoming, which he also calls steering goddess and keyholder and Justice and Necessity. The air has been separated off from the earth, vapourized by its more violent condensation, and the [[sun]] and the circle of the [[Milky Way]] are exhalations of fire. The [[moon]] is a mixture of both earth and fire. The ''[[aether (classical element)|aether]]'' lies around above all else, and beneath it is ranged that fiery part which we call [[sky|heaven]], beneath which are the regions around the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stobaeus]], i. 22. 1a, quoted in [[W. K. C. Guthrie]] (1979), ''A History of Greek Philosophy: Volume 2, The Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'', pp. 61–2. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Interpretations of Parmenides ==
The traditional interpretation of Parmenides' work is that he argued that the every-day [[perception]] of [[reality]] of the physical world (as described in ''[[doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in ''[[aletheia]]''): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole. Under the ''Way of Opinion'', Parmenides set out a contrasting but more conventional view of the world, thereby becoming an early exponent of the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] of appearance and reality. For him and his pupils, the [[phenomena]] of movement and change are simply appearances of a changeless, [[eternity|eternal]] reality. This interpretation could settle because of various wrong translations of the fragments. For example, it is not at all clear that Parmenides refuted that which we call perception. The verb ''noein'', used frequently by Parmenides, could better be translated as 'to be aware of' than as 'to think'. Furthermore, it is hard to believe that 'being' is only within our heads, according to Parmenides.

Parmenides' philosophy is presented in the form of poetry. The philosophy he argued was, he says, given to him by a goddess, though the "mythological" details in Parmenides' poem do not bear any close correspondence to anything known from traditional Greek mythology:&lt;blockquote&gt;Welcome, youth, who come attended by immortal charioteers and mares which bear you on your journey to our dwelling. For it is no evil fate that has set you to travel on this road, far from the beaten paths of men, but right and justice. It is meet that you learn all things — both the unshakable heart of well-rounded truth and the opinions of mortals in which there is not true belief. (B 1.24–30)&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is with respect to this religious/mystical context that recent generations of scholars such as Alexander P. Mourelatos, Charles H. Kahn, and the controversial [[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]] have begun to call parts of the traditional, rational logical/philosophical interpretation of Parmenides into question (Kingsley in particular stating that Parmenides practiced [[Iatromantis|iatromancy]]). It has been claimed that previous scholars placed too little emphasis on the apocalyptic context in which Parmenides frames his revelation. As a result, traditional interpretations have put Parmenidean philosophy into a more modern, metaphysical context to which it is not necessarily well suited, which has led to misunderstanding of the true meaning and intention of Parmenides' message. The obscurity and fragmentary state of the text, however, renders almost every claim that can be made about Parmenides extremely contentious, and the traditional interpretation has by no means been abandoned.

Parmenides' considerable influence on the thinking of [[Plato]] is undeniable, and in this respect Parmenides has influenced the whole history of [[Western philosophy]], and is often seen as its grandfather. Even Plato himself, in the ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', refers to the work of "our Father Parmenides" as something to be taken very seriously and treated with respect. In the ''[[Parmenides (Plato)|Parmenides]]'', the Eleatic philosopher, which may well be Parmenides himself, and [[Socrates]] argue about [[dialectic]]. In the ''[[Theaetetus (Plato)|Theaetetus]]'', Socrates says that Parmenides alone among the wise ([[Protagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Empedocles]], [[Epicharmus]], and [[Homer]]) denied that everything is change and motion.

Parmenides is credited with a great deal of influence as the author of an "Eleatic challenge" that determined the course of subsequent philosophers' enquiries. For example, the ideas of [[Empedocles]], [[Anaxagoras]], [[Leucippus]], and [[Democritus]] have been seen as in response to Parmenides' arguments and conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. David Sedley, "Parmenides," in E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Routledge, 1998): "Parmenides marks a watershed in Presocratic philosophy. In the next generation he remained the senior voice of Eleaticism, perceived as champion of the One against the Many. His One was defended by Zeno of Elea and Melissus, while those who wished to vindicate cosmic plurality and change felt obliged to respond to his challenge. Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Leucippus and Democritus framed their theories in terms which conceded as much as possible to his rejections of literal generation and annihilation and of division."&lt;/ref&gt;

Parmenides' influence on philosophy reaches up till present times. The Italian philosopher [[Emanuele Severino]] has founded his extended philosophical investigations on the words of Parmenides. His philosophy is sometimes called Neo Parmenideism, and can be understood as an attempt to build a bridge between the poem on truth and the poem on opinion.

==Influence on the development of science==
Parmenides made the [[ontological]] argument against nothingness, ''essentially denying the possible existence of a void''. According to [[Aristotle]], this led [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]], and many other physicists,&lt;ref name="Physics"&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', Book IV, 6 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to propose the [[atomic theory]], which supposes that everything in the universe is either atoms or voids, specifically to contradict Parmenides' argument. [[Aristotle]] himself reasoned, in opposition to atomism, that in a complete vacuum, motion would encounter no resistance, and "no one could say why a thing once set in motion should stop anywhere; for why should it stop here rather than here? So that a thing will either be at rest or must be moved ad infinitum, unless something more powerful get in its way."&lt;ref name="Physics"/&gt; See also ''[[horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]].''

[[Erwin Schrödinger]] identified Parmenides' [[monad (philosophy)|monad]] of the "Way of Truth" as being the conscious self in "Nature and the Greeks".&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Schrödinger (1954), ''Nature and the Greeks: and, Science and Humanism'', pp. 26–33, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific implications of this view have been discussed by scientist [[Anthony Hyman]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Anthony (2007), "The Selfseeker", Teignvalley Press&lt;/ref&gt;

A shadow of Parmenides' ideas can be seen in the physical concept of [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|Block time]], which considers existence to consist of past, present, and future, and the flow of time to be illusory. In his critique of this idea, [[Karl Popper]] called [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] "Parmenides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unended Quest |first=Karl |last=Popper |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NyCEnehPMd8C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=popper+einstein+parmenides&amp;q |page=127 |isbn=84-206-7240-8 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Popper did write:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So what was really new in Parmenides was his axiomatic-deductive method, which [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] turned into a hypothetical-deductive method, and thus made part of scientific methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |title=The World of Parmenides: Essays on the Presocratic Enlightenment |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415173019 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">The '''penthouse principle''', a term in [[syntax]] coined by [[John R. Ross]] in 1973, describes the fact that many syntactic phenomena treat matrix (or ''main'') clauses differently from embedded (or ''subordinate'') clauses:

:The ''penthouse principle'': The rules are different if you live in the penthouse.

The ''[[penthouse apartment|penthouse]]'' named in the principle is the top-floor of a highrise apartment building, and is a metaphor for the matrix clause in a multi-clause structure (which, when diagrammed in usual phrase marker notation, contains the highest clause node in the structure). Perhaps the best-known example of a penthouse principle effect is the distribution of [[subject-auxiliary inversion]] in constituent questions in English, which in many (but not all) varieties of English is restricted to matrix clauses:

:(1) a. What can Sam do about it?
:: b. I'll find out what Sam can do about it.

Compare:
:(2) a. *What Sam can do about it?
:: b. *I'll find out what can Sam do about it.

Other phenomena falling under the penthouse principle are V2-effects in the Germanic languages and the distribution of declarative markers, imperative morphology, and of various particles in a variety of languages.&lt;ref&gt;See Merchant 2007 for examples of these.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Henrici''' (born 31 March 1928) is a Swiss [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]], [[Maurice Blondel|Blondelian]] philosopher and professor (1960–1993) at the [[Gregorian University]]. He was Auxiliary Bishop of [[Chur]] from 1993 to 2007.

==Biography==
Born on 31 March 1928 at [[Zurich]], Henrici happens to be a [[cousin]] of the [[Catholic]] [[theologian]] [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ricordiamo [Hans Urs von Balthasar]," ''Monastica'' 4 (1989) 40–48. "Hans Urs von Balthasar: Ein Lebensbild," ''Internationale Katholische Zeitschrift Communio'' 18 (1989) 294–317. "Hans Urs von Balthasar: A sketch of his life," ''Communio: International Catholic Review'' 16 (1989) 306–350.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrici  joined the [[Society of Jesus]] and made his first profession (first vows) in 1947. After studies in [[philology]] at the [[University of Zürich]], he pursued further studies in [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at different universities in [[Rome]], [[Munich]] and [[Lyon]]. He was ordained as a [[Catholic priest|priest]] in 1958, and in 1965 he made his final religious profession as a Jesuit.

==Professor at the Gregorian University==
From 1960 to 1993 Henrici taught History of Modern Western Philosophy at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], Rome, where he also served as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy up to his appointment as Auxiliary Bishop of Chur. He was one of the much sought after professors at the Gregorian. His occasional lecture courses were often given to classes that were packed to overflowing. In the 1990–91 'A Philosophical Discourse for Theology' in the Faculty of Theology, for example, he gave a thrilling overview of the contributions of philosophy to Christian theology beginning from the doctrine of analogy in Plato and coming down to Heidegger. Again, in the 1990 graduate seminar on 'Methods of Interpreting a Philosophical Text,' with a chapter from Blondel's L'Action (1893), he gave hands-on training in the methods of Internal and External Structure, Lexicology, Metaphorology, Internal and External Sources, Redaktionsgeschichte, Wirkungsgeschichte, and Deutungsgeschichte (self- and other-interpretation).

Since 1993, he  served as Visiting Professor at the Theologische Hochschule, Chur, and honorary professor at the [[University of Zürich]]. In 2008 he was named honorary professor of the Theologische Hochschule, Chur.

==Auxiliary bishop of Chur==
In 1993, Henrici was named Auxiliary [[Bishop]] in [[Chur]] (Switzerland) and Titular Bishop of Absorus. Henrici was one of the two auxiliary bishops appointed to Chur in an attempt by the [[Holy See]] to defuse the crisis caused by the conservative policies of Bishop [[Wolfgang Haas]].

His resignation as Auxiliary Bishop was accepted by Pope [[Benedict XVI]] on 5 February 2007, on the ground of age.

==Publications==
Henrici has numerous publications to his credit, among which ''Hegel und Blondel'' (1958), a reworking of his doctoral thesis; ''Aufbrüche christlichen Denkens'' (1978), as also many translations, among others of the works of [[Jean Danielou]], [[Maurice Blondel]], and [[Pierre Favre]].

'''Pop-up Yoga''' refers to a means of teaching the discipline of [[yoga]] in spaces, public or private, in which the ordinary principal use of the space is unrelated to yoga or other forms of [[dance]] or exercise.  Commonly chosen outdoor spaces include [[park]]s, [[beach]]es, [[art gallery|art galleries]], [[public square]]s, outdoor events, and farms.  Indoor spaces may include [[wine shop]]s, [[grocery store]]s, or [[art studio]]s.  An integral part of the philosophy of pop-up yoga is its focus on cultivating a harmonious relationship with one's environment.

Because pop-up yoga is a means of teaching as opposed to a teaching in itself, it is not affiliated with one style of yoga or approach to practice. This allows the teacher of pop-up yoga a freer teaching approach, which results in yoga sessions being more accessible and inclusive. Moreover, in the same spirit of inclusiveness, sessions are offered freely, on a [[suggested donation]] basis.

Pop-up yoga embraces an atypical teacher-student dynamic. Students are free to contribute to teaching, and are frequently invited to introduce an approach to yoga or [[meditation]]. Since pop-up yoga sessions tend to use a location only once, it is useful practice for attendees to suggest future locations.

Pop-up yoga has maintained popularity around Europe, especially in large urban areas, the largest being in Amsterdam. In the United States, the first business to actively promote the "pop up yoga" concept in name and form was Pop Up Yoga in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], VA, with the tagline "Sprouting Locally".  Started by Jacqueline Wilde, an [[MBA]] student at the [[Darden School of Business]], the company started as an incubator project during the summer of 2011. Its first class was held in early summer 2011 during a [[farmer's market]] in Charlottesville.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popupyogacville.com/#!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  https://www.amazon.com/90-Degree-Reflex-Womens-Power/dp/B00IDHFYVM/| title= yoga pants }} Monday, 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''private defense agency''' ('''PDA''') is an enterprise which would provide personal protection and [[military|military defense]] services to individuals who would voluntarily contract for its services. PDAs are advocated in [[anarcho-capitalism]] and market-based forms of [[social anarchism]], such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A PDA is distinguished from a [[Private military company|private contractor]] of the state which is [[Subsidy|subsidized]] financially through [[taxation]] or legally through [[monopoly]] and [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]], and relies on [[conscription]] and other involuntary support. Instead, such agencies would be voluntarily financed primarily by competing [[insurance]] and [[security]] companies, which are penalized for losses and damages, and have a financial incentive to minimize waste and maximize quality of service.

==Theory==
As proponents of [[free-market anarchism]],
[[Benjamin Tucker]]&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin,''The Relation of the State to the Individual'', 1890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tucker |first=Benjamin |title=Liberty and Taxation |journal=[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gustave de Molinari]] first explicitly proposed for-profit private defense agencies.
The concept later was advanced and expanded upon by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] who consider the state to be illegitimate, and therefore believe defense is something that should be provided or determined privately by individuals and firms competing in a free market. The [[Mises Institute]] published a book of essays entitled ''[[The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Mises Review (Vol. 10, No. 1; Spring 2004) A summary is given in a review by David Gordon [https://www.mises.org/misesreview_detail.asp?control=247&amp;sortorder=issue].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray N. Rothbard]] in ''[[For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto]]'' and [[David D. Friedman]] in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' expand substantially on the idea. Both hold that a PDA would be part of a [[privatization|privatized]] system of [[law]], [[police]], [[court]]s, [[insurance companies]] and [[arbitration]] agencies who are responsible for preventing and dealing with aggression. In this environment, [[victimless crime]]s and "crimes against the state" would be rendered [[Mootness|moot]], and the legal realm would be limited to [[contract]]ual disputes and [[tort]] damages, as from [[assault]], [[burglary]], [[pollution]], and all other forms of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard133.html |title=Society without a State |journal=[[The Libertarian Forum]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=January 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Friedman, [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html Police, Courts, and Laws---on the Market], [http://daviddfriedman.com David Friedman home page].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is similar to [[Polycentric law]]. Within [[economics]], discussion of the concept largely has been confined to the [[Austrian School]], as in [[Hans Hoppe]]'s article "The Private Production of Defense" published by the [[Mises Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hans |last=Hoppe |url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_2.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |format=[[PDF]] | title=The Private Production of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors emphasize that PDAs have different motives from existing [[Statism|statist]] defense agencies. Their survival depends on quality of service leading to a wide customer base, rather than the ability to extract funds via the force of law, as is true of [[Sovereign state|states]]. Customers and markets would thus dictate that PDAs minimize offensive tendencies and [[Militarism|militarization]] in favor of a pure defense. Anarcho-capitalists believe such privatization and [[decentralization]] of defense would eliminate the credibility of, and popular support for, the state.

As a private firm offering individually determined defense, the PDA provides a model for how an entirely private defense would work in a free market. [[John Frederic Kosanke]] argues that the need for large-scale defense is minimized in direct inverse proportion to the extent of domestic control by the state. Since the greater number of [[proprietor]]s makes [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] more costly to an aggressor than a relatively authoritarian region, [[vulnerability]] to attack is less likely. Furthermore, since individuals minding their own business pose little threat to neighboring regions, official or [[Ideology|ideological]] justification by those neighbors for attacking them is also proportionately diminished.&lt;ref&gt;John Frederic Kosanke, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/johnfkosanke/Civilization101.html%23biv&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:56:26 "Civilization 101 - Elements of Security"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of monopoly power===
Hoppe points out that there is a contradiction in the beliefs of most philosophers and economists in reference to national defense. They generally hold that any [[monopoly]] is "bad" for consumers because, shielded from potential new entrants into his area of production, the price of his product X will be higher and its quality lower than otherwise. Yet they simultaneously hold that security must be undertaken by the government, which is a territorial monopoly of law and order (the ultimate decision maker and enforcer). Hoppe holds that the two propositions are clearly incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|chapter=Introduction|pages=3–4|author=Hoppe, Hans-Hermann|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari concluded:&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/web/2716 The Production of Security&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|If there is one well-established truth in political economy, it is this: That in all cases, for all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible needs of the consumer, it is in the consumer's best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and of trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum reduction of price. And this: That the interests of the consumer of any commodity whatsoever should always prevail over the interests of the producer. Now in pursuing these principles, one arrives at this rigorous conclusion: That the production of security should, in the interests of the consumers of this intangible commodity, remain subject to the law of free competition. Whence it follows: That no government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.}}
Tyler Cowen, however, argues that allowing private defense agencies would not necessarily prevent a monopoly on defense services, by positing that a cooperating network of such firms could use aggressive force to enforce the [[cartel]]'s market domination. Noting that advocates of PDAs typically argue that abuses would be prevented by the presence of rival agencies acting under the authority of rulings made by arbitrators empowered by inter-agency [[arbitration agreement]]s, Cowen opines, "The adjudication network is stable only if it can use force to put down outlaw agencies that do not accept its higher-order arbitration decisions. Such a network could also use force to put down firms that do not adhere to the collusive agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rejoinder to David Friedman on the Economics of Anarchy|author=Cowen, Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-capitalist]]s argue that competing defense providers would concentrate on comparatively lower-cost defense and security technology rather than relatively costly offensive weaponry, in order to maintain lower premiums and service charges. A company's offensive capabilities would also be readily exposed by such an aggressor's competitors. State-subsidized militaries, in contrast, are granted a distinct offensive advantage, resulting in a proportionately greater tendency toward monopolization.

===Aggression and abuses by private defense agencies===
[[Randall G. Holcombe]] argues that "Firms might prey on their competitors' customers, as competing mafia groups do, to show those customers that their current protective firm is not doing the job and thus to induce them to switch protection firms. This action seems to be a profit-maximizing strategy; hence, protection firms that do not prey on noncustomers may not survive." Holcombe states that [[mafia]]s offers protection for a fee, but it also uses its resources for predation; and thus profit-maximizing firms could be expected to employ them in the dual roles of protection and predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Leeson]] and [[Edward Stringham]] rebut this argument by claiming that unless the firm were overwhelmingly more powerful than its prey, it could incur substantial costs and risks in attempting to extract wealth by force. They argue that the potential for even a small state to inflict losses on a larger state explains why violent confrontations between states are less common than between individuals in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]; in other words, it is not the size of the group in question that matters, since in either case being the aggressor is likely to bring about undesirable risks and diminution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is Government Inevitable? Comment on Holcombe's Analysis|author1=Leeson, Peter  |author2=Stringham, Edward P  |lastauthoramp=yes |ssrn=1674461 |journal=[[Independent Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Linda and Morris Tannehill note that a private defense agency would be unlikely to engage in aggression, as it would not only become a target of retaliatory force, but would become the subject of severe business ostracism. Honest and productive individuals would dissociate themselves from it, fearing that it might use its aggressive force against them in the event of a dispute; or that they might become accidental casualties when retaliatory force is used by one of its other victims; or that their own reputation would suffer due to their ties to it. Moreover, the private defense agency's reputation would suffer and it would be regarded as a poor credit and insurance risk, the latter due to the high risk of claims resulting from its involvement in aggression. The employees and leaders of such an agency as well could face personal civil liability for their involvement, and the agency would not be shielded by [[sovereign immunity]]. High-quality employees would presumably be less willing to be involved with such an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=109–111|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argue that a defense company would be less likely to abuse its power and impose tyranny, noting that it "couldn't extract taxes from them, as a government does...A market relationship is a free relationship, and if a customer doesn't like a company's service or mistrusts its goals, he is free to take his business elsewhere, or to start his own competitive company, or to do without the service and just provide from himself...The objection that a tyrant might take over is actually a devastating argument against government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=115|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard makes a similar point, noting, "Of course, some of the private defense agencies will become criminal, just as some people become criminal now. But the point is that in a stateless society there would be no regular, ''legalized'' channel for crime and aggression, no government apparatus the control of which provides a secure monopoly for invasion of person and property...To create such an instrument ''de novo'' is very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State rulers centuries to create a functioning State apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State with Power and Market|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1054|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued, "If Defense Agency A instead of invading a business decides to invade a more worthwhile target such as a gold warehouse they are left with a much more complicated problem. The gold warehouse is owned by an entrepreneur who has his own defense agency and the gold in the warehouse also have owners that have hired their own respective defense agencies. In essence, Defense Agency A will have to deal with the wrath of the warehouse owner, the warehouse owner's defense agency and the defense agencies of all the owners of the gold in that warehouse."&lt;ref name=Villacampa&gt;{{Cite journal|title=In a State of Anarchy|author=Villacampa, Alexander|publisher=Grove City College|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert P. Murphy opines that given the privatization of other services in an anarcho-capitalist society, "We must consider that in such an environment, the law-abiding majority would have all sorts of mechanisms at their disposal, beyond physical confrontation. Once private judges had ruled against a particular rogue agency, the private banks could freeze its assets (up to the amount of fines levied by the arbitrators). In addition, the private utility companies could shut down electricity and water to the agency’s headquarters, in accordance with standard provisions in their contracts."&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/story/1855&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that customers will be able to hire a competing firm to protect them against a rogue defense agency has been critiqued by Jonathan Bond's essay, ''The Price of Private Law'', which argues, "If two defense firms are engaged in a truly ‘local’ dispute, and the remaining firms are not convinced that either their own interests will be affected or that systemic destabilization will result if the conflict continues, then the costs of intervening and ending the inter-agency war could presumably bar such third parties from stepping into the crossfire." Bond also argues that some firms may not be concerned with the risk of alienating other clients, because their clientele may consist of a small number of, or even only one, enormous multinational corporations. Bond further argues that some PDAs may reduce their risk of retaliation by carrying out anonymous sabotage or terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Price of Private Law|author=Bond, Jonathan C.|date=11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villacampa notes that consumers with large amounts of wealth would likely pay more for private defense, stating "There is no reason for someone void of valuable assets to hire a defense agency that is meant to protect assets other than oneself; but, in an involuntary government payment is demanded for the services regardless of whether they are use or not." He argues an alliance of aggressor private defense agencies would likely be unprofitable: "Chances are high that a mobilization of a mass army of defense agencies will cost more to each individual than his gain from gold, land, and such divided equally amongst themselves. If the region being attacked has large stashes of valuable goods, they will most likely have very effective defense agencies (stronger defense agencies for more valuable assets are logical) and thus the fight against the invading defense agencies will inflict more cost upon the invaders."&lt;ref name=Villacampa/&gt;

===Financing of private defense agencies===
Defense is often viewed as an archetypical [[public good]]{{spaced ndash}}i.e., a product that can only be provided by government because of its [[non-excludability]] and [[non-rivalrous consumption]]. Specifically, the [[free rider problem]], in which people refuse to pay for defense but instead rely on their neighbors to pay for defending the community, is said to make it inevitable that it be financed by taxes if an equitable allocation of costs is to be achieved. According to anarcho-capitalist theorists, there are many ways by which this problem can be overcome or rendered irrelevant. Rothbard's solution was to simply say "Who cares?" when it comes to the issue of free riders. He points out that free riders are commonplace in other aspects of our economy, asking hypothetically, "Are we to be critical because more than one person benefits from someone's actions?...In short, am I to be taxed for enjoying the view of my neighbor's well-kept garden?" He notes that we are all free riders on the past, as we would be living in a primitive society if it were not for the efforts of our ancestors; and we are free riders on the present, because we benefit from the continuing investment of our fellow men and from their specialized skills on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1037|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph R. Stromberg notes that the [[American Revolution]] occurred despite the fact that some individuals might have been free riders who benefited from it without funding it; he opines that successful defense of freedom often relies not on precise allocations of cost, but on "nationalism, religion, the desire for freedom, hatred of the enemy, social pressure to do the right thing, and so on," some of which might represent "[[enlightened self interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|pages=237–238|chapter=Mercenaries, Militias, Guerrillas, and the Defense of Minimal States and Free Societies|author=Stromberg, Joseph R.|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda and Morris Tannehill]] believe that big businesses will tend to pay the bulk of the defense costs (since they stand to lose the most in the event of an attack); they would then pass on the costs to their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the whole population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Foreign Aggression|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=131|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement, requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim would be filed with right of [[subrogation]], and the insurer would hire a private defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the "altruistic" insurer out of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.no-treason.com/archives/2001/06/ No Treason » 2001 » June&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the private defense agency's activity need not be limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including reasonable [[collection cost]]s), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy assets, as [[privateer]]s did in the 18th and 19th centuries under [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Sechrest, Larry J. |authorlink=Larry J. Sechrest |chapter=Privateering and National Defense: Naval Warfare for Private Profit|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=258|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners of war also used to have [[shadow price]]s (ransoms) which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another potential alternative to taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Radnitzky, Gerard|chapter=Is Democracy More Peaceful than Other Forms of Government?|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=147|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes arguments are made for voluntary funding of defense by way of attacking taxation. Anarcho-capitalists often argue, for instance, that the argument that taxation is needed to fund protection of liberty and property from aggression is a contradiction, because taxation itself requires aggression in order to be enforced. Another argument comes from the fact that, unlike voluntary transactions, no [[demonstrated preference]] has been made by the taxpayer; so there is no objective way of showing that he is receiving a service he wants and needs, at a price that is fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Block, Walter|chapter=National Defense and the Theory of Externalities, Public Goods, and Clubs|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=310|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples of widespread use==

===Ancient Europe===
Ancient city-states in Greece and Rome depended on [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgy]]{{spaced ndash}}contributions made by rich citizens for specific purposes{{spaced ndash}}for defense. A liturgy might be used, for instance, to fund the manning of a warship. Although a certain amount was assessed by magistrates, some citizens paid more than required in order to obtain popularity, influence, and sympathy among jurors in the event they were taken to court. During the [[Second Punic War]], [[Quintus Maximus Fabius Verrucosus]] used his personal resources to pay for the release of some Roman prisoners. When the son of [[Scipio Africanus]], who at the time was acting as de facto commander-in chief, was captured during the war against [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 190 BC, he came up with ransom himself. As Rome grew wealthier, greater use was made of private money and/or private armed forces, consisting of relatives and clients, to accomplish public objectives. Between 73 and 71 BC, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] and [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] used their own resources to suppress the armies of [[Spartacus]] in the [[Third Servile War]]. [[Julius Caesar]] made his fortune by vanquishing pirates in the Mediterranean and then by [[Gallic Wars|conquering]] [[Gaul]]. The emergence of the modern state caused the members of the upper classes to be disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the State|author=van Creveld, Martin|pages=32–33, 207|isbn=0-521-65629-X|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Iceland===
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|right|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]] and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society.]]
According to [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], "[[Icelandic Commonwealth|Medieval Icelandic institutions]] have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"&gt;Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]. Retrieved 12 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had "some features" of an anarcho-capitalist society&amp;nbsp;– while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function.  "Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially "public" offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"/&gt;

===American Old West===
According to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that "private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved," and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P. J. [http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wild-west3.pdf An American Experiment in Anarcho-Capitalism: The Not So Wild, Wild West], The Journal of Libertarian Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[squatter]]s had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|page=101|chapter=Private Justice in America|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=1998|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The [[land club]]s and claim associations each adopted their own written contract setting out the laws that provided the means for defining and protecting property rights in the land. They established procedures for registration of land claims, as well as for protection of those claims against outsiders, and for adjudication of internal disputes that arose. The reciprocal arrangements for protection would be maintained only if a member complied with the association's rules and its court's rulings. Anyone who refused would be ostracized. Boycott by a land club meant that an individual had no protection against aggression other than what he could provide himself.}}
According to Anderson, "Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/grilling_terry_l_anderson_free_market_environmentalist/C39/L39/|title=Grilling Terry L.

===Post-Feudal Sicily===
The Mafia began in the 19th century.  Modern scholars believe that the seeds were planted in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of [[feudalism]] beginning in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. [[Primogeniture]] was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land became private property of the peasants.&lt;ref name=sardell&gt;Jason Sardell, [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-103313/unrestricted/JSardellMafia.pdf Economic Origins of the Mafia and Patronage System in Sicily], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After Italy annexed Sicily in 1860, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. The result was a huge boom in landowners — from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.&lt;ref name=bandiera&gt;[[Oriana Bandiera]], [http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf Private States and the Enforcement of Property Rights: Theory and evidence on the origins of the Sicilian mafia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025549/http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf |date=2012-03-19 }}, 2001, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt; With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism.&lt;ref name=Gambetta1993p94&gt;{{harvp|Gambetta|1993|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of manpower was also a problem; there were often fewer than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith. ''A History of Sicily: Modern Sicily, after 1713''. p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding these problems was banditry; rising food prices,&lt;ref name=bandiera/&gt; the loss of public and church lands,&lt;ref name=sardell/&gt; and the loss of feudal [[common rights|commons]] pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors.  These extralegal protectors eventually organized themselves into the first Mafia clans.

'''Richard Edler von Mises'''&lt;ref&gt;{{German title|Edler}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|z|iː|z}};&lt;ref&gt;Also {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|s|iː|z}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|z|ɪ|z}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|z}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|fɔn ˈmiːzəs|lang}}; 19 April 1883 – 14 July 1953) was a scientist and mathematician who worked on [[solid mechanics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[aerodynamics]], [[aeronautics]], [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]]. He held the position of Gordon-McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at [[Harvard University]]. He described his work in his own words shortly before his death as being on

:"... practical analysis, integral and differential equations, mechanics, [[hydrodynamics]] and aerodynamics, constructive geometry, probability calculus, statistics and philosophy."&lt;ref name="JohnsonKotz2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman L.

Although best known for his mathematical work, Mises also contributed to the philosophy of science as a [[Logical positivism|neo-positivist]], following the line of [[Ernst Mach]]. Historians of the [[Vienna Circle]] of [[logical empiricism]] recognize a "first phase" from 1907 through 1914 with  [[Philipp Frank]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], and [[Otto Neurath]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} His older brother, [[Ludwig von Mises]], held an opposite point of view with respect to positivism and epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/story/1700|title=Ludwig von Mises: A Scholar Who Would Not Compromise - Fritz Machlup|first=|last=kanopiadmin|date=15 December 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in [[Istanbul]], Mises maintained close contact with [[Philipp Frank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Life==
Eighteen months after his brother, [[Ludwig von Mises]] (who later became a prominent [[economist]] of the [[Austrian School]]), Richard von Mises was born in [[Lviv|Lemberg]], part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (nowadays Lviv, Ukraine) into a [[Jewish family]]. His parents were Arthur Edler von Mises, a doctor of technical sciences who worked as an expert for the Austrian State Railways, and Adele Landau. Richard and Ludwig also had a younger brother, who died as an infant. Richard attended the [[Akademisches Gymnasium]] in Vienna, from which he graduated with honors in [[Latin]] and mathematics in autumn 1901. After graduating in mathematics, physics and engineering from the [[Vienna University of Technology]], he was appointed as [[Georg Hamel]]'s assistant in Brünn (now [[Brno]]). In 1905, still a student, he published an article on the geometry of curves called "Zur konstruktiven Infinitesimalgeometrie der ebenen Kurven," in the prestigious ''Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik''.
[[Image:Coat of arms of von Mises.gif|thumb|150px|right|The von Mises's family [[coat of arms]]]]

In 1908 Mises was awarded a doctorate from Vienna (his dissertation was on "the determination of flywheel masses in crank drives") and he received his [[habilitation]] from Brünn (now [[Brno]]) (on "Theory of the [[Waterwheel]]s") to lecture on engineering. In 1909, at 26, he was appointed professor of applied mathematics in Straßburg, then part of the [[German Empire]] (now [[Strasbourg]], [[Alsace]], [[France]]) and received [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[citizenship]]. His application for a teaching position at the [[Brno University of Technology]] was interrupted by the [[World War I|First World War]].

Before the war he had already become a pilot and lectured on the design of aircraft, and in 1913 at Strasbourg he gave the first university course on powered flight. On the outbreak of war it was natural for him to join the Austro-Hungarian army as a [[test pilot]] and a flying instructor. In 1915, he supervised the construction of a 600-[[horsepower]] (450 [[kW]]) aircraft – the "Mises-Flugzeug" (Mises aircraft) for the Austrian army. It was completed in 1916 but never saw active war service.

After the war, Mises held the new chair of [[hydrodynamics]] and [[aerodynamics]] at the [[Dresden]] ''Technische Hochschule''. In 1919 he was appointed director (and full professor) at the new Institute of [[Applied Mathematics]] created at the behest of [[Erhard Schmidt]] at the University of Berlin. In 1921 he founded the journal ''Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik'' and became its editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley-vch.de/publish/en/journals/alphabeticIndex/2233/|title=Wiley-VCH - ZAMM|website=www.wiley-vch.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist Party]] to power in 1933, Mises felt his position threatened,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} despite his First World War military service. He moved to [[Turkey]], where he held the newly created chair of Pure and Applied Mathematics at the [[University of Istanbul]]. In 1939 he accepted a position in the [[United States]], where in 1944 he was appointed as Gordon-McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at [[Harvard University]]. He married [[Hilda Geiringer]] in 1943; she had been his assistant at the Institute and followed him to Turkey and then to the U.S. after losing her position in December 1933.

In 1950 Mises declined an offer of honorary membership from the [[Communist]]-dominated [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] Academy of Science.

==Contributions==
In aerodynamics, von Mises made notable advances in boundary-layer-flow theory and airfoil design. He developed the ''[[Von Mises stress|distortion energy theory]]'' of [[Stress (physics)|stress]], which is one of the most important concepts used by [[engineer]]s in material strength calculations.

His ideas were not unanimously well received, although [[Alexander Ostrowski]] had said of him:

:"Only with the appointment of Richard von Mises to the University of Berlin did the first serious German school of applied mathematics with a broad sphere of influence come into existence. Von Mises was an incredibly dynamic person and at the same time amazingly versatile like [[Carl David Tolmé Runge|Runge]]. He was especially well versed in the realm of technology."

and also wrote:

:"Because of his dynamic personality his occasional major blunders were somehow tolerated. One has even forgiven him his theory of probability."

Yet [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], whose rival [[Axiomatic system|axiomatisation]] was better received, was less severe:

:"The basis for the applicability of the results of the mathematical theory of probability to real 'random phenomena' must depend on some form of the frequency concept of probability, the unavoidable nature of which has been established by von Mises in a spirited manner."

In [[solid mechanics]], von Mises made an important contribution to the theory of [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] by formulating what has become known as the [[von Mises yield criterion]], independently of [[Tytus Maksymilian Huber]].

He is also often credited for the [[Principle of Maximum Plastic Dissipation]].

In [[probability theory]], he was the person who originally proposed the now famous "[[birthday problem]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teacherlink.org/content/math/interactive/probability/lessonplans/birthday/home.html The Birthday Problem]&lt;/ref&gt; He also defined the [[impossibility of a gambling system]].&lt;ref&gt;''Probability, Statistics and Truth'' by Richard von Mises 1928/1981 Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-24214-5}} page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Counting for something: statistical principles and personalities'' by William Stanley Peters 1986 {{ISBN|0-387-96364-2}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">The '''Sábato triangle''' ({{lang-es|Triángulo de Sabato}}) is a model concerned with linkages between science, industry and government, which has informed discussions of science policy throughout Latin America. It was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by the Argentine physicist and metallurgist [[Jorge Sábato|Jorge Alberto Sábato]], of the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA, the Argentine government agency overseeing development of nuclear power in the country).

==Brief description==
The idea of the triangle was proposed by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and developed by Sábato as a model of [[policy]]-making in science and technology.&lt;ref name="Adler1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emanuel Adler|title=The Power of Ideology: The Quest for Technological Autonomy in Argentina and Brazil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSih4JkUBesC&amp;pg=PA302|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|302-303}}  The model is based on the concept that in order for a scientific-technological system to exist in practice it is necessary for three sectors to be strongly linked together over the long term: the [[State (polity)|State]] (which formulates and implements policy); the scientific and technological infrastructure (which provides technology); and the productive sector (which uses technology). These ''interrelationships'' are portrayed in the form of a [[triangle]].&lt;ref name="Adler1987" /&gt;{{rp|58-59}}&lt;ref name="GöranssonBrundenius2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bo Göransson|author2=Claes Brundenius|author3=Carlos Aguirre-Bastos|title=Innovation Systems for Development: Making Research and Innovation in Developing Countries Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54AwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|year=2016|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78347-383-0|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, each "[[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]" needs to have strong ''internal relations'', that is to say, relations between the different institutions contained within itself.  For example, within the State there needs to be coherence between "implicit" policy and "explicit" policy, between different [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] and autonomous organizations, and so on. The other factor considered is the ''external relations'' between the "vertices" and outside entities.

The triangle has been used to shed light on technological [[Dependency theory|dependency]]. The model predicts that the stronger the external relations, the weaker or non-existent will be the interrelationships and the internal relations, and this will delay the country in reducing its dependency.&lt;ref name="Bastos2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Ines Bastos|title=The Politics of Technology in Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgWFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-79937-4|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The Sábato Triangle won acceptance in several countries of Latin America, having an effect upon science and technology policy there and disseminating the belief that the State had an important role in promoting [[technology transfer]].&lt;ref name="Adler1987" /&gt;{{rp|58}}{{rp|302-303}} However, a separation of the three components of the "triangle" has still been observed in more recent times.&lt;ref name="GibsonHeitor2005"&gt;Isabel Bortagaray and Scott Tiffin, "Innovation clusters in Latin America", in {{cite book|author1=David V. Gibson|author2=Manuel V. Heitor|author3=Alejandro Ibarra Yunez (eds.)|title=Learning and Knowledge for the Network Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPlZgenaAZEC&amp;pg=PA273|year=2005|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-356-2|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]] may be described in terms of their '''matter and form'''.  
==History==
The idea seems to have been first proposed by [[William of Auxerre]].  Thus, for example, the ''matter'' for [[Baptism]] is water; the ''matter'' for the [[Eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]] is bread and wine.  The ''form'' of a sacrament consists of the words by which the Sacrament is affected.  Thus Saint Thomas held that the form of the [[Confession (Catholic Church)|sacrament of Penance]] was "I absolve thee."

The Catechism of the [[Council of Trent]] states it this way: "Every Sacrament consists of two things, matter, which is called the element, and form, which is commonly called the word."
==Matter and form==
{{see also|Matter (philosophy)|Theory of forms}}
The term "matter" should be taken broadly to mean that which underlies the sacrament in a manner similar that the way in which matter underlies substance.  Thus the three acts of the penitent are  taken to be the matter of Penance: repenting of one's sins, confessing them in words, and doing the penance assigned.

Secondly the form of a sacrament may take significantly different forms in different churches.  Thus, for example, though Saint Thomas held the form of [[confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] to be "I sign thee with the sign of the cross...", the [[Byzantine Rite]] uses the form "The sign of the seal of the Holy Spirit."

'''Sufi whirling''' (or Sufi turning) ({{lang-tr|Semazen}}) is a form of physically active [[meditation]] which originated among [[Sufism|Sufi]]s, and which is still practiced by the Sufi [[Dervish]]es of the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] order and other orders such as the Rifa'i-Marufi.  It is a customary meditation practice performed within the [[Sema]], or worship ceremony, through which dervishes (also called ''semazens'', from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|سماعزن}}) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal. This is sought through abandoning one's [[nafs]], [[egos]] or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on [[God]], and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the [[Solar System]] orbiting the sun.&lt;ref name="MOA sema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|title=The Sema of the Mevlevi|publisher=Mevlevi Order of America|accessdate=2009-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121221021339/http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|archivedate=21 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mevlevi practice gave rise to an Egyptian form, ''tanoura'', distinguished by the use of a multicolored skirt. This has also developed into a [[performance dance]] by non-Sufis, including dancers outside the [[Islamic world]].

== Origin ==
[[Image:Dansende derwisjen Rijksmuseum SK-A-4081.jpeg|thumb|''Mevlevi dervishes whirling in [[Beyoğlu|Pera]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste van Mour]]]]

"In the 12th century, Sufi fraternities ({{lang|ar|طرائق}} ''[[tariqa|ṭarāʾiq]]'') were first organized as an established leadership in which a member followed a prescribed discipline in service to a sheikh or master in order to establish rapport with him."&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"&gt;"Dervish." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 21 Sept. 2009 [http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9030024 Dervish]&lt;/ref&gt; A member of such a fraternity is referred to as a Persian ''darwish.''&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; These turuk (plural of tariqa) were responsible for organizing an Islamic expression of religious life, often founded by independent saints or resulted from the division of existing orders.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"&gt;MacDonald, D.B. "Darwish (Darwesh)." Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P.B. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2009. Brill Online. Augustana. 21 September 2009. [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-1731 Darwish (Darwesh)]&lt;/ref&gt; Each Sufi tariqa stems from a unique ''silsila'', or "chain of order" in which a member must learn, as the ''silsila'' binds each member to Allah through one's chain of order.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; One's ''silsila'' extends through the member's individual teacher, to their teacher and so on, through time until one is connected to the Prophet and thus Allah.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; The Prophet himself is revered as the originator of Sufism, which has in turn been traced down through a series of saints.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt;

== Practice ==
{{Sufism}}
A dervish practices multiple rituals, the primary of which is the ''[[dhikr]]'', a remembering of Allah.&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; The ''dhikr'' involves recitation of devotional Islamic prayer. This ''dhikr'' is coupled with physical exertions of movement, specifically dancing and whirling, in order to reach a state assumed by outsiders to be one of "ecstatic trances".&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; As explained by Sufis:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160306104925/http://whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (''tennure'') represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (''hırka''), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn [[Rumi]] says, "All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the Mevlevi order, the practice of ''dhikr'' is performed in a traditional dress: a ''tennure'', a sleeveless white frock, the ''destegul'', a long sleeved jacket, a belt, and a black overcoat or ''khirqa'' to be removed before the whirling begins.&lt;ref name="Schimmel1975"/&gt; As the ritual dance begins, the dervish dons a felt cap, a ''sikke'', in addition to a turban wrapped around the head, a trademark of the Mevlevi order.&lt;ref name="Schimmel1975"/&gt; The sheikh leads the ritual with strict regulations. To begin,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sheikh stands in the most honored corner of the dancing place, and the dervishes pass by him three times, each time exchanging greetings, until the circling movement starts. The rotation itself is on the left foot, the center of the rotation being the ball of the left foot and the whole surface of the foot staying in contact with the floor. The impetus for the rotation is provided by the right foot, in a full 360-degree step. If a dervish should become too enraptured, another Sufi, who is in charge of the orderly performance, will gently touch his frock in order to curb his movement, The dance of the dervishes is one of the most impressive features of the mystical life in Islam, and the music accompanying it is of exquisite beauty, beginning with the great hymn in honor of the Prophet (na't-i sharif, written by Jalaluddin himself) and ending with short, enthusiastic songs, some things sung in Turkish.&lt;ref name="Schimmel1975"&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie. ''Mystical Dimensions of Islam''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina press, 1975. Print. Page 325.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Western world, having witnessed Sufi whirling through tourism, have described the various forms of ''dhikr'' as "barking, howling, dancing, etc."&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; The practice of each ''tariqa'' is unique to its individual order, specific traditions and customs may differ across countries. The same ''tariqa'' in one country will not mirror that of another country as each order's ritual stresses "emotional religious life" in various forms.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; The Mevleviyah order, like many others, practice the ''dhikr'' by performing a whirling meditation. Accompanying the ''dhikr'' practices of whirling and prayer, the custom of ''sama'' serves to further one's "nourishment of the soul" through devotional "hearing" of the "'subtle' sounds of the hidden world or of the cosmos."&lt;ref name="Sama BO"&gt;During, J.; Sellheim, R. "Sama". ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2009. BRill Online. Augustana. 21 Sept. 2009 [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-0992 Sama]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the use of ''sama'', whirling and devotional prayer in the practice of ''dhikr'', the ''tariqa'' orders perform Sufi whirling in addition to playing musical instruments, consuming glowing embers, live scorpions and glass, puncturing body parts with needles and spikes, or practicing clairvoyance and levitation.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; The dervish practice can be performed by community residents or lay members, members have typically been those of lower classes.&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; Within Islamic faith, unlike Middle Eastern law, women have equal status to men, allowing women to participate in ''dhikr'' as dervishes themselves.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; Women were received into a ''tariqa'' order by a male sheikh, but traditionally were instructed to practice the ''dhikr'' alone or with an established branch of females within a specific order.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; Sufi whirling, a worship of ''dhikr'', became a gender and class neutral practice throughout the Central Islamic region.

The custom of ''[[sama (Sufism)|sama]]'' among Sufi orders has a history of controversy within the Islamic faith. In one argument, the use of the term ''sama'' is considered to suggest physically "listening" in a spiritual context.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; A differing opinion argues that ''sama'' is in fact "hearing", as "to hear" can pertain to any sound in addition to any "subtle" sounds of the spiritual realm.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; Those in support of ''sama'' further claim that the term is actually synonymous with "understanding" and therefore recognition and application of the Revelation as well as the act of "attaining higher knowledge."&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; The spread of ''sama'' among Sufi orders began some time around the mid 3rd/9th century C.E. in Baghdad, eventually finding acceptance and favor in Persian, Turkish and Indian Islam.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; The custom of ''sama'' evolved in practice over time as it complimented Sufi ''dhkir'', whirling and among some orders dancing and a meal.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; Rules of propriety and conditions were adopted upon the widespread concern surrounding the necessity of ''sama'' with the ''dhikr''; in order to distinguish between entertainment and valuable spiritual practice, the ''sama'' was distinguished as heard from the ego, heart or spirit.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; Despite the application of rules, some sheikhs continued to limit or disapprove the practice of ''sama''. While controversy continuously questioned the place of ''sama'' in Sufi orders, the music itself was not affected.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; More recently, the custom of ''sama'' is most commonly performed within a ''dhikr'' ceremony. Those in support of ''sama'' continue to argue that "according to that which it is not ''sama'' and dance which induce ecstasy, but ecstasy which arouses dance, or furthermore, that ''sama'' is only a revealing instrument and that it only supplies that which is brought to it by the hearer."&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt;

In 2005, [[UNESCO]] proclaimed the "[[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] [[Sema|Sema Ceremony]]" of [[Turkey]] as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/39eur_uk.htm The Mevlevi Sema Ceremony] [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
Dervish communities, in the Middle Ages, served a central role in social, religious and political life throughout "central Islamic lands."&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; Dervish orders were at one time much larger in size than they are today, as the government has taken control over most Dervish monasteries throughout this area.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; In 1925, Turkey ordered the dissolution of all Sufi fraternities by decree, the Mevlevi managed to survive among small villages throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Mawlawiyah EBO"/&gt; In 1954, the Turkish government granted the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi order]] a special permission to perform ritual whirling practices for tourists during two weeks each year.&lt;ref name="Mawlawiyah EBO"/&gt; Outside of tourist entertainment, Orthodox theologians have now vocally discounted the Dervish practice resulting in ''faqirs'', or wandering, mendicant dervishes throughout central Islamic regions.&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; Despite strict government control over Dervish practices, the Mevleviyah order continued its existence in Turkey to this day.&lt;ref name="Mawlawiyah EBO"&gt;"Mawlawiyah." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 21 Sept. 2009. [http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9051529 Mawlawiyah]&lt;/ref&gt;

While only men have historically been permitted to take part in the ceremony, some communities now allow women to participate.&lt;ref name="changeafoot"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/12/16/turkey.whirling.dervishes/ |title=Change is afoot for 800-year-old whirling dance |first=Mohammed |last=Jamjoom |work=CNN |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System |date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional and secular forms==
==={{anchor|Tanoura}}Egyptian tanoura===
[[File:Tanoura Dance, Egypt.jpg|thumb|Egyptian tanoura dancers]]
In [[Egypt]], the practice of whirling has been adapted as '''tanoura''' ({{lang-ar|التنورة}} ''{{transl|ar|el-tanoura}}''). The word ''tanoura'' or ''tannoura'' refers to the [[tanoura (skirt)|colorful skirt]] worn by the whirler, with a color representing each [[Sufi order]].&lt;ref name=feedfury&gt;[http://entertainment.feedfury.com/content/34279531-egyptian-folk-dance-tanoura.html Egyptian Folk Dance Tanoura at entertainment.feedfury.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The word may also refer to the dancer, traditionally a Sufi man.&lt;ref name=feedfury/&gt; Tanoura is associated with Sufism and is performed at Sufi festivals, but it is also performed by non-Sufis as a [[folk dance]] or [[concert dance]].

Although it is mainly used for visual effects, the dancers also augment their balance with the tanoura, through a dynamic centrifugal effect.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Pakistan===
In Sufi shrines in Pakistan, such as the [[Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar|Lal shrine]] in [[Sehwan]], [[Sindh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.outlookpakistan.com/deadliest-sehwan-attack-fails-to-bar-devotees-from-holding-dhamaal-at-shrine/6231/ |title=Deadliest Sehwan attack fails to bar devotees from holding Dhamaal at shrine |first=Atique |last=Sherwan |work=Outlook Pakistan |date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Akhtar|first1=Suleman|title=Damadam mast Qalandar is a cry of rebellion against established orders|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1315839/damadam-mast-qalandar-is-a-cry-of-rebellion-against-established-orders|accessdate=22 February 2017|publisher=Dawn|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of Sufi whirling is called ''Dhamaal'' and is performed to honor Sufi saints, or [[Qalandar (title)|qalandar]]s.&lt;ref name="PAA2015"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sci-int.com/pdf/46353304515%20Special%20issue%202%20Shaheer%20Ellahi%20Exploring%20the%20Sufi%20Dance%20in%20Pakistan.pdf |author=Shaheer Ellahi Khan |title=Sufi Dance in Pakistan: Anthropological Insights on the Concept and Origin of ''Dhamal'' |journal=Science International |volume=27 |number=2 |year=2015 |pages=1641–1643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Turkish practice, Dhamaal may be practiced by any devotee – priests as well as pilgrims. Dhamaal is usually preceded by the beating of a drum (naghara) and ringing of bells, as pilgrims raise their hands, start to skip steps standing at one place and gradually work into a trance as the beats get faster. As the beats get faster, rhythms change and the drum beats are accompanies by the playing of [[shehnai]].

Practitioners associate the dance with [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]] and with protests following the [[Battle of Karbala]]. They regard the rhythm of the drum to evoke the rhythm of the creation of the universe, as illustrated in the concept of [[Kun (Islamic term)|''Kun Fyakun'']].&lt;ref name="PAA2015"/&gt;

===In the West===
[[File:Whirling Dancer.jpg|thumb|Whirling dancer, performing in a modern costume]]
The tanoura tradition has attracted some interest from [[Western world|Westerners]] in the [[belly dancing]] community. These performers include both men and women, solo and in groups. Such performances may be augmented with [[pyrotechnics]] or props, such as veils, wings and ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2013/01/11/whirling-tanoura-nicole/#axzz42cy63H97 |title=Whirling: Meditation in Motion or Spectacular Show? |first=Nicole |last=McLaren |date=11 January 2013 |work=Gilded Serpent}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2016}}
The techniques used in Egyptian Tanoura can also be adopted by belly dancers to help with their balance and control dizziness.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Sufi whirling has also been promoted by actor and memoirist [[Annabelle Gurwitch]] as a form of stress relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |url=http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/14-days-shut-down-your-sugar-cravings?video_id=3825535920001 |title=How to Tell if You're a Member of the 4 A.M.

==Physiology==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
A defining feature of whirling is continuous [[rotation]] (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a central [[radical axis]] while avoiding [[vertigo]]. In untrained dancers, this sustained rotation causes [[dizziness]] or motion-induced vertigo. Training for whirling {{clarify span|targets the [[inner ear]]|date=June 2016}}, which is responsible for balance functions in humans. To counteract this effect, whirling dance performers practice various balancing and psychological techniques {{such as?}}.

==Records==
[[Guinness World Record]]s for "most Sufi whirls in one hour" were awarded in London in 2012, to Shafik Ibrahim Abd El Hamed in the male category with 2,905 rotations, and Tara Lee Oakley in the female category with 2,191.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxYrazfB3uE |title=World Record for Sufi Whirling |work=Afaq |publisher=[[BBC Arabic Television]] |year=2012 |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; These records were surpassed in Zurich in 2015 by Nicole McLaren, with 3,552 rotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lukhi |first=Angela |url=http://newsivity.com/news/dancer-nicole-mclaren-puts-her-fans-in-a-record-breaking-spin-in-switzerland |date=23 March 2015 |title=Dancer Nicole McLaren puts her fans in a record-breaking spin in Switzerland |work=Newsivity |publisher=Guavo Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The logical property that is variously described as [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]], [[defeasibility]], or [[falsifiability]], which means that [[counterexample]]s to the hypothesis are logically possible.
#The [[practical]] feasibility of observing a [[reproducibility|reproducible]] series of such counterexamples if they do exist. 
In short, a [[hypothesis]] is testable if there is some real hope of deciding whether it is true or false of real experience. Upon this property of its constituent hypotheses rests the ability to decide whether a [[theory]] can be supported or falsified by the data of actual experience. If hypotheses are tested, initial results may also be labeled inconclusive.

{{essay|date=January 2012}}
'''Verisimilitude''' (or '''truthlikeness''') is a philosophical concept that distinguishes between the relative and apparent (or seemingly so) [[truth]] and [[falsity]] of [[Logical assertion|assertion]]s and [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_V.html|title=Definition of Verisimilitude, Carson-Newman University|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of verisimilitude is the problem of articulating what it takes for one false [[Philosophical theory|theory]] to be closer to the truth than another false theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://public.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/realism.htm|title=Realism in AmericanLiterature, 1860-1890, Washington State University|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://literarydevices.net/verisimilitude/|title=Definition of Verisimilitude, Literary Devices|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem was central to the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] of [[Karl Popper]], largely because Popper was among the first to  affirm that truth is the aim of [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] while acknowledging that most of the greatest scientific theories in the [[history of science]] are, strictly speaking, false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://philosophy.wisc.edu/forster/220/notes_10.html|title=The Problem of Verisimilitude, University of Wisconsin-Madison|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If this long string of purportedly false theories is to constitute progress with respect to the goal of truth, then it must be at least possible for one false theory to be closer to the truth than others.

==Karl Popper==
{{also|Karl Popper#Truth}}
Popper assumed that scientists are interested in highly informative theories, in part for methodological reasons—the more informative a theory, the easier it is to test, and the greater its predictive power. But clearly [[Occam's razor|informative power by itself is rather easy to come by, and we do not want to gain content by sacrificing truths]]. So Popper proposed that closeness to the truth is a function of two factors—truth and content. The more truths that a theory [[Logical consequence|entails]] (other things being equal) the closer it is to the truth. 

Intuitively at least, it seems that [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of motion entails a good many more truths than does, say, [[Aristotle]]'s theory—despite the fact that both are known to have flaws. Even two true theories can have differing degrees of verisimilitude, depending on how much true information they deliver. For example, the claim "it will be raining on Thursday next week," if true, is closer to the truth than the true yet logically weaker claim "it will either be raining next Thursday or it will be sunny".

Popper's formal definition of verisimilitude was challenged since 1974 by [[Pavel Tichý]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Pavel Tichý]] |title=On Popper's Definitions of Verisimilitude |journal=[[The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=June 1974 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=155–160 |jstor=686819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pavel Tichý |title=Verisimilitude Redefined  |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |publisher= |location= |date=March 1976 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=25-42 |jstor=686376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Henry Harris (philosopher)|John Henry Harris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[John Henry Harris (philosopher)|John H. Harris]] |title=Popper's Definitions of 'Verisimilitude' |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |date=June 1974 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=160-166 |jstor=686820}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] |title=Popper's Qualitative Theory of Verisimilitude |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |date=June 1974 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=166–177 |jstor=686821}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that Popper's definition has an [[unintended consequences|unintended consequence]]: that no false theory can be closer to the truth than another. Popper himself stated: "I accepted the criticism of my definition within minutes of its presentation, wondering why I had not seen the mistake before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Karl Popper]] |editor=[[W. W. Bartley III]] |title=Realism and the Aim of Science. From the Postcript to the Logic of Scientific Discovery |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tlowU8nS2ygC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2013 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=4L6GswEACAAJ 1983] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=1-1358-5895-0 |id={{ISBN|978-1-135-85895-7}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=tlowU8nS2ygC&amp;pg=PR36&amp;dq=%22I+accepted+the+criticism+of+my+definition+within+minutes+of+its+presentation,+wondering+why+I+had+not+seen+the+mistake+before%22 xxxvi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result gave rise to a search for an account of verisimilitude that did not deem progress towards the truth an impossibility.

==Post-Popperian theories==

Some of the new theories (e.g. those proposed by David Miller and by [[Theo Kuipers]]) build on Popper's approach, guided by the notion that truthlikeness is a function of a truth factor and a content factor. Others (e.g. those advanced by {{ill|Gerhard Schurz|de}} in collaboration with {{ill|Paul Weingartner|de}}, by Mortensen, and by [[Ken Gemes]]) are also inspired by Popper's approach but locate what they believe to be the error of Popper's proposal in his overly generous notion of content, or consequence, proposing instead that the consequences that contribute to closeness to truth must be, in a technical sense, "relevant". A different approach (already proposed by [[Pavel Tichý|Tichý]] and {{ill|Risto Hilpinen|fi}} and developed especially by [[Ilkka Niiniluoto]] and [[Graham Oddie]]) takes the "likeness" in truthlikeness literally, holding that a proposition's likeness to the truth is a function of the overall likeness to the actual world of the possible worlds in which the proposition would be true. An attempt to use the notion of point-free metric space is proposed by Giangiacomo Gerla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Graham |last=Oddie|title= Truthlikeness|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truthlikeness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently a debate about whether or to what extent these different approaches to the concept are compatible.&lt;ref&gt; Zwart, S. D., and Franssen, M.: An impossibility theorem for verisimilitude. ''Synthese'', '''158''':1 (2007), 75&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Oddie, Graham (2013). The content, consequence and likeness approaches to verisimilitude: compatibility, trivialization, and underdetermination. ''Synthese'' '''190''' (9):1647-1687.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Gerla, G., 2007, "Point free geometry and verisimilitude of theories", Journal of Philosophical Logic, 36: 707–733.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Another problem in Popper's theory of verisimilitude is the connection between truthlikeness as the goal of scientific progress, on the one hand, and methodology, on the other hand, as the ways in which we can to some extent ensure that scientific research actually approaches this goal.{{fact|date=April 2012}} Popper conceived of his definition as a justification of his own preferred methodology: [[falsificationism]], in the following sense: suppose theory A is closer to the truth than theory B according to Popper's qualitative definition of verisimilitude; in this case, we will (or should, if that definition had been logically sound) have that all true consequences of B (ie: all predicted consequences of theory B's mathematical and physical predictions subject to a particular set of initial conditions) are consequences of [theory] A (['s] similarly predicted consequences – i.e., informally, B ≤ A), and that all false consequences of A are consequences of B (in that those set of events deemed impossible by theory A are a subset of those events deemed impossible B, subject to the same initial data conditions for both – i.e., informally, ¬B ≥ ¬A, so that ¬A ≤ ¬B); this means that, if A and B are so related, then it should be the case that all ''known'' false [[Empirical research|empirical]] consequences of A also follow from B, and all ''known'' true empirical consequences of B do follow from A. So, if A were closer to the truth than B, then A should be better [[Corroboration|corroborated]] than B by any possible amount of [[empirical evidence]]. Lastly, this easy theorem allows interpretation of the fact that A is actually better corroborated than B as a ''corroboration of the hypothesis'' (or 'meta-hypothesis') that A is more verisimilar than B.

'''Witelo''' (also ''Erazmus Ciołek Witelo; Witelon; Vitellio; Vitello; Vitello Thuringopolonis; Vitulon; Erazm Ciołek''); born ca. 1230, probably in [[Legnica]] in [[Lower Silesia]]; died after 1280, before 1314) was a [[friar]], [[theology|theologian]] and [[scientist]]: a [[physicist]], [[natural philosopher]], [[mathematician]]. He is an important figure in the [[history of philosophy in Poland#Scholasticism|history of philosophy in Poland]]. On the [[Moon]] there is a [[Impact crater|crater]], ''[[Vitello (crater)|Vitello]]'', named after him.

== Life ==
Witelo's mother was from a Polish knightly house, while his father was a [[Germans|German]] settler from [[Thuringia]]. He called himself, in [[Latin]], "''Thuringorum et Polonorum filius''" — "a son of [[Thuringians]] and [[Poles]]."  He studied at [[University of Padua|Padua University]] about 1260, then went on to [[Viterbo]].  He became friends with [[William of Moerbeke]], the translator of [[Aristotle]].  Witelo's major surviving work on [[optics]], ''Perspectiva'', completed in about 1270–78,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/dlc/garland/deweever/UV/vitulon.htm CHAUCER NAME DICTIONARY Copyright © 1988, 1996 Jacqueline de Weever Published by Garland Publishing, Inc., New York and London.]&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated to William. In 1284 he described [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]] of light.&lt;ref name="RosenGothard2009"&gt;Joe Rosen; Lisa Quinn Gothard. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=avyQ64LIJa0C Encyclopedia of Physical Science]''. Infobase Publishing; 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-7011-4}}. p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Perspectiva'' ==
[[Image:Witelo-Perspectiva.jpg|thumb|225px|Page from a manuscript of ''De Perspectiva'', with miniature of its author Witelo]]
Witelo's ''Perspectiva'' was largely based on the work of the [[polymath]] [[Alhazen]] ([[Ibn al-Haytham]]; d. ca. 1041) and in turn powerfully influenced later scientists, in particular [[Johannes Kepler]].  Witelo's treatise in optics was closely linked to the Latin version of Ibn al-Haytham's Arabic opus: ''[[Book of Optics|Kitab al-manazir]]'' (''The Book of Optics''; ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectivae''), and both were printed in the [[Friedrich Risner]] edition ''Opticae Thesaurus'' (Basel, 1572).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], "A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen’s ''Optics''", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', Vol. 15, Issue 2 (2005), pp. 189-218 (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Witelo's ''Perspectiva'', which rested on Ibn al-Haytham's research in optics, influenced also the Renaissance theories of perspective. [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s ''Commentario terzo'' (''Third Commentary'') was based on an Italian translation of Witelo's Latin tract: ''Perspectiva''.&lt;ref&gt;Graziela F. Vescovini, "Contributo per la storia della fortuna di Alhazen in Italia: II volgarizzamento del MS. Vat. 4595 e il '''Commentario terzo''' del Ghiberti, ''Rinascimento'', V (1965), pp. 1749 -- Also (''Ibid'', El-Bizri, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Witelo's treatise also contains much material in [[psychology]], outlining views that are close to modern notions on the [[Association (psychology)|association]] of ideas and on the [[subconscious]].

''Perspectiva'' also includes [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] discussions.  Witelo argues that there are intellectual and corporeal bodies, connected by causality (corresponding to the [[Idealism|Idealist]] doctrine of the universal and the actual), emanating from [[God]] in the form of Divine Light.  [[Light]] itself is, for Witelo, the first of all sensible entities, and his views on light are similar to those held by [[Roger Bacon]], though he is closer in this to [[Alhazen]]'s legacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', El-Bizri, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other works ==
In ''Perspectiva'', Witelo refers to other works that he had written.  Most of these do not survive, but ''De Natura Daemonum'' and ''De Primaria Causa Paenitentiae'' have been recovered.

'''Yehuda Elkana''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{rtl-lang|he|יהודה אלקנה}}&amp;lrm;; 16 June 1934{{spaced ndash}}21 September 2012)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9737917/Professor-Yehuda-Elkana.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a historian and [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], and a former President and [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[Central European University]] in [[Budapest|Budapest, Hungary]]. He was married to Dr Yehudit Elkana and had four children.

==Life and career==
Born as László Fröhlich to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]-speaking Jewish parents in Yugoslavia, Elkana moved with his family to [[Szeged]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=eden /&gt; That same year, Elkana and his parents were dispatched to [[Auschwitz]]. His family escaped the [[gas chamber]]s when the [[Nazism|Nazis]] transferred them to [[Austria]] as [[Corvée|corvée labourers]] for the reconstruction of war-torn cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, at the age of 14, he [[aliyah|immigrated to Israel]]. He took up residence in [[HaZore'a|Kibbutz HaZore'a]], but health problems impeded Elkana from performing physical tasks. The [[kibbutz]] helped him acquire a scholarship to [[The Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. Soon after beginning his studies, Elkana decided he wished to be a philosopher and a historian of science. In 1955 he took up the study of mathematics and physics at the [[Hebrew University]]. He taught at [[Gymnasia Rehavia]] while undertaking his [[Master's degree]], which meant that it took him 11 years to complete it.&lt;ref name=eden /&gt; He then obtained a [[doctorate]] from [[Brandeis University]] with a thesis on ''On the Emergence of the Energy Concept'' in 1968, which formed the basis for his book, ''The discovery of the conservation of energy'' (1974). After receiving his Ph.D. he taught at [[Harvard University]] for a year. When he returned to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem he was named chairman of the department of the history and philosophy of science, becoming in the meantime Director of the [[Van Leer Jerusalem Institute]] in 1968, a post he held until 1993.

He has taught at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref name=eden&gt;{{harvnb|Eden|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a [[Fellow]] of the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], [[Stanford University]] (1973–1974), a [[Research fellow|Visiting Fellow]] at [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford]] (1977–1978), a visiting researcher at the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech and was Director of the [[History of science and technology|Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas]] at [[Tel Aviv University]] from 1981 to 1991. From 1995 to 1999 he was professor of Theory of Science at [[ETH Zurich]]. He was a permanent fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin]] (''Wissenschaftskolleg Berlin'').

Elkana was a [[Academician|corresponding member]] of the International Academy for the History of Science as well as, since 1997, member of the Science Board of Advisors of the ''Collegium Helveticum'' in [[Zürich]]. He was a co-founder and editor of the scientific journal ''Science in Context''.

During his tenure at the Wissenschaftskolleg in 2009/10 he began to work on a global initiative to reform undergraduate university curricula, in order to tackle the problems he outlined in earlier [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2663546148976112660# public appearances]. This resulted in the foundation of the [http://www.curriculumreform.org Curriculum Reform Forum]. Until shortly before his death he worked with his co-author Hannes Klöpper on his last major work entitled: "Die Universität im 21. Jahrhundert: Für eine neue Einheit von Lehre, Forschung und Gesellschaft", which was published in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koerber-stiftung.de/edition-koerber-stiftung/programm/bildungwissenschaft/artikel-detailseite/buch/die-universitaet-im-21-jahrhundert.html Yehuda Elkana, Hannes Klöpper "Die Universität im 21. Jahrhundert: Für eine neue Einheit von Lehre, Forschung und Gesellschaft", Körber Stiftung, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; An English version is in the works.

===President of Central European University===
In 1999, Elkana began his tenure as President and Rector of the [[Central European University]], succeeding [[Josef Jarab]]. The third rector of the university in nine years, Elkana held the post until being replaced in August 2009 by [[John Shattuck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agovino|2000|p=A63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UWN|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his tenure, Elkana came under fire for his handling of the dismissal of the head of the Program for Gender and Culture and the firing of a part-time professor in that program. Describing himself as a "lifelong feminist", Elkana said that while he understood the furor over the incident as he felt that women are often treated unfairly, his decision was sound.&lt;ref name=Agovino64&gt;{{harvnb|Agovino|2000|p=A64}}&lt;/ref&gt; He oversaw the reorganization of the department of environmental sciences, halving the ratio of students to professors by both decreasing the number of students within the program and hiring additional professors. By the end of Elkana's term the Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy had become one of the most successful Departments at CEU in terms of the number of applicants and external research funding.&lt;ref name=Agovino64 /&gt;

During Elkana's term five new Departments: Philosophy, Mathematics, Sociology and Social Anthropology, and Public Policy as well as 15 research centers including the Center for Cognitive Science (from 2010 the Department of Cognitive Science), the Center for Ethics and Law in Biomedicine (CELAB) and the Center for Policy Studies (CPS) were established at CEU. CEU received its institutional accreditation from the [[Middle States Commission on Higher Education]] ) and was legally recognized as a Hungarian University, which allowed it to participate in various European Union research and education programs. In particular, three prestigious Erasmus Mundus programs in Environmental Sciences, Policy and Management (2005), Public Policy (2006) and Gender Studies (2007) were launched at CEU.

Following his retirement in 2009, Elkana was granted the title of President and Rector Emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CEU|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on the Holocaust, Jewish Memory and Israel===
[[File:Yehuda Elkana portrait, Berliner Dom, 05.05.jpg|thumb|Yehuda Elkana, Berlin 2011]]In 1988, in an article published in [[Haaretz]], Elkana challenged what the role of memories of the Holocaust, which  he called 'the central axis of our national experience,' in Israeli identity. He criticized the custom of repeatedly taking schoolchildren to [[Yad Vashem]]. For Elkana, Holocausts can happen to any people, and the message is universal. When "anomalous incidents" are reported, referring to things done to Palestinians, the initial reactions of his acquaintances, he claimed, were to deny such things happened, or to dismiss them as symptomatic of a reciprocal hatred between Israelis and Palestinians. Elkana's own view is that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;there is no "anomalous incident" that I have not seen with my own eyes. I mean this literally: I was an eye-witness to incident after incident; I saw a bulldozer bury people alive, I saw a rioting mob tear away the life-support system from old people in the hospital, I saw soldiers breaking the arms of a civilian population, including children. For me all this is not new. At the same time I do not generalize: I do not think that they all hate us; I do not think that all Jews hate the Arabs; I do not hate those responsible for the "anomalies" - but that does not mean that I condone their acts or that I do not expect them to be punished with the full severity of the law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He confessed that his personal conviction was that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the deepest political and social factor that motivates much of Israeli society in its relations with the Palestinians is not personal frustration, but rather a profound existential "Angst" fed by a particular interpretation of the lessons of the Holocaust and the readiness to believe that the whole world is against us, and that we are the eternal victim,&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and in this sense had come to the conclusion that this was 'the tragic and paradoxical victory of Hitler.' For Elkana,'any philosophy of life nurtured solely or mostly by the Holocaust leads to disastrous consequences,' and [[Thomas Jefferson]] was correct in his view that democracy and worship of the past were incompatible. While it may be the duty of the world to remember the Holocaust, he argued, 'we' must learn to forget, for the penetration of such memories deep within Israeli national consciousness, in his view, was the greatest threat to the state of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Elkana, [http://www.einsteinforum.de/fileadmin/einsteinforum/downloads/victims_elkana.pdf 'The Need to Forget,'] in [[Ha'aretz]], 2 March 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delivering the opening address, 'Einstein's Legacy', for Germany's Einstein Year (2005) celebrating the centenary of Einstein's [[annus mirabilis]], Yehuda remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I love Israel and feel a deep loyalty towards it, and hope for its continued existence, and at the same time I warn against strong nationalist tendencies which may endanger the democratic character of the state (I never accepted that there can be such a thing as a genuinely democratic Jewish state, nor can any other religion-based state be fully democratic) ... when I publicly called for 'The need to forget', against the political manipulation of the Holocaust in Israel (by right-wing and left-wing governments equally), and at the same time I oppose tendencies by some in Germany who wish to 'close the chapter' of the Holocaust, I do not think that I am being inconsistent ... Israel should leave to the individual the memory he or she wishes to keep up or even to cultivate, while Germany must continuously, publicly, remember that this chapter can and should not be closed.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Elkana,[http://web.ceu.hu/yehuda_einstein_legacy.pdf Einstein's legacy- Einsteins Erbe], p.16 19 January 2005, at the Deutsches Historisches Museum, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
