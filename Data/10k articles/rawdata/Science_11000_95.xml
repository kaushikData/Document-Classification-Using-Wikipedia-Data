The '''A563''' is the designation for the [[ring road]] of [[Leicester]], [[England]]. It forms a near complete circuit except for a gap of around {{convert|2.2|mi}} in the east of the city. An indirect route linking the gap involves the ([[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]]) [[A6030 road|A6030]], and [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]]. The A563 was formerly referred to as the Outer Ring.

If the outstanding section were completed, the road would have a circumference of about {{convert|19|mi}} and an average distance from Town Hall Square of around {{convert|3|mi}}.

==Route (described in a clockwise direction)==

Starting in the SE at the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] in [[Oadby]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.6058|-1.0937|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A563 road (A6 junction)}}),}} the road goes west, between [[Knighton, Leicestershire|Knighton]] and [[Wigston]] (crossing the [[A5199 road|A5199]] Welford Road), then to the south of [[Aylestone]] (crossing the [[A426 road|A426]]), passing [[Fosse Shopping Park]] that lies to the north it crosses the [[Fosse Way|B4114]] ([[Fosse Way]]) then in close proximity it passes over and intersects with the [[A5460 road (Great Britain)|A5460]] giving access to the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M69 motorway|M69]] motorways. It then turns north, parallel to the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and crosses the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] and then the [[A50 road (Great Britain)|A50]]. As the road bears eastwards at [[Beaumont Leys]] there is the [[A5630 road (Great Britain)|A5630]] junction providing a link to the [[A46 road (Great Britain)|A46]] [[Leicester Western Bypass]].

Directly north of the city the A563 arrives at Red Hill Circle, near to the [[River Soar]], and crosses the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] again. It then passes east. After crossing the [[A607 road|A607]] it transects with the northern terminus of the [[A6030 road|A6030]] (which serves as a ''bis'' alternate route for traffic progressing directly towards [[Oadby]]/[[Stoneygate]]). Continuing, the A563 turns south and finishes at the [[A47 road|A47]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.6377|-1.0732|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A563 road (A47 junction)}})}}, towards the city's eastern boundary at Goodwood/Rowlatts Hill north of [[Evington]] Village.

Here the A563 Ring Road ends given that the section directly linking the [[A47 road|A47]] at Goodwood to the A6 in Oadby was not constructed. Traffic can continue straight on at the A47 junction down the Goodwood Road (or go via the A47 and Spencefield Lane) and then continue by a variety of routes to the A6 (by Evington to Stoughton Drive and then Stoughton Road, meeting the A6 considerably further in than Oadby), or can turn at [[Evington]] village onto the back road Shady Lane, and then proceed by Stoughton Road into Oadby, meeting the A6 further out.

==Developments==
Recently{{when|date=May 2017}} a short section of road linking the A563 in [[Hamilton, Leicestershire|Hamilton]] and the [[A6030 road|A6030]] in [[Northfields, Leicester|Northfields]] was completed between the junction with Victoria Road East and Gipsy Lane to the south, and Thurmaston Lane to the north, to assist traffic to the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] and [[Oadby]]. Building this section meant having to cut through part of the Humberstone Heights Golf Course.

Although the ring road has been planned for decades, there are currently no firm plans to complete the eastern part, known as the '''Eastern District Distributor Road'''. The original designated route included Goodwood Road, but Leicester City Council allowed housing to be built on land earmarked for an expansion to a dual carriageway. Tentative plans to route traffic along Spencefield Lane were strongly opposed by residents, leaving it unclear where exactly the Distributor Road would be built. The A47 is not dual carriageway and is already congested at peak hours, so extending the A563 eastwards as far as open countryside seems problematic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2668">The '''Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze''' ("National Academy of the Sciences"), or more formally '''L’Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze detta dei XL''', and also called the '''Accademia dei XL''' ("Academy of the Forty"), is [[Italy]]'s [[national academy]] of science. Its offices are located within the Villino Rosso, at the corner of via L. Spallanzani and via Siracusa, [[Villa Torlonia (Rome)|Villa Torlonia]], [[Rome]].

The academy promotes progress in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[Natural science|natural sciences]]; organizes meetings; publishes journals; establishes consultative committees for governmental agencies; and awards scientific prizes.

The academy contains 40 fellows and a variable number of "fellows in excess" who are age 70 and above, and who have been fellows for at least five years. It also contains 25 foreign members.

==History==
The academy was founded in 1782 in [[Verona]] as the '''Società Italiana''', comprising 40 scientists from various parts of Italy. The idea of forming an academy comprising the leading Italian scientists was put forward in 1766 by the mathematician [[Antonio Maria Lorgna]]. By 1781 he had received the support of [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], [[Ruggero Giuseppe Boscovich]] and others. In the following year the academy was created as the ''Società Italiana'', with forty members representing the most important Italian scientists of the period.

'''Alexey Fyodorovich Tryoshnikov''' ({{lang-ru|Алексе&amp;#769;й Фёдорович Трёшников}}) (14 April 1914 in the village of Pavlovka, now in [[Baryshsky District]], [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]]&amp;nbsp;– 18 November 1991 at [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[polar explorer]] and leader of the [[2nd Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] and the [[13th Soviet Antarctic Expedition]].

He was involved in defending the [[Northern Sea Route]] during [[World War II]] and participated in the [[1948 Soviet expedition to the North Pole]]. Between 1954 and 1955, he was the leader of the [[North Pole-3]] [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations|ice station]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]].

He was also the president of the [[Russian Geographical Society|Geographical Society of the USSR]] since 1977 and the director of the [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]] (AARI) of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1960 to 1981. In 1982 he was elected Academician of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">The '''American Bryological and Lichenological Society''' is an organization devoted to the scientific study of all aspects of the [[biology]] of [[bryophytes]] and [[lichen]]-forming [[fungi]] and is one of the nation's oldest botanical organizations. It was originally known as the '''Sullivant Moss Society''', named after [[William Starling Sullivant]]. The Society publishes a quarterly journal distributed worldwide, ''[[The Bryologist]]'', which includes articles on all aspects of the biology of [[mosses]], [[hornworts]], [[liverworts]] and lichens.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1898, and was first known as the Sullivant Moss Chapter. It was founded by [[Elizabeth Gertrude Britton]] and [[Abel Joel Grout]].  [[Carolyn Wilson Harris]] was vice president of the Society during 1904–1905 and charge of the Lichen Department from 1901–1905.

[[Annie Morrill Smith]] was a central figure in the organization in the early years, contributing much time, energy, and money. She was editor or associate editor of ''[[The Bryologist]]'' for ten years, and changed the name to the Sullivant Moss ''Society''.

'''Aseptic processing''' is a processing technique wherein commercially thermally [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] liquid products (typically [[food]] or [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]]) are packaged into previously sterilized containers under sterile conditions to produce shelf-stable products that do not need refrigeration.&lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960758611|title=Food processing technology : principles and practice|last=Fellows|first=Peter|date=2016|publisher=Woodhead Publishing/Elsevier Science|year=2016|isbn=9780081005231|edition=4th|location=Kent|pages=|oclc=960758611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aseptic processing has almost completely replaced in-container sterilization of liquid foods, including [[milk]], fruit [[Juice|juices]] and concentrates, [[cream]], [[yogurt]], [[salad dressing]], [[liquid egg]], and ice cream mix. There has been an increasing popularity for foods that contain small discrete particles, such as [[cottage cheese]], [[Baby food|baby foods]], [[tomato]] products, [[fruit]] and [[Vegetable|vegetables]], [[Soup|soups]], and rice desserts.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

Aseptic processing involves three primary steps: [[Sterilization (microbiology)|thermal sterilization]] of the product, sterilization of the [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] material, and conservation of sterility during packaging.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767579357|title=Handbook of food safety engineering|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Sun, Da-Wen.|isbn=1444333348|location=Oxford|oclc=767579357}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure commercial sterility, aseptic processing facilities are required to maintain proper documentation of production operations, showing that commercially sterile conditions were achieved and maintained in all areas of the facility.&lt;ref name=":74"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/InspectionGuides/ucm074946.htm|title=Aseptic Processing and Packaging for the Food Industry|last1=FDA|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any breach of a scheduled process for the processing or packaging system means that the affected product must be destroyed, reprocessed or segregated and held for further evaluation.&lt;ref name=":74" /&gt; In addition, the processing and packaging system must be cleaned and re-sterilized before processing and/or packaging operations can resume. Packaging equipment and packaging materials are sterilized with various medium or combination of mediums (i.e., saturated [[steam]], superheated steam, [[hydrogen peroxide]] and heat and other treatments).&lt;ref name=":74" /&gt;

== Historical development in foods ==
Aseptic processing was derived from [[C. Olin Ball|Olin Ball]]'s heat-cool-fill (HCF) machine that was developed in 1927.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897799891|title=Electron beam pasteurization and complementary food processing technologies|last=Pillai|first=Suresh|last2=Shayanfa|first2=Shima|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|others=|year=2014|isbn=9781782421085|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=897799891}}&lt;/ref&gt; While HCF was successful in improving the sensory quality of the processed [[chocolate milk]] as compared to [[Canning|canned]] product, the use of the equipment was hindered by its cost, maintenance, and inflexibility to process various container sizes, rendering the machine a failure.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647803601|title=Advances in food research Vol. 32|date=1988|publisher=Academic Press|others=Chichester, C. O., 1925-, Schweigert, B. S.|isbn=9780080567778|location=San Diego|oclc=647803601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, the Avoset process was developed  by George Grindrod. Food products processed using the Avoset process were packaged under [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet lamps]] and sterilized air inside a positive-pressurized room to keep the [[contaminants]] out of the processing room. sterilization was achieved through the use of direct steam injection of {{convert|126|-|137|C|abbr=on|-1}} and then cooled. The food treated using this technique was described as an "excellent cream product" and 75-100 containers were produced each minute.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

Later in the 1940s, the Dole Aseptic Process was developed by McKinley Martin.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The foods processed ranged from soups to specialty sauces, fruits, and dairy products.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; This process involved four steps:&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

#Sterilization of product by heating and immediate cooling
#Sterilization of containers and lids using steam
#Filling of cooled products aseptically into previously sterilized containers
#Sealing of lids at an atmosphere of saturated or super heated steam

The Dole aseptic machine overcame the hindrances that caused HCF's failure, since it was able to process various container sizes, needed less maintenance time, and cost less. The quality of products processed was consistent regardless of its container size, an important characteristic for heat sensitive foods, due to its short processing time. [[Pea soup|Split pea soup]] was treated using the Dole aseptic machine at the following dosage: heat time of {{convert|140|-|146|C|abbr=on|-1}} for 3.53 seconds, hold time of 8.8 seconds, and cooling to {{convert|32|C|abbr=on|-1}} in 14.0 - 17.0 seconds, compared to the normal processing time of 40-70 minutes at {{convert|115|-|121|C|abbr=on|-1}}. The lack of consumer interest drove foods that were processed in the Dole aseptic machine to be discontinued.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;[[File:Erik_Wallenberg_inventor_of_Tetra_Pak_first_package.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Erik_Wallenberg_inventor_of_Tetra_Pak_first_package.jpg|thumb|'''Erik Wallenberg inventor of Tetra Pak first package'''.]]Roy Graves began sterilizing milk in the 1940s. The milk that was drawn from the cow went through a pipeline, into a vacuum tank, which was then heated to 285°F, then cooled to room temperature. The product, packaged in metal cans, was widely accepted by consumers without access to fresh milk, including the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811776682|title=Handbook of aseptic processing and packaging|last=D.|first=David, Jairus R.|date=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|others=Graves, Ralph H., Szemplenski, Thomas.|isbn=9781138199071|location=Boca Raton|oclc=811776682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the [[food industry]] saw the advent of the use of paper-foil-plastic laminated containers called tetrahedron. In 1962, a Swedish company, [[Tetra Pak]], introduced this container to the United States market. They sold pasteurized milk and beverages in the containers. Roy Graves' company started sterilizing this container with [[chlorine]] and were able to aseptically fill and [[Hermetic seal|hermetically seal]] the container. The use of these containers was not accepted by the American consumers due to their difficulty in opening however, it was widely used by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In 1981, [[hydrogen peroxide]] was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to be used to sterilize containers.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Today, ships used for continental food transport are equipped with aseptic tanks to transport fruit juices. Another means of transporting aseptically processed food is the use of aseptic bags.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

==Processing==
Aseptic processing allows for the food to be properly sterilized outside the container and then placed into a previously sterilized container, which is then sealed in a sterile environment.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; Most systems use [[Ultra-high-temperature processing|ultra-high temperature]] (UHT) sterilization to sterilize the food product before it is packaged. UHT sterilizes food at high temperatures usually above 135 C for 1-2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-07|title=Ultra-high-temperature processing|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ultra-high-temperature_processing&amp;oldid=840089595|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is advantageous because it allows for faster processing, usually a few seconds at high temperatures (130-150ºC) and better retention of sensory and nutritional characteristics.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;  Aseptic products have a non-refrigerated shelf-life of a few months to several years.

Sterilization of aseptic packaging material is a crucial step in aseptic food processing. These containers are sterilized to kill microorganisms present on the container during forming and transport and prior to filling.&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ansari|first=I.A.|last2=Datta|first2=A.K.|title=An Overview of Sterilization Methods for Packaging Materials Used in Aseptic Packaging Systems|url=https://doi.org/10.1205/096030803765208670|journal=Food and Bioproducts Processing|volume=81|issue=1|pages=57–65|doi=10.1205/096030803765208670}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous methods used to sterile the containers, the most commonly used methods include: heat, hot water, chemical sterilants ([[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[peracetic acid]]), and [[radiation]] or a combination of methods.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":83" /&gt;

Aseptically processed food products can be sterilized using either direct or indirect methods of heat transfer. [[Heat transfer|Direct heat transfer]] can be achieved through [[Steam injection (oil industry)|steam injection]] and [[steam infusion]]. Food products processed with a steam [[injector]] go through an injection chamber, where steam (150ºC) is injected into the product, then the product is flash cooled to 70°C. Direct heat transfer is suitable for heat-sensitive foods such as milk. However, only low viscosity liquids can be processed using steam injection, and high-quality steam is required to ensure sterilization.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; Steam infused food products involves food free-falling into highly pressurized steam which heats the food to approximately 145ºC and then its flash cooled to 65-70ºC. [[Steam infusion]] provides processors with great control compared to steam injection and reduction of burn-on and overheating risks are reduced. It can process higher viscosity foods compared to steam injection, but risks the blockage of nozzles in machinery.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; Indirect forms of heat transfer include: plate [[Heat exchanger|heat exchangers]], tubular heat exchangers, or scraped-surface heat exchangers.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; [[Plate heat exchanger|Plate heat exchangers]] are mostly used because they are inexpensive and allow for easy changes during production.Tubular and scraped-surface can heat viscous food with particulates or high pulp content with minimal damage.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;
===Equipment and systems===
Equipment used in aseptic processing of food and beverages must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] before processing and remain sterile during processing.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; When designing aseptic processing equipment there are six basic requirements to consider: the equipment must have the capability of being cleaned thoroughly, it must be able to be sterilized with steam, chemicals, or high-temperature water, sterilization media should be able to contact all surfaces of the equipment, meaning the equipment does not contain any cracks, crevices or dead spots, the equipment must be able to be kept in a sterile state, it must have the ability to be used continuously, and lastly, the equipment must comply with regulations.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Aseptic packaging are generally placed in the following categories:&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hersom|first=A.C.|date=2009|title=Aseptic processing and packaging of food|url=|journal=Food Reviews International|volume=1:2|pages=215-270|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; fill, erect, form, [[Thermoforming|thermoform]], [[Blow molding|blow mold]], and bulk packaging and storage systems.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

#''Fill and seal.'' The containers are filled and sealed in a sterile environment to avoid contamination.
#''[http://www.atlantapackaging.co.uk/case-erection-filling-closing Erect, fill and seal].'' A plastic container is erected then sterilized, filled and sealed.
#''Form, fill and seal.'' In this system, a roll of film is first sterilized. After sterilization it is formed into the desired shape, filled and sealed.
#''Thermoform, fill and seal.'' A roll of film is heated and thermoform on a sterile surface or environment. It is then filled and seal, also in a sterile environment.
#''Blow mold, fill and seal.'' The process requires an extrudable material to be first blow-molded into a sterile package before filling and sealing. This process is usually used to produce bottle products like [[Juice|juices]] and sodas.
#''Bulk packaging and storage systems.'' Packaging used for bulk storage (drums, totes, bags, etc) are sterilized using either heat or [[Disinfectant|disinfectants]]. After sterilization they are able to be filled and sealed.

==Packaging material==
Aseptic packaging consists of filling and sealing a sterilized packaging material with a sterilized product. Aseptic packaging material not only has to assure sterile conditions within the package and protect the product from physical damage, but also maintain the quality of the product inside the packaging.&lt;ref name=":83" /&gt; To achieve this, a laminate material is formed from the following components: semi-rigid paper, [[Aluminium|aluminum]], and plastic.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Paper (70%) provides the stiffness, strength, and the efficient brick shape to the package. [[Low-density polyethylene]] (24%), the most common plastic used for aseptic packaging, located on the innermost layer forms the seals that make the package liquid-tight. [[Aluminum]] (6%) is located on the inside of the aseptic package, forming a barrier against light and oxygen, thereby eliminating the need for refrigeration and preventing spoilage without using preservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aseptic Processing and Packaging of Particulate Foods|last1=Willhoft|first1=Edward|date=1993|publisher=Blackie Academic &amp; Professional|edition=1st|location=London|pages=1-192|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most packaging material used in aseptic packaging is made from [[Plastic|plastics]] instead of [[metal]] or [[Container glass|glass containers]] due to the relatively low cost of producing plastic material when compared to metal and glass. Plastics are lighter than metal or glass making them cheaper and easier to transport. Plastics also required much less energy to produce than metal and glass.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; These factors have made plastic the packaging material of choice for use in aseptic processing.[[File:Tetra_Pak_packaging_portfolio_I_medium_size.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tetra_Pak_packaging_portfolio_I_medium_size.jpg|thumb|Aseptic packaging material made by Tetra Pak]]
===Selection of aseptic containers===
There are a lot of factors that can influence the type of aseptic container chosen for a product. The following factors may influence the choice of packaging material for aseptically processed products: functional properties of the plastic polymer (gas and water vapor barrier properties, chemical [[Chemically inert|inert]]ness, and flavor and odor absorption or [[scalping]]), potential interactions between plastic polymer and food product, desired shelf life, economical costs, mechanical characteristics of the packaging material (molding properties, material handling characteristics, and compatibility with packaging and sterilization methods), shipping and handling conditions (toughness, compression), compliance with regulation, and targeted consumer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food Processing: Principles and Applications|last1=Smith|first1=J. Scott|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|edition=1st|location=Iowa, USA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a range of different types of containers to choose from depending on the product. The table below offers a few container types and examples.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

==Effects on food quality==
Aseptic processing preserves [[food quality]] through fast heat treatment followed by a short holding time and rapid cooling.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;  Compared to [[canning]] where food products are subjected to high temperature processing, the fast heat treatment provided by aseptic processing enables heat-sensitive characteristics of the food to be better retained.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;
===Flavor===
The flavor of aseptically processed food products is minimally changed.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;  Dairy products could have a cooked flavor because of exposure to [[sulfhydryl]] groups. The flavor is reduced during storage as the sulfhydryl groups [[oxidize]]. Severely treated milk could have a [[Taste|bitter flavor]] because of [[Proteolysis|proteolysis.]]&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;
===Color===
Dairy products could have changes in color, an effect caused by [[Maillard reaction|Maillard browning]]. This depends on the amount of reducing sugar, the formation of pyralysins and [[Melanoidin|melanoidins]], the severity of the treatment, and the storage temperature&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;.

Plant pigments, [[carotene]] and [[betanin]], are not affected, while [[chlorophyll]] and [[Anthocyanin|anthocyanins]] are minimally reduced.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;
===Texture===
Meat is less likely to toughen when aseptically processed, compared to [[Canning (food preservation method)|canned]] products.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

Fruit juice [[viscosity]] is unaffected. Processed sliced fruit and vegetable pieces are softer compared to unprocessed pieces as a result of the solubilization of pectic materials and loss of cell turgor.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;
===Nutritional value===
Aseptic Processing achieves sterility through a flash-heating process with temperatures ranging from 91°C to 146°C and is minimally processed. Due to the significantly lower processing time and temperature range used in aseptic processing compared to conventional sterilization, such as canning, products that are aseptically processed are able to retain more nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nutrition: Science and Applications|last1=Smolin|first1=Lori|date=2017|publisher=Content Technologies, Inc.|edition=2nd|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Riboflavin]], [[pantothenic acid]], [[biotin]], [[niacin]], and [[vitamin B6]] are unaffected. Approximately 10% of [[thiamine]] and [[vitamin B12]], approximately 15% of [[Folate|folic acid]] and [[pyridoxine]], and approximately 25% of [[vitamin C]] are lost during aseptic processing.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

==Advantages and limitations==
===Advantages===
Foods that are processed aseptically have better nutritional, vitamin, and natural pigment retention ([[chlorophyll]], [[Anthocyanin|anthocyanins]], [[Betalain|betalins]], [[Carotenoid|carotenoids]]) compared to [[Canning (food preservation method)|canned]] food products because of the lower temperature the foods are subjected to upon processing.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; Aseptic processing provides flexibility in using various container sizes as well as possibility of addition of bioactive and heat-sensitive components after processing ([[Probiotic|probiotics]], [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3 fatty acids]], conjugated [[Linoleic acid|linoleic acids]]).&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;
===Limitations===
Aseptic processing costs more than canning because sterilization of the packaging materials requires different machinery and can get complex.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; In addition, maintaining air sterility in the processing room is difficult.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

==FDA inspection and regulation for aseptic processing==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=September 2018}}
Inspections of aseptic processing is one of the most complex inspection of food manufacturing operations. Process authorities are required to establish a process that ensures commercial sterility for the following:

#The product
#All equipment including the hold tube and any equipment downstream from the holding tube such as the filler
#The packaging equipment
#The packaging material.

Documentation of production operations must be maintained by the facility, showing an achievement of commercial sterile conditions in all areas of the facility.&lt;ref name=":74" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general regulatory requirements for all [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulated foods are found in section 21 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations|U.S. Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) Part 110. Section 113.40 lists specific requirements for aseptic processing and packaging systems, including specifications for equipment and instrumentation. One requirement of the FDA regulations is that all thermal processing operations must be conducted under the operating supervision of an individual who has completed an FDA-approved course of instruction on control of thermal processing systems, container closures, and acidification procedures. The [https://www.gmaonline.org/resources/science-education-foundation/better-process-control-schools/ Better Process Control School] provides a section on aseptic processing and packaging systems, and will meet the FDA requirement for supervisors of aseptic operations.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m97VRCEDfEUC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=how+does+fda+regulate+aseptic+processing+food&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OhsCxUnYAB&amp;sig=xDB3q_Lnhqahl5nAVF3bDCI9upE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRkNCJrsXaAhVG9mMKHXP1DlYQ6AEIiQEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20does%20fda%20regulate%20aseptic%20processing%20food&amp;f=false|title=Principles of Aseptic Processing and Packaging|last1=Nelson|first1=Philip|date=1993|publisher=GMA Science and Education Foundation|edition=3|location=USA|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Processing authorities are responsible for aseptic systems must  be aware of certain factors unique to aseptic processing and packaging operations, therefore specific knowledge in this area is essential. Neither the FDA nor other regulatory agency maintains a list of recognized processing authorities, however, certain organizations are widely recognized within government agencies and the industry as having the experience and expertise. The FDA regulations rely upon aseptic processing and packaging authorities to establish parameters for sterilization of product, packages, and equipment so that commercial sterility of the end product is assured.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

The forms presently used to file aseptic processes for low-acid foods with the FDA is Form 2541c. Processes for acidified foods that are aseptically processes and packaged are filed under 2541a. Additionally, processing plants must be registered with the FDA using Form 2541. The FDA has also developed a Low-acid Canned Food (LACF) Electronic Process Filling System that facilitates the completion and submission of the forms.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA does exert authority over the types of aseptic processing and packaging systems that can be utilized to produce foods for distribution in U.S. commerce by reviewing and either accepting or rejecting process filing forms from individual processing firms. The FDA may request sufficient technical information from the processor to evaluate adequacy of the equipment and the procedures used to produce a commercially sterile product. Until the FDA finds no further objections to a process filing, the company is prevented from distributing product produced on that system in interstate commerce.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Final aseptic products must undergo an incubation test before the product is released into distribution. The firm must determine the time and temperature of incubation as well as how many containers are incubated.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; It is generally accepted to incubate at 20-25°C for a minimum of 7 days followed immediately, or after a first reading, by incubation at 30-35°C for a total minimum incubation time of 14 days. Other incubation schedules should be based on supporting validation data. It is important to note that prior to incubation, the containers with the microbial growth medium must be inverted to ensure all surfaces are throughly wetted by the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.picscheme.org/|title=Recommendation on the Validation of Aseptic Processes|last1=Hargreaves|first1=Paul|website=Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-Operation Scheme|publisher=PIC/S|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA relies on periodic inspections of processing plants to monitor compliance with its regulatory requirements. Inspection frequency for an individual plant may vary significantly depending upon products packed, occurrence of potential hazardous processing problems at the plant, and availability of FDA inspection personnel.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An '''astronomical constant''' is a [[physical constant]] used in [[astronomy]]. Formal sets of constants, along with recommended values, have been defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) several times: in 1964&lt;ref name="IAU1964"&gt;Resolution No.4 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1964_French.pdf XIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Hamburg, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1976&lt;ref name="IAU76"&gt;Resolution No. 1 on the recommendations of Commission 4 on ephemerides in the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; (with an update in 1994&lt;ref name="IAU94"&gt;{{citation | author = Standish, E. M. | contribution = Report of the IAU WGAS Sub-group on Numerical Standards | url = http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/iausgnsrpt.pdf | title = Highlights of Astronomy | editor = Appenzeller, I. | location = Dordrecht | publisher = [[Kluwer]] | date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2009 the IAU adopted a new current set, and recognizing that new observations and techniques continuously provide better values for these constants, they decided&lt;ref name="IAU2009"&gt;Resolution B2 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2009_English.pdf XXVIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Rio de Janeiro, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; to not fix these values, but have the Working Group on Numerical Standards continuously maintain a set of Current Best Estimates.&lt;ref name="IAUWG"&gt;IAU Division I Working Group on Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy and Astronomical Constants: Current Best Estimates (CBEs) [http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826200953/http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html |date=2016-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of constants is widely reproduced in publications such as the ''[[Astronomical Almanac]]'' of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]].

Besides the IAU list of units and constants, also the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] defines constants relevant to the orientation and rotation of the Earth, in its technical notes.&lt;ref name=IERS2010&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 1.1: IERS numerical standards |work=IERS technical note no. 36: General definitions and numerical standards |editor=Gérard Petit |editor2=Brian Luzum |url=ftp://tai.bipm.org/iers/conv2010/chapter1/tn36_c1.pdf |publisher=[[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] |date=2010}} For complete document see {{cite book |title=IERS Conventions (2010): IERS technical note no. 36 |editor=Gérard Petit |editor2=Brian Luzum |isbn=978-3-89888-989-6 |url=http://www.iers.org/nn_11216/IERS/EN/Publications/TechnicalNotes/tn36.html |publisher=International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAU system of constants defines a system of astronomical units for length, mass and time (in fact, several such systems), and also includes constants such as the [[speed of light]] and the [[constant of gravitation]] which allow transformations between astronomical units and [[SI unit]]s. Slightly different values for the constants are obtained depending on the [[frame of reference]] used. Values quoted in [[barycentric dynamical time]] (TDB) or equivalent time scales such as the [[Ephemeris Time|''T''&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]] represent the mean values that would be measured by an observer on the Earth's surface (strictly, on the surface of the [[geoid]]) over a long period of time. The IAU also recommends values in SI units, which are the values which would be measured (in [[proper length]] and [[proper time]]) by an observer at the [[barycentre]] of the Solar System: these are obtained by the following transformations:&lt;ref name="IAU94" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_A({\rm SI}) = (1+L_{\rm B})^{\frac{1}{3}} \tau_A({\rm TDB})\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;GE({\rm SI}) = (1+L_{\rm B}) GE({\rm TDB})\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;GS({\rm SI}) = (1+L_{\rm B}) GS({\rm TDB})\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Astronomical system of units ==
{{main article|Astronomical system of units}}
The astronomical unit of time is a time interval of one day (''D'') of 86400 seconds. The astronomical unit of mass is the mass of the Sun (''S''). The astronomical unit of length is that length (''A'') for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{nowrap|0.017&amp;thinsp;202&amp;thinsp;098&amp;thinsp;95}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time.&lt;ref name="IAU76" /&gt;

;Notes
&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; The theories of [[precession]] and [[nutation]] have advanced since 1976, and these also affect the definition of the [[ecliptic]]. The values here are appropriate for the older theories, but additional constants are required for current models.

† The definitions of these derived constants have been taken from the references cited, but the values have been recalculated to take account of the more precise values of the primary constants cited in the table.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1304">The '''Captive bubble method''' is a method for measuring [[contact angle]] between a liquid and a solid, by using drop shape analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramehart.com/glossary.htm#captive_bubble ramé-hart instrument co.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, a [[:wikt:bubble|bubble]] of [[air]] is injected beneath a solid, the surface of which is located in the [[liquid]], instead of placing a [[drop (liquid)|drop]] on the [[solid]] as in the case of the [[sessile drop technique]].

The method is particularly suitable for solids with high [[surface free energy]] on which liquids spread out. [[Hydrogel]]s, such as soft [[contact lens]]es for example, are likewise inaccessible for the standard arrangement; the captive bubble method is also used in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.biolinscientific.com/zafepress.php?url=%2Fpdf%2FAttension%2FApplication%20Notes%2FAT_AN_8_captive-bubble.pdf# |title=Captive bubble method in Contact lens |access-date=2015-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207172534/http://www.biolinscientific.com/zafepress.php?url=%2Fpdf%2FAttension%2FApplication%20Notes%2FAT_AN_8_captive-bubble.pdf# |archive-date=2015-02-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Case Notes''''' is a weekly half-hour radio programme on topics in medicine. It is broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]]. A different illness is covered from a variety of perspectives in each programme. Dr [[Mark Porter (general practitioner)|Mark Porter]] is the current presenter.

==History==
It looks at medicine in general and recent medical advances. The programme takes its name from case notes, another name for [[medical record]]s, the formal documentation written by medics and paramedics.

==Transmission==
Case Notes is broadcast on Tuesdays from 21.30 to 22.00. It is repeated on Wednesdays from 16.30 to 17.00. There is a [[podcast]] and a programme audio and transcript archive dating back to January 2004.

==Presenters==
Dr [[Mark Porter (general practitioner)|Mark Porter]] is the current presenter, who took over from Dr [[Graham Easton]], who left the programme to write for the [[BMJ]]; however, he presents the show when Mark Porter is unavailable.

A '''contact force''' is any [[force]] that requires contact to occur.&lt;ref name = "PGC"&gt;{{cite book

Pushing a car up a hill or kicking a ball or pushing a desk across a room are some of the everyday examples where contact forces are at work. In the first case the force is continuously applied by the person on the car, while in the second case the force is delivered in a short [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]]. Contact forces are often decomposed into [[orthogonal]] components, one perpendicular to the surface(s) in contact called the [[normal force]], and one parallel to the surface(s) in contact, called the [[friction]] force.&lt;ref name = "PGC"/&gt;

In the [[Standard Model]] of modern physics, the four [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]] are known to be [[non-contact forces]]. The [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction]] primarily deal with forces within atoms, while [[gravitational]] effects are only obvious on an ultra-[[macroscopic scale]]. Molecular and quantum physics show that the [[electromagnetic force]] is the fundamental interaction responsible for contact forces. The interaction between macroscopic objects can be roughly described as resulting from the electromagnetic interactions between [[protons]] and [[electrons]] of the atomic constituents of these objects. Everyday objects do not ''actually'' touch; rather, contact forces are the result of the interactions of the [[electron]]s at or near the surfaces of the objects.&lt;ref name = "PGC"/&gt;

It runs between the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] and the two launch pads at [[Launch Complex 39]]. It has a length of {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} to [[Launch Complex 39#Launch Pad 39A|Pad 39A]] and {{convert|4.2|mi|km}} to [[Launch Complex 39#Launch Pad 39B|Pad 39B]]. A seven-foot (2 m) bed of stones lies beneath a layer of [[asphalt]] and a surface made of Tennessee river [[rock (geology)|rock]]s.

The Crawlerway was designed to support the weight of a [[Saturn V]] rocket and payload, plus its Launch Umbilical Tower and [[Mobile Launcher Platform]], atop a [[Crawler-transporter]] during the [[Project Apollo|Apollo Program]]. It was used from 1981&amp;ndash;2011 to transport the lighter [[Space Shuttle]]s to their launch pads.

Construction of the Crawlerway connected [[Merritt Island]] with the mainland, forming a peninsula. The main vehicle access road to and from the launch pads, the Saturn Causeway, runs alongside the crawlerway.

==Construction==
The crawlerway is composed of two {{convert|40|ft|m}} wide lanes, separated by a {{convert|50|ft|m}} median. The top layer is Tennessee river gravel, 4&amp;nbsp;inches thick on the straight sections and 8&amp;nbsp;inches thick on curves. Tennessee river rock was chosen for its anti-spark properties. Beneath that is 4&amp;nbsp;feet of graded, crushed stone, resting on two layers of fill.&lt;ref name=pao.ksc.nasa.gov /&gt; As of 2013 a project to repair and upgrade the crawlerway is in process, the first time since it was constructed that the foundation will be repaired. Additional rock was added to the surface in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upgrades Will Prepare Crawlerway for Space Launch System|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/ground/crawlerway_upgrades.html|accessdate=13 December 2013|date=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">'''Cyclotron resonance''' describes the interaction of external forces with charged particles experiencing a [[magnetic field]], thus already moving on a circular path. It is named after the [[cyclotron]], a cyclic [[particle accelerator]] that utilizes an oscillating electric field tuned to this resonance to add kinetic energy to charged particles.

==Cyclotron frequency==
The '''cyclotron frequency''' or '''gyrofrequency''' is the frequency of a [[charged particle]] moving perpendicular to the direction of a uniform magnetic field ''B'' (constant magnitude and direction). Since that motion is always circular,&lt;ref name="Physics"&gt;Physics by M. Alonso &amp; E. Finn, Addison Wesley 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; the cyclotron frequency is given by equality of [[centripetal force]] and magnetic [[Lorentz force]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{mv^2}{r} = qBv&lt;/math&gt;

with the particle mass ''m'', its charge ''q'', velocity ''v'', and the circular path radius ''r'', also called [[gyroradius]].

The angular speed of the rotation is then:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{v}{r} = \frac{qB}{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

Giving the rotational frequency (being the cyclotron frequency) as:
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}&lt;/math&gt;,

It is notable that the cyclotron frequency is independent of the radius and velocity and therefore independent of the particle's kinetic energy; all particles with the same charge-to-mass ratio rotate around magnetic field lines with the same frequency.

The cyclotron frequency is also useful in non-uniform magnetic fields, in which (assuming slow variation of magnitude of the magnetic field) the movement is approximately helical - in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, the motion is uniform, whereas in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field the movement is, as previously circular. The sum of these two motions gives a trajectory in the shape of a [[helix]].

===Gaussian units===
The above is for [[SI units]]. In some cases, the cyclotron frequency is given in [[Gaussian units]].&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, Charles. Introduction to Solid State Physics, 8th edition. pp. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In Gaussian units, the Lorentz force differs by a factor of 1/c, the speed of light, which leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_c = \frac{v}{r} = \frac{qB}{mc}&lt;/math&gt;.

For materials with little or no magnetism (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mu \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;H \approx B&lt;/math&gt;, so we can use the easily measured H instead of B:&lt;ref&gt;Ashcroft and Mermin. Solid State Physics. pp12&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_c = \frac{qH}{mc}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that converting this expression to SI units introduces a factor of the [[vacuum permeability]].

===Effective mass===
{{See also|Effective mass (solid-state physics)#Cyclotron effective mass}}
For some materials, the motion of electrons follows loops that depend on the applied magnetic field, but not exactly the same way. For these materials, we define a cyclotron effective mass, &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; so that:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_c = \frac{qB}{m^*}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[finance]], the term '''debt compliance''' describes various [[law|legal]] measures taken to ensure that [[debtor]]s, whether individuals, [[business]]es, or [[government]]s, honor their [[debt]]s and make an honest effort to repay the money that they owe. Generally regarded as a subdivision of [[tax law]], debt compliance is most often enforced through a combination of [[audit]]s and legal restrictions. For example, a provision of the [[Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990]] states that a person or organization indebted to the United States, against whom a judgment [[lien]] has been filed, is ineligible to receive a government [[federal grant|grant]]. Noncompliance, depending on severity and frequency, may be punished by [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] or even [[prison|incarceration]].

[[File:Drexler-Smalley cover.jpg|thumb|The debate between [[K. Eric Drexler]] and [[Richard Smalley]] on the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s began in 2001 and concluded in a cover story in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in 2003.]]

The '''Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology''' was a public dispute between [[K. Eric Drexler]], the originator of the conceptual basis of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[Richard Smalley]], a recipient of the 1996 [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the [[nanomaterial]] [[buckminsterfullerene]]. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing [[molecular assembler]]s, which are [[molecular machine]]s which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.

The debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and [[open letter]]s. It began with a 2001 article by Smalley in ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was followed by a [[Counterargument|rebuttal]] published by Drexler and coworkers later that year, and two open letters by Drexler in early 2003. The debate was concluded in late 2003 in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in which both parties participated.

The debate has been often cited in the [[history of nanotechnology]] due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to go so far as to characterize the tone of the debate as similar to "a [[pissing contest|pissing match]]"&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "reminiscent of [a] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Yes, They Can!

==The participants==

===K. Eric Drexler===
[[File:Eric Drexler 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].]]

{{main|K. Eric Drexler}}

K. Eric Drexler is generally considered to have written the first scholarly paper on the topic of nanotechnology,&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelesko |first=John A. |title=Self-assembly: the science of things that put themselves together |year=2007 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58488-687-7 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work.&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toumey|first=Christopher|title=Reading Feynman into nanotechnology: a text for a new science|journal=Techné|date=Fall 2008|volume=12|issue=3|page=133–168|doi=10.5840/techne20081231|url=http://litsciarts.org/slsa08/slsa08-650.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in [[molecular biology]] such as [[recombinant DNA]] technology. In a 1981 publication in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the [[ribosome]] were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work ''Nanosystems'' in 1992. He also co-founded the [[Foresight Institute]], a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"&gt;Edwards, pp. 15–21, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler's vision of nanotechnology, now called [[molecular nanotechnology]], is based on the concept of the [[molecular assembler]], a [[molecular machine]] which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between [[wet nanotechnology]] based on biological systems, and "second-generation" dry nanotechnology which would be based on [[mechanosynthesis]], positional control of molecules through principles more related to [[mechanical engineering]]. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"/&gt;

===Richard Smalley===
[[File:Richard Smalley.jpg|thumb|250px|Richard Smalley won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with [[Harry Kroto]] and [[Robert Curl]] for their 1985 discovery of [[buckminsterfullerene]].]]

{{main|Richard Smalley}}

Richard E. Smalley, a chemist at [[Rice University]], was best known as a co-discoverer of the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[Allotropes of carbon|form of carbon]] known as [[buckminsterfullerene]] in 1985, along with [[Harry Kroto]], [[Robert Curl]], [[James R. Heath|James Heath]], and [[Sean O'Brien (scientist)|Sean O'Brien]]. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be discovered of the class of molecules known as [[fullerenes]], which also includes [[carbon nanotube]]s. The study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of the fields of [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanoelectronics]], and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 27, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley had also taken a prominent [[public policy]] role in relation to nanotechnology, and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to the world's energy and health problems, for example raising the possibility of [[Energy applications of nanotechnology|using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission]], and of developing [[Nanomedicine|nanomaterial-based drugs]] for [[targeted drug delivery]]. Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology [[Startup company|startups]]. Smalley died of [[leukemia]] in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 132, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berube"/&gt;

==The debate==

===Smalley's ''Scientific American'' article===
[[File:Drexler-Smalley SciAm cover.png|thumb|Smalley's 2001 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article doubting the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s led to a rebuttal by Drexler and his colleagues.]]

Smalley wrote an article, "Of Chemistry, Love, and Nanobots", for the September 2001 issue of the [[popular science]] magazine ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was a special issue on the topic of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley |pmid=11524973| volume=285| issue=3| pages=76–7| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms:

{{Quote|When a boy and a girl fall in love, it is often said that the chemistry between them is good. This common use of the word "chemistry" in human relations comes close to the subtlety of what actually happens in the more mundane coupling of molecules. In a chemical reaction between two 'consenting' molecules, bonds form between some of the atoms in what is usually a complex dance involving motion in multiple dimensions.... And if the chemistry is really, really good, the molecules that do react will all produce the exact product required.}}

He referenced the idea of a [[molecular assembler]], a [[nanorobot]] capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one [[Mole (chemistry)|mole]] of material, but [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a [[grey goo]] scenario, or, referring to [[Bill Joy]]'s previous article "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", that the nanorobots could develop [[swarm intelligence]] and become alive in some sense.

Smalley then considered how realistic the concept of a self-replicating nanorobot was. He noted that in a chemical reaction, the [[chemical bond]]s are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity. He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work, and would thus have to have many manipulator arms. This led him to raise two objections to the concept of molecular assembler, which he called the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem":

{{Quote|Because the fingers of a manipulator arm must themselves be made out of atoms, they have a certain irreducible size. There just isn't enough room in the nanometer-size reaction region to accommodate all the fingers of all the manipulators necessary to have complete control of the chemistry.... [Also,] the atoms of the manipulator hands will adhere to the atom that is being moved. So it will often be impossible to release this minuscule building block in precisely the right spot. Both these problems are fundamental, and neither can be avoided. Self-replicating, mechanical nanobots are simply not possible in our world.}}

Smalley closed the article by returning to the analogy of chemistry as a dance of love, remarking that "you don't make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together."

===Drexler's response===

An [[:File:Translation.gif|animated version]] is also available. Bottom, a schematic of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]], which Drexler cited as being able to manipulate individual molecules via [[Mechanosynthesis|positional control]].|alt1=Ribosome schematic|alt2=Scanning tunneling microscope schematic}}

Drexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through the [[Institute for Molecular Manufacturing]], which was co-authored with others including [[Robert Freitas]], [[J. Storrs Hall]], and [[Ralph Merkle]].&lt;ref name="drexlerresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=On Physics, Fundamentals, and Nanorobots: A Rebuttal to Smalley’s Assertion that Self-Replicating Mechanical Nanorobots Are Simply Not Possible |publisher=Institute for Molecular Manufacturing |year=2001 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |first1=K. Eric |last1=Drexler |first2=David |last2=Forrest |first3=Robert A. |last3=Freitas |first4=J. Storrs |last4=Hall |first5=Neil |last5=Jacobstein |first6=Tom |last6=McKendree |first7=Ralph |last7=Merkle |first8=Christine |last8=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors first discussed the "fat fingers" argument by attacking Smalley's notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one of which can be immobilized and the other attached to a single "finger". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the "sticky fingers" problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem.

The authors put forth the [[ribosome]] as an example of a natural molecular machine; because the ribosome suffers from neither problem, they must not be fundamental, saying:

{{Quote|This ubiquitous biological molecular assembler suffers from neither the “fat finger” nor the “sticky finger” problem. If, as Smalley argues, both problems are “fundamental,” then why would they prevent the development of mechanical assemblers and not biological assemblers? If the class of molecular structures known as proteins can be synthesized using positional techniques, then why would we expect there to be no other classes of molecular structures that can be synthesized using positional techniques?}}

The authors also questioned Smalley's figures for the replication time of nanomachines. Instead of Smalley's figure of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz for the atomic placement frequency, they point out that ''Nanosystems'' suggested a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, a thousand times slower, and that at Smalley's higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds. The authors called this a [[straw man]] argument, writing that "in a serious scientific discussion, a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal."  The authors closed by stating that the best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work, and that "there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome, but thus far, there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible."

Drexler followed up with two open letters to Smalley in April and July 2003. The April letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=An Open Letter on Assemblers|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; began, "I have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work."  Drexler accused Smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what Drexler now calls "Smalley fingers", which he stated to be unlike the enzyme-like systems he had actually proposed. He asserted:

{{Quote|The impossibility of "Smalley fingers" has raised no concern in the research community because these fingers solve no problems and thus appear in no proposals. Your reliance on this straw-man attack might lead a thoughtful observer to suspect that no one has identified a valid criticism of my work. For this I should, perhaps, thank you.}}

Drexler compared the nanotechnology debate's importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before [[Sputnik]] or to theoretical work on [[nuclear chemistry]] before the [[Manhattan Project]]. He disputed Smalley's arguments that the fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research, arguing that the potential for long-term risks made research even more important. His conclusion stated, "your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long-term security concerns."

The July 2003 letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=Toward closure|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter2.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=2 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced a note from Smalley promising to respond, which had yet gone unfulfilled. Drexler mentions inconsistencies in Smalley's previous public statements on atom-by-atom construction, and ended by stating "I would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently, but the question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps the most fundamental issue in the field today—it shapes basic objectives and expectations—and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived."

===Exchange of letters in ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''===
[[File:Nanob.jpg|thumb|A depiction of a putative [[technomimetic]] molecular [[planetary gear]] set. Smalley questioned whether devices like these could be constructed using an [[enzyme]]-like mechanical process, either in an [[aqueous solution]] or with some other chemistry, and whether such devices would be operational at all.]]

The debate was concluded in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature that was the 1 December 2003 cover story of ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'', the newsmagazine of the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature first reproduced Drexler's April 2003 open letter to Smalley. Smalley's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused, and stating that Drexler's book ''Engines of Creation'' had triggered Smalley's own interest in nanotechnology. He agreed that "Smalley fingers" could not work, and then asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks, since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled

He then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry, but asked how the nanorobot would be able to obtain, control, and repair such an enzyme, and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water-based biological systems, stating that "biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build, but it can't make a crystal of silicon, or steel, or copper, or aluminum, or titanium, or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built." Smalley asked what kind of "nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry" Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this "a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries."

Drexler's counterresponse began by returning to Feynman's 1959 talk, stating that "although inspired by biology... Feynman's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical, not biological." He characterized the challenges as being that of [[systems engineering]] rather than solely chemistry, and referred Smalley to ''Nanosystems'', with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion. He stated:

{{Quote|Positional control naturally avoids most side reactions by preventing unwanted encounters between potential reactants. Transition-state theory indicates that, for suitably chosen reactants, positional control will enable synthetic steps at megahertz frequencies with the reliability of digital switching operations in a computer. The supporting analysis for this conclusion appears in "Nanosystems" and has withstood a decade of scientific scrutiny.}}

Drexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers, and would augment solution-phase chemistry to produce [[macroscopic]] products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks, using solution-phase molecular assemblers to [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] the construction of more sophisticated assemblers. He concluded by writing:

{{Quote|U.S. progress in molecular manufacturing has been impeded by the dangerous illusion that it is infeasible. I hope you will agree that the actual physical principles of molecular manufacturing are sound and quite unlike the various notions, many widespread in the press, that you have correctly rejected. I invite you to join me and others in the call to augment today's nanoscale research with a systems engineering effort aimed at achieving the grand vision articulated by Richard Feynman.}}

Smalley began his concluding letter:

{{Quote|I see you have now walked out of the room where I had led you to talk about real chemistry, and you are now back in your mechanical world. I am sorry we have ended up like this. For a moment I thought we were making progress. You still do not appear to understand the impact of my short piece in Scientific American. Much like you can't make a boy and a girl fall in love with each other simply by pushing them together, you cannot make precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with simple mechanical motion along a few degrees of freedom in the assembler-fixed frame of reference. Chemistry, like love, is more subtle than that.}}

Smalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach. He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme-like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium, and as all known enzymes use water as that medium, the range of products must be limited to the "meat and bone of biology."  He accused Drexler of creating "a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there."

Lastly, Smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit, saying that nearly half of them thought that self-replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about the results of them spreading across the world. Smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay. Smalley concluded his letter:

{{Quote|You and people around you have scared our children. I don't expect you to stop, but I hope others in the chemical community will join with me in turning on the light, and showing our children that, while our future in the real world will be challenging and there are real risks, there will be no such monster as the self-replicating mechanical nanobot of your dreams.}}

==Critical response==
{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|image1=Raymond Kurzweil Fantastic Voyage.jpg|width1=160|image2=Lessig portrait.jpg|width2=150|footer=The Drexler–Smalley debate attracted commentary from figures such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] (left) and [[Lawrence Lessig]] (right).|alt1=Ray Kurzweil in 2005|alt2=Lawrence Lessig in 2009}}

===Tone===
The debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone. David Berube in ''Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz'' characterized it as "two people talking over each other... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal," and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying "the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and a place in the pantheon."&lt;ref name="berube"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1822/ |pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zyvex]] founder James von Ehr remarked that "Eric [Drexler] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a [[Pissing contest|pissing match]] with a Nobel-prize winner."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;  An article in ''The New York Times'' called the debate "reminiscent of that old ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch... [with] Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue," referring to a version of the long-running [[Weekend Update#Jane Curtin (1976–1980)|Weekend Update]] segment.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

===Technical commentary===
The debate has received technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in ''The Nanotech Pioneers'' noted that the ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of the argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that "nowhere in it does ''Nanosystems'' contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together."  He concludes that "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' declared Drexler as the winner of the debate,&lt;ref name="kurzweil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-303788-9|pages=236&amp;ndash;241}}&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating the view that Smalley distorted Drexler's ideas and calling Smalley's responses "short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors" and asserting that "Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions... [which have] been extensively studied."  He quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions, and pointed out that modern non-biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded the capabilities of natural biological systems. He also noted that "earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible... [but today] we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-drexler-smalley-debate-on-molecular-assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on public perception of nanotechnology===
The debate's focus on the public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger [[Glenn Reynolds]] stated that "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"&gt;Berube, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lawrence Lessig]] criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=Stamping Out Good Science|date=July 2004|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=5|accessdate=12 July 2011|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="kurzweil"/&gt;

'''Fringe science''' is an inquiry in an established field of study which departs significantly from [[mainstream#In science|mainstream]] theories in that field and is considered to be questionable by the mainstream.

Fringe science may be either a questionable application of a scientific approach to a [[field of study]] or an approach whose status as scientific is widely questioned.

For mainstream scientists, attributes of fringe science include being highly speculative or relying on premises already [[Objection (argument)|refuted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dutch, Steven I |title=Notes on the nature of fringe science |journal=[[J Geol Ed]] |issn=0022-1368 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=6–13 |date=January 1982 |id=ERIC EJ260409 |oclc=427103550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fringe science theories are often advanced by persons who have no traditional academic science background, or by researchers outside the mainstream discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedlander, Michael W. |title=At the Fringes of Science |oclc=42309381}}p. 58{{Verify source|date=June 2010}}&lt;!--p 63?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |author=Isaac Asimov |title=Left Hand of the Electron|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-440-94717-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The general public has difficulty distinguishing between science and its imitators,&lt;ref name=Fried173/&gt; and in some cases a "yearning to believe or a generalized suspicion of experts is a very potent incentive to accepting pseudoscientific claims".&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fringe science" covers everything from novel [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] which can be tested by means of the [[scientific method]] to wild [[Ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc hypotheses]] and [[Mumbo jumbo (phrase)|mumbo jumbo]].  This has resulted in a tendency to dismiss all fringe science as the domain of [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientists]], hobbyists, and [[Crank (person)|cranks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Bell |title=Secret science |journal=Science and Public Policy |date=December 1999 |volume=26 |issue=6 |page=450 |doi=10.1093/spp/26.6.450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms for questionable types of science are ''[[pathological science]]'', ''[[voodoo science]]'', and ''[[cargo cult science]]''. The term ''[[junk science]]'' is used to criticize research seen as dubious or fraudulent, as opposed to "solid science".

A concept that was once accepted by the mainstream [[scientific community]] may become fringe science because of a later evaluation of previous research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sld.cu/galerias/pdf/sitios/revsalud/beyerstein_cience_vs_pseudoscience.pdf|title=Distinhuishing Science from Pseudoscience|last=Beyerstein|first=Barry L.|date=July 1995|website=INFOMED - Red de Salud de Cuba|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[focal infection theory]], which held that focal infections of the tonsils or teeth are a primary cause of [[systemic disease]], was once considered to be medical fact. It has since been dismissed because of lack of evidence.

==Description==
The term "fringe science" denotes unorthodox scientific theories and [[Scientific modeling|models]]. Persons who create fringe science may have employed the [[scientific method]] in their work, but their results are not accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Fringe science may be advocated by a scientist who has some recognition within the larger scientific community, but this is not always the case. Usually the evidence provided by fringe science is accepted only by a minority and is rejected by most experts.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The boundary between fringe science and [[pseudoscience]] is disputed. The connotation of "fringe science" is that the enterprise is rational but is unlikely to produce good results  for a variety of reasons, including incomplete or contradictory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be considered [[pejorative]]. For example, Lyell D. Henry Jr. wrote that, "fringe science [is] a term also suggesting kookiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry Lyell D. |year=1981 |title=Unorthodox science as a popular activity |journal=[[J Am Culture]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1981.0402_1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization is perhaps inspired by the [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric behavior]] of many researchers of the kind known colloquially (and with considerable historical precedent) as [[mad scientist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Runco |first1=Mark A |last2=Pritzker |first2=Steven R |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Creativity |volume=i–z |year=1999 |page=10 |contribution=}} {{Verify source|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most fringe science is rejected, the scientific community has come to accept some portions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such is [[plate tectonics]], an idea which had its origin in the fringe science of [[continental drift]] and was rejected for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation| The confusion between science and pseudoscience, between honest scientific error and genuine scientific discovery, is not new, and it is a permanent feature of the scientific landscape .... Acceptance of new science can come slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
===Historical===
Some historical ideas that are considered to have been refuted by mainstream science are:

*[[Focal infection theory]] (FIT) as the primary cause of systemic disease rapidly became accepted by mainstream dentistry and medicine after World War I. This acceptance was largely based upon what later turned out to be fundamentally flawed studies. As a result, millions of people were subjected to needless [[dental extraction]]s and surgeries.&lt;ref name="FITPaper"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The focal infection theory: appraisal and reappraisal. | author=Pallasch, TJ | journal=Journal of the California Dental Association |date=March 2000  | volume=28 | issue=3 | pages=194–200 | pmid=11326533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original studies supporting FIT began falling out of favor in the 1930s.

===Contemporary===
Relatively recent fringe sciences include:

* [[Aubrey de Grey]], featured in a 2006 ''[[60 Minutes]]'' special report, is  studying human [[longevity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/28/60minutes/main1168852.shtml |title=The quest for immortality: Want to live 500 years? One scientist says it may be possible one day |publisher=CBS News |date=2005-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls his work "[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]]" (SENS). Many mainstream scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1=H. |last1=Warner | first2=J. |last2=Anderson | first3=S. |last3=Austad | first4=E. |last4=Bergamini | first5=D. |last5=Bredesen | first6=R. |last6=Butler | first7=B.

In a 2005 article in ''[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence#Technology Review controversy|Technology Review]]'' (part of a larger series), it was stated that "SENS is highly speculative. Many of its proposals have not been reproduced, nor could they be reproduced with today's scientific knowledge and technology. Echoing [[Nathan Myhrvold|Myhrvold]], we might charitably say that de Grey's proposals exist in a kind of antechamber of science, where they wait (possibly in vain) for independent verification. SENS does not compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists; but neither is it demonstrably wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jason |last=Pontin |title=Is defeating aging only a dream? |date=2006-07-11 |work=Technology Review | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/}} ''(includes June 9, 2006 critiques and rebuttals)''&lt;/ref&gt;
* A nuclear fusion reaction called [[cold fusion]] which occurs near room temperature and pressure was reported by chemists [[Martin Fleischmann]] and [[Stanley Pons]] in March 1989. Numerous research efforts at the time were unable to replicate their results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A report from the American Physical Society spring meeting – 1–2 May 1989 Baltimore, MD Special session on cold fusion |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/physics/Cold-fusion/vince-cate/aps.ascii |accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a number of scientists have worked on cold fusion or have participated in international conferences on it. In 2004, the United States Department of Energy commissioned a panel on cold fusion to take another look at it. They wanted to determine whether their policies concerning it should be altered because of new evidence.

*The theory of [[abiogenic petroleum origin]] holds that [[petroleum]] was formed from deep carbon deposits, perhaps dating to the formation of the Earth. The ubiquity of hydrocarbons in the solar system is taken as evidence that there may be a great deal more petroleum on Earth than commonly thought, and that petroleum may originate from carbon-bearing fluids which migrate upward from the Earth's mantle. Abiogenic hypotheses saw a revival in the last half of the twentieth century by Russian and Ukrainian scientists. More interest was generated in the West after the 1999 publication by [[Thomas Gold]] of ''[[Thomas Gold#The Deep Hot Biosphere|The Deep Hot Biosphere]]''. Gold's version of the theory is partly based on the existence of a [[biosphere]] composed of [[thermophile]] bacteria in the Earth's crust, which might explain the existence of certain biomarkers in extracted petroleum.

===Accepted as mainstream===
Some theories that were once rejected as fringe science, but were eventually accepted as mainstream science, are:

==Responding to fringe science==
[[Michael W. Friedlander]] has suggested some guidelines for responding to fringe science, which, he argues, is a more difficult problem&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; than [[scientific misconduct]]. His suggested methods include impeccable accuracy, checking cited sources, not overstating orthodox science, thorough understanding of the Wegener [[continental drift]] example, examples of orthodox science investigating radical proposals, and prepared examples of errors from fringe scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 178–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedlander suggests that fringe science is necessary so that mainstream science will not atrophy. Scientists must evaluate the plausibility of each new fringe claim, and certain fringe discoveries "will later graduate into the ranks of accepted" — while others "will never receive confirmation".&lt;ref name=Fried173&gt;Friedlander, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Wertheim]] profiled many "outsider scientists" in her book ''Physics on the Fringe'', who receive little or no attention from professional scientists.  She describes all of them as trying to make sense of the world using the scientific method, but in the face of not being able to understand the complex theories of modern science.  She also finds it fair that credentialed scientists do not bother spending a lot of time learning about and explaining problems with the fringe theories of uncredentialed scientists, since the authors of those theories have not taken the time to understand the mainstream theories they aim to disprove.&lt;ref&gt;http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/77/510036/143369581/KERA_143369581.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
Towards the end of the 20th century, some critics (such as [[Answers in Genesis]]) began to cite fringe science theories with limited support. Often their goal{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} was to classify as [[Controversy|controversial]] entire fields of scientific inquiry (notably [[paleoanthropology]], [[human sexuality]], [[evolution]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]]) that contradict literal or fundamentalist interpretation of various [[Religious text|sacred texts]].

Critics argue that such controversies open a window of plausibility for [[Miracle|divine intervention]] and [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The dangers of creationism in education |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11297.htm |publisher=Council of Europe |date=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813201055/http://www.assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc07%2FEDOC11297.htm |archivedate=2007-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Wedge |publisher=Discovery Institute |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html |title=Edwards v. Aguillard}}: Amicus curiae brief of 72 Nobel laureates, 17 state academies of science, and 7 other scientific organizations in support of appellees in {{ussc|482|578|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Donald E. Simanek]] asserts, "Too often speculative and tentative hypotheses of cutting edge science are treated as if they were scientific truths, and so accepted by a public eager for answers." But the public is ignorant of the fact that "As science progresses from ignorance to understanding it must pass through a transitional phase of confusion and uncertainty."&lt;ref name='Simanek'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alcor.concordia.ca/~vpetkov/links4.htm#cutting |title=Cutting edge science |accessdate=2008-04-01 |last=Simanek |first=Donald |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080319110815/http://alcor.concordia.ca/~vpetkov/links4.htm#cutting &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media also play a role in propagating the belief that certain fields of science are controversial. In their 2003 paper "Optimising Public Understanding of Science and Technology in Europe: A Comparative Perspective", Jan Nolin ''et al.'' write that "From a media perspective it is evident that controversial science sells, not only because of its dramatic value, but also since it is often connected to high-stake societal issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/virusss/opus/OPUS%20Report%20Final.pdf |page=632 |author=Nolin, Jan |title=Optimising public understanding of science: A comparative perspective |format=PDF |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912101731/http://www.univie.ac.at/virusss/opus/OPUS%20Report%20Final.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GEC-Marconi scientist deaths conspiracy theory''' states that between 1982 and 1990 twenty-five [[United Kingdom|British]]-based [[GEC-Marconi]] scientists and engineers who worked on the [[Sting Ray torpedo]] project and other [[United States]] [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] related projects (better known as Star Wars) died under mysterious circumstances.

'''Gaetano Cari''' ([[18th century]]) was an Italian scientific instrument maker.

Not much is known about Gaetano Cari, except that he performed restoration work on [[physics]] instruments at the [[Pistoia]] Seminary in [[1787]] and was appointed steward of the [[Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale]] in [[Florence]] in [[1788]]. Because of his poor health, he was relieved of the latter duties in the following year.

{{Distinguish|Geon (disambiguation)}}

The term '''geon''' (for geological [[eon (geology)|eon]]) refers to large, [[geologic]] units of time.
Geologists traditionally subdivide Earth history into a hierarchy of named intervals: eons, eras, periods, etc. (e.g., the [[Jurassic]] Period of the [[Mesozoic]] Era). Historians subdivide the history of human activity into intervals that are comparatively much shorter. In both geological and historical scales, the divisions of equal rank are characteristically of unequal duration, and the identification of a particular interval is primarily based on its fossil, artifact, or cultural content (e.g., [[Carboniferous]], [[Neolithic]], [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], [[Ming Dynasty]]). Both scales are calibrated against numerical ages obtained
separately.

An alternative way of referring to the past is to use a scale with intervals of equal duration. We speak of a given decade, century, or millennium. For the enormously long geologic time frame, it is advantageous to use corresponding large, equal time intervals encompassing the events and processes that have shaped our planet. The development of mountain ranges, ocean basins, and continents takes tens to hundreds of millions of years, and large time units thus are convenient for discussing long-term trends. Astronomers use [[light years]] and [[parsecs]] to deal with huge distances, rather than kilometres. Geologists have geons to refer to large specified time intervals of Earth history. The '''geon scale''' is also applicable to other planets with different histories, and to the universe itself.

Two usages of geon have been introduced in geology:

# A geon is a unit "...taken to represent either the span of the average geologic period, or the thickness of the average stratigraphic equivalent, a matter of 60,000,000 years, and 50,000 feet [~15 km] of clastic depositions" (Woodward, 1929). Utilizing the currently accepted value of 542 [[Mega-annum|Ma]], million years ago) for the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] Period, and using 11 geologic periods in the [[Phanerozoic]] Eon, an updated value for Woodward's geon would be about 49.4 million years. Usage in this sense is not current.

# A geon is a specified 100-million-year interval of geologic time, counted backward from the present. The geon scale can be likened to a ladder, each interval between rungs representing 100 million years. Geons are named for the leftmost part of the number representing age. For example, the Earth formed about 4550 million years ago, an event that is assigned to Geon 45 (interval below rung 45). Rocks formed at 1851 Ma or 1800 Ma both belong to Geon 18. The extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] Period (065 Ma) belongs to Geon 0. (Hofmann, 1990).

{{Infobox Observatory}}
The '''Greenhill Observatory''' is an astronomical observatory operated by the [[University of Tasmania]] (UTAS)
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utas.edu.au/maths-physics/research/physics-research/optical-astronomy&lt;/ref&gt; on Bisdee Tier, near Spring Hill, Tasmania. The observatory is located roughly 50&amp;nbsp;km (30 miles) north of [[Hobart]], ([[Australia]]). The nearest municipality is the village of [[Jericho, Tasmania|Jericho]]. The observatory was officially opened by the Governor of Tasmania in February, 2013. The facility is named in honour of longtime University of Tasmania astrophysicist Dr John G. Greenhill (1933-2014).

==Telescopes==
The site replaces the University of Tasmania's previous observatory at [[Canopus Hill Observatory|Canopus Hill]], near Hobart. The site was developed with the installation of a 1.3 m telescope in mind, and consideration given for possible future expansion. One telescope is currently hosted, the Harlingten Telescope (H127).

* The H127 is a {{convert|1.27|m|in|abbr=on}} diameter reflector of modified Ritchey-Chrétien design, on an equatorial fork mount. The H127 has a rotating tertiary mirror and wide-field corrector lenses installed at two folded Cassegrain (Nasmyth) focal stations, allowing rapid switching between instruments. The H127 was donated to the University of Tasmania by Mr Caisey Harlingten.

'''Hecates Tholus''' is a [[Mars|Martian]] [[volcano]], notable for results from the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Mars Express]] mission which indicate a major eruption took place 350 million years ago. The eruption created a [[caldera]] 10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter. It has been suggested that glacial deposits later partly filled the caldera and an adjacent depression. Crater counts indicate this happened as recently as 5 to 20 million years ago. However climate models show that ice is not stable at Hecates Tholus today, pointing to climate change since the glaciers were active. It has been shown that the age of the glaciers correspond to a period of increased [[obliquity]] of Mars' rotational axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The volcano is at location 32.12°N 150.24°E, in the volcanic province [[Elysium (volcanic province)|Elysium]], and has a diameter of 182&amp;nbsp;km. It is the northernmost of the Elysium volcanoes; the others are [[Elysium Mons]] and [[Albor Tholus]].  Hecates Tholus is in the [[Cebrenia quadrangle]].

==Origin of name==
In [[planetary nomenclature]], a "[[tholus]]" is a "small domical mountain or hill".  Hecates is named after Hecate, the goddess of the ghost-world, nightly events, and sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Blunck, J.  1982.  Mars and its Satellites.  Exposition Press.  Smithtown, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hem Singh Pruthi''' (23 February 1897 – 23 December 1969) was an Indian entomologist who served as Imperial Entomologist, being the first native Indian in that position.

He was born at [[Begowala]], [[Sialkot]] where his father Dr Bhagat Singh Pruti worked in the Police and Jail Hospital at [[Gujranwala]]. He studied locally and completed his MSc at the Government College in Lahore and joined [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], where he was a Charles Abercrombie Smith Student and obtained a Ph.D. in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=98|title=Admissions to Peterhouse|author=Ansell, E.| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pruthi received an Sc.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1943. He then became an assistant superintendent at the [[Zoological Survey of India]] at Calcutta. He worked mainly on the Hemiptera. He then joined the [[Indian Agricultural Research Institute]] and became the Imperial Entomologist, succeeding [[Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher|T.B. Fletcher]] in 1934. In 1938 he founded the Entomological Society of India. Pruthi's work during this period was mainly on insects of economic importance and was a plant protection advisor to the Government of India and established a locust warning system. He retired in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Lal, K. B. |year=1954|title= Dr. Hem Singh Pruthi| journal= Current Science |volume=23|issue=1|page= 5 |url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Downloads/article_id_023_01_0005_0005_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he published a ''Textbook of Agricultural Entomology''.

A number of species of hemipterans have been named after him including ''[[Pruthiana]]'',  ''[[Pruthiorosius]]'', and ''[[Pruthius]]''. His student [[Mahadeva Subramania Mani|M.S. Mani]] named a fly ''Pruthidiplosis'' after him.

In October 1608, the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States General]] discussed Jacob Metius's patent application for a device for "seeing faraway things as though nearby," consisting of a convex and concave lens in a tube, and the combination magnified three or four times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  His use of a convex [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] and concave [[eyepiece]] may have been a superior design to Hans Lippershey telescope design&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007155750/http://www.metius.nl/Newweb/Vereniging/Frames/frame_Metius_.html What do we know about Metius?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007155750/http://www.metius.nl/Newweb/Vereniging/Frames/frame_Metius_.html |date=October 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was submitted for patent only a few weeks before Metius'.

Metius informed the States General that he was familiar with the secrets of [[glassmaker|glassmaking]], and that he could make an even better telescope with the government's support.  When Metius perceived that the States General was reluctant to review his claim, he prohibited anyone from seeing his telescope.

The States General voted Jacob Metius a small award, although it ended up employing Lippershey to make binocular versions of the telescope.  At his death, Metius’ tools were destroyed according to his wishes in order to prevent anyone from claiming the honor of inventing the telescope.

There is a claim by Johannes Zachariassen, [[Zacharias Janssen]]'s son, that Jacob Metius and [[Cornelis Drebbel]] bought a telescope from him and his father in 1620 and copied it,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupre, Rob Van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope - 2011, page 43&lt;/ref&gt; although this is well after the dates Metius is known to have been making telescopes. One version is stated in [[Charles Hutton]]'s 1795 book ''Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary'' :

:"In 1620, James Metius of Alcmaer, brother of [[Metius|Adrian Metius]] who was professor of mathematics at Franeker, came with [[Cornelis Drebbel|Drebel]] to Middleburg, and there bought Telescopes of [[Zacharias Jansen|Jansen's]] children, who had made them public; and yet this Adr. Metius has given his brother the honour of the invention, in which too he is mistakenly followed by [[Descartes]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archimedes.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.cgi?dir=hutto_dicti_078_en_1795;step=textonly;corpus=&amp;page=1291&amp;n=1291 archimedes.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joachim Boldt''' (born September 29, 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thieme.de/specials/presseservice/dgch/pdf/pressemappe_dgch_dgai_do_30.4.09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319234147/http://www.thieme.de/specials/presseservice/dgch/pdf/pressemappe_dgch_dgai_do_30.4.09.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a German [[anesthesiologist]] who was previously considered a leading researcher into [[colloids]]. He has been stripped of his professorship and is under criminal investigation for possible forgery of up to 90 research studies.&lt;ref name=Blake/&gt;

The editors of 16 different [[scientific journal]]s, including ''[[Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia]]'', ''[[Anaesthesia (journal)|Anaesthesia]]'', the ''[[European Journal of Anaesthesiology]]'' and the ''[[British Journal of Anaesthesia]]'', allege that 89 of 102 studies published by Boldt contained research without proper [[institutional review board]] approval.&lt;ref name=Kelland&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/04/us-journals-retractions-idUSTRE7235J820110304 "Medical journals retract 'unethical' research"], Kate Kelland, [[Reuters]], March 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2010, Boldt was suspended from Klinikum [[Ludwigshafen]], a hospital in Germany, for a scientific publication in ''Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia'' with insufficient background research. His field of research and the publications were related to [[hydroxyethyl starch]] (HES).&lt;ref&gt;[http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news399181 Informationsdienst Wissenschaf: "DGAI: Wissenschaftliches Fehlverhalten in der Anästhesie inakzeptabel"] 2010-11-26 (retrieved 2011-03-04) German&lt;/ref&gt; Some 90 studies he published are currently being reviewed by medical authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8360678/Joachim-Boldt-profile-a-glittering-career-built-on-charisma-and-charm.html "Joachim Boldt profile: a glittering career built on charisma and charm"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 2011-03-03 (retrieved: 2011-03-04)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Boldt was stripped of his title of professor at the [[University of Giessen]] for failing to teach, and the university is investigating possible charges of [[scientific misconduct]].&lt;ref name=uni-giessen&gt;[http://www.uni-giessen.de/cms/ueber-uns/pressestelle/pm/pm38-11 Giessen University: "Akademische Bezeichnung aberkannt"] 2011-02-15 (retrieved: 2011-03-04) {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His case was described at the time as "possibly the biggest medical research scandal since [[Andrew Wakefield]] was struck off in 2010 for falsely claiming to have proved a link between the [[MMR vaccine controversy|MMR vaccine and autism]]".&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;Heidi Blake, Holly Watt and Robert Winnett. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8360667/Millions-of-surgery-patients-at-risk-in-drug-research-fraud-scandal.html "Millions of surgery patients at risk in drug research fraud scandal"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 03 Mar 2011 (retrieved 2011-03-03)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the hospital released the results of its investigation: while no patients were harmed, "in a large number of the studies investigated, the conduct of research failed to meet required standards. False data were published in at least 10 of the 91 articles examined, including, for instance, data on patient numbers/ study groups as well as data on the timing of measurements".&lt;ref&gt;Press release, Klinikum Ludwigshafen, http://www.klilu.de/content/aktuelles___presse/pressearchiv/2012/hospital_presents_results_of_final_report_committee_completes_investigation_in_the_case_of_dr_boldt/index_ger.html, 9 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2013, JAMA published a metaanalysis on HES in critically ill patients (Zachyranski R et al.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2013.430 |pmid=23423413 |title=Association of Hydroxyethyl Starch Administration with Mortality and Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients Requiring Volume Resuscitation |journal=JAMA |volume=309 |issue=7 |pages=678–88 |year=2013 |last1=Zarychanski |first1=Ryan |last2=Abou-Setta |first2=Ahmed M. |last3=Turgeon |first3=Alexis F. |last4=Houston |first4=Brett L. |last5=McIntyre |first5=Lauralyn |last6=Marshall |first6=John C. |last7=Fergusson |first7=Dean A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boldt had 7 studies from the 1990s that had not yet been retracted. Including them, there was no increase in mortality, but excluding them, there was a significant increase in mortality. Only the Boldt studies showed an improvement with HES; all other studies showed the opposite. It is believed that his fraudulent studies put critically ill patients at risk and caused harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2013.851 |pmid=23423420 |title=Hydroxyethyl Starch for Intravenous Volume Replacement |journal=JAMA |volume=309 |issue=7 |pages=723–4 |year=2013 |last1=Antonelli |first1=Massimo |last2=Sandroni |first2=Claudio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overview of the challenges for meta-analysts presented by the fraud has recently been published. It includes double publication of studies, manipulating demographic and outcome data to conceal double publication and getting better results for a drug being tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilkes |first1=Mahlon M. |first2=Roberta J. |last2=Navickis |title=The Boldt affair: a quandary for meta-analysts |journal=Anesthesiology News |volume=39 |issue=4 |year=2013 |pages=8–9 |url=http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/ViewArticle.aspx?d=Commentary&amp;d_id=449&amp;i=April+2013&amp;i_id=945&amp;a_id=22877 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, 96 of his papers have been retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/ | title=The Retraction Watch Leaderboard| date=2015-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2018 a review highlighted additional retractions, the first fraudulent one retracted was from 1986 demonstrating persistent fraud for the entire career of Boldt ,Statistical analyses demonstrate,that still many most likely fraudulent papers from Boldt are out there and editors should take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00134-018-5289-3 |pmid=29968012 |title=The Boldt scandal still in need of action: The example of colloids 10 years after initial suspicion of fraud |journal=Intensive Care Medicine |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=1735–1737 |year=2018 |last1=Wiedermann |first1=Christian J. |last2=Joannidis |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[control theory]], a '''Kalman decomposition''' provides a mathematical means to convert a representation of any [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant]] (LTI) [[control system]] to a form in which the system can be decomposed into a standard form which makes clear the [[Observability|observable]] and [[Controllability|controllable]] components of the system. This decomposition results in the system being presented with a more illuminating structure, making it easier to draw conclusions on the system's [[Reachability problem|reachable]] and observable subspaces.

== Notation ==
The derivation is identical for both discrete-time as well as continuous time LTI systems. The description of a continuous time linear system is

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\, y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where 
: &lt;math&gt;\, x&lt;/math&gt; is the "state vector", 
: &lt;math&gt;\, y&lt;/math&gt; is the "output vector", 
: &lt;math&gt;\, u&lt;/math&gt; is the "input (or control) vector", 
: &lt;math&gt;\, A&lt;/math&gt; is the "state matrix",
: &lt;math&gt;\, B&lt;/math&gt; is the "input matrix", 
: &lt;math&gt;\, C&lt;/math&gt; is the "output matrix",
: &lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; is the "feedthrough (or feedforward) matrix".

Similarly, a discrete-time linear control system can be described as

: &lt;math&gt;\, x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\, y(k) = Cx(k) + Du(k)&lt;/math&gt;

with similar meanings for the variables. Thus, the system can be described using the tuple consisting of four matrices &lt;math&gt;\, (A, B, C, D)&lt;/math&gt;. 
Let the order of the system be &lt;math&gt;\, n&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, the Kalman decomposition is defined as a transformation of the tuple &lt;math&gt;\, (A, B, C, D)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\, (\hat{A}, \hat{B}, \hat{C}, \hat{D})&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\, {\hat{A}} = {T^{-1}}AT&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\, {\hat{B}} = {T^{-1}}B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\, {\hat{C}} = CT&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\, {\hat{D}} = D&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\, T&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;\, n \times n&lt;/math&gt; invertible matrix defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\,  T = \begin{bmatrix} T_{r\overline{o}} &amp; T_{ro} &amp; T_{\overline{ro}} &amp; T_{\overline{r}o}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\, T_{r\overline{o}}&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix whose columns span the subspace of states which are both reachable and unobservable.
* &lt;math&gt;\, T_{ro}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that the columns of &lt;math&gt;\, \begin{bmatrix} T_{r\overline{o}} &amp; T_{ro}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; are a basis for the reachable subspace.
* &lt;math&gt;\, T_{\overline{ro}}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that the columns of &lt;math&gt;\, \begin{bmatrix} T_{r\overline{o}} &amp; T_{\overline{ro}}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; are a basis for the unobservable subspace.
* &lt;math&gt;\, T_{\overline{r}o}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that &lt;math&gt;\,\begin{bmatrix} T_{r\overline{o}} &amp; T_{ro} &amp; T_{\overline{ro}} &amp; T_{\overline{r}o}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible.
By construction, the matrix &lt;math&gt;\, T&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. It can be observed that some of these matrices may have dimension zero. For example, if the system is both observable and controllable, then &lt;math&gt;\, T = T_{ro}&lt;/math&gt;, making the other matrices zero dimension.

==Standard Form==
By using results from controllability and observability, it can be shown that the transformed system &lt;math&gt;\, (\hat{A}, \hat{B}, \hat{C}, \hat{D})&lt;/math&gt; has matrices in the following form:

: &lt;math&gt;\, \hat{A} = \begin{bmatrix}A_{r\overline{o}} &amp; A_{12} &amp; A_{13} &amp; A_{14} \\
0 &amp; A_{ro} &amp; 0 &amp; A_{24} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; A_{\overline{ro}} &amp; A_{34}\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; A_{\overline{r}o}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\, \hat{B} = \begin{bmatrix}B_{r\overline{o}} \\ B_{ro} \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\, \hat{C} = \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; C_{ro} &amp; 0 &amp; C_{\overline{r}o}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\, \hat{D} = D&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the conclusion that
* The subsystem &lt;math&gt;\, (A_{ro}, B_{ro}, C_{ro}, D)&lt;/math&gt; is both reachable and observable.
* The subsystem &lt;math&gt;\, \left(\begin{bmatrix}A_{r\overline{o}} &amp; A_{12}\\ 0 &amp; A_{ro}\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}B_{r\overline{o}} \\ B_{ro}\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; C_{ro}\end{bmatrix}, D\right)&lt;/math&gt; is reachable.
* The subsystem &lt;math&gt;\, \left(\begin{bmatrix}A_{ro} &amp; A_{24}\\ 0 &amp; A_{\overline{r}o}\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}B_{ro} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}C_{ro} &amp; C_{\overline{r}o}\end{bmatrix}, D\right)&lt;/math&gt; is observable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2505">The '''Knudsen layer''', also known as [[evaporation]] layer, is the thin layer of vapor near a liquid or solid. It is named after [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist [[Martin Knudsen]] (1871–1949).

==Definition==
At the interface of a vapor and a liquid/solid, the gas interaction with the liquid/solid dominates the gas behavior, and the gas is, very locally, not in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dongari | first1 = Nishanth | first2 = Yonghao | last2 = Zhang | first3 = Jason M. | last3 = Reese | author-link3 = Jason Reese | title = The ‘Knudsen Layer’ Effect on Thermal Transiporation of Rarefied Gases | year = 2008 | journal = GASMEMS report | pmid =  | pmc =  | url = http://www.gasmems.eu/site/www/fichiers/GASMEMS11_QR_12-11_ESR1.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160603141550/http://www.gasmems.eu/site/www/fichiers/GASMEMS11_QR_12-11_ESR1.pdf | archivedate = 2016-06-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This region, several [[mean free path]] lengths thick, is called the Knudsen layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aoki | first1 = K. |title=Knudsen Layer for Gas Mixtures| journal = Journal of Statistical Physics | volume = 112 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 629–655 | doi = 10.1023/A:1023876025363 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knudsen layer thickness==
The knudsen layer thickness can be approximated by &lt;math&gt;l_c&lt;/math&gt;, given by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gusarov | first1 = A. V. | last2 = Smurov | first2 = I. | doi = 10.1063/1.1516211 | title = Gas-dynamic boundary conditions of evaporation and condensation: Numerical analysis of the Knudsen layer | journal = Physics of Fluids | volume = 14 | issue = 12 | pages = 4242 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2002PhFl...14.4242G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;l_c =\frac{k T_s}{\pi d^2 p_s}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular diameter and &lt;math&gt;p_s&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure.

==Applications==
One of the applications of Knudsen layer is in the coma of comets. It has been used specially in the coma chemistry model (ComChem model).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = W.

A '''layered account''' is a form of [[qualitative research|qualitative social research]] in which the researcher writes from more than one voice and is informed by several layers of consciousness.  First proposed by Carol Rambo Ronai, a layered account intentionally blurs the boundaries between social research and art.

'''Little Joe 1A''' ('''LJ-1A''') was an unmanned rocket launched as part of [[NASA]]'s [[Mercury program]] on November 4, 1959. This flight, a repeat of the [[Little Joe 1]] (LJ-1) launch, was to test a launch abort under high aerodynamic load conditions. After lift-off, the pressure sensing system was to indicate when the correct abort dynamic pressure was reached. This should have happened about thirty seconds after launch. A signal was sent to the [[explosive bolt]]s to separate the spacecraft from the [[launch vehicle]]. Up to this point, everything was going as planned. The impulse was also intended to ignite the escape motor. The motor was ignited, but it took a number of seconds to build up thrust, and thus the abort maneuver was not accomplished at the desired dynamic pressure. Because of this, a repeat of the test was planned. Other events from launch through recovery occurred without incident. An altitude of 9 statute miles (14.5&amp;nbsp;km) and a range of 11.5 statute miles (18.5&amp;nbsp;km) were obtained, and a speed of 2,021.6 miles per hour (3,254&amp;nbsp;km/h) was reached. Flight time 8 minutes 11 seconds. Payload 1,007&amp;nbsp;kg.

[[File:Rompida de la hora en Calanda.jpg|thumb|270px|Holy Week celebrations with [[drum]]s in [[Calanda, Spain|Calanda]].]]

'''Lower Aragon''' ({{lang-es|Bajo Aragón}}, {{lang-an|Baixo Aragón}}, {{lang-ca|Baix Aragó}}), also known as ''Tierra Baja'', is a [[natural region|natural]] and [[historical region]] in [[Aragon]], [[Spain]]. The name "Lower Aragon" refers to the areas of the lowest altitude within the [[Ebro]] river basin, but the historical region encompasses only the river basins of several right tributaries of the [[Ebro]] River, namely the [[Matarranya River|Matarranya]], [[Guadalope]], [[Regallo]], [[Martín River|Martín]] and [[Aguas River|Aguas]], located between the Ebro and the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian mountain range]].

The [[demonym]] for Lower Aragonese people is ''bajoaragonés'' or ''tierrabajino''. The eastern fringes of the Lower Aragon natural region include some areas belonging as well to the [[Catalan-speaking]] strip in eastern Aragon known as [[La Franja]] and overlapping the historical [[Ilercavonia]] comarca.

All the villages traditionally taking part in the characteristic and loud [[Drum and Bass drum Route]] during [[Holy Week]] processions are included in Lower Aragon historical region.

==History==
In 1707, following King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip's]] [[Nueva Planta decrees]] a large part of Lower Aragon became the ''Corregimiento de Alcañiz'', a kind of large district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rp-ediciones.iespana.es/DossierProfes.pdf Paseando por Valderrobres] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229154236/http://rp-ediciones.iespana.es/DossierProfes.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, as a result of Marshal [[Louis Gabriel Suchet]]'s territorial division, the '''Province of Alcañiz''' ''(Provincia de Alcañiz)'' briefly unified the Lower Aragon region during French occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Eliseo Serrano Martín, ''El Matarraña y la Historia Moderna''. Portal Aragon.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, and despite of the strong identity of its inhabitants, this historical region has not been able to achieve the necessary legal recognition for its administrative development. 

After the [[1833 territorial division of Spain|territorial division of Spain]] in 1833 there have been attempts to create again a fourth province of Aragon with its capital in [[Alcañiz]]. These proposals were based on the limited relationship that the municipal areas of Lower Aragon have had with [[Teruel]], the capital of the province in which most of the historical region of Lower Aragon is presently included. 

In 1935, at the time of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] there was a feeble attempt to segregate the municipalities surrounding Alcañiz and [[Híjar]] from the Province of Teruel and merge them with [[Zaragoza Province]]. But so far the proposals to make a province out of the Lower Aragon region have not found much echo and the area finds itself in a state of administrative and economical neglect reflected in the [[Autovía del Ebro|A-68]] highway issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elperiodic.com/vinaros/noticias/16193_alcaldes-morella-vinaroz-alcaiz-piden-fomento-n232-coincida-autovia-comunicara-aragon-mediterraneo.html Los alcaldes de Morella, Vinaroz y Alcañiz piden a Fomento que la N232 coincida con la autovia que comunicará Aragón con el Mediterráneo]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present-day status===
Lower Aragon was divided into the smaller administrative comarcas after the official delimitation of the [[Comarcas of Aragon]] in 1999. Its historical limits fall now within the [[Bajo Aragón]], [[Bajo Aragón-Caspe]], [[Bajo Martín]], [[Andorra-Sierra de Arcos]], [[Matarraña|Matarranya]] and [[Ribera Baja del Ebro]] comarcas, as well as some municipal terms of the [[Maestrazgo, Aragon|Maestrazgo]], [[Campo de Belchite]], [[Bajo Cinca]] and [[Cuencas Mineras]] comarcas.

Since the current ''Bajo Aragón'' administrative division is only a small fraction of the historical territory, the name ''Bajo Aragón histórico'' is now commonly used in order to distinguish it from the homonymous small comarca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=1772 ''Bajo Aragón'' entry in the ''Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa'' (In Spanish)].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11414">The Method for an Integrated Knowledge Environment ('''MIKE2.0''') is an [[open source]] delivery methodology for [[enterprise information management]] consultants. MIKE2.0 was released in December, 2006, by [[BearingPoint]], a management and technology consulting company, under the [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution License]].

==Description==
The methodology provides a framework for [[information management]].
It covers how information is created, accessed, presented and used in decision-making to how it is kept secure, stored and destroyed.

=== Information development ===
While initially focused around structured data, the it coined the term "information development". 
The MIKE2.0 approach is based on the premise that traditional software delivery has under-focused on the information management.  The goal of MIKE2.0 is to create a new competency, specifically for managing information

=== Integrated content repository ===
[[Image:Mike2 integrated content repository.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Integrated Content Repository of MIKE2.0]]
MIKE2.0 introduces the concept of an integrated content repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/MIKE2:Integrated_Content_Repository
| title = Integrated Content Repository Overview from MIKE2.0
| accessdate = 2008-05-05
| author = 
| publisher = www.openmethodology.org
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This repository is a federated hub of shared assets from the Internet and content held internally within an organization.  Using this concept, organizations can create [[Mashup (digital)|mashups]] to the MIKE2.0 standard and information management assets on the [[World Wide Web]].  Although they are not required to share any of their assets with the open source community, they are encouraged to contribute. The content repository architecture is based on using wiki-pages created in MIKE2.0, assets that are linked from other sites using a social bookmarking tools and common tagging and extensions that allows  users to create mashups into their organization.&lt;!-- What the heck does that mean? Sounds like buzz --&gt;

=== Open methodology framework ===
MIKE2.0 claimed to be a pilot project for a "framework".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Open Methodology Framework Overview from MIKE2.0

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It proposes to be an approach which sits between a completely open Wikipedia-style model and a more rigorous development approach seen with software development.  The collaborative technology, the structure of the [http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/MIKE2:Content_Model content model] and a number of content governance articles are used to enable this concept.  The methodology states that this model is likely to evolve over time

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content model ==
[[Image:Mike2 content model.jpg|thumb|right|400px|MIKE2.0 Content Model]]
MIKE2.0 is made up of building blocks, given in a block diagram.

=== Products ===
Products tend to focus on a certain type of problem as opposed to being generalized for information management like the overall implementation guide.

=== SAFE Architecture ===
[[Image:Mike2 safe architecture.jpg|thumb|right|400px|SAFE Architecture for enterprise information management]]

The approach of the MIKE2 Methodology is to drive implementation of information management projects through a conceptual architecture framework known as strategic architecture for the federated enterprise (SAFE). SAFE goes across applications, data, and infrastructure and is designed to accommodate the inherent complexities of a highly federated organisation. Using a Conceptual Architecture helps align projects to a target vision for the future and to take the complexity out of the myriad of vendor choices around integration and information management.

=== Information governance ===
Information governance is a term used in MIKE2.0.&lt;!-- what the heck is it?? --&gt;  The governance model provides assessment tools, information standards, organizational structures and roles and responsibilities in relation to managing information assets.  Governance 2.0 is another term used, along with Enterprise 2.0 techniques and technologies.

==== Overall task list ====
* '''Overview and Key Concepts''' frame the overall approach as well as the rationale for why MIKE2.0 was created.
* The ''overall task list'' is a project management and project implementation methodology consisting of five phases, activities for each phase, tasks for each activity and inputs/outputs for each task. These are:

:* ''Phase 1'' – Business Assessment and Strategy Definition Blueprint
:* ''Phase 2'' – Technology Assessment and Selection Blueprint
:* ''Phase 3'' – Information Management Roadmap and Foundation Activities
:* ''Phase 4'' – Design Increment
:* ''Phase 5'' – Incremental Development, Testing, Deployment and Improvement

The task list is underpinned by the information development approach and tightly integrated with SAFE architecture.

* '''Usage Models''' show how the different tasks are applied for different solutions. Usage models use an indicator approach to show the relevance of an activity.

==== Supporting assets ====
''Supporting assets'' complement the overall methodology with:
* Tools and technique papers (such as [http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Information_Maturity_QuickScan Information Maturity Quickscan])
* Deliverable templates
* Capability statements
* Software assets
* Other tools and guides
Supporting Assets are typically the lowest-level assets of the overall approach.

== Collaboration environment ==
[[Image:Mike2 main page.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The MIKE2.0 Methodology]]
The MIKE2.0 collaboration environment is provided through omCollab, an open source collaboration product that provides the following capabilities:

* A [[Wiki]] to collaboratively create and share content (based on the same [[MediaWiki]] software that powers [[Wikipedia]])
* [[Blogs]] to publish individual or group-based information (based on [[WordPress]])
* [[Social Bookmarking]] for storing, sharing and discovering web bookmarks
* [[Social Networking]]  for the MIKE2.0 community to store basic profile information and to interact with one another.
* [[Tag (metadata)]] and [[Categorization|categories]] are used to classify articles, blogs and bookmarks into a common taxonomy.  MIKE2.0 brings these two concepts together in the bookmarking component.
* Techniques and technologies to [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]] to MIKE2.0, to build integrated solutions based on open content and internally  held assets
* [[Search engine|Search]] for users to discover content across federated repositories.  MIKE2.0 uses [[Google Custom Search]].
* A rich user interface with advanced navigational components an integrated skin and single sign on to provide common look and feel across the platform
* An open methodology compliance (OMC) capability to link an organisation into MIKE2.0

The overall product is referred to as "omCollab" and was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Organa''' is the informal name given to a [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Pluto]]'s largest [[moon]], [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. The crater was discovered by [[NASA]]'s ''[[New Horizons]]'' [[space probe]] on its flyby of Pluto. The name was chosen as a reference to [[Leia Organa]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' media franchise in the theme of naming Charon's craters after science fiction characters. Organa crater is rich in frozen ammonia, which suggests it was created very recently.&lt;ref name="ammonia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talbert|first1=Tricia|title=The Youngest CraterThe Youngest Crater on Charon?|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/the-youngest-crater-on-charon|website=NASA|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of Organa crater is in the northern Pluto-facing hemisphere of Charon.

==Ammonia==
[[file:Organa crater.jpg|thumb|300px|A composite image showing the ammonia around Organa crater, in green.]]
Organa crater is the only known crater on Charon that contains abundant [[ammonia]]. The ammonia was detected using the ''New Horizons'' LEISA instrument, by observing an absorption of [[infrared]] light in the {{val|2.22|u=[[Micrometre|μm]]}} band, which is associated with ammonia.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;

The source of the ammonia has not been confirmed, but it is associated with the impact process that created Organa crater, perhaps by removing the overlaying layer of water of ice and [[regolith]].&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cruikshank|first1=D. P.|title=Pluto and Charon: Surface Colors and Compositions - A Hypothesis|journal=47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|date=Mar 21, 2016|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160003677|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is confirmed, the detection could indicate that Charon has experienced [[Cryovolcano|cyrovolcanic]] activity, with ammonia as magma.&lt;ref name="Owlcation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Leonard|title=The Secrets of Pluto's Moons, Including Charon, Styx, Hydra, Kerberos, and Nix|url=https://owlcation.com/stem/The-Secrets-of-Plutos-Moons-Including-Charon-Styx-Hydra-Kerberos-and-Nix|website=Owlcation|publisher=[[HubPages Inc.]]|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is puzzling, since cryovolcanism isn't known to occur on such small bodies.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; In this scenario, the ammonia may have [[Precipitation|precipitated]] from an atmosphere, or soaked the ground from a subsurface source, or diffused out of the existing [[tholin]].&lt;ref name="Owlcation"/&gt;

An alternate explanation suggests the deposit of ammonia was delivered by the impactor that created Organa crater.&lt;ref name="ammonia"/&gt; In either case, it is believed that Organa crater is the result of a recent impact, less than 10 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{Cite arxiv |last1=Stern |first1=S.

The term is opposed to [[caducibranchiate]].

'''SciPy''' (pronounced /ˈsaɪpaɪ'/ "Sigh Pie"&lt;ref&gt;https://scipy.org/ "SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie")"&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[free and open-source]] [[Python (programming language)|Python]] library used for [[scientific computing]] and technical computing.

SciPy contains modules for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[linear algebra]], [[Integral|integration]], [[interpolation]], [[special functions]], [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]], [[signal processing|signal]] and [[image processing]], [[ordinary differential equation|ODE]] solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.

SciPy builds on the [[NumPy]] array object and is part of the NumPy stack which includes tools like [[Matplotlib]], [[pandas (software)|pandas]] and [[SymPy]], and an expanding set of scientific computing libraries. This NumPy stack has similar users to other applications such as [[MATLAB]], [[GNU Octave]], and [[Scilab]]. The NumPy stack is also sometimes referred to as the SciPy stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scipy.org/about.html|title=Scientific Computing Tools for Python|publisher=SciPy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SciPy is also a family of conferences for users and developers of these tools: SciPy (in the United States), EuroSciPy (in Europe) and SciPy.in (in India).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://conference.scipy.org/index.html|title=SciPy Conferences}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enthought]] originated the SciPy conference in the United States and continues to sponsor many of the international conferences as well as host the [https://www.scipy.org SciPy] website.

The SciPy library is currently distributed under the [[BSD license]], and its development is sponsored and supported by an open community of developers. It is also supported by [http://www.numfocus.org Numfocus] which is a community foundation for supporting reproducible and accessible science.

==Python Scientific Computing Environment==
A typical Python Scientific Computing Environment includes many [https://www.scipy.org/topical-software.html dedicated software tools].

==The SciPy Library/Package==
The SciPy package of key algorithms and functions core to Python's scientific computing capabilities. Available sub-packages include:
* '''constants''': physical constants and conversion factors (since version 0.7.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=660191&amp;group_id=27747|title=SciPy: Scientific Library for Python|publisher=[[SourceForge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Scipy source.png|thumb|Snapshot showing SciPy ndimage source code]]

==Data structures==
The basic data structure used by SciPy is a multidimensional [[Array data structure|array]] provided by the [[NumPy]] module. NumPy provides some functions for linear algebra, [[Fourier transform]]s, and [[random number generation]], but not with the generality of the equivalent functions in SciPy. NumPy can also be used as an efficient multidimensional container of data with arbitrary datatypes. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases. Older versions of SciPy used Numeric as an array type, which is now deprecated in favor of the newer NumPy array code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numpy.org/|title=NumPy Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1990s, Python was extended to include an array type for numerical computing called Numeric (This package was eventually replaced by [[Travis Oliphant]] who wrote NumPy in 2006 as a blending of Numeric and Numarray which had been started in 2001). As of 2000, there was a growing number of extension modules and increasing interest in creating a complete environment for scientific and technical computing. In 2001, Travis Oliphant, Eric Jones, and Pearu Peterson merged code they had written and called the resulting package SciPy. The newly created package provided a standard collection of common numerical operations on top of the Numeric array data structure. Shortly thereafter, Fernando Pérez released IPython, an enhanced interactive shell widely used in the technical computing community, and John Hunter released the first version of Matplotlib, the 2D plotting library for technical computing. Since then the SciPy environment has continued to grow with more packages and tools for technical computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.scipy.org/History_of_SciPy|title=History of SciPy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/courses/nlp/Software/NumPyBook.pdf|title=Guide to NumPy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/cs/2011/02/mcs2011020009.html|title=Python for Scientists and Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, [[incisors]] can present a more pronounced version of this called double shovel-shaped. When present, shovel-shaped incisors can indicate correlation among populations and are considered to be one of the [[wikt:nonmetrical|non-metrical]] traits in [[osteology]]. Structurally resembling the shovel-shaped incisors, double-shovel-shaped incisors are distinguished by a more pronounced mesial ridge comparing to the distal ridge. Similarly, the grades for both shovel-shaped incisors and the double shovel-shaped incisors in females are significantly greater than that in males.&lt;ref name="Kimura" /&gt; 

Shovel-shaped dental characteristic are also observed in ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and in [[Neanderthal|Neanderthals]], although the morphology of these shoveled incisors is distinct from the modern human form of shoveling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bailey S | title = Beyond shovel-shaped incisors: Neandertal dental morphology in a comparative context. | journal = Periodicum Biologorum | date = October 2006 | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–67 | url = https://hrcak.srce.hr/83097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The morphology of Neanderthal's anterior teeth has been seen as an adaptation to the heavy use of their canines and incisors in processing and chewing food, and the use of their teeth for activities other than feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clement AF, Hillson SW, Aiello LC | title = Tooth wear, Neanderthal facial morphology and the anterior dental loading hypothesis | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–76 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22341317 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
Variation in modern human incisor shoveling has been associated with the presence/absence of the V370A allele of the [[Ectodysplasin A receptor|''Ectodysplasin A Receptor'' (''EDAR'') gene]].&lt;ref name="Kimura" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park JH, Yamaguchi T, Watanabe C, Kawaguchi A, Haneji K, Takeda M, Kim YI, Tomoyasu Y, Watanabe M, Oota H, Hanihara T, Ishida H, Maki K, Park SB, Kimura R | title = Effects of an Asian-specific nonsynonymous EDAR variant on multiple dental traits | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 57 | issue = 8 | pages = 508–14 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22648185 | doi = 10.1038/jhg.2012.60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan J, Peng Q, Li J, Guan Y, Zhang L, Jiao Y, Yang Y, Wang S, Jin L | title = Characteristics of dental morphology in the Xinjiang Uyghurs and correlation with the EDARV370A variant | journal = Science China. Life Sciences | volume = 57 | issue = 5 | pages = 510–8 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24752358 | doi = 10.1007/s11427-014-4654-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EDAR V370A [[Protein isoform|isoform]] arises from a [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphism]]/missense mutation which changes the 370 Valine residue to an Alanine on the EDAR gene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The effect is approximately additive, where individuals with one copy of the allele have intermediate expression of shovel-shaped incisors and homozygotes have more strongly shoveled incisors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The trait is [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropically]] related to thicker and straighter hair shafts, other dental traits, sweat glands, and mammary gland ductal branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamberov YG, Wang S, Tan J, Gerbault P, Wark A, Tan L, Yang Y, Li S, Tang K, Chen H, Powell A, Itan Y, Fuller D, Lohmueller J, Mao J, Schachar A, Paymer M, Hostetter E, Byrne E, Burnett M, McMahon AP, Thomas MG, Lieberman DE, Jin L, Tabin CJ, Morgan BA, Sabeti PC | display-authors = 6 | title = Modeling recent human evolution in mice by expression of a selected EDAR variant | journal = Cell | volume = 152 | issue = 4 | pages = 691–702 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23415220 | pmc = 3575602 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.01.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimura" /&gt; An earlier quantitative genetic analysis of a Finnish population also revealed that inheritance of incisor shoveling is [[Genetic disorder#Single gene disorder|monogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Portin P, Alvesalo L | title = The inheritance of shovel shape in maxillary central incisors | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–62 | date = July 1974 | pmid = 4843087 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330410108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1540C allele of EDAR is also strongly correlated with the presence of shovel-shaped incisors and Asian specific hair thickness, as found in a study conducted on the DNA from Japanese populations.&lt;ref name="Kimura" /&gt;

It is hypothesized that other [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] effects associated with the V370A allele were favored by [[natural selection]] to help promote the presence of the allele and thus the emergence of shovel-shaped incisors. One of these associated traits is increased ductal branching in the mammary gland, which improves nutrient transport in [[Breast milk|breastmilk]]. This may likely have conferred a survival advantage to those with the allele during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] in certain environments with high altitudes and low Vitamin D.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hlusko LJ, Carlson JP, Chaplin G, Elias SA, Hoffecker JF, Huffman M, Jablonski NG, Monson TA, O'Rourke DH, Pilloud MA, Scott GR | title = Environmental selection during the last ice age on the mother-to-infant transmission of vitamin D and fatty acids through breast milk | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 19 | pages = E4426-E4432 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29686092 | pmc = 5948952 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1711788115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first description of shovel-shaped incisors was in 1870.&lt;!--This information is in the second sentence of the last paragraph of the right column of page 533.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Saukko P, Knight B | date = 2004 | title = Knight's Forensic Pathology | edition = 3rd | location = USA | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] | page = 533 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n40E_u05WVQC&amp;q=%22Muhlreiter%20in%201870%22  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, it was accepted that incisor shoveling yielded a direct advantage to the possessor. The proposed explanation for this at the time was that shovel-shaped incisors were stronger than non-shovel shaped incisors, resulting in the evolution of shovel-shaped incisors in regions where having stronger teeth would provide an evolutionary advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prehistoric Teeth of Man and of the Orang-utan from Central Sumatra, with notes on the Fossil Orang-utan from Java and Southern China| vauthors = Hooijer DA |publisher=EJ Brill|year=1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrdlička|first=Aleš | name-list-format = vanc |date= October 1920 |title=Shovel-shaped teeth |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume=3|issue=4|pages=429–465|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330030403|issn=0002-9483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater size and mass of shoveled incisors was said to have provided increased strength and durability as a means to prevent breakage.&lt;ref name="pmid14063186"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahlberg AA | title = Dental Evolution and Culture | journal = Human Biology | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 237–49 | date = September 1963 | pmid = 14063186 | doi = | jstor = 41448607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current research shows that part of the genotype, the [[Ectodysplasin A receptor|EDAR gene]], which was selected for because of its role in nutrient transfer in breast milk during the era of the [[Beringia|Beringian]] refugium, also determines the degree to which teeth shovel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In an interview, Dr. Hlusko suggests that human populations who had the trait migrated from Asia to the Americas, thus leaving their genetic trace around the world. With greater implications outside shoveling itself, the human variation in shoveling also supports the idea that populations are dynamic, rather than the theory of static populations evolving separately and distinctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =  Robert | last = Sanders | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://news.berkeley.edu/2018/04/23/did-last-ice-age-affect-breast-feeding-in-native-americans/|title=Did last ice age affect breast feeding in Native Americans?|date=2018-04-23|work=Berkeley News |access-date=2018-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In the mid 20th century, shovel-shaped incisors were considered to be a trait useful for [[racial grouping|racial categorization]], since the occurrence of shovel-shape incisors varies between many populations.&lt;!--This information is in the bottom of the first paragraph of the right column of page 65. The source text said, "...studies of many populations show that shovel-shaped incisors are among the traits conspicuously indicating a racial difference." The phrase "very noticeable" is a rewording of the source text's word "conspicuously".--&gt;&lt;ref name="SuzukiSakai" /&gt; A 1964 text said that many anthropologists at the time used the trait of shovel-shaped incisors as a diagnostic for race.&lt;!--This information is in the bottom of the second paragraph of the right column of page 65. The source text said, "At present, shovel-shaped incisors have been highly regarded as a racial diagnostic characteristic by many anthropologists (Moorrees, '57)." The inclusion of "(Moorrees, '57)" in the source text indicates that this claim in Suzuki &amp; Sakai (1964) was cited to Moorrees (1957).--&gt;&lt;ref name="SuzukiSakai"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suzuki M, Sakai T | title = Shovel-shaped incisors among the living Polynesians | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–71 | date = March 1964 | pmid = 14218893 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330220117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of shovel-shaped incisors, among many dental characteristics, is utilized in [[forensic dentistry]] to identify an individual’s ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pretty IA, Sweet D | title = A look at forensic dentistry--Part 1: The role of teeth in the determination of human identity | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 190 | issue = 7 | pages = 359–66 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11338039 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.4800972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, this trait occurs predominantly in Asian and Native American populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jodi|first=Blumenfeld | name-list-format = vanc |date=2000|title=Racial Identification in the Skull and Teeth|url=https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/totem/vol8/iss1/4|journal=Totem: The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology |volume=8|issue=1 | pages = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been republished several times and is much more common than the later volumes of the series. 

The contents include 
*Chapter I: sets
*Chapter II Real numbers
*Chapter III [[Metric space]]s
*Chapter IV The real line
*Chapter V [[Normed space]]s
*Chapter VI [[Hilbert space]]s
*Chapter VII Spaces of continuous functions
*Chapter VIII [[Differential calculus]] (This uses the Cauchy integral rather than the more common [[Riemann integral]] of functions.)
*Chapter IX [[Analytic function]]s (of a complex variable)
*Chapter X Existence theorems (for [[ordinary differential equation]]s)
*Chapter XI Elementary [[spectral theory]]

'''Visual geography''' is the study of [[geography]] as represented in paintings, photos and other forms of the [[visual arts]]. Both [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]] in the visual arts are studied. Typical studies in Visual Geography include the [[geographical]] symbols within visual arts. Another is cross referencing the date a piece of visual art was produced with known weather records to see if the art was drawn accurately in the field or from memory in a studio.
