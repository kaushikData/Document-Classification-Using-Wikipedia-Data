'''AKPD Message and Media''' is an [[United States|American]] [[political consulting|political]] and [[media consulting|media]] [[management consulting|consulting firm]] catering to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates and related causes. Formerly Axelrod and Associates, it is named after its four original partners: [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], John Kupper, [[David Plouffe]], and John Del Cecato. All four were members of [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], with Plouffe serving as [[campaign manager]], Axelrod as senior strategist, and Del Cecato as media advisor.

'''Abu Muhammad Abd al-Jamil bin Abd al-Haqq bin Abd al-Wahid bin Muhammad bin al-Hashim bin Bilal al-Hashimi al-Umari al-Adawi''', better known as '''Abu Turab al-Zahiri''', was a renowned [[Islamic scholar]] and journalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reocities.com/wallstreet/1612/ARG/Shaikh.html The Greatest Islamic Scholar of the Century] at [[Reocities]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdur-Rahman al-Mu'allimee al-Yamani]], Introduction to [[Ibn Makula]]'s ''al-Ikmal'', vol. 1, pg. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his roots were Arabic, he was often referred to as the [[Sibawayh]] of his era due to his knowledge of the [[Arabic language]] despite his upbringing in a non-Arab country.&lt;ref&gt;''Abu Turab al-Zahiri...Sibawayh of the Era''. [[Al Jazirah (newspaper)|Al Jazirah]], Monday, 27 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Zahiri was born in 1923 in what was then the [[British Raj]],&lt;ref name=awsat&gt;''Departure of the Saudi Journalist and Scholar, Abu Turab al-Zahiri''. [[Asharq Al-Awsat]], Iss. #8560, Monday, May 6, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; to a family of [[Arab]] descent. Through their family tree, Zahiri's parents could trace their original roots back to [[Umar]], the second [[caliph]] of [[Islam]] and of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], and thus the [[Banu Adi]] clan of the [[Quraysh tribe]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction of ʻAbd al-Karīm ibn ʻAbd Allāh ʻAbd al-Karīm to ''Abū Turāb al-Ẓāhirī, 1343-1423 H/1923-2002 M : ṣafaḥāt min ḥayātih-- wa-taʼammulāt fī adabih''. [[Riyadh]]: Maktabat al-Malik Fahd al-Waṭanīyah, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahiri traveled extensively in pursuit of Islamic manuscripts, which he often copied by hand due to lack of resources. During his younger years, he visited [[Western Europe]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. He eventually ended up in [[Egypt]], where he earned his master's and doctoral degrees at [[Al-Azhar University]],&lt;ref name=awsat/&gt; and was also a student of fellow [[Hadith]] specialist [[Ahmad Muhammad Shakir]]. Later, Zahiri settled down in [[Saudi Arabia]] at the behest of first [[King of Saudi Arabia]] [[Ibn Saud]], who requested that Zahiri teach Muslim theology in [[Mecca]]'s [[Masjid al-Haram]], the holiest site in Islam.&lt;ref name=awsat/&gt; Zahiri's best known student was [[Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri]], who shared Zahiri's pen name due to their adherence to the [[Zahiri]]te [[Madhhab|school]] of [[Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.al-madina.com/node/198204 Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri: The Zahiri school was the fourth school before the Hanbalis existed]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[Al Madina (newspaper)|Al Madina]], Iss. #17340. 14 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Zahiri also had a friendship with fellow foreigner in Saudi Arabia, [[Abdallah Bin Bayyah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130221225706/http://www.binbayyah.net/portal/saidabout/321 About the Sheikh: from Sheikh Abu Turab al-Zahiri] at the official website of Abdallah Bin Bayyah.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahiri died on Saturday morning, the 21st of [[Safar]] in 1423 [[Hijri]],&lt;ref name=awsat/&gt; corresponding to May 4, 2002 [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicfinder.org/dateConversion.php?mode=hij-ger&amp;day=21&amp;month=2&amp;year=1423&amp;date_result=1 Gregorian-Hijri Dates Converter] at Islamic Finder.&lt;/ref&gt; While in his [[private library]], Zahiri complained of [[paralysis]] in his feet to an aide. Prevented from pronouncing the [[Shahada|Muslim testimony of faith]] due to [[aphasia]], Zahiri died on his bed pointing toward the sky instead. He was buried in Mecca's historic [[Jannatul Mualla]] cemetery the next morning.

==Works==
Zahiri authored roughly fifty published works. Although he was fluent in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] and conversational in multiple [[Languages of India]], most of his written work was in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

'''American [[prison literature]]''' is literature written by Americans who are incarcerated. It is a distinct literary phenomenon which is increasingly studied as such by academics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfp.english.upenn.edu/archive/2003-07/0107.html Call for Papers: American Prison Writing]. 2004 National PCA/ACA Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Arnold Erickson:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Prison has been a fertile setting for artists, musicians, and writers alike. Prisoners have produced hundreds of works that have encompassed a wide range of literature. [...] Books describing the prison experience, including the Autobiography of Malcolm X, inspired an audience far outside the prison walls. The importance of these works have been recognized in this country's highest courts. See Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. New York State Crime Victim's Compensation Board, 502 U.S. 105, 121-122 (1991)(citing works by prisoners).&lt;ref&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/lawrev.html Review of] H. Bruce Franklin, ed., ''Prison Writing in 20th Century America''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Overview ==
The emergence of prison writing relied on convicts with the necessary writing skills to tell their stories from the inside. Early writings came from prisoners who had already begun to publish before being arrested. Among these early-20th-century writers was [[Jack London]], who in 1894 spent a month in New York State's Erie County Penitentiary. This transformative experience informed much of his writing.

=== Early 20th century ===
Prison writing has often been seen as an act of political resistance. In the first two decades of the 20th century, the prisoners who were published were primarily social activists. Socialist writer [[Kate Richards O'Hare]], spent a year in prison (1919–1920), causing her to dedicate her life to exposing the horrors of prison conditions and the economic structure by which they were supported. Anarchist activists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] also wrote while imprisoned, deepening their philosophical convictions and influencing people worldwide.

One of the most widely read early accounts of prison life in the 20th century was ''My Life in Prison'' (1912), by [[Donald Lowrie]]. The book inspired [[Thomas Mott Osborne]], who later became warden at [[Sing Sing]], to dedicate his career to prison reform. In 1924, after World War I, [[H.L. Mencken]] founded the ''[[American Mercury]]'' magazine and regularly published convict authors.

At the onset of the Great Depression, authorities began to perceive prison writing as more of a threat to American society. Manuscripts were potentially profitable subversive tools, and therefore all writing was suppressed.

In 1932, [[Robert E. Burns]] published his memoir ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang]]'', which was subsequently made into the movie ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]''. As a prison escapee, he wrote to expose the realities of prison slavery. During this time, the entire population felt the effects of poverty, crime, and hardship, making more people receptive to prison narratives.

[[Chester Himes]] began writing after going to prison for armed robbery. He reported: "When I could see the end of my time inside I bought myself a typewriter and taught myself to touch type. I'd been reading stories by Dashiell Hammett in ''Black Mask'' and I thought I could do them just as well. When my stories finally appeared, the other convicts thought exactly the same thing. There was nothing to it. All you had to do was tell it like it is."&lt;ref&gt;John M. Reilly, ed., ''Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another writer to emerge during the 1930s was [[Nelson Algren]], whose short story "El Presidente de Mejico" explored his experience in a Texas jail.

=== Post-WWII ===
The ''[[Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'', published in 1965, was the first full-length memoir of an African-American convict. Co-written by [[Alex Haley]], the book was published the same year that X was assassinated. Prisoners and ex-prisoners began using the printed word to participate in revolutionary activities.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Among those influenced by Malcolm X were [[Eldridge Cleaver]], [[Iceberg Slim]], [[Piri Thomas]], and [[Jack Henry Abbott]].

Prison writing's literary renaissance coincided with social and political unrest of the 1960s and 1970s. There was tremendous support for incarcerated writers, since they represented an important front of the culture war. [[Urban riots|Inner city riots]] and prison riots exemplified the volatile emotional state of the entire population. The 1971 escape attempt by a San Quentin inmate and author, [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] (Soledad Brother), ended in bloodshed. Another activist author, [[Angela Davis]], was implicated in the event because a gun was used that was registered in her name. Jackson's shooting lead to a mass [[hunger strike]] at New York's [[Attica Prison]]. The strike eventually lead to a prisoner uprising and a subsequent police assault leaving 128 wounded and 39 dead, 10 of them hostages.

By the late 1970s, prison writing was being published extensively in "mass-market paperbacks, newspapers, magazines, major motion pictures." &lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 1998, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and 1990s, however, there was something of a backlash. New York State led the legislative attack against prison writing. In 1977, the [[Son of Sam law|"Son of Sam" law]] made it illegal for convict authors to collect money from the writings. Some claim that "[a]lthough ostensibly designed to 'protect the victim' and to keep criminals from profiting from their crimes, the real purpose of these laws was identical to the purpose of the repression of prison literature in the 1930s: to keep the American people in the dark about the American prison."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 1998, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bell Gale Chevigny (1999), prison writing began to go out of fashion in the 1980s. One event triggering this reaction was the 1981 publication of the letters that [[Jack Henry Abbott]] wrote from prison to [[Norman Mailer]]. This enormously popular publication, entitled ''[[In the Belly of the Beast]]'', documented the rage Abbott had cultivated in his years of incarceration. Within six weeks of his release from prison, Abbott killed a man during a fight.

One of the few institutions that still continues to support prison writing is the [[PEN American Center]].

== PEN American Center Prison Writing Program ==
PEN American Center (Poets, Playwrights, Essayists, Editors and Novelists) is a national chapter of an international association of writers working towards peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/152 |title=PEN American Center - Prison Writing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505021318/http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/152 |archive-date=2007-05-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center established its Prison Writing Program in 1971, when PEN president Tom Fleming began lobbying for educational opportunities for prisoners. These efforts resulted in reduced censorship, better access to typewriters, classes, and improved prison libraries.

In 1973, PEN began its annual prison writing contest. Though it had some very difficult years in the 1980s, the contest has taken place every year since its inception. The Prison Writing Program continues to provide mentoring opportunities and to publish information concerning prison writing, as well as anthologizing contest winners.

'''Andrew Exum''' is an American scholar of the [[Middle East]], a former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer.&lt;ref name=CNAS/&gt; He was a part of General [[Stanley McChrystal]]'s review of the American strategy in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonindependent.com/53205/gen-mcchrystals-freaked-out-advisers Washington Independent on Stanley McChrystal's advisors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017035115/http://washingtonindependent.com/53205/gen-mcchrystals-freaked-out-advisers |date=October 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
After graduating from [[The McCallie School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] (1996) and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (2000), where he was a columnist for the ''[[Daily Pennsylvanian]],'' a member of Sigma Nu fraternity, and a member of the [[Sphinx Senior Society]], Exum, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, led a platoon of light infantry in Afghanistan following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and subsequently led a platoon of [[United States Army Rangers|Army Rangers]] as a part of special operations task forces in [[Kuwait]] and [[Afghanistan]] with the rank of Captain. He was commissioned as an officer through the University of Pennsylvania's [[Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Army ROTC]] program, which he initially joined as a means of financing his education there. He graduated in 2000 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Classics]] and English Literature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/02/opinion/for-some-soldiers-the-war-never-ends-815578.html For Some Soldiers The War Never Ends - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a veteran of [[Operation Anaconda]]. He earned a master's degree in Middle Eastern Studies at the [[American University of Beirut]].  In 2006-2007, Exum was a Soref fellow at the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]].  He was awarded a doctorate from the Department of War Studies, [[King's College London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/members/andrew_exum/ » Andrew Exum Middle East Strategy at Harvard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blake Hounshell]] of [[Foreign Policy]] calls Exum, “one of the sharpest Middle East analysts around.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/node/6340 What you need to know about Lebanon's latest car bomb | FP Passport&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While still on active duty, but “laid up with a non-combat knee injury,” Exum wrote his first book, ''This Man's Army: A Soldier's Story from the Front Lines of the War on Terrorism.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0704/exuminterview.html Gazette | Interview: Andrew Exum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0406/05/cnnitm.00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2008, Exum revealed himself to be the founder of the blog ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20100724042629/http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama Abu Muqawama]'' (Arabic,      أبوالمقاومة  for "father or expert of the Resistance"). This blog, "dedicated to following issues related to contemporary insurgencies," was followed by many notable students and practitioners of counterinsurgency in the military, academia and the media. It has also been referred to as [[Small Wars Journal]]'s "rogue cousin" partially due to the large overlap in topics and participants, and due to its ability to initiate discussion about topics that are not yet appropriate for the more professional forum.  At the time of the revelation, Exum also announced he was leaving the blog to pursue his research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abumuqawama.blogspot.com/2008/05/thank-you-and-goodbye.html abu muqawama: Thank You, and Goodbye&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2008/05/thank-you-and-goodbye.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128221519/http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2008/05/thank-you-and-goodbye.html |archivedate=2010-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exum has criticized several strategic elements of the War on Terror. In particular, he is critical of the U.S. government's reliance on [[Private military company|private military corporations]] in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as what he sees as the misuse of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] in eliminating terror targets.

'''Bhagwanpura''', also known as '''Bhagpura''', is a village in [[Thanesar]] sub-district of [[Kurukshetra district]], Haryana, India.&lt;ref name="2011 Census"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bhagwanpur |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/pca/SearchDetails.aspx?Id=65485 |website=[[2011 Census of India]] |publisher=[[Government of India]] |accessdate=12 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/Cs4Bw |archivedate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an archaeological site that lies on the bank of Hakra Ghaggar channel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyclopaedia.de/wiki/Ghaggar_River&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Bhagwanpura-40703.htm India9]&lt;/ref&gt; Situated 24&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Kurukshetra]], the site is notable for showing an overlap between the [[Cemetery H culture|late Harappan]] and [[Painted Grey Ware]] cultures. Painted Grey Ware is generally associated with the [[Vedic period|Vedic people]], so this area can be said as the junction of two great civilizations of India.

An archaeological museum at [[Sheikh Chilli's Tomb]] complex in [[Thanesar]] established by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] consists of archaeological finds like a humped bull-shaped [[carnelian]] pendant, terracotta beads and semi-precious stones from sites in Bhagwanpura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Archaeological Museum, Thanesar|publisher= Archaeological Survey of India| url = http://asi.nic.in/asi_museums_thanesar.asp | accessdate = 2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Bhagwanpura shows one period of habitation, with two sub-periods:&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Joshi (1993), ''Excavation at Bhagwanpura 1975 - 76 : and other explorations &amp; excavations 1975 - 81 in Haryana, Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Punjab''. Archaeological Survey of India&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sub-period IA: late Harappan culture (''c.'' 1700&amp;ndash;1300 BCE)
*Sub-period IB: overlap between late Harappan and PGW culture (''c.'' 1400&amp;ndash;1000 BCE)

During sub-period IA, the late Harappan people lived in houses of burnt brick and built mud platforms to protect against flooding. During sub-period IB, the late Harappan pottery continued, but a new form of pottery (the PGW) was introduced. Initially, the PGW people lived in thatched [[wattle-and-daub]] huts, but later they began to build mud-walled houses. One large house had thirteen rooms and a courtyard, and may have belonged to a chief. Towards the end of sub-period IB, the PGW people began to use burnt bricks, but no complete structures have been found. During both phases, cattle, sheep, and pig were domesticated, but horse bones have only been found in sub-period IB. Six oval structures from this sub-period may have had some ritualistic use.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that the burnt bricks (square, rectangular, and wedge-shaped) from sub-period IB were not in fact used for building houses, but for the construction of [[Vedic fire altar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Kenoyer (2006), "Cultures and Societies of the Indus Tradition. In Historical Roots" in ''the Making of ‘the Aryan’'', R. Thapar (ed.), pp. 21&amp;ndash;49. New Delhi, National Book Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commesso also known as Florentine Commesso''', also referred to as '''Florentine mosaic''', is a method of piecing together cut sections of luminous, narrow [[gemstones]] to form works of art.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica#1994–present|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1998). Art – [https://www.britannica.com/art/commesso "Commesso"]. [[Encyclopaedia Britannica, inc.]] Accessed March 03, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Precise patterns are cut into a slab of (generally black) [[marble]]. Gems are then cautiously cut and meticulously inlaid  into these patterns. The work is then [[Polishing|polished]] section by section, as it cannot be polished as a whole due to gems having different hardnesses.&lt;ref name="COUA"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=[[Cyclopaedia of Useful Arts: Mechanical and Chemical, Manufactures, Mining and Engineering|Cyclopaedia of Useful Arts: &lt;small&gt;Mechanical and Chemical, Manufactures, Mining and Engineering&lt;/small&gt;]] | title=Mosaic | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZU9AQAAMAAJ | editor=Tomlinson, Charles | publisher=[[J. S. Virtue]] | location=London and New York | year=1862 | volume=2; Hammer to Zirconium. | at=pp. 304–305; Florentine mosaic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The assembly between each pieces is made using glue made with a mixture of virgin wax and colophony. The Master personally follow the whole creative process and all mosaics are completely produced in the laboratory

The practice, which began in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], Italy, dates back to at least the 14th century and gained  prominence just before the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica" /&gt; Some of its uses include making pictures and decorating furniture and architecture. '''It is know all over the world for its excellence and old tradition and it is still alive today and kept alive from Tuscany masters, with the magnificent and magical atmosphere in their ancient “botteghe”.'''

'''"Commesso is something you will love and admire each day for a life, something that is perfect now and will be perfect forever because stones never change"'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commessofiorentino.com|title=CommessoFiorentino.com|last=Guido|first=Bedarida|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Silence Day (disambiguation)}}

In the United States, the '''Day of Silence''' is the [[GLSEN]]'s annual day of action to spread awareness about the effects of the [[Gay bullying|bullying and harassment]] of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], queer, and questioning ([[LGBTQ]]) students. Students take a day-long [[vow of silence]] to symbolically represent the silencing of LGBTQ students.

The Day of Silence has been held each year in April since 1996. From 2011 to 2017, the Day of Silence was held on the third Friday in April except for April 11, 2014; in 2018 it was observed on Friday, April 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glsen.org/participate/programs/day-of-silence|title=Day of Silence (April 27, 2018)|website=GLSEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Day of Silence is organized by the GLSEN.
Students are encouraged to obtain permission from their school before organizing the event.

GLSEN states that hundreds of thousands of students at more than 8,000 schools participated in the 2008 Day of Silence.&lt;ref name=glsenfaq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glsen.org/dayofsilence|title=Day of Silence|publisher=|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Created by then-student Maria Pulzetti, the first event was organized by students at [[University of Virginia]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/washington/news.aspx?id=87161 |title=Day of Silence takes on a political tone |last=Riley |first=John |publisher=Medill Reports |date=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulzetti explained: "I wanted to do something for BGLAD week that would impact many people at the school and that would be very visible...I knew that if we held panel discussions and events like that, the only people who would come would be the people who already were fairly aware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/day-silence-fights-school-bullying |publisher=[[The Nation]] |last=Ashenfelter |first=Morgan |date=2010-04-14 |title=Day of Silence Fights School Bullying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Day of Silence went national, with almost 100 colleges and universities participating.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dayofsilence.org/faqs/|title=FAQs|website=www.dayofsilence.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Pulzetti's classmates Jessie Gilliam and Chloe Palenchar, and [[GLSEN]] National Student Organizer Chris Tuttle, developed the proposal for the day to become an official project of GLSEN. GLSEN developed its first-ever "student leadership team" as part of the Day of Silence.

In 2008, the Day of Silence was held in memory of [[Murder of Larry King|Lawrence "Larry" King]], an eighth grader from E.O. Green Middle School who was shot by classmate Brandon McInerney.&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dayofsilence.org/content/news.html|title=12th Annual National Day of Silence Honors the Memory of Slain Lawrence King|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121121152/http://www.dayofsilence.org./content/news.html|archivedate=2008-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last several years, over 10,000 participants have registered their participation with GLSEN each year. These participants attend middle schools, high schools, colleges, and universities. They include students from all 50 states in the U.S.A. as well as students from around the world, including New Zealand, Singapore, and Russia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Opposition==

In 2005, the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] began sponsoring a yearly counter-protest called the [[Day of Dialogue|Day of Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Day of Silence|publisher= Snopes.com| date= 2008-03-20|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/sexuality/silence.asp|accessdate= 2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Events like these actually end up promoting homosexuality in public schools, and that actually creates a hostile climate for students of faith," said Candi Cushman, an education analyst for [[Focus on the Family]].&lt;ref name=DayOfTruth&gt;{{cite news|last= Swanson|first= Perry|title= Christians Plan a 'Day of Truth'|publisher= The Gazette| date= 2008-04-24|url= http://www.gazette.com/articles/plan_35647___article.html/truth_christians.html|accessdate= 2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A card carried by participants in the Day of Truth reads: "true tolerance means that people with differing&amp;mdash;even opposing&amp;mdash;viewpoints can freely exchange ideas and respectfully listen to each other. It's time for an honest conversation about homosexuality. There's freedom to change if you want to. Let's talk."&lt;ref name=DayOfTruth/&gt;

Other [[social conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] organizations, including the [[American Family Association]], [[Concerned Women for America]], [[Mission America (Columbus, Ohio)|Mission America]], [[Traditional Values Coalition]], Americans for Truth, and [[Liberty Counsel]], opposed the Day of Silence in 2008 by forming a coalition urging parents to keep their kids home on the DOS if students at their school were observing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Birkey|first= Andy|title= 2008 Day of Silence Honors Slain Gay Student|publisher= Minnesota Independent|date= 2008-04-24|url= http://minnesotaindependent.com/3729/2008-day-of-silence-honors-slain-gay-student|accessdate= 2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rev. [[Ken Hutcherson]], the principal supporter of those who skipped school, said, "We want education, not indoctrination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Thompson|first= Lynn|title= Mount Si's Gay-Rights Day of Silence is Far From Quiet|publisher= The Seattle Times| date= 2008-04-26|url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/eastsidenews/2004374870_dayofsilence26e.html|accessdate= 2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, in opposition to the Day of Silence, several students in Laingsburg High School in [[Laingsburg, Michigan]] wore T-shirts stating "[[Straight Pride]]" on the front side and bore a reference to {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|NASB}} on the back. That Bible verse refers to homosexual behaviour as an [[abomination (Bible)|abomination]] and prescribes death as the penalty for it. The same protest, which was organized on a [[Facebook]] group, also took place in the St. Johns and Bath school districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/37172/rural-high-school-students-create-straight-pride-stir |title=Rural high school students create ‘straight pride’ stir |author=Todd A. Heywood |publisher=Michigan Messenger |date=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315111013/http://michiganmessenger.com/37172/rural-high-school-students-create-straight-pride-stir |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2010, [[CNN]] reported that [[Exodus International]], which promotes "freedom from homosexuality through Jesus Christ", would not support the 2011 annual Day of Truth as the organization had done in 2010. President Alan Chambers stated, "All the recent attention to bullying helped us realize that we need to equip kids to live out biblical tolerance and grace while treating their neighbors as they'd like to be treated, whether they agree with them or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/06/christian-group-pulls-support-for-event-challenging-homosexuality/?hpt=T2|title=Christian Group Pull Support for Event Challenging Homosexuality | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Focus on the Family acquired the “Day of Truth” event and renamed it into the “Day of Dialogue”. As of 2012, the Day of Dialogue website stated: "Now it boasts a new name, while maintaining the same goal it’s always had since its founding — encouraging honest and respectful conversation among students about [[Christian God|God]]’s design for sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;Focus on the Family, "Day of Dialogue History," {{cite web |url=http://www.dayofdialogue.com/2011/02/03/history-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601155210/http://www.dayofdialogue.com/2011/02/03/history-2/ |archivedate=2011-06-01 |df= }} (accessed April 2, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dura-Europos synagogue''' (or "Dura Europas", "Dura Europos" etc.) was an ancient synagogue uncovered at [[Dura-Europos]], [[Syria]], in 1932. The last phase of construction was dated by an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscription to 244 [[Common Era|CE]], making it one of the oldest synagogues in the world. It was unique among the many ancient synagogues that have emerged from [[archaeological]] digs as the structure was preserved virtually intact, and it had extensive [[Figurative art|figurative]] wall-paintings, which came as a considerable surprise to scholars.  These paintings are now displayed in the [[National Museum of Damascus]].

Dura-Europos was a small garrison and trading city on the [[river Euphrates]], and usually on the frontier between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and finally the [[Sassanid Empire]]s of [[Persia]].  It changed hands at various points but was Roman from 165 CE.  Before the final Persian destruction of the town in 256-257 CE, parts of the synagogue which abutted the main city wall were apparently requisitioned and filled with sand as a defensive measure.  The city was abandoned after its fall and never resettled, and the lower walls of the rooms remained buried and largely intact until excavated. The excavations discovered also very important wall-paintings from places of worship of Christianity, at the [[Dura-Europos church]], and [[Mithraism]], and fragmentary Christian texts in [[Hebrew]].

In the [[Syrian Civil War]], the site was occupied by [[ISIL]], and what was left there appears to have been destroyed.

==Wall-paintings==
Because of the paintings adorning the walls, the synagogue was at first mistaken for a Greek temple, though this was quickly corrected by the vice-director of excavations [[Robert du Mesnil du Buisson]] in ''Les peintures de la synagogue de Doura-Europos'' (Rome, 1939). Mesnil also made detailed comparisons of the friezes from the Dura synagogue with those of the [[mithraeum]], the Christian baptistery, and the temple of the [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] gods.&lt;ref&gt;Guitty Azarpay ''Sogdian Painting: The Pictorial Epic in Oriental Art'' 1981 Page 147 "For a comparison of the arrangement of the friezes from the Dura synagogue and those of the mithraeum, the Christian baptistery and the temple of the Palmyrene gods, see Comte R. Du Mesnil du Buisson, Les peintures de la synagogue de ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The synagogue contains a forecourt and house of assembly with painted walls depicting people and animals, and a [[Torah]] shrine in the western wall facing [[Jerusalem]]. The paintings cover the walls of the main "Assembly Room", using three levels of pictures over a [[dado (architecture)|dado]] [[frieze]] of symbols in most places, reaching a height of about 7 metres.  The scenes depicted are drawn from the [[Hebrew Bible]] and include many narrative scenes, and some single figure "portraits"—58 scenes in total, probably representing about 60% of the original number.  They include the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' and other [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] stories, [[Moses]] receiving the [[Tablets of the Law]], Moses leading the [[Hebrews]] out of [[Egypt]], the visions of [[Ezekiel]], and many others.  The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] is used to represent divine intervention or approval in several paintings.  Scholars cannot agree on the subjects of some scenes, because of damage, or the lack of comparative examples.

Stylistically they are provincial versions of contemporary Graeco-Roman style and technique; several different artists seem to have worked on them. Technically they are not [[fresco]] (paint fused into wet plaster) but [[tempera]] over plaster. Earlier parts of the building have decorative painting with no figures. Some of the paintings have figures whose eyes have been scratched out, especially those in Persian costume.

Scholars think the paintings were used as an instructional display to educate and teach the history and laws of the religion. Some think that this synagogue was painted in order to compete with the many other religions practiced in Dura Europos; the new (and considerably smaller) Christian church ([[Dura-Europos church]]) appears to have opened shortly before the surviving paintings were begun in the synagogue.  The large-scale pictorial art in the synagogue came as a surprise to scholars, although they already suspected that there was a tradition of Jewish narrative religious art at this period, which had all been lost, leaving only traces in later Christian art.  The discovery of the synagogue helps to dispel narrow interpretations of Judaism's historical prohibition of visual images.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary aesthetics''' refers to [[evolutionary psychology]] theories in which the basic [[aesthetic]] preferences of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' are argued to have [[evolution|evolved]] in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

Based on this theory, things like color preference, preferred mate body ratios, shapes, emotional ties with objects, and many other aspects of the aesthetic experience can be explained with reference to human [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, H.M., Chen, K. H., &amp; Chou, G. J. 2011. 'Pleasurable elements in emotional design,' ''Designing Pleasurable Products and Interfaces.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aesthetics and evolutionary psychology ==
Many animal and human traits have been argued to have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success. [[Evolutionary psychology]] extends this to psychological traits including aesthetical preferences. Such traits are generally seen as being [[adaptation]]s to the environment during the [[Pleistocene era]] and are not necessarily adaptative in our present environment. Examples include disgust of potentially harmful spoiled foods; pleasure from sex and from eating sweet and fatty foods; and fear of spiders, snakes, and the dark.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. 'Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology' in "The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics". Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

All known cultures have some form of art. This universality suggests that art is related to evolutionary adaptations. The strong emotions associated with art suggest the same.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

== Landscape and other visual arts preferences ==
[[File:La Gran Sabana.jpg|thumb|San Rafael [[Gran Sabana]], [[Venezuela]].]]
An important choice for a mobile organism is selecting a good [[habitat]] to live in. Humans are argued to have strong aesthetical preferences for [[landscape]]s which were good habitats in the ancestral environment. When young human children from different nations are asked to select which landscape they prefer, from a selection of standardized landscape photographs, there is a strong preference for [[savanna]]s with trees. The East African savanna is the ancestral environment in which much of human evolution is argued to have taken place. There is also a preference for landscapes with water, with both open and wooded areas, with trees with branches at a suitable height for climbing and taking foods, with features encouraging exploration such as a path or river curving out of view, with seen or implied game animals, and with some clouds. These are all features that are often featured in calendar art and in the design of [[public park]]s.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

A survey of art preferences in many different nations found that realistic painting was preferred. Favorite features were water, trees as well as other plants, humans (in particular beautiful women, children, and well-known historical figures), and animals (in particular both wild and domestic large animals). Blue, followed by green, was the favorite color. Using the survey, the study authors constructed a painting showing the preferences of each nation. Despite the many different cultures, the paintings all showed a strong similarity to landscape calendar art. The authors argued that this similarity was in fact due to the influence of the Western calendar industry. Another explanation is that these features are those evolutionary psychology predicts should be popular for evolutionary reasons.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

== Physical attractiveness ==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}
{{See also|Fluctuating asymmetry}}
Various evolutionary concerns have been argued to influence what is perceived to be physically attractive.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Bjorn. 2006. 'The Rules of Attraction in the Game of Love,' "Live Science.""&lt;/ref&gt;

Such evolutionary based preferences are not necessarily static but may vary depending on environmental cues. Thus, availability of food influences which female body size is attractive which may have evolutionary reasons. Societies with food scarcities prefer larger female body size than societies having plenty of food. In Western society males who are hungry prefer a larger female body size than they do when not hungry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nettle | first1 = D. | title = Ecological influences on human behavioural diversity: A review of recent findings | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2009.05.013 | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 11 | pages = 618–24| year = 2009 | pmid =  19683831| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary musicology ==
{{Main|Evolutionary musicology}}

Evolutionary musicology is a subfield of [[biomusicology]] that grounds the psychological mechanisms of [[music perception]] and [[music production (music psychology)|production]] in [[evolutionary theory]]. It covers [[Animal communication|vocal communication]] in non-human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross-cultural human universals in musical ability and processing. It also includes evolutionary explanations for what is considered aesthetically pleasing or not.

== Darwinian literary studies ==
{{Main|Darwinian literary studies}}

Darwinian Literary Studies (aka Literary Darwinism) is a branch of [[literary criticism]] that studies [[literature]], including aesthetical aspects, in the context of evolution.{{Synthesis inline|date=August 2018}}

== Evolution of emotion ==
{{Main|Evolution of emotion}}
Aesthetics are tied to emotions. There are several explanations regarding the [[evolution of emotion]].{{Synthesis inline|date=August 2018}}

One example is the emotion [[disgust]] which has been argued to have evolved in order to avoid several harmful actions such as infectious diseases due to contact with spoiled foods, feces, and decaying bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tybur | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Lieberman | first2 = D. | last3 = Griskevicius | first3 = V. | doi = 10.1037/a0015474 | title = Microbes, mating, and morality: Individual differences in three functional domains of disgust | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–122 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19586243| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexy son hypothesis, handicap principle, and arts ==
[[File:Peacock Wooing Peahen.jpg|thumb|alt=|A male [[peacock]] does its best to court a female, dancing and displaying its extravagant plumage.]]

The [[sexy son hypothesis]] suggests that a [[female]] optimal choice among potential [[Mating|mate]]s is a male whose genes will produce male [[offspring]] with the best chance of [[reproductive success]] by having trait(s) being attractive to other females. Sometimes the trait may have no reproductive benefit in itself, apart from attracting females, because of [[Fisherian runaway]]. The peacock's tail may be one example. It has also been seen as an example of the [[handicap principle]].

It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what is needed for survival on the savanna. One explanation could be that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the equivalent of the peacock's tail for humans. According to this theory superior execution of art was important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"/&gt;

}}

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses a [[breve]], {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;̆&amp;nbsp;]}}, to indicate a speech sound (usually a [[vowel]]) with '''less than normal''' or '''extra short''' duration. That is, {{IPA|[ă]}} is a very short vowel with the quality of {{IPA|[a]}}.

An example from English is the short [[schwa]] of the word ''police'' {{IPA|[pʰə̆ˈliˑs]}}. This is typical of [[vowel reduction]].

Before 1989, the breve was used for a [[Semi-vowel|non-syllabic vowel]] (that is, part of a [[diphthong]]), which is now indicated by an {{em|inverted}} breve placed under the vowel letter, as in ''eye'' {{IPA|[aɪ̯]}}. It is also sometimes used for [[flap consonant]]s which do not have dedicated symbols in the IPA, since a flap is in effect a very brief [[stop consonant|stop]].

The anonymous '''''Historia Compostelana''''' is based on the relation of events by a writer in the immediate circle of [[Diego Gelmírez]],&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Biggs, ''Diego Gelmírez: first archbishop of Compostela'' Catholic Universities of America Press), 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; second bishop (1100–1120) then first archbishop (1120&amp;ndash;1140) of [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]], one of the major figures of the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].&lt;ref&gt;B.F. Reilly, "The Historia Compostelana: The Genesis and Composition of a Twelfth-Century Spanish Gesta" ''Speculum: A Journal of Mediaeval Studies'', 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative of the ''Historia Compostelana'' spans the years 1100 &amp;ndash; 1139, the years of Gelmírez' tenure, in three books. Its twofold central agenda is to extol the Archbishop's doings, while establishing the foundation and rights of Santiago de Compostela, including its founding legend, which provided apostolic connections with [[Saint James the Great]]. The bishopric had been transferred from [[Iria Flavia]] to Compostela as recently as 1095.

From a Galician perspective the ''Historia'' recounts the reigns of the contemporary sovereigns of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]: [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] (until 1109), [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]] (1109&amp;ndash;1126) and [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] (from 1126). "A very complex work of multiple authorship, it must be used with care, for it is essentially an episcopal gesta of Diego Gelmírez, bishop and then [[archbishop of Santiago de Compostela]], and very partisan in its commentary," is the assessment of the major historian of this period, Bernard F. Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/urraca/preface.htm Bernard F. Reilly, "The Kingdom of León-Castilla under Queen Urraca"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of Hispanic [[historiography]] in [[Latin (language)|Latin]] it is unique for narrating contemporary events, utilizing documents inserted in the text, giving it great historical value. 

Its title in Latin is ''De rebus gestis D. Didaci Gelmirez, primi Compostellani Archiepiscopi'' but it has been known simply as the ''Historia Compostelana'' since the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript transmission: B.F. Reilly, "Existing Manuscripts of the Historia Compostelana: Notes toward a Critical Edition," ''Manuscripta'', '''15''' (1971), 131-152; D. MacKenzie, "A Manuscript of the

'''Interactional linguistics''' is an interdisciplinary approach to [[grammar]] and [[Interactivity|interaction]] in the fields of [[linguistics]], the [[sociology of language]], and [[anthropology]]. [[Paul Hopper]] originally  proposed '''emergent grammar''' as a [[functional theories of grammar|functional]] approach to the study of [[syntax]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://home.eserver.org/hopper/emergence.html |last=Hopper |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Hopper |year=1987 |title=Emergent Grammar |journal=Berkeley Linguistics Society |volume=13 |pages=139–157 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918233214/http://home.eserver.org/hopper/emergence.html |archivedate=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later work expanded to include approaches to [[phonology]] and other aspects of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Couper-Kuhlen |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Selting |first2=Margaret |year=1996 |title=Prosody in Conversation: Interactional Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergent grammar postulates that rules of grammar emerge as language is used. This is contrary to the ''a priori grammar postulate'', the idea that grammar rules exist in the mind before the production of utterances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopper|first=Paul|year=1988|chapter=Emergent Grammar and the A Priori Grammar Postulate|title=Linguistics in Context|editor=Deborah Tannen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the principles of [[generative grammar]] and the concept of [[Universal Grammar]], interactional linguistics asserts that grammar emerges from interactions among language users.&lt;ref name="Su"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Su|first=Danjie|year=2016|url=http://dis.sagepub.com/content/18/3/330.full.pdf+html |title=Grammar emerges through reuse and modification of prior utterances|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=18|issue=3|pages=330-353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Universal Grammar claims that features of grammar are innate,&lt;ref name="hornstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hornstein|first1=Norbert|first2=Jairo |last2=Nunes|first3=Kleanthes K. |last3=Grohmann |year=2005|title=Understanding Minimalism|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; emergent grammar and other interactional theories claim that the human language faculty has no innate grammar and that features of grammar are learned through experience and social interaction.&lt;ref name="Su" /&gt;

Interactional linguistics has developed in linguistic [[discourse analysis]] and [[conversation analysis]], and is used to investigate the relationship between grammatical structure and real-time interaction and language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fox | first=Barbara | title=Principles shaping grammatical practices: an exploration | journal=Discourse Studies | year=2007 | url=http://dis.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/3/299 | accessdate=2008-10-16 | volume=9 | pages=299 | doi=10.1177/1461445607076201 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in interactional linguistics draw from functional linguistics, conversation analysis, and [[linguistic anthropology]] in order to describe "the way in which language figures in everyday interaction and cognition."&lt;ref name=OST1996&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ochs|first1=Elinor|last2=Schegloff |first2=Emanuel |last3=Thompson |first3=Sandra |year=1996 |title=Interaction and Grammar |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in interactional linguistics view linguistic forms, including syntactic and prosodic structures, as greatly affected by interactions among participants in speech, [[Sign language|signing]], or other language use. The field contrasts with dominant approaches to linguistics during the twentieth century, which tended to focus either on the form of language per se, or on theories of individual language user's [[linguistic competence]].&lt;ref name=CKS2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Couper-Kuhlen |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Selting |first2=Margaret |year=2001 |title=Studies in Interactional Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''John Langshaw Austin''' (26 March 1911 – 8 February 1960) was a British [[philosophy of language|philosopher of language]] and leading proponent of [[ordinary language philosophy]], perhaps best known for developing the theory of [[speech acts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[G. J. Warnock|Warnock, G. J.]] "John Langshaw Austin, a biographical sketch". ''Symposium on J. L. Austin'', ed. K.T. Fann. New York: Humanities Press, 1969. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin pointed out that we use language to ''do'' things as well as to ''assert'' things, and that the utterance of a statement like "I promise to do so-and-so" is best understood as ''doing'' something —  ''making a promise'' —  rather than making an assertion about anything. Hence the name of one of his best-known works ''How to Do Things with Words''. Austin, in providing his theory of speech acts, makes a significant challenge to the philosophy of language, far beyond merely elucidating a class of morphological sentence forms that function to do what they name. Austin's work ultimately suggests that all speech and all utterance is the doing of something with words and signs, challenging a metaphysics of language that would posit denotative, propositional assertion as the essence of language and meaning.

==Life==
Austin was born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], England, the second son of Geoffrey Langshaw Austin (1884–1971), an architect, and his wife Mary Hutton Bowes-Wilson (1883–1948; ''née'' Wilson). In 1921 the family moved to Scotland, where Austin's father became the secretary of [[St Leonards School]], [[St Andrews]]. Austin was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] in 1924, earning a scholarship in Classics, and went on to study Classics at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1929.

In 1933, he received a First in [[Literae Humaniores]] (Classics and Philosophy) as well as the [[Gaisford Prize]] for Greek prose and first class honours in his finals. Literae Humaniores introduced him to serious philosophy and gave him a lifelong interest in [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=hacker&gt;Hacker, P. M. S. 'Austin, John Langshaw (1911–1960)', in [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30505 online] (subscription site), accessed 16 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook his first teaching position in 1935, as fellow and tutor at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].

Austin's early interests included Aristotle, [[Kant]], [[Leibniz]], and [[Plato]] (especially the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''). His more contemporary influences included especially [[G. E. Moore]], [[John Cook Wilson]] and [[H. A. Prichard]]. The contemporary influences shaped their views about general philosophical questions on the basis of careful attention to the more specific judgements we make. They took our specific judgements to be more secure than more general judgements. It's plausible that some aspects of Austin's distinctive approach to philosophical questions derived from his engagement with the last three.&lt;ref&gt;Longworth, Guy. "John Langshaw Austin." Stanford University. Stanford University, 11 Dec. 2012. Web. 30 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] Austin served in the British Intelligence Corps. It has been said of him that, "he more than anybody was responsible for the life-saving accuracy of the D-Day intelligence" (reported in Warnock 1963: 9). Austin left the army with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] and was honored for his intelligence work with an OBE (Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]]), the French [[Croix de guerre]], and the U.S. Officer of the [[Legion of Merit]].&lt;ref name=hacker/&gt;&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-jl|title=John Langshaw Austin|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Austin became [[White's Chair of Moral Philosophy|White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], as a Professorial Fellow of Corpus Christi College. He began holding his famous "Austin's Saturday Mornings" where students and colleagues would discuss language usages (and sometimes books on language) over tea and crumpets, but published little.&lt;ref&gt;See John Passmore, ''A Hundred Years of Philosophy'' (New York: Basic Books, 1967) 459, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin visited [[Harvard]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] in the mid-fifties, in 1955 delivering the William James Lectures at Harvard that would become ''How to Do Things With Words'', and offering a seminar on excuses whose material would find its way into "A Plea for Excuses".&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', 1956-57. See Stanley Cavell, ''The Claim of Reason: Wittegenstein, Skepticism, Morality and Tragedy'' (New York: Oxford, 1979) xv.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that he met and befriended [[Noam Chomsky]]. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1956 to 1957.

Austin died at the age of 48 of [[lung cancer]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} At the time, he was developing a [[semantics|semantic theory]] based on [[sound symbolism]], using the [[Phonestheme#Identification|English gl-words]] as data.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Work==

===''How to Do Things with Words''{{anchor|How_to_Do_Things_With_Words}}===
''How to Do Things with Words'' (1955/1962) is perhaps Austin's most influential work. In contrast to the [[positivist]] view, he argues, sentences with [[truth-value]]s form only a small part of the range of utterances.

After introducing several kinds of sentences which he asserts are neither true nor false, he turns in particular to one of these kinds of sentences, which he calls ''[[performative utterance]]s'' or just "performatives". These he characterises by two features:

* Again, though they may take the form of a typical indicative sentence, performative sentences are not used to describe (or "constate") and are thus not true or false; they have no truth-value.
* Second, to utter one of these sentences in appropriate circumstances is not just to "say" something, but rather to perform a certain kind of action.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Austin, ''How to Do Things with Words'', Second Edition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975) 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

He goes on to say that when something goes wrong in connection with a performative utterance it is, as he puts it, "infelicitous", or "unhappy" rather than false.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Do Things with Words,'' 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Austin seems to have thought, controversially, that a performative utterance must be infelicitous if it occurs in a poem. [[Robert Maximilian de Gaynesford]] has argued that what Austin intends by his comments on poetry is better than is usually thought, but what he offers poets is considerably worse; see his 'The Seriousness of Poetry' ''Essays in Criticism'' 59, 2009, 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The action which is performed when a 'performative utterance' is issued belongs to what Austin later calls a ''[[speech act|speech-act]]'' &lt;ref&gt;J.L. Austin, How to Do Things With Words, Second Edition (1976, Oxford University Press). pp40&lt;/ref&gt; (more particularly, the kind of action Austin has in mind is what he subsequently terms the ''[[illocutionary act]]''). For example, if you say "I name this ship the ''Queen Elizabeth''," and the circumstances are appropriate in certain ways, then you will have done something special, namely, you will have performed the act of naming the ship. Other examples include: "I take this man as my lawfully wedded husband," used in the course of a marriage ceremony, or "I bequeath this watch to my brother," as occurring in a will. In all three cases the sentence is not being used to describe or state what one is 'doing', but being used to actually 'do' it.

After numerous attempts to find more characteristics of performatives, and after having met with many difficulties, Austin makes what he calls a "fresh start", in which he considers "more generally the senses in which to say something may be to do something, or in saying something we do something".

For example: John Smith turns to Sue Snub and says ‘Is Jeff’s shirt red?’, to which Sue replies ‘Yes’. John has produced a series of bodily movements which result in the production of a certain sound. Austin called such a performance a ''phonetic act'', and called the act a ''phone''. John’s utterance also conforms to the lexical and grammatical conventions of English—that is, John has produced an English sentence. Austin called this a ''[[phatic]] act'', and labels such utterances ''phemes''. John also referred to Jeff’s shirt, and to the colour red. To use a pheme with a more or less definite sense and reference is to utter a ''[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#Classes of signs|rheme]]'', and to perform a ''rhetic act''. Note that rhemes are a sub-class of phemes, which in turn are a sub-class of phones. One cannot perform a rheme without also performing a pheme and a phone. The performance of these three acts is the performance of a ''locution''—it is the act of saying something.

John has therefore performed a locutionary act. He has also done at least two other things. He has asked a question, and he has elicited an answer from Sue.

Asking a question is an example of what Austin called an ''[[illocutionary act]].'' Other examples would be making an assertion, giving an order, and promising to do something. To perform an illocutionary act is to use a locution with a certain force. It is an act performed ''in'' saying something, in contrast with a locution, the act ''of'' saying something.

Eliciting an answer is an example of what Austin calls a ''[[perlocutionary act]]'', an act performed ''by'' saying something. Notice that if one successfully performs a perlocution, one also succeeds in performing both an illocution and a locution.

In the theory of speech acts, attention has especially focused on the illocutionary act, much less on the locutionary and perlocutionary act, and only rarely on the subdivision of the locution into phone, pheme and rheme.

''How to Do Things With Words'' is based on lectures given at Oxford between 1951 and 1954, and then at Harvard in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes by J.L. Austin|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/austin/austin.html|publisher=Bodleian Library at Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performative utterance===

According to J. L. Austin, "[[performative utterance]]" refers to a not truth-valuable action of "performing", or "doing" a certain action. For example, when people say "I promise to do so and so", they are generating the action of making a promise. In this case, without any flaw (the promise is flawlessly fulfilled), the "performative utterance" is "happy", or to use J. L. Austin’s word, "felicitous"; if on the other hand, one fails to do what he or she promised, it can be "unhappy", or "infelicitous". Notice that performative utterance is not truth-valuable, which means nothing said can be judged based on truth or falsity. 
 
There are four types of performative s according to Austin: explicit, implicit, primitive, and in explicit. "How to Do Things With Words", edited by [[J. O. Urmson]] and Marina Bissau, records Austin's lectures on this topic. In this book,  Austin offers examples for each type of performative mentioned above. For explicit performative, he mentioned "I apologize", "I criticize" (Page 83), which are so explicit to receivers that it would not make sense for someone to ask "Does he really mean that?". In explicit performative are opposite, so the receiver will have understandable doubts. For primary performative, the example Austin gave is "I shall be there". Compared with explicit performative, there is uncertainty in implicit performative. People might ask if he or she is promising to be there with primary performative, however, this uncertainty is not strong enough as in explicit performative. Most examples given are explicit because it is easy to identify and observe, and identifying other performative requires comparison and contrast with explicit performative.&lt;ref&gt;Crimson, J.O, and Marina Bissau.

===''Sense and Sensibilia''===
{{main|Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)}}
In the posthumously published ''Sense and Sensibilia'' (the title is Austin's own, and wittily echoes the title of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', [[Jane Austen]]'s first book, just as his name echoes hers),&lt;ref&gt;Austin had lectured on the material of this book many times in Oxford from about 1947 to 1959, and once at the University of California at Berkeley. See Warnock's Foreword.&lt;/ref&gt; Austin criticizes the claims put forward by [[Alfred Jules Ayer|A. J. Ayer's]] ''The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge (1940)'', and to a lesser extent, H.H. Price’s Perception (1932) and G. J. Warnock’s Berkley (1953), concerning the [[Sense data|sense-data]] theory. He states that perceptual variation, which can be attributed to physical causes, does not involve a figurative disconnect between sense and reference, due to an unreasonable separation of parts from the perceived object. Central to his argument, he shows that "there is no one kind of thing that we ‘perceive’ but many different kinds, the number being reducible if at all by scientific investigation and not by philosophy" (Austin 1962a, 4).
 
Austin argues that Ayer fails to understand the proper function of such words as "illusion", "delusion", "hallucination", "looks", "appears" and "seems", and uses them instead in a "special way...invented by philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;''Sense and Sensibilia'', 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Austin, normally these words allow us to express reservations about our commitment to the truth of what we are saying, and that the introduction of sense-data adds nothing to our understanding of or ability to talk about what we see.
 
As an example, Austin examines the word ‘real’ and contrasts the ordinary meanings of that word based on everyday language and the ways it is used by sense-data theorists. In order to determine the meaning of ‘real’ we have to consider, case by case, the ways and contexts in which it is used. By observing that it is (i) a substantive-hungry word that is sometimes a (ii) adjuster-word,&lt;ref&gt;Sense and Sensibilia, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a   (iii) dimension-word &lt;ref&gt;Sense and Sensibilia, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iv) a word whose negative use "wears the trousers,"&lt;ref&gt;Sense and Sensibilia, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Austin highlights its complexities.  Only by doing so, according to Austin, can we avoid introducing false dichotomies.

===''Philosophical Papers''===
Austin's papers were collected and published posthumously as ''Philosophical Papers'' by [[J. O. Urmson]] and [[Geoffrey Warnock]]. The book originally contained ten papers, two more being added in the second edition and one in the third. His paper Excuses has had a massive impact on criminal law theory.

Chapters 1 and 3 study how a word may have different, but related, senses. Chapters 2 and 4 discuss the nature of knowledge, focusing on [[performative utterance]]. Chapters 5 and 6 study the [[correspondence theory]], where a statement is true when it corresponds to a fact. Chapters 6 and 10 concern the doctrine of [[speech acts]]. Chapters 8, 9, and 12 reflect on the problems that language encounters in discussing actions and considering the cases of excuses, accusations, and freedom.

==="Are there ''A Priori'' Concepts?"===
This early paper contains a broad criticism of [[Idealism]]. The question set dealing with the existence of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts is treated only indirectly, by dismissing the concept of ''concept'' that underpins it.

The first part of this paper takes the form of a reply to an argument for the existence of [[Universal (metaphysics)|Universals]]: from observing that we do use words such as "grey" or "circular" and that we use a single term in each case, it follows that there must be a ''something'' that is named by such terms—a universal. Furthermore, since each case of "grey" or "circular" is different, it follows that universals ''themselves'' cannot be sensed.

Austin carefully dismantles this argument, and in the process other [[transcendental arguments]]. He points out first that universals are not "something we stumble across", and that they are ''defined'' by their relation to particulars. He continues by pointing out that, from the observation that we use "grey" and "circular" as if they were the names of things, it simply ''does not follow'' that there is something that is named. In the process he dismisses the notion that "words are essentially proper names", asking "...why, if 'one identical' word is used, ''must'' there be 'one identical object' present which it denotes".

In the second part of the article, he generalizes this argument against universals to address [[concept]]s as a whole. He points out that it is "facile" to treat concepts as if they were "an article of property". Such questions as "Do we possess such-and-such a concept" and "how do we come to possess such-and-such a concept" are meaningless, because concepts are not the sort of thing that one possesses.

In the final part of the paper, Austin further extends the discussion to relations, presenting a series of arguments to reject the idea that there is some ''thing'' that is a relation. His argument likely [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the conjecture of his colleague, S. V. Tezlaf, who questioned what makes "this" "that".

==="The Meaning of a Word"===
''The Meaning of a Word'' is a polemic against doing [[philosophy]] by attempting to pin down the ''meaning'' of the words used, arguing that 'there is ''no'' simple and handy appendage of a word called "the meaning of the word (x)"'.

Austin warns us to take care when removing words from their ordinary usage, giving numerous examples of how this can lead to error.

==="Other Minds"===

In ''Other Minds'', one of his most highly acclaimed pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, ''ibid''., 463&lt;/ref&gt; Austin criticizes the method that philosophers have used since [[Descartes]] to analyze and verify statements of the form "That person S feels X." This method works from the following three assumptions:

*(1) We can know only if we intuit and directly feel what he feels.
*(2) It is impossible to do so.
*(3) It may be possible to find strong evidence for belief in our impressions.

Although Austin agrees with (2), quipping that "we should be in a pretty predicament if I did", he found (1) to be false and (3) to be therefore unnecessary. The background assumption to (1), Austin claims, is that if I say that I know X and later find out that X is false, I did not know it. Austin believes that this is not consistent with the way we actually use language. He claims that if I was in a position where I would normally say that I know X, if X should turn out to be false, I would be speechless rather than self-corrective. He gives an argument that this is so by suggesting that believing is to knowing as intending is to promising— knowing and promising are the speech-act versions of believing and intending respectively.

==="A Plea for Excuses"===
''A Plea for Excuses'' is both a demonstration by example, and a defense of the methods of [[ordinary language philosophy]], which proceeds on the conviction that:
"...our common stock of words embodies all the distinctions men have found worth drawing, and the connections they have found worth marking, in the lifetime of many generations: these surely are likely to be more numerous, more sound, since they have stood up to the long test of survival of the fittest, and more subtle, at least in all ordinary and reasonable practical matters, than any that you or I are likely to think up in our armchair of an afternoon—the most favourite alternative method."&lt;ref&gt;''A Plea for excuses'', in Austin, J. L., ''Philosophical Papers'', p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such a distinction Austin describes in a footnote is that between the phrases "by mistake" and "by accident". Although their uses are similar, Austin argues that with the right examples we can see that a distinction exists in when one or the other phrase is appropriate.

Austin proposes some curious philosophical tools. For instance, he uses a sort of word game for developing an understanding of a key concept. This involves taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. This process is iterated until the list of words begins to repeat, closing in a "family circle" of words relating to the key concept.

==Austin, Wittgenstein and Ryle==
Austin occupies a place in philosophy of language alongside the Cantabrigian [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and Austin's fellow Oxonian, [[Gilbert Ryle]], in staunchly advocating the examination of the way words are [[Ordinary language philosophy|ordinarily]] ''used'' in order to elucidate [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] and by this means avoid philosophical confusions. Unlike many ordinary language philosophers, however, Austin disavowed any overt indebtedness to Wittgenstein's later philosophy.&lt;ref name=hacker/&gt;

The '''Jew clause''' ({{lang-no|Jødeparagrafen}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stortinget.no%2Fno%2FStortinget-og-demokratiet%2FHistorikk%2FHistorisk-dokumentasjon%2FJodeparagrafen%2F&amp;edit-text=|title=A digital dissemination of documents to the history of the Jews Act, § 2, last passus, in the Norwegian Constitution of 17 May 1814.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the vernacular name of the second paragraph of the [[Constitution of Norway]] from 1814 to 1851. The clause, in its original form, banned [[Jews]] from entering [[Norway]], and also forbade [[Jesuits]] and monastic orders. An exception was made for so-called [[Portuguese Jews]]. The penultimate sentence of the same paragraph is known as the Jesuit clause ({{lang-no|Jesuittparagrafen}}).

The clause roughly translates as:

{{quote|The Evangelical-Lutheran religion is the state's public religion. The inhabitants who practice it are obliged to raise their children in the same. Jesuits and monastic orders may not be tolerated. Jews are excluded from access to the Kingdom.}}

[[Christian Magnus Falsen]], [[Georg Sverdrup]] and [[Nicolai Wergeland]] were the central delegates behind the wording of the section's final paragraph. The wording was adopted on May 4, 1814. This paragraph was finalized in Constitutional Committee and adopted after discussion, but without changes in the plenary.

On June 13, 1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stortinget.no%2Fno%2FStortinget-og-demokratiet%2FHistorikk%2FHistorisk-dokumentasjon%2FJodeparagrafen%2F&amp;edit-text=|title=The abolition of the Jews Act in Norway's Basic Law 1814 - 1851 - 2001. Brief history and description of the documentation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; after tireless efforts by the poet [[Henrik Wergeland]] (the son of the clause's architect Nicolai Wergeland), as well as politician [[Peder Jensen Fauchald]], school principal [[Hans Holmboe]], and others, the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian parliament]] deleted the article from the constitution, and thereby lifted the ban against Jews, who were thus awarded religious rights on par with Christian dissenters.

'''Captain Kit Dalton''' --- (23 January 1843 – 3 April 1920).

"''He fought for the Confederacy and with [[Quantrill's Raiders]].  After the war, he rode with Jesse &amp; Frank James and [[Cole Younger]] over 100 years ago.  A $50,000 reward was offered for him dead or alive; since they could not capture him, he was later pardoned by several governors with his promise that he would lead an exemplary life, which he did during his last 20 years, in Memphis.'"&lt;ref&gt;from the tombstone of Kit Dalton at Elmwood Cemetery, Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4694">'''Lawlessness''' is a lack of [[law]], in any of the various senses of that word. Lawlessness may describe various conditions.
{{TOC right}}

==In society==
'''[[Anomie]]''' is a breakdown of social bonds between an individual and their community, in which individuals do not feel bound by the moral strictures of society. The term was popularized by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] in his influential 1897 book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mestrovic |first=Stjepan |title=Emile Durkheim and The Reformation of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchy]]''' (meaning "without leadership") is a condition in which a person or group of people reject societal hierarchies, laws, and other institutions. It often entails the dissolution of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1551642484 |title=Decentralism: Where It Came From-Where Is It Going? |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchism]]''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies." George Woodcock. "Anarchism" at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. "Anarchism" from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anarchism." The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 "Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state." Judith Suissa. ''Anarchism and Education: a Philosophical Perspective''. Routledge. New York. 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist." [[Peter Kropotkin]]. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Anarchism__its_philosophy_and_ideal.html Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__An_Anarchist_FAQ__03_17_.html#toc2 "B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?"] in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Civil disorder]]''', or civil unrest, refers to public disturbances generally involving groups of people, and resulting in danger or damage to persons or property.&lt;ref&gt;Schurink, W.J. (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KMlv2eJozAUC&amp;pg=PA416 ''Victimization: Nature and Trends.''] Human Sciences Research Council. {{ISBN|0796912580}}. p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil disorder is a breakdown of civil society, and may be a form of protest. It may take various forms, such as illegal parades, sit-ins, riots, sabotage, and other forms of crime.

==In nature==
'''[[Randomness]]''' is the lack of [[pattern]] or [[predictability]] in events.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "random" as "Having no definite aim or purpose; not sent or guided in a particular direction; made, done, occurring, etc., without method or conscious choice; haphazard."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
'''[[Antinomianism]]''', in [[Christianity]], is a theological position which takes the principle of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] by [[Faith#Christianity|faith]] and [[divine grace]] to the point of asserting that the saved are not bound to follow the [[Law of Moses]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28267/antinomianism Encyclopædia Britannica: Antinomianism]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27519">'''Legal informatics''' is an area within [[information science]]. Erdelez and O'Hare (1997) define legal informatics as follows:

:The [[American Library Association]] defines [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] as "the study of the [[structure]] and [[properties]] of [[information]], as well as the application of [[technology]] to the [[Categorization|organization]], [[archive|storage]], [[information retrieval|retrieval]], and dissemination of information." Legal informatics therefore, pertains to the application of informatics within the context of the legal environment and as such involves [[law]]-related [[organization]]s (e.g., law offices, [[court]]s, and [[law school]]s) and [[User (computing)|user]]s of information and [[information technology|information technologies]] within these organizations.

==Delivery of legal services==
Advances in [[technology]] and legal informatics have led to new models for the delivery of legal services. Legal services have traditionally been a "bespoke" product created by a professional [[Lawyer|attorney]] on an individual basis for each client.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"&gt;Richard Susskind, From Bespoke to Commodity, LEGAL TECH. J., 2006, at 4, 4–7. {{cite web |url=http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/21/51/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129134550/http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk//content//view//21//51// |archivedate=2011-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to work more efficiently, parts of these services will move sequentially from (1) bespoke to (2) standardized, (3) systematized, (4) packaged, and (5) commoditized.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"/&gt; Moving from one stage to the next will require embracing different technologies and knowledge systems.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"/&gt;

===Cloud computing and legal services===
The widespread introduction of [[cloud computing]] provides several benefits in delivering legal services. Legal service providers can use the [[Software as a Service]] model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services.
* Software as a service is much more [[scalable]]. Traditional bespoke models require an attorney to spend more of a limited resource (their time) on each additional client. Using Software as a Service, a legal service provider can put in effort once to develop the product and then use a much less limited resource (cloud computing power) to provide service to each additional customer.
* Software as a service can be used to complement traditional bespoke services by handling routine tasks, leaving an attorney free to concentrate on bespoke work.
* Software as a service can be delivered more conveniently because it does not require the legal service provider to be available at the same time as the customer.

Software as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for [[attorney-client privilege]].  The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be [[Privilege (evidence)|legally privileged]].&lt;ref name="Johnsonarticle"&gt;Chris Johnson, Leveraging Technology to Deliver Legal Services, 23 HARV. J.L. &amp; TECH.259, 279 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latent markets===
Because the traditional model for delivery services demanded all legal work to be done in a bespoke manner the supply of legal services is generally [[inelastic]]. Households that are ineligible for [[legal aid]] but are not able to easily afford bespoke legal services are effectively underserved by the traditional model. A report by the [[American Bar Association]] Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services found that "among moderate-income households, 39% used the legal system to attempt resolution of their legal problems, 23% attempted resolution without legal help, and 26% took no action."&lt;ref name="DeliveryReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/delivery/deltech.html|title=Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services - Standing Committee / Delivery of Legal Services|author=|date=|work=abanet.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New organizations seek to access this under-served [[latent market]] by using technology to reduce prices and make services more available.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info.

===Online legal services===
{{See also|Document automation#In Legal Services|l1=Document automation in legal services}}

The spread of the Internet and development of legal technology and informatics are extending legal services to individuals and small-medium companies.

====United States====
In 1995, [[FindLaw]] started its online legal information service, where users can search lawyers, discuss legal topics in open forum, and purchase legal forms. In 1999, [[LegalMatch]] started its online legal matching service, where users answer questions online, LegalMatch identify the service required and notifies relevant lawyers, and users receives responses from the lawyers and can decide whom to hire. In 2001, [[LegalZoom]] started its online legal documentation service.  At LegalZoom, users can create legal documents for personal and business use by answering a questionnaire online and purchase the completed document.  In 2008, [[Rocket Lawyer]] started its online legal service, where users can receive legal documentation service and the on-call service to consult lawyers for personal and business needs at monthly or annual subscription fee. In 2012, [[Shake (company)|Shake]] started its mobile legal documentation service, with which users can create simple legal agreements via a mobile app.

====Japan====
In 2005, Taichiro Motoe, an attorney at law qualified in Japan, founded Authense Group, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.authense.co.jp&lt;/ref&gt; and started its online legal service, Bengoshi.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bengo4.com|title=弁護士ドットコム-無料法律相談・弁護士/法律相談事務所検索ポータル|author=|date=|work=bengo4.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Bengoshi.com, users can search lawyers, ask legal questions and receive answers from lawyers in open forum, request estimate for attorney fees, and consult lawyers for personal and business needs.

===Regulatory barriers to delivery of legal services===
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}
Currently available legal technologies and processes cannot be implemented due to various regulations on the practice of law put into place by [[state bar association]]s and state statutes. There is controversy over whether these regulations remain in place due to economic interests by attorneys or out of genuine concern for potential harms to customers. Regulations which pose obstacles to widespread adoption of new legal technologies and processes include [[Unauthorized practice of law#Unauthorized practice of law|unauthorized practice of law]] statutes, ethical rules restricting alternative business structures for law firms, and professional rules which make practicing law in multiple jurisdictions difficult.

====Unauthorized practice of law====
{{Main|Unauthorized_practice_of_law#Unauthorized_practice_of_law}}
[[Layperson|Lay]] organizations seeking to provide legal services must be careful to avoid committing unauthorized practice of law or face exposure to litigation from consumers and regulators. The definition of what constitutes unauthorized practice of law is nebulous and has been criticized as a potentially [[unconstitutional]] restriction on free speech.&lt;ref name="LanctotArticle"&gt;Catherine J Lanctot, "Does LegalZoom have First Amendment Rights? Some Thoughts About Freedom of Speech and the Unauthorized Practice of Law", Villanova Univ. Sch. of L. Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Working Paper No. 2011-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative business structures====
{{main|Law_firm#Restrictions_on_ownership_interests}}
In the United States a complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been adopted by the [[American Bar Association]] as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] and has been codified in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer.html Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/selling_law_on_an_open_market/ |title=Selling Law on an Open Market |first=Jason |last=Krause |publisher=''[[ABA Journal]]'' |date=July 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 4, 2010}} See also: [[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter's notes, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; except the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/ethics/legal_ethics/rules_of_professional_conduct/amended_rules/rule_five/rule05_04.cfm Rule 5.4 of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these rules, law firms face additional difficulties in raising equity capital to finance development of their own legal technologies and additional regulatory requirements compared to layperson organizations. Outside of the United States there are several countries which have allowed nonlawyer ownership of law firms ranging from limitations on percentage ownership combined with a "fit to own" test&lt;ref name="ABSMemo"&gt;ABA Commission on Ethics 20/20, Memorandum Re: For Comment: Issues Paper Concerning Alternative Business Structures, 17-19 (April 5, 2011)[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/ethics_2020/abs_issues_paper.authcheckdam.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (as in the [[United Kingdom]]) to allowing passive equity investment in law firms&lt;ref name="ABSMemo"/&gt; (as in [[Australia]]).

====Multijurisdictional practice====
Rule 5.5 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] requires that attorneys who maintain a "systematic and continuous practice" in a jurisdiction be admitted to practice in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="ModelRule5.5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_5_unauthorized_practice_of_law_multijurisdictional_practice_of_law.html|title=Rule 5.5: Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law - The Center for Professional Responsibility|author=|date=|work=americanbar.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For law firms that wish to provide legal services over online delivery platforms, this phrase is unclear as to what types of activities within a state require licensing in that state.&lt;ref name="KimbroSlice"&gt;Staphanie L. Kimbro, Regulatory Barriers to the Growth of Multijurisdictional Virtual Law Firms and Potential First Steps to Their Removal, 13 N.C.J.L. &amp; TECH. ON. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This difficulty is especially acute for [[virtual law firm]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Use of technology for legal access==

===Access to legal information===
From the mid-1990s onwards, lawyers, developers and publishers began to make the law available via the world wide web. Particularly influential{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} was the [[Free Access to Law Movement]] which by 2014 had 54 national and regional member organizations. In 2002, FALM adopted the Declaration on Free Access to Law. The goal of the movement has been to ensure that legal information is freely available to everyone. The declaration declared public legal information to be the common heritage of mankind.

The member organizations of FALM, primarily through the Internet, engaged in widespread publication of primary and secondary legal information. Early examples include the [[Legal Information Institute]] at Cornell University Law School and the [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]] based at the University of Technology and the University of New South Wales. The latter involved early adoption of hypertext technology to represent laws as a network of nodes, each representing a section.&lt;ref name="nyulawglobal.org"&gt;[http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Legal_Information_Institutes.htm Legal_Information_Institutes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="austlii.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/austlii/articles/libs_paper.html|title=AustLII - Publications: AustLII - Libs Paper|author=|date=|work=austlii.edu.au|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work of the open access to law movement is now published through the ''Journal of Open Access to Law'', which was established in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ojs.law.cornell.edu/index.php/joal|title=Journal of Open Access to Law|author=|date=|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the movement provided a catalyst for increasing official open access publication of legal information online by government agencies themselves.&lt;ref name="nyulawglobal.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="austlii.edu.au"/&gt;

===Access to justice===
Lawyers, designers, and computers scientists have considered ways to use technology to improve non-lawyers' access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;See CodeX Techindex. Stanford Law School, n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://techindex.law.stanford.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT's) Institute of Design and the [[Chicago–Kent College of Law|Chicago-Kent College of Law]] collaborated on a multi-year redesign of self-represented litigants' court experience. Their 2002 report documented their investigation of current assistance systems, creation of a new design protocol, and plan for a new system design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/Documents/Institutes%20and%20Centers/CAJT/access-to-justice-meeting-the-needs.pdf Charles L. Owen, Edward B. Pedwell, and Ronald W. Staudt, "Access to Justice: Meeting the Needs of Self-Represented Litigants", 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also puts forward a number of concept designs, reimagining how the court system may work and people may access it. Some of their proposals include:
* "CourtNet", a network inside the court building, to link together judicial staff and the public;
* "Interactive Translator", a software tool that can be used in interviewing and court exchanges, able to translate verbal and text communications into different languages;
* "Archetypes", a diagnosis platform that models users' legal problems, classifies them, and offers referral services; 
* "Pursuit Evaluator", an online tool to allow potential litigants evaluate whether pursuing a case would be worth their time, money, and effort
* "Complaint Formulator", an electronic interface to let litigants extract data from their problem situation and assemble it into various legal documents;
* "Informer", software that uses sample cases to help litigants model their own forms and teaches them how to file correctly; and
* "Case Tracker", an interactive searchable archive of a litigant's case history, that provides a clear timeline and reference to past actions.

The [[Berkman Center]] at Harvard Law School has been working with Massachusetts housing court judge Dina Fein to design access to civil justice in the state for pro se litigants, low-income people, litigants who aren't proficient in English, and people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/6853|title=Technology and Access to Justice - Berkman Klein Center|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, hosts projects such as [[Legal.io]] and [[Ravel Law]], addressing the application of legal informatics to access to justice issues, and convenes a community bringing researchers, lawyers, entrepreneurs and technologists together to work side-by-side to advance the frontier of legal technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.stanford.edu/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics/|title=CodeX {{!}} Stanford Law School|last=School|first=Stanford Law|website=Stanford Law School|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and policy==
Law and policy issues in legal informatics stem from the use of informational technologies in the implementation of law, such as the use of [[subpoenas]] for information found in email, search queries, and social networks. Policy approaches to legal informatics issues vary throughout the world; for example, European countries tend to require destruction or anonymization of data so that it cannot be used for discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dolin | first1 = Ron A | year = | title = Search Query Privacy: The Problem of Anonymization | url = | journal = Hastings Science &amp; Technology Law Journal | volume = 2010 | issue = | page = 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital rights management and copyright law===
Copyright holders make use of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) technology to limit the use and distribution of digital content. In the United States, the [[anti-circumvention]] provision of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) criminalizes attempts to circumvent DRM, even in cases where the circumvention is merely to facilitate non-infringing uses of the content. Along with the anti-circumvention provision, DRM can override substantive rights, such as [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;"Restoring the Public Library Ethos: Copyright, E-Licensing, and the Future of Librarianship". William M. Cross. ''Law Library Journal'' Vol. 104:2 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal informatics in legal practice===
Within the practice issues conceptual area, progress continues to be made on both litigation and transaction focused technologies. In particular, technology including predictive coding has the potential to effect substantial efficiency gains in law practice. Though predictive coding has largely been applied in the litigation space, it is beginning to make inroads in transaction practice, where it is being used to improve document review in mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbar.org/about/communications/nc-lawyer/2012-nc-lawyer-editions/may-2012/predictivecoding.aspx|title=NC Lawyer by NC Bar Association - NC Bar Association's NC Lawyer|author=|date=|work=ncbar.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advances, including XML coding in transaction contracts, and increasingly advanced document preparation systems demonstrate the importance of legal informatics in the transactional law space.&lt;ref&gt;Darryl Mountain, XML E-Contracts: Documents that Describe Themselves, 11(3) INT'L J.L. &amp; TECH. 274 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunziker |first1=R |date=Feb 2017 |title=New Invention Disclosure Standard – Why Would I Care? |url=http://www.ipo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/New_Invention_Disclosure_Standard.pdf |journal=IPO Law Journal |publisher=[[Intellectual Property Owners Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==

{{main|Applications of artificial intelligence to legal informatics}}

Artificial intelligence is already employed in  [[online dispute resolution]] platforms that use optimization algorithms and blind-bidding, and may be employed extensively in the future.&lt;ref&gt;David Allen Larson, "Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?" Technology Can Reduce Dispute Resolution Costs When Times Are Tough and Improve Outcomes, 11 Nev. L.J. 523, 550 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial intelligence is also frequently employed in modeling the legal [[ontology]], "an explicit, formal, and general specification of a conceptualization of properties of and relations between objects in a given domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wyner | first1 = A. | year = | title = An Ontology in OWL for Legal Case-Based Reasoning | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence and Law | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 361–387 | doi=10.1007/s10506-008-9070-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative legal prediction==
Both academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court. The model predicted 75% of cases correctly compared to experts who only predicted 59.1% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/4099370 Theodore W. Ruger, Pauline T. Kim, Andrew D. Martin, &amp; Kevin M. Quinn, "The Supreme Court Forecasting Project: Legal and Political Science Approaches to Predicting Supreme Court Decisionmaking" ''Columbia Law Review'' Volume 104 May 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of an academic quantitative legal prediction models is a 2012 model that predicted the result of Federal Securities class action lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01260.x | volume=9 | title=Predicting Securities Fraud Settlements and Amounts: A Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Federal Securities Class Action Lawsuits | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies | pages=482–510 | last1 = McShane | first1 = Blakeley B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also there are legal technology startups that are attempting to create proprietary models to predict case outcomes; one example is Lex Machina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lexmachina.com/|title=Legal Analytics by Lex Machina|author=|date=|work=lexmachina.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a company that provides [[intellectual property]] data and analytics.

==Criminal law==
In 1995, Peter W. Martin's paper for the NCAIR Sponsored Program on the Future of Legal Information Technology, entitled "Digital Law: Some Speculations on the Future of Legal Information Technology", wondered how innovations in technology were shaping—and would shape—legal information flow, storage, and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/papers/fut95fnl.htm|title=Digital Law|author=|date=|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Martin was wondering how technology would change the fundamental nature and practice of the legal field in the United States. Martin wrote that "There is a powerful (but infrequently noticed) linkage between ways societies think about law and the technology they use in operation and distribution of it (law that is)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was writing shortly after launching the Legal Information Institute at Cornell, the first law server on the Internet. LEXIS had pioneered putting digital legal content on computers twenty-four years prior, and digital content then accounted for more than 50% of the legal information market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Martin asked readers to suspend their disbelief as he proposed relatively rapid shifts in the ratio of paper-based legal information to digital legal information; the power wielded by the information-seeking public vs. high-priced gatekeepers of legal information; and a shift away from the private sector as a means to basic legal data and towards more higher-level skill sets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Martin suggested "fuller" bodies of data, pointing to a case in which the court thoroughly discussed a restaurant's trademark decor without ever showing a picture of the decor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Martin also highlights the Penalty Statistics Database in use in sentencing in New South Wales, and comparing it to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines of the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The South Wales model, launched in 1990, allows judges access not only to both more traditional legal data, including statutory provisions and appellate decisions but also to the availability of alternate facilities (such as drug rehabilitation programs).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The "Penalty Statistics Database" furthermore gives judges access to a pre-analyzed data pool of sentencing decisions made by other sentencing officers in New South Wales, as well as full offense and offender information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In this suggestion, too, Martin emphasizes the Penalty Statistics Database's use of graphical display to make the information it is transmitting to judges easier to access and utilize.

Treating legal informatics as a field as a serious tool for changing the way people interact with the law may pave the way for radical innovations in areas of law that are seen as inherently static, top-down, and bureaucratic.

==In corporate legal departments==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}Today's corporate legal departments are entities which can be as large as the biggest law firms. As such, the usage of different legal informatics technologies is important for their success. Legal departments use among other: various technology aids to manage their document databases, and more advanced assets such as patent portfolios. Some legal departments are also experimenting with the automation of certain types of tasks performed by in-house attorneys in their day-to-day practice. These tasks include: preparation of documents, editing and customization of these documents and the management of signatures.

==Corporate governance==
The prevailing [[corporate governance]] [[paradigm]], especially when [[public company|public companies]] are concerned, is largely based on the notion of the relative [[efficiency]] of separating ownership and control in managing business [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge"&gt;''See'' Stephen M. Bainbridge, ''The Case for Limited Shareholder Voting Rights'', 53 UCLA L. Rev 601 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[technological change]] can affect the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] of optimal governance structure for individual [[firm]]s. For instance, by lowering the cost of both disseminating [[information]] to [[shareholder]]s and gathering [[data]] about their [[preference]]s, developments in [[communication technology]] can potentially make it preferable for some firms to organize the [[management]] of the firm in a manner more similar to, for example, [[direct democracy]], with features such as [[two-way communication]] between the company's [[senior management]] and its [[investor]]s. The study of such questions thus applies legal informatics to analyzing the relationship between [[technology]] and [[corporate governance]] structures.

Legal Tech companies are generally [[startup companies|startups]] founded with the purpose of [[disruptive innovation|disrupting]] the traditionally conservative legal market.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TechCrunch]], as of December 2014, "legal technology is booming, with companies attempting to disrupt the legal space at every level and from every angle"&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Legal Tech Startups Have A Short History And A Bright Future|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/06/legal-tech-startups-have-a-short-history-and-a-bright-future/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=TechCrunch|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forbes]] noted in February 2015 that there were “hundreds of legal startups popping up all over the US and Europe”.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Juetten|first1=Mary|title=The Future Of Legal Tech: It's Not As Scary As Lawyers Think|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjuetten/2015/02/19/legal-tech-or-tech-legal/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Legal technology traditionally referred to the application of technology and software to help law firms with [[legal matter management|practice management]], [[document management system|document storage]], [[invoicing|billing]], [[accounting]] and [[electronic discovery]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibnick|first1=Eva|title=What is Legal Tech?|url=http://www.thelawinsider.com/insider-news/what-is-legal-tech|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=The Law Insider|date=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Legal Tech has evolved to be associated more with technology startups disrupting the [[practice of law]] by giving people access to online software that reduces or in some cases eliminates the need to consult a lawyer, or by connecting people with lawyers more efficiently through online marketplaces and lawyer-matching websites.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt;

==Industry context==
The legal industry is widely seen to be conservative and traditional, with Law Technology Today noting that "in 50 years, the customer experience at most law firms has barely changed".&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  Reasons for this include the fact law firms face weaker cost-cutting incentives than other professions (since they pass disbursements directly to their client) and are seen to be risk averse (as a minor technological error could have significant financial consequences for a client).&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;

However, the growth of the hiring by businesses of in-house counsel and their increasing sophistication, together with the development of email, has led to clients placing increasing cost and time pressure on their lawyers.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  In addition, there are increasing incentives for lawyers to become technologically competent, with the [[American Bar Association]] voting in August 2012 to amend the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] to require lawyers to keep abreast of "the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Client-Lawyer Relationship, Rule 1.1 Competence - Comment|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrogi|first1=Robert|title=The Cloud Has Landed: 10 Legal Tech Innovations and What They Mean|url=http://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=88&amp;Issue=4&amp;ArticleID=23997|website=Wisconsin Lawyer|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the saturation of the market leading many lawyers to look for cutting-edge ways to compete.  &lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt; The exponential growth in the volume of documents (mostly email) that must be reviewed for litigation cases has greatly accelerated the adoption of technology used in eDiscovery, with elements of machine language and artificial intelligence being incorporated and cloud-based services being adopted by law firms.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Investment in Legal Tech is predominantly focused in the United States with more than $254 million invested in 2014 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltransformationinstitute.com/blog/2014/3/10/legal-startup-funding-2014-so-far |title=Legal Startup Funding &amp;#124; 2014 So Far [Update 10/24/14&amp;#93; — LTI |website=Legaltransformationinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there is significant growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Is The Legal Tech Boom Over?

*''[[Frederic Tuten#Tintin in the New World: A Romance|Tintin in the New World : A Romance]]'' (1993) by [[Frederic Tuten]]. A novel that transplants Tintin from his comic book confines into a fleshed out, realistic world with all its wicked, grave and abstruse trappings.

'''Loyston''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Union County, Tennessee]], United States, that was inundated by the waters of the [[Clinch River]] after the completion of [[Norris Dam]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=Kids&gt;[http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/union Union County], Tennessee History for Kids, Inc. website&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in the early 19th century around a [[foundry]] built by its namesake, John Loy, over subsequent decades the community's location along [[Tennessee State Route 61|State Highway 61]] helped it grow into a trading center for local farmers.  By the time the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) began making plans to build Norris Dam in the early 1930s, Loyston had a population of approximately 70 residents, and consisted of a [[post office]] and several small businesses.&lt;ref name=perspectives&gt;Michael McDonald and John Muldowny, ''Tennessee Valley Perspectives'', vol. 2, no. 3 (Spring 1972), pp. 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to inundation, TVA conducted extensive [[sociological]] surveys of Loyston's residents, and the community was documented by photographer [[Lewis Hine]].  Most of Loyston's residents relocated elsewhere in the area, with many forming the community of New Loyston in the hills to the south.  Loyston was located near where Mill Creek empties into the [[Clinch River]], at river mile 98. Mill Creek's drainage carved a broad valley known as Big Valley, flanked on the south by Lone Mountain and on the east by Big Ridge.  At Loyston, State Highway 61 intersected a major local road.  The trip to Knoxville from Loyston was a {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} drive on Highway 61 (which has since been re-routed).&lt;ref name=perspectives /&gt;

Loyston is now under a mile-wide section of Norris Lake known as the "Loyston Sea," located along the shores of [[Big Ridge State Park]].&lt;ref name=StateParktrail&gt;[http://www.tennessee.gov/environment/parks/BigRidge/features/hiking.shtml Loyston Overlook Trail description], Big Ridge State Park website, accessed October 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Stooksbury-mill-loyston-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|Francis Stooksbury gristmill in Loyston, photographed in 1933]]

In the 1780s, German immigrant Henry Sharp built a frontier fort known as "Sharp's Station" on the slopes of Big Ridge overlooking the Clinch River east of Loyston, the area having been identified by [[long hunters]] travelling down the Clinch Valley during the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;Union County Historical Society, "[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~tnkin/historical/stat2.htm Sharp's Fort] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505043819/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~tnkin/historical/stat2.htm |date=2008-05-05 }}."  1999.  Retrieved: 23 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Sharp's descendants were still prominent members of the Loyston community, evidenced by names such as "Sharp's Station Methodist Episcopal Church," which was located just outside Loyston.&lt;ref name=perspectives /&gt; Another notable early settler, Robert Stooksbury, moved to the Loyston area around 1800. Several dozen of Stooksbury's descendants were still living in the Loyston area in the early 1930s, some of whom operated one of the community's [[general store]]s.&lt;ref name=perspectives /&gt;     
[[Image:Sharps-station-methodist-tn1.gif|thumb|left|Sharp's Station Methodist Episcopal Church in Loyston, photographed by [[Lewis Hine]] in 1933]]

In the early 19th century, John Loy established a foundry in the area, taking advantage of the iron ore deposits at the base of Big Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Noble Thompson, ''A Geographic Appraisal of Union County, Tennessee'' (Tennessee Technological University, 1965), 5-8, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The community that developed around the foundry was known variously as "Loy" and "Loy's Crossroads."  When a post office was established in the community in 1866, it took the name "Loy's Cross Roads," but the name was changed to Loyston in 1894.&lt;ref name=PO&gt;[http://www.tngenweb.org/union/po-a-l.html Union County Tennessee Post Offices and Postmasters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620221857/http://tngenweb.org/union/po-a-l.html |date=2010-06-20 }}, Union County GenWeb website, accessed October 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1930s, when TVA agents were surveying the Clinch River Valley for the Norris Dam Project, Loyston consisted of a post office, two general stores, a filling station, a cafe, a mill, and a barbershop.  A [[Delco Electronics|Delco]] Light system provided electricity to Loyston's businesses and a few of its houses.  TVA and the University of Tennessee Department of Agriculture's extension service helped Loyston families relocate, driving them to farms for sale around the region (one Loyston family required 25 such trips before finding a farm that satisfied them).&lt;ref name=perspectives /&gt;  [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] Company 4495, which built Big Ridge State Park, was headquartered at Loyston.&lt;ref&gt;Information obtained from CCC monument near the entrance to Big Ridge State Park, 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennessee Valley Authority==
[[Image:Oakdale-school-loyston-tn1.gif|thumb|right|Oakdale School near Loyston, photographed by Lewis Hine in 1933]]
[[File:"Exterior view of Oakdale School near Loyston, Tennessee. This immediate region will be flooded when the Norris Dam... - NARA - 532647.jpg|thumb|right|Oakdale School, 1933]]

TVA's studies showed that most residents of the Norris Basin were living in relative poverty, although Loyston's residents fared better due to better farm land.  The Stooksbury general store had sales of $50,000 per year, resulting in a $7,000 profit.  Houses in the Loyston area ranged from primitive two-room log cabins to eight-room frame houses.  Most houses were heated by fireplaces, although some had coal-burning stoves.  Loyston's children attended either Loyston Elementary School or the nearby one-room Oakdale School.&lt;ref name=perspectives /&gt;

TVA agents discussed in depth with Loyston's residents the benefits of moving to more fertile lands in the lower parts of the valley, and were perplexed when most of the community's residents chose to move no further than the less lucrative adjacent hill country.&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Valley Authority, ''The Norris Project'' (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1940), 531-532.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an attempt to keep the community intact, many of the displaced residents established [[New Loyston, Tennessee|New Loyston]] a few miles to the south.  A significant number moved to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], and others moved to nearby [[Anderson County, Tennessee|Anderson County]] or to [[Blount County, Tennessee|Blount]] or [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon]] counties south of Knoxville.&lt;ref name=perspectives /&gt;

==Legacy==

The valley in which Loyston was once located is now submerged under the widest part of Norris Lake, the mile-wide "Loyston Sea."  While building the Norris reservoir, TVA engineers determined that a [[saddle dam]] would be necessary to prevent water from the Mill Creek embayment from escaping into the Buffalo Creek Valley (which empties into the Clinch downstream from Norris Dam).  This saddle dam, known as the "Loyston Dike," is located along Highway 61 just west of Big Ridge State Park.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norris Project'', pp. 540-545.&lt;/ref&gt;  A recreation area along the Mill Creek embayment has also been named for Loyston.  In 2008, the [[Museum of Appalachia]] accepted a donation of a children's playhouse that originally stood in Loyston and was said to be the last intact building from the community.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Fowler, [http://m.knoxnews.com/news/2008/Aug/11/museum-to-preserve-loyston-playhouse/ Museum to preserve Loyston playhouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713162845/http://m.knoxnews.com/news/2008/Aug/11/museum-to-preserve-loyston-playhouse/ |date=2011-07-13 }}, ''Knoxville News Sentinel'', August 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the husband of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the current [[State Counsellor of Myanmar]].

==Life==
Aris was born in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. His mother, Josette Aris (née Vaillancourt), was the Canadian Ambassador's daughter, and his English father, John Aris, was an officer with the [[British Council]].&lt;ref name="New York Times Obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutchow, Kim 1999 pp. 18"&gt;Gutchow, Kim. 'Michael Aris: In memoriam'. ''Ladakh  Studies'' 12 (Autumn 1999), pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being educated at [[Worth School]] in [[Sussex]] and upon completing his degree in modern history at [[St Cuthbert's Society]], [[Durham University]] in 1967, Aris spent six years as the private tutor of the children of the royal family of the Himalayan [[Bhutan|Kingdom of Bhutan]].

Aris was an academic and [[lecturer]] in [[Asian history]] at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] and later at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]]. In the last years before his death, he helped to establish a specialist Tibetan and Himalayan Studies centre at Oxford.

Michael Aris's identical twin brother, [[Anthony Aris]], similarly became a scholar of Tibetan studies, and founded ''Serindia Publications'' to focus on bringing Tibetan history and culture to modern audiences.&lt;ref name="New York Times Obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutchow, Kim 1999 pp. 18"/&gt;

==Aung San Suu Kyi==

In 1972, Aris married [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], whom he had met while at the university. They married in a [[Buddhist]] ceremony. After spending a year in Bhutan, they settled in [[North Oxford]], where they raised their two sons, [[Alexander Aris]] and Kim Aris. During this time, he did postgraduate studies at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]] and obtained a PhD in Tibetan literature in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/cia/tibetanstudies/alumni/ |title=SOAS Tibetan Studies Alumni |publisher=The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) - University of London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515042204/http://www.soas.ac.uk/cia/tibetanstudies/alumni/ |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to [[Burma]] at first to care for her mother but later to lead the country's pro-democracy movement. St John's College provided Aris with an extended leave of absence as a [[fellow]] on full [[stipend]] so that he could lobby for his wife's cause.

In 1997, Aris was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] which was later found to be terminal. Several countries, prominent individuals and organisations, including the United States government, United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], made appeals to the Burmese authorities to allow Dr Aris a visa. The Burmese government would not grant him a [[visa (document)|visa]] to visit Burma, saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from [[house arrest]] but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the junta's assurance that she could return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm |title=Suu Kyi rejects UK visit offer |publisher=BBC News |date=26 March 1999 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Levicoff surveys various unaccredited Christian schools as well as providing an explanation about various forms of accreditation. Although in the past Levicoff has criticized the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]], he notes that TRACS has since "responded positively" to his earlier critiques.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Levicoff]]. ''Name It and Frame It? New Opportunities in Adult Education and How to Avoid Being Ripped Off by 'Christian' Degree Mills.'' (Institute on Religion and Law, third edition 1993), 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Levicoff argues that a non-accredited school is not necessarily a [[degree mill]].&lt;ref&gt;Levicoff, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He devotes a chapter to "legitimate unaccredited Christian programs", some notable examples of which include (in the United States): [[Bob Jones University]], [[Luther Rice University]], [[Messenger College]],&lt;ref&gt;Levicoff, 93-97&lt;/ref&gt; (all three accredited by TRACS since publication) and (in Canada) [[Regent College]].&lt;ref&gt;Levicoff, 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Levicoff also surveys "[[ordination mill]]s", of which one of the more prominent is the [[Universal Life Church]].

The "Institute on Religion and Law", Levicoff's publisher, is a business name used for his personal consulting firm.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The '''National Rural Health Association''' ('''NRHA''') is a national [[non-profit organization|nonprofit]] [[professional association]] in the [[United States]] with more than 18,000 members. The association’s mission is to provide leadership on [[rural health]] issues, which it attempts to carry out through education, communication, and advocacy.  The NRHA membership is made up of a diverse collection of individuals and organizations, all of whom share the common bond of an interest in rural health.  Many member organizations have specific facility designations such as [[critical access hospital| critical access hospitals]], [[rural health clinic| rural health clinics]], or [[Community health centers in the United States|community health centers]].

==History==
In the mid to late 1970s, a small group of rural community health centers began to coalesce around the need for an independent association to make sure the rural-specific needs of the community health center movement was represented.  In 1978, the National Rural Primary Care Association (NRPCA) was founded and based in [[Waterville, Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History, Evolution, Current Status and Issues of Community Health Centers |url=http://rhr.sph.sc.edu/News/USC%2520Grand%2520Rounds%2520Presentation.ppt |accessdate=2009-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727213224/http://rhr.sph.sc.edu/News/USC%20Grand%20Rounds%20Presentation.ppt |archivedate=July 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NRPCA would move its headquarters to [[Kansas City, Missouri]] in 1983, where it remains to this day.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web | title = NRHA Organizational History | url = http://www.ruralhealthweb.org/go/top/about-the-nrha/organizational-history | accessdate= 2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s two additional rural health associations were formed with similar desires to represent the rural-specific needs within their larger professional groups.  The American Rural Health Association (ARHA) was formed in 1980 primarily made up of rural health researchers.  The goal of the ARHA was to "become a definitive source of information on rural health."&lt;ref name=History /&gt;  In February 1981, the American Small and Rural Hospital Association (ASRHA) was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = News and Notes | publisher = Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law | pages = 566–573 | url = http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/6/3/566.pdf | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Board of the NRPCA changed the association's name to the National Rural Health Care Association (NRHCA).  In doing so, the association moved past its mainly community health center roots and allowed other providers as segments of its membership.  This change prepared the way for the NRHCA to eventually merge with both the ARHA and the ASRHA.  These mergers took place in 1987 and 1986, respectively.  These mergers led to a change of the name to the National Rural Health Association, a "new unified voice for rural health."&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

NRHA' roots in professional-specific rural organizations has led to a membership structure that contains specific constituency groups for different rural health interests.  These associations within an association each have seats on the NRHA board of trustees and its policy setting body.  Many also have their own conference or tracks within larger NRHA conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NRHA Constituency Groups | url = http://www.ruralhealthweb.org/go/top/about-the-nrha/constituency-groups | accessdate = 2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Story-teller reciting from the "Arabian Nights." (1911) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|A Story-teller reciting from the "Arabian Nights" - 1911]]
[[File:Indian Kathakar Storyteller 1913.jpg|thumb|''Vyasa'' (sitting on high table), the common title for Indian oral storytellers, reciting epics among villagers, 1913]]
'''Oral [[storytelling]]''' is an ancient and intimate [[tradition]] between the storyteller and their audience. The storyteller and the listeners are physically close, often seated together in a circular fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, F.S., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C.A., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing traditional storytelling to promote wellness in American Indian communities.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the telling of the story people become psychically close, developing a connection to one another through the communal experience. The storyteller reveals, and thus shares, him/her self through his/her telling and the listeners reveal and share themselves through their reception of the story. The intimacy and connection is deepened by the flexibility of oral storytelling which allows the tale to be moulded according to the needs of the audience and/or the location or environment of the telling. Listeners also experience the urgency of a creative process taking place in their presence and they experience the  empowerment of being a part of that creative process. Storytelling creates a personal bond with the teller and the audience.

The flexibility of oral storytelling extends to the teller. Each teller will incorporate their own personality and may choose to add characters into the story. As a result, there will be numerous variations of a single story.&lt;ref&gt;Silko, L. Storyteller. New York, New York: Seaver Books Pub., 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Some tellers consider anything outside the [[narrative]] as extraneous while other storytellers choose to enhance their telling of the tale with the addition of [[visual]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] tools, specific actions and creative strategies and devices.

Storytelling may be performed in many forms: in prose, in poetic form, as a song, accompanied with dance or some kind of theatrical performance, etc.

==Human need==

It is likely that oral storytelling has been around as long as human [[language]]. Storytelling fulfills the need for human beings to cast their experiences in narrative form. Our ancestors probably gathered around the evening fires and expressed their fears, their beliefs and their heroism through oral [[narrative]]s. This long tradition of storytelling is evident in ancient [[cultures]] such as the [[Australian Aborigines]]. Community storytelling offered the security of explanation; how life and its many forms began and why things happen, as well as entertainment and enchantment. Communities were strengthened and maintained through stories that connected the present, the past and the future.

Telling stories is a nurturing act for the listener, who is connected to the storyteller through the story, as well as for the storyteller who is connected to the listeners through the story.

==History==
[[File:Dastangoi dastango.jpg|thumb|An Indian traditional oral storytller [[Dastangoi]] artist reciting the "Dastan"]]

Early storytelling probably originates in simple chants {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}. People sang chants as they worked at grinding corn or sharpening tools. Our early ancestors created myths to explain natural occurrences. They assigned superhuman qualities to ordinary people, thus originating the hero tale.

Early storytelling combined stories, poetry, music, and dance. Those who excelled at storytelling became entertainers, educators, cultural advisors, and historians for the community. Through storytellers, the history of a culture was handed down from generation to generation.

The importance of stories and storytellers throughout human history can be seen in the respect afforded to professional storytellers.

The 9th century fictional storyteller [[Scheherazade]] of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', who saves herself from execution by telling tales, is one example  illustrating the value placed on storytelling in days of old. Centuries before Scheherazade, the power of storytelling is reflected by [[Vyasa]] at the beginning of the Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. [[Vyasa]] says, "If you listen carefully, at the end you'll be someone else."

In the [[Middle Ages]] storytellers, also called a troubadour or a minstrel, could be seen in the market places and were honored as members of royal courts. [[Medieval]] storytellers were expected to know all the current tales and in the words of American storyteller [[Ruth Sawyer]], ‘to repeat all the noteworthy theses from the universities, to be well informed on court scandal, to know the healing power of herbs and simples (medicines), to be able to compose verses to a lord or lady at a moment's notice, and to play on at least two of the instruments then in favor at court.’ According to some writers there were 426 minstrels employed at the wedding of Princess Margaret of England in 1290. Two of the storytellers of the court of  [[King Edward I]] were two women who performed under the names of Matill Makejoye and Pearl in the Egg.

Journeying from land to land, storytellers would learn various regions's stories while also gathering news to bring back with them. Through exchanging stories with other storytellers, stories changed, making it difficult to trace the origins of many stories.

In the 1800s Jakob and Wilhelm [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm]] collected and published stories that had been told orally in [[Germany]]. They did not publish them as they found them however, but edited them in accordance with their own values. Like the Grimm brothers in Germany, [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jorgen Moe]] collected [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] folk tales. In Denmark [[Hans Christian Andersen]] adapted folktales he heard from oral storytellers. In England, [[Joseph Jacobs]] recorded collections of folktales of [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]].

In the 1900s the importance of oral storytelling was recognised by storytellers such as [[Marie Shedlock]], a retired English schoolteacher. She made several tours to the [[United States]] to lecture on the art of storytelling emphasising the importance of storytelling as a natural way to introduce literature to children.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Pbpreservation.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of The Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach.]] --&gt;
The '''Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach''' is a private, [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]] membership organization dedicated to the [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of the historic, architectural, as well as [[cultural heritage]] of [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. Through advocacy initiatives, educational programs, architectural resources, and cultural events, the foundation’s goal is to encourage the [[community]] to learn about and save the historic [[building]]s that make the town of Palm Beach special.

==History==

Founded in 1981, the organization is committed to honoring and preserving Palm Beach’s original architectural treasures and [[public spaces]]. Honorable Judge James R. Knott, a dedicated historian and author, facilitated the establishment of the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalsocietypbc.org/news_JudgeKnottAward.asp The Judge Knott Award by the Historical Society of Palm Beach County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424202120/http://historicalsocietypbc.org/news_JudgeKnottAward.asp |date=2007-04-24 }}, retrieved on August 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It has lobbied local and county government to change policy and enact legislation that directly and legally protects Palm Beach’s architectural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DF103AF936A25753C1A967958260 Rother, Larry.

The organization not only encourages education and appreciation for these historical structures, but also works against the forces of speculation, development, and degradation to ensure they remain a vital part of the community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E1DE1630F936A15750C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print Rozhon, Tracie.

Town-owned open space has also been safeguarded, as well as neighborhood zoning strengthened and upheld through the efforts of preservationists. Facade easement donations to the foundation help protect buildings, as well as bring tax savings to owners. Millions of dollars have gone to purchase property, as well as into restoration and rehabilitation over the years.

==Awards==

Several awards are offered to encourage preserving of the historic, architectural, and cultural heritage:

* The Ballinger Award commemorates a restoration or new construction that best exemplifies the traditions of original houses and the architects who designed them. The award was first presented in 1987 in honor of the late Robert I. Ballinger Jr., former chairman of the Palm Beach Landmarks Preservation Commission. Mr. Ballinger worked to instill pride in the island’s architectural heritage.
* The Polly Earl Award was founded in 2005 and is given to recognize a Palm Beach property owner for outstanding service to the cause of preservation, specifically through restoration of an existing landmarked property or property of historic significance that is not necessarily a large estate. Mrs. Earl was the foundation’s executive director for some 20 years. She died in 2005. The first award was given toward the restoration of a house on Seabreeze Avenue, in one of the original neighborhoods on the island.
* The Elizabeth L. and John H. Schuler Award was founded in 2005 by Mr. and Mrs. Schuler to recognize new architecture that is designed and built in keeping with the traditional styles of the town's architecture. John Schuler served as chairman of the Town of Palm Beach Architectural Review Commission.

==Heritage Education==

In 1987, the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach introduced its Heritage Education Program. The goal is to teach children about the history and culture of Palm Beach through its local architecture and cultural artifacts. The program’s workshops are currently offered in several public and private schools in or near the Town of Palm Beach.

Since 1990, [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach county]] teachers have participated in teacher training workshops sponsored by the foundation. These sessions are designed to instruct teachers how to create local heritage education programs in their schools. In 1993, the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation presented The Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach its Outstanding Achievement Award in Education for the Heritage Education Program.

==Archives==

The organization's Archives and Library exist to sustain the mission of the foundation by collecting, preserving, organizing, and encouraging use of its historical documents and research materials. Maintained are a collection of books, historic documents, resource materials and photographs dealing with [[architecture]], Palm Beach, [[History of Florida|Florida history]], [[historic preservation]], as well as [[Landscape architecture|horticulture and landscape architecture]]. Housed in the foundation’s headquarters, the archives and library have resources that are available to the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/fash/content/fashion/ArtDeco0705.html Janjigian, Robert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">{{for|other uses of ''prolepsis''|Prolepsis (disambiguation)}}
'''Procatalepsis''', also called '''prolepsis''' or '''prebuttal''', is a [[figure of speech]] in which the speaker raises an objection to their own argument and then immediately answers it. By doing so, they hope to strengthen their argument by dealing with possible counter-arguments before their audience can raise them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialog Theory for Critical Argumentation|author=Douglas N. Walton|pages=106|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=978-90-272-1885-8|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]] anticipating future responses and answering possible objections will set up one's argument for a strong defense. The ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' states that there are three distinct theoretical uses of prolepsis: argumentation, literary discussion, and conjunction with narratological analyses of the order of events.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childers|first1=Joseph|last2=Hentzi|first2=Gary|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism|year=1995|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07243-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}}

In argumentation, procatalepsis is used to answer the opponent's possible objections before they can be made. In literary discussion, procatalepsis is used as a figure of speech in which a description is used before it is strictly applicable. Sayings such as "I'm a dead man" exemplify the suggestion of a state that has not yet occurred. In [[Narratology|narratological analyses]] prolepsis can be used with the order of events and presentation of events in texts. This refers to the study of narrative in respect to "flash-forwards" in which a future event serves as an interruption of the present time of the text.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict" /&gt;

Example:
* "It is difficult to see how a pilot boat could be completely immune to capsizing or plunging, but pilot boat design criteria must meet the needs of the industry and pilotage authorities."

As a linguistic phenomenon found in both classic and current languages, prolepsis is described as the construction whereby the subject of a subordinate clause occurs by anticipation as an object in the main clause.&lt;ref&gt;Panhuis, Dirk. "Prolepsis in Greek as a Discourse Strategy." ''Glotta'' 62.1/2 (1984): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 30 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition is strictly technical as used in linguistics, it has also been used to describe the more general phenomenon of objects or phrases appearing earlier than intended or expected. 

==Other examples in rhetoric and argument== 

Procatalepsis as a rhetorical technique is also related to and used in other forms and techniques. A [[hypophora]] is described as a figure of speech in which a speaker raises a question then immediately answers it. Since these questions are often raised as possible dissenting opinions or audience objections, the hypophora can be said to be a use of procatalepsis.

The [[Straw Man]] argument, an informal fallacy in which one misrepresents an opposing argument in order to further one's own, can serve as an example of misused procatalepsis. In this fallacy, the rhetor misconstrues the words, arguments, or views of an opponent, most often on purpose, to facilitate rebuttal or create a false impression on the audience. This, in effect, creates a "straw man" against which the rhetor will then defend and strengthen his or her argument. &lt;ref&gt;Douglas Walton, "The Straw Man Fallacy." ''In Logic and Argumentation'', ed. Johan van Bentham, Frans H. van Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst and Frank Veltman. Amsterdam, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, North-Holland, 1996. pp. 115-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct use of procatalepsis is still an effective tactic in an argument, since it allows the rhetor to answer opponents before they have a chance to raise the counterargument themselves. This "inoculation" can be subtle, but also signaled rather obviously (e.g. "Now, my opponent might argue that X. But, as you can see, Y"). The unique benefit to this more overt approach is twofold: The rhetor successfully replies to an opposing argument or audience objection, but also builds a sort of trust and authority with the audience. Then, if the opponent does in fact bring up the argument that the rhetor anticipated, the rhetor appears to be correct not only in the subject matter of the argument but in the general course of the argument itself.

==Inoculation==
Procatalepsis is linked to the rhetorical term [[Inoculation theory|inoculation]]. The ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory'' describes this rhetorical technique in relation to its medical definition: introducing small doses of viruses to the body in order to build up immunization.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=Stephen W.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|title=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory|year=2009|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}} In rhetoric, the small dose of the threat parallels to the awareness of the opposing argument that is used to build up one's argument by defense in prolepsis. William McGuire proposed the Inoculation Theory in 1964 to challenge attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that make an argument more resistant when exposed to counter views in weakened, small doses. Persuasion research in the 1950s found that providing two sides of an issue created a greater resistance to later arguments.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt; This is closely related to the rhetorical use of procatalepsis as an opposing argument to defend the intended view of the argument.

Inoculation and procatalepsis are both present in certain courtroom situations, as described in the ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory''. An attorney may set up their defense by disclaiming the negative views or classifications of the accused as untrue: "The prosecutor will call Ms. Jones evil, a bad mother, and a poor member of society, but these labels are not true. I will prove to you their inaccuracy." When the prosecutor asserts an attack on Ms. Jones' character, the jury is already prepared and expecting to hear it and they may question or even discount these accusations. The goal is not to overwhelm the audience members with anticipation or the opposing view of the argument, but rather to use the inverse argument to one's advantage through strategic rhetoric.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt;

The "'''Second Thirty Years' War'''" is a [[periodization]] scheme sometimes used by historians to encompass the wars in Europe from 1914 to 1945.{{efn|name=term}}

Just as the [[Thirty Years' War]] of 1618 to 1648 was not a single war but a series of conflicts in varied times and locations, later organized and named by historians into a single period, the Second Thirty Years' War has been seen as a "[[European Civil War]]", fought over the problem of Germany and exacerbated by new ideologies such as [[communism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="HKU 2013"&gt;
{{cite web

|title= HIST2013 Twentieth-century Europe, Part I: The European Civil War, 1914–1945
| publisher = The [[University of Hong Kong]]
|quote= This period can be seen as a Thirty Years' War fought over the problem of Germany, beginning with the First World War, 1914–18, and climaxing with the total defeat of Germany at the end of the Second World War, 1939–45. Tensions between the Great Powers were exacerbated by new ideologies such as Fascism, Nazism and Communism, which appeared in Europe as part of a general crisis in Western Civilisation after the First World War.|archivedate= 2007-03-09
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept's origins==
The concept of a "Second Thirty Years War" originated in 1946 with former head of French Government [[Charles de Gaulle]] speech in [[Bar-le-Duc]] (28 July 1946) evoking "the drama of the thirty years war, we just won", for him the First World War and the Second World War were a single conflict, the [[interwar period]] being just a mere [[truce]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles de Gaulle, Discours prononcé à Bar-le-Duc, 28 juillet 1946, http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/textes/degaulle28071946.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was echoed, among others, by [[Sigmund Neumann]] in his book ''The Future in Perspective'' (1946).{{sfn|Pons|2000|p=XII|loc=Footnote 3}} In 1948 British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] gave the idea a boost when, in the first paragraph of the Preface to ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Gathering Storm]]'' (1948), he says his books will "cover an account of another Thirty Years War".{{sfn|Churchill|1948|loc=preface}}

As point in fact, major European conflicts during this period included: [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–13), [[World War I]] (1914–18), [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–23), [[Ukrainian–Soviet War]] (1917–21), [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–21), [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39) and [[World War II]] (1939–45). In addition the [[Interwar period]] saw significant levels of [[Aftermath of World War I|civilian and labor conflict]] as well as colonial wars.

{{quote|Though it is not "scholarly" in form, it is obviously based upon close acquaintance with the sources and keenly perceptive observation. Thus it is that rare combination of the scholarly study and readable synthesis that many strive for and few attain. In approaching his subject, Neumann regards the years since 1914 as another Thirty Years' War which has been accompanied at the same time by a revolution that is still going on. Likening World War I and the Versailles peace to a prologue, he interprets what followed as five acts of a Greek drama of approximately equal length: 1919–24, 1924–29, 1929–34, 1934–39 and 1939–45.{{sfn|Lee|1946|pp=604–606}}|Lee, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20757">'''State capture''' is a type of systemic [[political corruption]] in which private interests significantly influence a [[State (polity)|state's]] decision-making processes to their own advantage.

The term 'state capture' was first used by the [[World Bank]] (c 2000) to describe the situation in central Asian countries making the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|transition]] from [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]].  Specifically it was applied to situations where small corrupt groups used their influence over government officials to appropriate government decision making in order to strengthen their own economic positions; these groups would later become known as [[Business oligarch|oligarchs]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=wJDhDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=%22state+capture%22&amp;ots=8kplIzdID1&amp;sig=JcVONGmjfhSwfJXI2PkaCN3_ha0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22state%20capture%22&amp;f=false|title=Peru: Elite Power and Political Capture|last=Crabtree|first=John|last2=Durand|first2=Francisco|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|year=2017|isbn=978-1-78360-904-8|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations of state capture have led to protests against the government in Bulgaria in 2013-2014 and Romania in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.makeapoint.ro/en/open-letter-romanian-democracy-at-grave-danger/ |title=Romanian Democracy at Grave Danger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have caused an ongoing controversy in [[South Africa]] beginning in 2016.

==Defining state capture==
The classical definition of state capture refers to the way formal procedures (such as laws and social norms) and government [[bureaucracy]] are manipulated by private individuals and firms so as to influence state policies and laws in their favour.  State capture seeks to influence the formation of laws to protect and promote influential private interests.  In this way it differs from most other forms of corruption which instead seek selective enforcement of already existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duane_Edwards/publication/316608300_Corruption_and_State_Capture_under_two_Regimes_in_Guyana/links/59076cbc4585152d2e9c42ea/Corruption-and-State-Capture-under-two-Regimes-in-Guyana.pdf|title=Corruption and State Capture under two Regimes in Guyana|last=Edwards|first=Duane C.|date=1 May 2017|website=ResearchGate|publisher=University of the West Indies|access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State capture may not be illegal, depending on determination by the captured state itself,&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|last2=Vicente|first2=Pedro C|title=Legal Corruption (October 2005)|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and might be attempted through private lobbying and influence. The influence may be through a range of state institutions, including the legislature, executive, ministries and the judiciary, or through a corrupt electoral process. It is similar to [[regulatory capture]] but differs in the scale and variety of influenced areas and, unlike regulatory capture, the private influence is never overt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=World Bank| title=Anticorruption in Transition: Contribution to the Policy Debate | publisher=World Bank Publications| year=2000 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpBvS3O17S4C&amp;pg=PA3| isbn=9780821348024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private influences cannot be discovered by lawful processes,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} since the legislative process, judiciary, electoral process, and/or executive powers have been subverted.

A distinguishing factor from [[corruption]] is that, while in cases of corruption the outcome (of policy or regulatory decision) is not certain, in cases of state capture the outcome is known and is highly likely to be beneficial to the captors of the state.

Also, in cases of corruption (even rampant) there is plurality and competition of 'corruptors' to influence the outcome of the policy or distribution of resources. However, in state capture, decision-makers are usually more in a position of agents to the principals (captors) who function either in monopolistic or oligopolistic (non-competitive) fashion.

Protests in Bulgaria in 2013–14 against the [[Oresharski]] cabinet were prompted by allegations that it came to power due to the actions of an oligarchic structure (formerly allied to [[Boyko Borisov]]) which used underhand manouevres to discredit the [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria|GERB]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://iris-bg.org/files/stID.pdf |title=Политическата криза и дневният ред на промяната (pp.1–2) |accessdate=2 March 2014 |date=17 June 2013 |language=Bulgarian |publisher=iris.bg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627000204/http://iris-bg.org/files/stID.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 there were allegations of an overly close and potentially corrupt relationship between the wealthy [[Gupta family]] and the [[South Africa]]n president [[Jacob Zuma]], his family and leading members of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC).&lt;ref name="rdmAllies"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2016/02/01/zuma-allies-break-ranks-with-him-over-guptas | title=Zuma allies 'break ranks' with him over Guptas | publisher=Rand Daily Mail | date=1 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Symbol"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/2015/12/17/Gupta-family-seen-as-symbol-of-Zuma%E2%80%99s-failing-rule | title=Gupta family seen as symbol of Zuma's failing rule | publisher=Sunday Times | date=17 December 2015 | accessdate=9 February 2016 | author=Wild, Franz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcGupta"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22513410 | title=Who are the Guptas? | publisher=BBC | date=14 May 2013 | accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMgupta"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-02-01-keeping-up-with-the-guptas-whats-behind-the-anti-saxonwold-revolt | title=Keeping Up with the Guptas: What's behind the anti-Saxonwold revolt | publisher=[[Daily Maverick]] | date=1 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016 | author=Munusamy, Ranjeni}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African Opposition parties have made claims of "State Capture" following allegations that the Guptas, said to be close to President Jacob Zuma, his family and other ANC leaders, had insinuated themselves into a position where they could offer Cabinet positions and influence the running of government.&lt;ref name="N24statecapture"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/parliament-must-deal-with-state-capture-da-20160327 | title= Parliament must deal with 'state capture' – DA | publisher=News24.com | date=27 March 2016 | accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations were made in light of revelations by former ANC MP [[Vytjie Mentor]] and Deputy Finance Minister [[Mcebisi Jonas]] that they had been offered Cabinet positions by the Guptas at the family's home in Saxonwold, Johannesburg.&lt;ref name="N24zumarelationship"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-defends-relationship-with-guptas-report-20160323 | title= Zuma defends relationship with Guptas – report| publisher=News24.com | date=23 March 2016 | accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mentor claimed that in 2010 the Guptas had offered her the position of Minister of Public Enterprises, provided that she arranged for [[South African Airways]] to drop their India route, allowing a Gupta linked company ([[Jet Airways]]) to take on the route.&lt;ref name="JetAirways"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2016/03/17/vytjie-mentor-i-can-prove-zuma-was-with-me-in-the-gupta-house | title=Vytjie Mentor: I can prove Zuma was with me in the Gupta house | publisher=Rand Daily Mail | date=17 March 2016 | accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2016/03/18/Zuma-said-its-OK-Ntombazana-says-former-ANC-MP-Vytjie-Mentor|title='Zuma said it's OK Ntombazana,' says former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor|publisher=Times Live|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said she declined the offer, which occurred at the Guptas' Saxonwold residence, while President Zuma was in another room. This came a few days before a cabinet reshuffle in which minister [[Barbara Hogan]] (then Minister of [[Department of Public Enterprises|Public Enterprises]]) was dismissed by Zuma. The Gupta family agreed that the meeting took place and agreed offering Vytijie a ministerial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khoza |first=Amanda  |date=15 March 2016 |title=Gupta family denies offering former ANC MP top job |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/gupta-family-denies-offering-former-anc-mp-top-job-20160315 |newspaper=news24 |location= |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Zuma claimed that he had no recollection of Vytjie Mentor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Khoza |first1=Amanda |last2=Tandwa |first2=Lizeka  |date=15 March 2016  |title=Zuma has 'no recollection' of Mentor - Presidency |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/zuma-has-no-recollection-of-mentor-presidency-20160315 |newspaper=news24 |location= |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputy Finance Minister [[Mcebisi Jonas]] said he had been offered a ministerial position by the Guptas shortly before the dismissal of Finance Minister [[Nhlanhla Nene]] in December 2015, but had rejected the offer as "it makes a mockery of our hard-earned democracy‚ the trust of our people and no one apart from the President of the Republic appoints ministers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2016/03/16/full-statement-by-deputy-finance-minister-mcebisi-jonas-on-gupta-job-offer|title=Full statement by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas on Gupta job offer|date=16 March 2016|publisher=The Sowetan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gupta family denied offering Jonas the job of Finance Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Gupta family denies offering Jonas South Africa's finance minister role |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0WI2J7 |newspaper=Reuters |location= |date=16 March 2016 |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Jacob Zuma denied the allegation of blocking an attempt to set up a commission of inquiry to probe state capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/special-features/the-zuma-era/zuma-denies-blocking-state-capture-probe-9381582|title=Zuma denies blocking state capture probe {{!}} IOL News|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guptas' alleged "state capture" was investigated by [[Public Protector (South Africa)|Public Protector]] [[Thuli Madonsela]].

On 25 November 2016, Zuma announced that the Presidency would be reviewing the contents of the state capture report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/zuma-to-take-state-capture-report-on-review-20161125|title=Zuma to take state capture report on review|newspaper=CityPress|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said it "was done in a funny way" with "no fairness at all," and argued he was not given enough time to respond to the public protector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citizen.co.za/news/news-national/1357691/zuma-take-madonselas-state-capture-report-review/|title=Zuma to launch a review on Madonsela's state capture report|last=Williams|first=Denise|newspaper=The Citizen|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 2017 the former Finance Minister, [[Pravin Gordhan]], estimated the cost of state capture at 250 billion Rand, in a presentation at the [[University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1651069/r250bn-lost-to-state-capture-in-the-last-three-years-says-gordhan/|title=R250bn lost to state capture in the last three years, says Gordhan|last=reporter|first=Citizen|work=The Citizen|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2017,  in an exclusive interview with [[ANN7]] (belonging to the [[Gupta Family]]), South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] said 'State Capture' was a fancy word used by media houses for propaganda proliferation. He said that a real state capture would include seizure of the three arms of the constitution - Legislative, Executive and Judiciary - which has never been the case in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Africa News Network 7 TV|title=#StraightTalk: ANN7 exclusive interview with Pres Jacob Zuma|date=2017-11-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MITFfskDJR4|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book [[How to Steal a City]] details state capture within the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality]] in South Africa and takes place during the Zuma government.

===Hungary===
The captured state of Hungary started after 2010. The former main opposition party won the 2/3rd of the mandates in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary election]]. The manipulation of the constitutional law and the Constitutional Court became possible. The parliamentary election laws was later tailored also to the purpose of the new governmental party. Step by step, the different institutional applications, competitions, and tenders have been won almost exclusively by organisations and individuals loyal to the government. The winners have been frequently the relatives of the governmental staff or connected with them. The managements of different institutions have been filled with persons loyal to the government. Independent applicants have been rejected without explanation or by created formal causes. The incomes of the government independent media had been dried up. These have been ceased with scarce exemptions.&lt;ref name="bbcNepszabadsag"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37596805 | title=Hungary's largest paper Nepszabadsag shuts, alleging pressure | publisher=BBC | date=11 October 2016 | accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reutersMN"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-election-media/major-hungarian-opposition-newspaper-to-close-after-orban-victory-idUSKBN1HH10S | title=Major Hungarian opposition newspaper to close after Orban victory | publisher=Reuters | date=10 April 2018 | accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subventions and advertisement expenditures of the state owned and government loyal companies have been directed to the purpose of the widely accessible propagandistic state media and to the government loyal press. The majority of the Hungarian population can only access government influenced radio stations. Only a single government independent television channel have been tolerated as a source of unfiltered news. The propaganda applies classical "[[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]]" cunnings. It regularly use war termini, and show up two typical imaginary public enemies: "[[Immigration|migrant]]s" and "[[George Soros]]".&lt;ref name="governmentinfo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/news/george-soros-and-his-network-are-doing-everything-possible-to-overthrow-governments-that-are-resisting-immigration | title=George Soros and his network are doing everything possible to overthrow governments that are resisting immigration | publisher=kormany.hu Cabinet Office of the Prime Minister | date=10 March 2018 | accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether these proceedings provided additional 2/3rd victories for the governmental party&lt;ref&gt;[[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018]]&lt;/ref&gt; and more unrestricted possibilities for the administration.

''Popular Tales from the Norse''. Edinburgh: David Douglass, 1888. [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/asbjornsenmoe/tatterhood.html "Tatterhood"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Aarne–Thompson]] type 711, the beautiful and the ugly twin.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, [http://www.pitt.edu/AFShome/d/a/dash/public/html/norway122.html "Tatterhood"]&lt;/ref&gt;  This tale type is quite common in Norway and Iceland and very rare elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 96, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the tale also appears in ''[[A Book of Witches]]'' and ''[[A Choice of Magic]]'', by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].

==Synopsis==
A king and queen had no children, which grieved the queen greatly.  To alleviate the queen's loneliness, they adopted a girl to raise as their own.  One day, when the queen saw her adopted daughter playing with a beggar girl, she scolded her adopted daughter and tried to drive the other girl off.  However, the beggar girl mentioned that her mother knows a way for the queen to become pregnant.

When the queen approached the beggar woman, the woman denies having such knowledge.  The queen treated the woman to as much wine as the woman pleased until the woman is drunk.  When the queen asked the drunk beggar woman how she could get a child of her own, the beggar woman told her to wash herself in two pails of water before going to bed, and afterward pour the water under the bed. The next morning, two flowers will have sprung up from under the bed: one fair and one rare. The beggar tells the queen that she must eat the beautiful one, but not to eat the hideous one no matter what. The queen followed this advice, and the next morning under the bed were two flowers. One was bright and lovely, and the other was black and foul. The queen ate the beautiful flower at once, but it tasted so sweet that she craved the other and ate it as well.

Not long afterward, the queen bore a child. She gave birth to a girl who carried a wooden spoon in her hand and rode upon a goat. She was very ugly and loud from the moment she was born.  The queen despairs having such a daughter until the girl tells her mother that her next child will be fair and agreeable.  As the girl promised, the queen gave birth to a second daughter, one who was born fair and sweet, which pleased the queen very much. The sisters were as different as they could be, but they were very fond of each other.  The elder daughter was named Tatterhood, because she wore a tattered hood over her unruly hair.

One Christmas Eve, when the girls were half grown, there was great noise in the gallery outside the queen's rooms.  When Tatterhood demanded to know what was causing the noise, the queen reluctantly reveals that it was a pack of trolls (in some versions, witches) who come to the palace every seven years.  Tatterhood, being headstrong, decides to drive the trolls off and instructs her mother keep the door tightly shut.  Worried about Tatterhood, Tatterhood's younger sister opens one of the doors during the battle with the trolls.  Her head is instantly snatched off by a troll and replaced with a calf's head, after which the trolls flee from the castle.

To restore her sister's head, Tatterhood sets off in a ship with no crew or company aside from her own sister.  They arrive at the isle of the trolls and Tatterhood battles the trolls and successfully regain her sister's head.  The sisters escape and arrive in a distant kingdom.  The king, a widower with one son, fell in love with the younger sister at first sight.  However, she declared she will not marry until Tatterhood does.  The king begged his son to marry Tatterhood, and eventually he reluctantly agreed. 

The two sisters were to be married to their grooms on the same day. The king, his young princess bride, and the king's son were regally adorned, while Tatterhood refused to dress up and happily wore her rags. As the couples rode to church to be married, Tatterhood asked her bridegroom why he did not ask why she rides a goat, and when he duly asked, she answered that she rode a grand horse, which it promptly becomes. She asked the prince why he does not ask why she carries a wooden spoon, which he asks, and she declares it to be a fan (or in some versions a wand), which it turns into. This is repeated with the tattered hood, which is turned into a golden crown, and with Tatterhood herself, whose beauty she declares to surpass her sister's, which it then does. The prince now understands that she chooses to appear ragged, and that her beauty matters not.  He now is glad to be married to her.

'''''The Contemporary Pacific: A Journal of Island Affairs''''' is an academic journal covering a wide range of disciplines with the aim of providing comprehensive coverage of contemporary developments in the entire Pacific Islands region, including [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Polynesia]]. It features refereed, readable articles that examine social, economic, political, ecological, and cultural topics, along with political reviews, book and media reviews, resource reviews, and a dialogue section with interviews and short essays. Each recent issue highlights the work of a [[Pacific Islander]] artist.

The journal was founded at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]] [[Center for Pacific Islands Studies]] under the directorship of [[Robert C. Kiste]], with then-CPIS faculty member [[Brij Lal (historian)|Brij Lal]] serving as editor of volumes 1-4. The historian [[David Hanlon]] edited volumes 5-10, the anthropologist [[Geoffrey M. White]] edited volumes 11-13, the playwright [[Vilsoni Hereniko]] edited volumes 14-20, and the political scientist [[Terence Wesley-Smith]] edits current volumes. The journal continues to be edited at the UH Center for Pacific Islands Studies and published by the [[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press]]. CPIS also edits and UH Press publishes the related [[Pacific Islands Monograph Series]].

From volume 15 (2003), the journal began featuring the work of a different Pacific Islander artist on the cover and inside each issue. Among the artists featured so far are [[John Pule]] of [[Niue]], [[Kapulani Landgraf]] of Hawai{{okina}}i, [[Rongotai Lomas]] of [[New Zealand]], [[Ake Lianga]] of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Meleanna Aluli Meyer]] of Hawai{{okina}}i, [[Ric R Castro]] of [[Guam]], [[Albert Wendt]] of [[Samoa]], [[Larry Santana]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Shigeyuki Kihara]] of [[New Zealand]], [[Ralph Regenvanu]] of [[Vanuatu]], [[Carl F.

'''''The Railway''''', widely known as '''''Gare Saint-Lazare''''', is an 1873 painting by [[Édouard Manet]].  It is the last painting by Manet of his favourite model, the fellow painter [[Victorine Meurent]], who was also the model for his earlier works ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'' and the ''[[Luncheon on the Grass]]''.  It was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1874, and donated to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. in 1956.

==Painting==
Meurent is depicted sitting to the left side of the frame, in front of an iron fence near the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] in Paris.  The pensive subject is wearing a dark hat and sombre deep blue dress with white details, and is looking towards the viewer, while a sleeping puppy, a fan and an open book rest in her lap. Next to her is a little girl, modelled by the daughter of Manet's neighbour {{ill|Alphonse Hirsch|de}}, a contrasting figure wearing a white dress with large blue bow, standing her back to the viewer, watching through the railings as a train passes beneath them. The black band in the girl's hair echoes the black band around the neck of the woman.  Instead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opted for the iron grating which "boldly stretches across the canvas" (Gay 106). The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. Modern apartment buildings can be seen in the background - including the house on the {{ill|Rue de Saint-Pétersbourg|fr}}, near the {{ill|Place de l'Europe|fr}}, where Manet had rented a studio since July 1872 - and also a signal box and the [[Pont de l'Europe]].

The arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus, separated from the background by the row of railings. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored.  Resting on a parapet to the right of the painting is a bunch of grapes, perhaps indicating that the painting was made in the autumn.  The dog may be a reference to [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]''; Manet had earlier echoed Titian's composition in his ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]''.

==Reception==
Historian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: "Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. [[caricature|Caricaturists]] ridiculed Manet's picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today".&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Katherine H.; Michael L. Keene. ''After the Vote Was Won: The Later Achievements of Fifteen Suffragists''. McFarland, 2010. p. 37. {{ISBN|0-7864-4938-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after it was completed, the painting was sold to baritone [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]].  It was sold in 1881 for 5,400 francs to the art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], who gave it several names: ''Enfant regardant le chemin de fer'', ''Le pont de l'Europe'', ''A la Gare St. Lazare'', and later just ''Gare St. Lazare''.  It was sold on 31 December 1898 for 100,000 francs to American [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer]]. His wife [[Louisine Havemeyer]] left 2,000 artworks to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York on her death in 1929, but she divided a small collection, including ''The Railway'', among her three children.  The painting was donated to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. in 1956 on the death of her son Horace Havemeyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=43340.0 |title=Art Object Page |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003025509/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=43340.0 |archivedate=2012-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23045">'''Todd Merlin Compton''' (born 1952) is an [[United States|American]] [[historian]] in the fields of [[Mormon history]] and [[Classics]]. Compton is an expert on [[List of Joseph Smith's wives|the plural wives of the LDS Church founder, Joseph Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/52371806-78/smith-says-women-wives.html.csp;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biographical background ==
Compton is a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Julie M. "An Interview with Todd Compton". http://www.timesandseasons.org/?p=2826. Accessed 1 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who lived for a number of years in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref name=Sign/&gt;  He has served an [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS mission]] to [[Latter-day Saint movement in Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal|first=Todd|last=Compton|title=Counter-Hierarchical Revelation|journal=[[Sunstone Magazine]]|volume=15|issue=2|date=June 1991|pages=34–41|format=[[PDF]]|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/082-34-41.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied violin with [[Richard Nibley]]&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; and has played electric violin with singer-songwriter Mark Davis.&lt;ref name=Sign/&gt;  In 1982 he completed a [[Master of Arts|master's degree]] from [[Brigham Young University]].  He later received a [[Ph.D.]] from [[UCLA]] in [[Classics]] (concentrating on [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Indo-European mythology]]) which he taught for a year at [[University of Southern California|USC]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;  He also taught at UCLA and [[California State University, Northridge]].  He has been an independent researcher since 1993, drawing a regular income by working as an ADS specialist for a law office.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

Compton began his serious work in Mormon history as a Visiting Fellow at [[the Huntington Library]] studying the journals of [[Eliza R. Snow]].  He found that his [[Classics]] background helped his Mormon history work by teaching him respect for these primary documents.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;  While researching, and trying to note people identified in Snow's journals, Compton found that he needed a good list of Joseph Smith's plural wives.  Not finding one, he began researching his own list, which eventually grew into his 1997 book, ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith''.

== Publications ==
Compton's notable works include ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith'', which was awarded the Best Book Award from both the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] and the [[Mormon History Association]].&lt;ref name=Sign&gt;{{cite web|title=In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith (publisher's site)|url=http://www.signaturebooks.com/insacred.htm|publisher=[[Signature Books]]|accessdate=2008-07-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316161600/http://signaturebooks.com/insacred.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mormon History Association also awarded him the 2002 Best Documentary Award for his and Charles Hatch's book ''A Widow's Tale, The 1884-1886 Diary of Helen Mar Kimball Whitney'', and the 1996 Award of Excellence for his article "A Trajectory of Plurality: An Overview of Joseph Smith's Thirty Three Plural Wives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MHA Awards|publisher=[[Mormon History Association]]|year=2006|url=http://www.mhahome.org/awards/07_Awards.pdf|accessdate=2008-07-14|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213160031/http://www.mhahome.org/awards/07_Awards.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''USA for Indonesia'''" is a [[parody]] sung to the 1985 tune "[[We Are the World]]," which was performed by [[USA for Africa]]. A parody of charity [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] songs, it mocks the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] disaster and its victims.  "USA for [[Indonesia]]" was aired on [[WQHT|WQHT-FM (Hot 97)]], a [[New York City]] radio station, during the week of January 17, 2005. The show's producer, [[Rick Del Gado]], wrote and produced the song, while [[shock jock]] [[Miss Jones (radio personality)|Miss Jones]] introduced it. This was a response to jolt the ratings when former Hot 97 morning hosts [[Star &amp; Buc Wild]] arrived at rival station [[WWPR-FM]]. The lyrics were deemed derogatory and offensive to many listeners, notably [[Asian Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/thefirenexttime/|title=The Fire Next Time {{!}} POV {{!}} PBS|last=POV|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miss Info]], a co-host of the now defunct radio show, made known her disagreement with the song being aired on the radio. Miss Jones accused her of feeling superior probably because she was Asian, and [[Todd Lynn]], another co-host of then-radio show said afterward that he thought he was going to start shooting Asians. Within about a week many listeners, politicians and [[civil rights]] groups held a protest rally outside Hot 97. New York City Councilman [[John Liu]] and [[Charles Barron]] talked to media and press reporters about this fiasco and demanded that disciplinary action be taken against Hot 97. Councilwoman [[Letitia James]] noted "If you're going to profit from hate, it's going to cost you and it's going to cost you dearly." The week following this protest rally, rap pioneer [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and other listeners held another protest rally, targeting Hot 97's misappropration of the [[hip hop culture]] and demanded a format change. Simultaneously, [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] and [[McDonald's]] as well as ''New York [[Newsday]]'' pulled their advertising from the station, resulting in the station's financial losses.

'''Vocabulary mismatch''' is a common phenomenon in the usage of natural languages, occurring when different people name the same thing or concept differently.

Furnas et al. (1987) were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem.&lt;ref&gt;Furnas, G., et al, The Vocabulary Problem in Human-System Communication, Communications of the ACM, 1987, 30(11), pp. 964-971.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their results show that on average 80% of the times different people (experts in the same field) will name the same thing differently.  There are usually tens of possible names that can be attributed to the same thing.  This research motivated the work on [[latent semantic indexing]].

The vocabulary mismatch between user created queries and relevant documents in a corpus causes the term mismatch problem in [[information retrieval]].  Zhao and Callan (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, L. and Callan, J., Term Necessity Prediction, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2010). Toronto, Canada, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem in a retrieval setting.  Their results show that an average query term fails to appear in 30-40% of the documents that are relevant to the user query.  They also showed that this probability of mismatch is a central probability in one of the fundamental probabilistic retrieval models, the [[Binary Independence Model]].  They developed novel term weight prediction methods that can lead to potentially 50-80% accuracy gains in retrieval over strong keyword retrieval models.  Further research along the line shows that expert users can use Boolean Conjunctive Normal Form expansion to improve retrieval performance by 50-300% over unexpanded keyword queries.&lt;ref name="cnf"&gt;Zhao, L. and Callan, J., Automatic term mismatch diagnosis for selective query expansion, SIGIR 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques that solve mismatch ==

* [[Stemming]]
* [[Full-text indexing]] instead of only indexing keywords or abstracts
* Indexing text on inbound links from other documents (or other [[Folksonomy|social tagging]]
* [[Query expansion]].  A 2012 study by Zhao and Callan&lt;ref name="cnf"/&gt; using expert created manual [[Conjunctive normal form]] queries has shown that searchonym expansion in the Boolean conjunctive normal form is much more effective than the traditional bag of word expansion e.g. [[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio expansion]].
* Translation-based models

'''James Butler Hickok''' (May 27, 1837 – August 2, 1876), better known as "'''Wild Bill'''" '''Hickok''', was a [[folk hero]] of the [[American Old West]] known for his work across the frontier as a [[droving|drover]], [[wagon master]], soldier, spy, [[reconnaissance|scout]], lawman, [[gunfighter]], gambler, showman, and [[actor]]. He earned a great deal of notoriety in his own time, much of it bolstered by the many outlandish and often fabricated [[Tall tale|tales]] that he told about his life. Some contemporaneous reports of his exploits are known to be fictitious, but they remain the basis of much of his fame and reputation, along with his own stories.

Hickok was born and raised on a farm in northern [[Illinois]] at a time when lawlessness and [[vigilante]] activity were rampant because of the influence of the "[[Banditti of the Prairie]]". Hickok was drawn to this ruffian lifestyle and headed west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice, working as a [[stagecoach]] driver and later as a lawman in the frontier territories of [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]]. He fought and spied for the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]] and gained publicity after the war as a scout, [[marksman]], actor, and professional gambler. Over the course of his life, he was involved in several notable shoot-outs.

In 1876, Hickok was shot from behind and killed while playing [[poker]] in a [[Bar|saloon]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Dakota Territory]] (present-day [[South Dakota]]) by [[Jack McCall]], an unsuccessful gambler. The hand of cards which he supposedly held at the time of his death has become known as the [[dead man's hand]]: two pairs, aces and eights.

Hickok remains a popular figure in frontier history. Many historic sites and monuments commemorate his life, and he has been [[List of cultural depictions of Wild Bill Hickok|depicted numerous times]] in literature, film, and television. He is chiefly portrayed as a protagonist, though historical accounts of his actions are often controversial and most of his career was exaggerated by both himself and various mythmakers. While Hickok claimed to have killed numerous named and unnamed gunmen in his lifetime, according to [[Joseph G. Rosa]], Hickok's biographer and the foremost authority on Wild Bill, Hickok killed only six or seven men in gunfights.&lt;ref name="True"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://truewestmagazine.com/how-many-men-did-wild-bill-hickok-actually-kill/|title=How many men did Wild Bill Hickok actually kill?|publisher=''[[True West Magazine]]''|author=Trimble, Marshall}} April 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, Joseph G. ''Wild Bill Hickok, Gunfighter: An Account of Hickok's Gunfights''. University of Oklahoma Press; 1st edition (May 26, 2003). p. 198. {{ISBN|978-0806135359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James Butler Hickok was born May 27, 1837, in Homer, Illinois, (present-day [[Troy Grove, Illinois]]) to William Alonzo Hickok, a farmer and [[abolitionism|abolitionist]], and his wife Polly Butler.&lt;ref&gt;''They Called Him Wild Bill: The Life and Adventures of James Butler Hickok''. pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was said to have used the family house, now demolished, as a station on the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Gene F. |title=Vi's Secret: A Family's Story |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=YpQwhk28YtIC&amp;pg=PA9 |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |year=2008 |page=9 |isbn=9780595466252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickok was the fourth of six children. William Hickok died in 1852, when James was 15.&lt;ref name=odrowaz/&gt;

Hickok was a good shot from a young age and was recognized locally as an outstanding marksman with a pistol.&lt;ref name="Black Hills"&gt;{{cite web | title = James Butler 'Wild Bill' Hickok, Early Deadwood | work = Black Hills Visitor Magazine | url = http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/all-articles-directory.html?pid=878&amp;sid=918:James-Butler-Wild-Bill-Hickok-Early-Deadwood| accessdate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographs of Hickok appear to depict dark hair, but all contemporaneous descriptions affirm that it was red. (Reddish shades of hair appear black in early photographic processes because of their sensitivity, primarily to blue light.)&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, Joseph G. (1979). ''They Called Him Wild Bill''. University Press of Oklahoma. p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, at age 18, James Hickok fled Illinois following a fight with Charles Hudson, during which both fell into a canal (each thought, mistakenly, that he had killed the other). Hickok moved to [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]] in the [[Kansas Territory]], where he joined "General" [[James H. Lane (politician)|Jim Lane's]] Free State Army (also known as the [[Jayhawker]]s), a vigilante group active in the new territory.&lt;ref&gt;Jayhawkers were also often referred to as "Red Legs" because of the distinctive feature of their uniform leggings.&lt;/ref&gt; While a Jayhawker, he met 12-year-old [[Buffalo Bill|William Cody]] (later known as Buffalo Bill), who despite his youth served as a scout just two years later for the U.S. Army during the [[Utah War]].&lt;ref name="Martin1"&gt;{{cite book | first=George| last=Martin| editor=James Garry  |title=Guns of the Gunfighters| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Guns_of_the_gunfighters.html?id=Az1QAAAACAAJ| publisher=Peterson Publishing| isbn=0-8227-0095-6| year=1975| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicknames ===
[[File:James Hickok.jpg|thumb|James B. Hickok, in the 1860s, during his pre-gunfighter days]]
While in Nebraska, James Hickok was derisively referred to as "Duck Bill" for his long nose and protruding lips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weiser |first1=Kathy|title=Nebraska Legends: Rock Creek Station and the McCanles Massacre |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ne-rockcreek.html|website=Legends of America |accessdate=October 31, 2016|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''They Called Him Wild Bill: The Life and Adventures of James Butler Hickok''. p.&amp;nbsp;51: the name was inspired by his "sweeping nose and protruding upper lip".&lt;/ref&gt; He grew a moustache following the [[David McCanles|McCanles]] incident and in 1861 began calling himself Wild Bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/lib-arch/research/treasures/wild_bill_hickok.htm "Wild Bill" Hickok Court Documents]. [[Nebraska State Historical Society]]. 1861 subpoena issued to Monroe McCanles to testify against Duck Bill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fido, Martin (1993). ''The Chronicle of Crime''. p. 24 (citing an 1861 newspaper article reporting the McCanles shooting). {{ISBN|1-84442-623-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known before 1861 by Jayhawkers as "Shanghai Bill" because of his height and slim build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelsey, D.

Hickok used his late brother's name, William Hickok, from 1858 and the name William Haycock during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Most newspapers referred to him as William Haycock until 1869. He was arrested while using the name Haycock in 1865. He afterward resumed using his given name, James Hickok. Military records after 1865 list him as Hickok but note that he was also known as Haycock.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Nyle H. (200). ''Why the West Was Wild''.

In 1857, Hickok claimed a 160-acre (65-ha) tract in [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]], Kansas (near present-day [[Lenexa, Kansas|Lenexa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.lenexa.ks.us/police/history.html |title="The Lenexa Police Department History" |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624023800/http://www.ci.lenexa.ks.us/police/history.html |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |df=mdy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, 1858, he was elected one of the first four constables of [[Monticello Township, Johnson County, Kansas|Monticello Township]]. In 1859, he joined the [[Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company| Russell, Majors and Waddell freight company]], the parent company of the [[Pony Express]].

In 1860, he was badly injured by a bear while driving a freight team from [[Independence, Missouri]] to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. According to Hickok's account, he found the road blocked by a [[cinnamon bear]] and its two cubs. Dismounting, he approached the bear and fired a shot into its head, but the bullet ricocheted off its skull, infuriating it. The bear attacked, crushing Hickok with its body. Hickok managed to fire another shot, wounding the bear's paw. The bear then grabbed his arm in its mouth, but Hickok was able to grab his knife and slash its throat, killing it.

Hickok was severely injured, with a crushed chest, shoulder and arm. He was bedridden for four months before being sent to [[Rock Creek Station]] in the [[Nebraska Territory]] to work as a stable hand while he recovered. The freight company had built the stagecoach stop along the [[Oregon Trail]] near [[Fairbury, Nebraska]], on land purchased from David McCanles.&lt;ref name="Kelsey"&gt;Kelsey, D. M. (2004).

[[File:David C McCanless.jpg|thumb|David C. McCanles, alleged leader of the [[McCanles Gang]], in 1860]]
On July 12, 1861, David McCanles went to the Rock Creek Station office to demand an overdue property payment from Horace Wellman, the station manager. McCanles reportedly threatened Wellman, and either Hickok (who was hiding behind a curtain) or Wellman killed him.&lt;ref name=rosa&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosa|first1=Joseph G.|title=They Called Him Wild Bill: The Life and Adventures of James Butler Hickok |date=1987 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=978-0806115382|edition=second |pages= 45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock Creek Station State Historical Park|url=http://www.fairbury.com/pages/history/rock_creek.html|publisher=Main Street Consulting Group|accessdate=December 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224000043/http://www.fairbury.com/pages/history/rock_creek.html#|archive-date=December 24, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hickok, Wellman, and another employee, J.W. Brink, were tried for killing McCanles but were found to have acted in self-defense. McCanles may have been the first man Hickok killed.&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt; Hickok subsequently visited McCanles' widow, apologized for the killing, and offered her $35 in restitution, all the money he had with him at the time.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Personal account of the foreman of the Overland Stage Company stations, as given to ''The DeWitt Times News'': &lt;blockquote&gt;At the time of this affair I was at a station farther west and reached this station just as Wild Bill was getting ready to go to [[Beatrice, Nebraska|Beatrice]] for his trial. He wanted me to go with him and as we started on our way, imagine my surprise and uncomfortable feeling when he announced his intention of stopping at the McCanles home. I would have rather been somewhere else, but Bill stopped. He told Mrs. McCanles he was sorry he had to kill her man then took out $35 [${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35|1861}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars] and gave it to her saying: 'This is all I have, sorry I do not have more to give you.' We drove on to Beatrice and at the trial, his plea was self-defense, no one appeared against him and he was cleared. The trial did not last more than fifteen minutes.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War service===
After the Civil War broke out in April 1861, James Hickok became a teamster for the Union Army in [[Sedalia, Missouri]]. By the end of 1861, he was a [[wagon master]], but in September 1862 he was discharged for unknown reasons. He then joined General [[James Henry Lane (Union general)|James Henry Lane]]'s Kansas Brigade and, while serving with the brigade, saw his friend [[Buffalo Bill Cody]], who was serving as a scout.

In late 1863 he worked for the [[provost marshal]] of southwest [[Missouri]] as a member of the [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]] detective police. His work included identifying and counting the number of troops in uniform who were drinking while on duty, verifying hotel liquor licenses, and tracking down individuals who owed money to the cash-strapped Union Army.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Buffalo Bill claimed that he encountered Hickok disguised as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer in Missouri in 1864.&lt;ref name="JGRosa"&gt;Rosa, Joseph G. [http://www.ozarkscivilwar.org/archives/585 ''James 'Wild Bill' Hickok''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cody"&gt;''The Life of Hon. William F.

In June, Hickok mustered out and went to Springfield, where he gambled.&lt;ref name="JGRosa" /&gt; The 1883 ''History of Greene County, Missouri'' described him as "by nature a ruffian ... a drunken, swaggering fellow, who delighted when 'on a spree' to frighten nervous men and timid women."&lt;ref name="WHC"&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.net/mo/greene/bios/t3000004.txt ''The Killing of David Tutt''], 1865.

===Duel with Davis Tutt===
{{Main|Wild Bill Hickok – Davis Tutt shootout}}

While in Springfield, Hickok and a local gambler named [[Davis Tutt]] had several disagreements over unpaid gambling debts and their mutual affection for the same women. Hickok lost a gold watch to Tutt in a poker game. The watch had great sentimental value to Hickok and he asked Tutt not to wear it in public.
They initially agreed not to fight over the watch, but when Hickok saw Tutt wearing it, he warned him to stay away. On July 21, 1865, the two men faced off in Springfield's town square, standing sideways before drawing and firing their weapons. Their [[Fast draw|quick-draw]] [[duel]] was recorded as the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWhickok.htm|title=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=April 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412092615/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWhickok.htm|archivedate=April 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tutt's shot missed, but Hickok's struck Tutt through the heart from about {{convert|75|yd|m}} away.

Two days later, Hickok was arrested for murder. The charge was later reduced to manslaughter. He was released on $2,000 bail and stood trial on August 3, 1865. At the end of the trial, Judge [[Sempronius H. Boyd]] told the jury they could not find Hickok acted in self-defense if he could have reasonably avoided the fight.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Judge Boyd told the jury, "The defendant cannot set up justification that he acted in self-defense if he was willing to engage in a fight with the deceased. To be entitled to acquittal on the ground of self-defense, he must have been anxious to avoid a conflict, and must have used all reasonable means to avoid it. If the deceased and defendant engaged in a fight or conflict willingly on the part of each, and the defendant killed the deceased, he is guilty of the offense charged, although the deceased may have fired the first shot."&lt;/ref&gt; However, if they felt the threat of danger was real and imminent, he instructed they could apply the unwritten law of the "fair fight" and acquit.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Judge Boyd said, "That when danger is threatened and impending a man is not compelled to stand with his arms folded until it is too late to offer successful resistance and if the jury believe from the evidence that Tutt was a fighting character and a dangerous man and that [Defendant] was aware such was his character and that Tutt at the time he was shot by the Deft. was advancing on him with a drawn pistol and that Tutt had previously made threats of personal injury to Deft. ... and that Deft. shot Tutt to prevent the threatened impending injury [then] the jury will acquit."&lt;/ref&gt; The jury voted to clear Hickok, resulting in public backlash and criticism of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lubet |first=Steven |author-link=Steven Lubet |year=2001 |url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/ucla/lubet48.htm |title=Legal Culture, Wild Bill Hickok and the Gunslinger Myth |journal=[[UCLA Law Review]] |volume=48 |issue=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213073825/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/ucla/lubet48.htm |archive-date=February 13, 2007 |publisher=[[The University of Texas]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks later, an interview Hickok gave to Colonel [[George Ward Nichols]], a journalist known as the creator of the Hickok legend,&lt;ref&gt;Rosa J. G. ''[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40168620?uid=3738936&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103441111073 George Ward Nichols and the Legend of Wild Bill Hickok]'' // Arizona and the West. Vol. 19, №. 2, Summer, 1977. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]''. Under the name "Wild Bill Hitchcock"{{sic}}, the article recounted the "hundreds" of men whom Hickok had personally killed and other exaggerated exploits.&lt;ref name="twain"/&gt; The article was controversial wherever Hickok was known, and several frontier newspapers wrote rebuttals.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Deputy U.S. marshal in Kansas===
In September 1865, Hickok came in second in the election for city marshal of Springfield. Leaving Springfield, he was recommended for the position of [[United States Marshal Service|deputy federal marshal]] at [[Fort Riley]], Kansas. This was during the [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]], in which Hickok sometimes served as a scout for General [[George Armstrong Custer|George A. Custer]]'s [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Martin1"/&gt;

In 1865, Hickok recruited six [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] to accompany him to [[Niagara Falls]], where he put on an outdoor demonstration called ''The Daring Buffalo Chasers of the Plains''.&lt;ref name=odrowaz&gt;Odrowaz-Sypniewska, Margaret. [http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/WBHickok.html James Butler Hickok/"Wild Bill"].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the event was outdoors, he could not compel people to pay, and the venture was a financial failure.&lt;ref name=buel/&gt;{{rp|34}}

===Killings of Native Americans===
Hickok was reported by some{{by whom|date=June 2016}} to be "an inveterate hater of Indians", perhaps to enhance his reputation as a scout and Indian fighter, but it is difficult to separate fact from fiction considering his recruitment of Native Americans to cross the nation in order to appear in his own Wild West show.&lt;ref name=odrowaz/&gt; Witnesses confirm that while working as a scout at [[Fort Harker (Kansas)|Fort Harker, Kansas]], on May&amp;nbsp;11, 1867, he was attacked by a large group of Indians, who fled after he shot and killed two. In July, Hickok told a newspaper reporter that he had led several soldiers in pursuit of Indians who had killed four men near the fort on July 2. He reported returning with five prisoners after killing ten. Witnesses confirm that the story was true to the extent the party had set out to find whoever had killed the four men,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;For details, see [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1867-07-01/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=06%2F26%2F1867&amp;index=0&amp;date2=07%2F31%2F1867&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Battles+Indians&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=Battles+with+Indians&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 ''Evening Star''], July 1, 1867, which contains a garbled report of eleven men killed by Indians at Fort Harker. It also reports the death of one and the wounding of a second railroad man by Indians near Fort Harker (the two casualties are confirmed). The report of the larger number of deaths may confuse this incident with another fight with Indians, at [[Fort Wallace]], Kansas, in which a number of soldiers were killed and wounded. For the Fort Wallace fight and casualties, see [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1867-07-15/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=06%2F26%2F1867&amp;index=8&amp;date2=07%2F31%2F1867&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=battle+Indian&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=Battles+with+Indians&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 ''The Sun''], July 15, 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; but the group returned to the fort "without nary a dead Indian, [never] even seeing a live one".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Nyle H. (2003). ''Why the West was Wild''. University Press of Oklahoma. p. 185. {{ISBN|0-8061-3530-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For confirmation that Hickok was employed as a U.S. Army scout fighting Indians in Kansas in the summer of 1867, see Ames, George Augustus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yVAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ups+and+Downs+of+a+Army+Officer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT6tHtp__KAhUJ_R4KHfsrA98Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ups%20and%20Downs%20of%20a%20Army%20Officer&amp;f=false ''Ups and Downs of a Army Officer''], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shootout in Nebraska===
In 1867, Hickok reportedly was involved in a dispute with drunken cowboys inside a saloon in [[Jefferson County, Nebraska]]. One of them pushed him, causing him to drop his drink. Hickok struck the man, and four of his friends rose with guns drawn. Hickok persuaded the men to step outside where he faced all four at 15 paces, or about {{convert|40|ft}}. The bartender counted down and Hickok killed three of the men with a bullet to the head and wounded the fourth with a shot through the cheek bone. Hickok was wounded in the shoulder.&lt;ref name=buel&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2ZNAAAAYAAJ |title=Life and Marvelous Adventures of Wild Bill, the Scout |first1=James William |last1=Buel |year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–43}}

Later that year, he moved to Kansas, where he ran for sheriff in [[Ellsworth County, Kansas|Ellsworth County]] on November 5, 1867. He was defeated by a former soldier, E.W. Kingsbury.

===Move to Hays, Kansas===
In December 1867, newspapers reported that Hickok had come to stay in [[Hays, Kansas|Hays City, Kansas]]. He became a Deputy U.S. marshal, and on March 28, 1868, he picked up eleven Union Army deserters who had been charged with stealing government property. Hickok was assigned to bring the men to [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] for trial, and he requested a military escort from Fort Hays. He was assigned [[Buffalo Bill|William F. Cody]], a sergeant, and five privates. They arrived in Topeka on April 2. Hickok remained in Hays through August 1868, when he brought 200 [[Cheyenne Indians]] to Hays to be viewed by "[[Tourist attraction|excursionists]]".&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;

===Work as a scout===
On September 1, Hickok was in [[Lincoln County, Kansas]], where he was hired as a scout by the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]], a segregated African-American unit. On September 4, Hickok was wounded in the foot while rescuing several cattlemen in the [[Bijou Creek]] [[Colorado drainage basins|Basin]] who had been surrounded by Indians. The 10th Regiment arrived at [[Fort Lyon]] in [[Colorado]] in October and remained there for the rest of 1868.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller, Nyle H. (2003). ''Why the West Was Wild''. University Press of Oklahoma. pp. 186–189. {{ISBN|0-8061-3530-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marshal of Hays, Kansas===
[[File:Wild-Bill-3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wild Bill Hickok in 1869; the unsheathed knife is likely a photographer's prop.]]
In July 1869, Hickok returned to Hays and was elected [[city marshal]] of Hays and sheriff of [[Ellis County, Kansas]], in a special election held on August&amp;nbsp;23, 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droversmercantile.com/history.cfm |title=Ellsworth, Kansas History |publisher=Droversmercantile.com |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66kpvHw45?url=http://www.droversmercantile.com/history.cfm |archivedate=April 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three sheriffs had quit during the previous 18 months. Hickok may have been acting sheriff before he was elected; a newspaper reported that he arrested offenders on August 18, and the commander of Fort Hays wrote a letter to the assistant [[adjutant general]] on August 21 in which he praised Hickok for his work in apprehending deserters.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The "special election" may not have been legal, as a letter dated September 17 to the governor of Kansas noted that Hickok had presented a warrant for an arrest which was rejected by the Fort Hays commander, because, when asked to produce his commission, Hickok admitted that he had never received one.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular county election was held on November 2, 1869, and Hickok, running as an independent, lost to his deputy, Peter Lanihan, running as a Democrat, but Hickok and Lanihan remained sheriff and deputy, respectively. Hickok accused a J.V. Macintosh of irregularities and misconduct during the election. On December 9, Hickok and Lanihan both served legal papers on Macintosh, and local newspapers acknowledged that Hickok had guardianship of Hays City.&lt;ref name=miller2/&gt;{{rp|196}}

===Killings as sheriff===
[[Image:MVI 2987 Hickok on Texas Trail of Fame.jpg|left|thumb|Hickok's star on the Texas Trail of Fame in the [[Fort Worth Stockyards]], Texas]]
In September 1869, his first month as sheriff, Hickok killed two men. The first was Bill Mulvey, who was rampaging through town, drunk, shooting out mirrors and whisky bottles behind bars. Citizens warned Mulvey to behave, because Hickok was sheriff. Mulvey angrily declared that he had come to town to kill Hickok. When he saw Hickok, he leveled his cocked rifle at him. Hickok waved his hand past Mulvey at some onlookers and yelled, "Don't shoot him in the back; he is drunk." Mulvey wheeled his horse around to face those who might shoot him from behind, and before he realized he had been fooled, Hickok shot him through the temple.&lt;ref name="Martin1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RiZknWJqjAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16 |title=My Life on the Frontier, 1864–1882 |year=1936 |publisher=Sunstone Press |first1=  Miguel Antonio |last1=Otero |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second killed by Hickok was Samuel Strawhun, a cowboy, who was causing a disturbance at 1 a.m. in a saloon on September 27 when Hickok and Lanihan went to the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWhickok.htm |title=Wild Bill Hickok: Biography |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412092615/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWhickok.htm |archivedate=April 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strawhun "made remarks against Hickok," and Hickok killed him with a shot through the head. Hickok said he had "tried to restore order". At the coroner's inquest into Strawhun's death, despite "very contradictory" evidence from witnesses, the jury found the shooting justifiable.&lt;ref name=miller2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Nyle H.|last2=Rosa|first2=Joseph W. |title=Why the West Was Wild: A Contemporary Look at the Antics of Some Highly Publicized Kansas Cowtown Personalities|year=1963|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=0-8061-3530-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|192}}

On July 17, 1870, Hickok was attacked by two troopers from the [[7th U.S. Cavalry]], Jeremiah Lonergan and John Kyle (sometimes spelled Kile&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{cite web |quote=John Kyle was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] on 8 July 1869, at [[Republican River]], Kansas, during the Indian campaigns |url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/gravesites/states/pages_go/kyle_john.html |title=Kyle John |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014051615/http://www.homeofheroes.com/gravesites/states/pages_go/kyle_john.html# |archive-date=October 14, 2008 |year=1999 |work=HomeOfHeroes |access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in a saloon. Lonergan pinned Hickok to the ground, and Kyle put his gun to Hickok's ear. When Kyle's weapon misfired, Hickok shot Lonergan, wounding him in the knee, and shot Kyle twice, killing him. Hickok was not re-elected to office.

===Marshal of Abilene, Kansas===
On April 15, 1871, Hickok became marshal of [[Abilene, Kansas]]. He replaced [[Thomas J. Smith|Tom "Bear River" Smith]], who had been killed on November 2, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=12490 |title=Officer Down Memorial Page: Thomas J.

[[File:John Wesley Hardin.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[John Wesley Hardin]], a well-known gunfighter, who was known to have killed at least 27 men. In his autobiography, Hardin made the unlikely claim that while surrendering his guns to the lawman due to a [[local ordinance]], he had once disarmed Town Marshal "Wild Bill" Hickok with the use of  "[[road agent's spin|the road agent's spin]]."]]

The outlaw [[John Wesley Hardin]] arrived in Abilene at the end of a cattle drive in early 1871. Hardin was a well-known gunfighter and is known to have killed more than 27 men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85032573/1877-08-30/ed-1/seq-2/ "Hardin Credited with 27 Killings"].

(1996). ''Wild Bill Hickok: The Man and His Myth''. University Press of Kansas. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickok later said he did not know that "Wesley Clemmons" was Hardin's alias and that he was a wanted outlaw. He told Clemmons (Hardin) to stay out of trouble in Abilene and asked him to hand over his guns, and Hardin complied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bowen/hardincaptorkiller.html Border Roll Incident].&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin claimed that when his cousin, Mannen Clements, was jailed for killing two cowhands, he persuaded Hickok to arrange for his escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewittliffcollections.txstate.edu/research/a-z/hardin.html John Wesley Hardin Collection]. [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Texas State University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1871, "Wild Bill" Hickok sought to arrest Hardin for killing Charles Couger in an Abilene hotel "for snoring too loud". Hardin left Kansas before Hickok could arrest him.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Shootout with Phil Coe===
Hickok and [[Phil Coe]], a saloon owner and acquaintance of Hardin's, had a dispute that resulted in a shootout.

Infuriated, Thompson tried to incite John Wesley Hardin to kill Hickok, by exclaiming to Hardin that "He's a damn Yankee. Picks on rebels, especially Texans, to kill." Hardin was in town under his assumed name Wesley Clemmons but was better known to the townspeople by the alias Little Arkansas. He seemed to have respect for Hickok's abilities and replied, "If Bill needs killing why don't you kill him yourself?"&lt;ref name="Hardin Autobiography"&gt;{{cite book | first = John Wesley |last = Hardin | authorlink=John Wesley Hardin | title = The Life of John Wesley Hardin: As Written by Himself | isbn = 978-0-8061-1051-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jLM-AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=john+wesley+hardin#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | publisher = Smith &amp; Moore | location=Seguin, Texas | page=44 | year = 1896 |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to intimidate Hickok, Coe allegedly stated that he could "kill a crow on the wing". Hickok's retort is one of the West's most famous sayings (though possibly apocryphal): "Did the crow have a pistol? Was he shooting back? I will be."

On October 5, 1871, Hickok was standing off a crowd during a street brawl when Coe fired two shots. Hickok ordered him to be arrested for firing a pistol within the city limits. Coe claimed that he was shooting at a stray dog, and then suddenly turned his gun on Hickok, who fired first and killed Coe.&lt;ref&gt;Shooting stray dogs within city limits was legal, and a 50-cent bounty was paid by the city for each one shot.&lt;/ref&gt; Hickok caught a glimpse of someone running toward him and quickly fired two more shots in reaction, accidentally shooting and killing Abilene Special Deputy Marshal Mike Williams, who was coming to his aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/16507-special-deputy-marshal-mike-williams|title=Special Deputy Marshal Mike Williams|work=The Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event haunted Hickok for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nj.essortment.com/whowildbillhi_rgvu.htm |title=Who Was Wild Bill Hickok? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902172148/http://nj.essortment.com/whowildbillhi_rgvu.htm |archive-date=September 2, 2006 |year=2002 |first=Darrell |last=Baizley |access-date=28 August 2018 |publisher=Pagewise |work=Essortment}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another account of the Coe shootout: Theophilus Little, the mayor of Abilene and owner of the town's lumber yard, recorded his time in Abilene by writing in a notebook which was ultimately given to the Abilene Historical Society. Writing in 1911, he detailed his admiration of Hickok and included a paragraph on the shooting that differs considerably from the reported account:

{{quote|"Phil" Coe was from Texas, ran the "Bull's Head" a saloon and gambling den, sold whiskey and men's souls. As vile a character as I ever met for some cause Wild Bill incurred Coe's hatred and he vowed to secure the death of the marshal. Not having the courage to do it himself, he one day filled about 200 cowboys with whiskey intending to get them into trouble with Wild Bill, hoping that they would get to shooting and in the melee shoot the marshal. But Coe "reckoned without his host". Wild Bill had learned of the scheme and cornered Coe, had his two pistols drawn on Coe. Just as he pulled the trigger one of the policemen rushed around the corner between Coe and the pistols and both balls entered his body, killing him instantly. In an instant, he pulled the triggers again sending two bullets into Coe's abdomen (Coe lived a day or two) and whirling with his two guns drawn on the drunken crowd of cowboys, "and now do any of you fellows want the rest of these bullets?" Not a word was uttered.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Theophilus. [http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pasulliv/settlers/settlers25/WildBill.htm "Early Days in Abilene"]. Loose-leaf notebook, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hickok was relieved of his duties as marshal less than two months after accidentally killing Deputy Williams, this incident being only one of a series of questionable shootings and claims of misconduct.&lt;ref name="Black Hills"/&gt;

==Later life==
[[Image:Wild-Bill-Buffalo-Bill.jpg|thumb|right|Hickok, [[Texas Jack Omohundro]], and [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] as the "Scouts of the Plains" in 1873]]
In 1873, Buffalo Bill Cody and [[Texas Jack Omohundro]] invited Hickok to join their troupe after their earlier success.&lt;ref name="cody"/&gt;{{rp|329}} Hickok did not enjoy acting, and often hid behind scenery. In one show he shot the spotlight when it focused on him.

(Blackfoot, Idaho)|date=November 2, 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, Hickok was diagnosed by a doctor in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], with [[glaucoma]] and [[ophthalmia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Alhough he was just 39, his marksmanship and health were apparently in decline, and he had been arrested several times for [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87052128/1876-08-18/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1869&amp;index=0&amp;date2=1922&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Hickok+William&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=William+Hickok&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|title=The State Journal (Jefferson City, Mo.), 1872–1886.

==Marriages==
Martha Jane Cannary, known popularly as [[Calamity Jane]], claimed in her autobiography that she was married to Hickok and had divorced him so he could be free to marry Agnes Lake, but no records have been found that support her account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Griske  | first = Michael | authorlink = | title = The Diaries of John Hunton |publisher = Heritage Books  |year = 2005  |location =  |pages = 89, 90  | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-7884-3804-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two possibly met for the first time after Jane was released from the guardhouse in [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]] and joined the wagon train in which Hickok was traveling. The wagon train arrived in Deadwood in July 1876.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/main.asp?id=14&amp;cat_id=30243 "Charlie Utter, Early Deadwood"]. ''Black Hills Visitor Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jane confirmed this account in an 1896 newspaper interview, although she claimed she had been hospitalized with illness rather than in the guardhouse.

On March 5, 1876, Hickok married Agnes Thatcher Lake, a 50-year-old circus proprietor in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], [[Wyoming Territory]]. Hickok left his new bride a few months later, joining [[Charlie Utter]]'s wagon train to seek his fortune in the goldfields of [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref name="Martin1"/&gt; 
[[File:Wild Bill Hickok tintype.png|thumb|right|250px|A rare [[tintype]] of Hickok, circa 1870, found with the last letter he wrote to his wife, Agnes Thatcher Lake]] 
Shortly before Hickok's death, he wrote a letter to his new wife, which read in part, "Agnes Darling, if such should be we never meet again, while firing my last shot, I will gently breathe the name of my wife&amp;mdash;Agnes&amp;mdash;and with wishes even for my enemies I will make the plunge and try to swim to the other shore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpYWQPAGmPUC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Famous Last Words|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On August 1, 1876, Hickok was playing poker at [[Nuttal &amp; Mann's Saloon]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Dakota Territory]]. When a seat opened up at the table, a drunk man named [[Jack McCall]] sat down to play. McCall lost heavily. Hickok encouraged McCall to quit the game until he could cover his losses and offered to give him money for breakfast. Although McCall accepted the money, he was apparently insulted.&lt;ref name="McCall"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-jackmccall.html |title=Jack McCall - The Coward That Killed Wild Bill Hickok |website=Legends of America |date=November 2014 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Hickok was playing poker again. He usually sat with his back to a wall so he could see the entrance, but the only seat available when he joined the game was a chair facing away from the door. He twice asked another man at the table, Charles Rich, to change seats with him, but Rich refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wild Bill's Death Chair |url=http://www.icatweb.com/ropaweb/photos/southdakota/deadwood/deadwood18.html |work=Deadwood photos |accessdate=July 31, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313061938/http://www.icatweb.com/ropaweb/photos/southdakota/deadwood/deadwood18.html |archivedate=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCall entered the saloon, walked up behind Hickok, drew his Colt's Model 1873 Single Action Army .45 caliber revolver, and shouted, "Damn you! Take that!" He shot Hickok in the back of the head at point-blank range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last=Campagna| first=Jeff| title=American Wonder Wild Bill Hickok Shot and Killed from Behind on This Day in History| url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/aroundthemall/2011/08/american-wonder-wild-bill-hickok-shot-and-killed-from-behind-on-this-day-in-history/| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hickok died instantly.

===Jack McCall's two trials===
[[image:Jack McCall.jpg|rt|thumb|[[Jack McCall]] shot Hickok in the back of the head]]
[[Image:Dead man's hand.jpg|left|thumb|The card hand held by Hickok at his death, now widely known as the "[[dead man's hand]]"]]
McCall's motive for killing Hickok is the subject of speculation, largely concerning McCall's anger at Hickok's having given him money for breakfast the day before, after McCall had lost heavily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLaird|first=James D.|title=Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane: Deadwood Legends|year=2008|publisher=South Dakota State Historical Society|isbn=0977795594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcmanus&gt;{{cite book|last=McManus|first=James|title=Cowboys Full: The Story of Poker|year=2009|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=0374299242|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCall was summoned before an informal "miners' jury" (an ad hoc local group of miners and businessmen). McCall claimed he was avenging Hickok's earlier slaying of his brother, which may have been true. (A man named Lew McCall was killed by an unknown lawman in Abilene, Kansas, but it is not known if the two McCall men were related.)&lt;ref name=mcmanus/&gt; McCall was acquitted of the murder, which prompted editorializing in the ''[[Black Hills Pioneer]]'': "Should it ever be our misfortune to kill a man ... we would simply ask that our trial may take place in some of the mining camps of these hills." [[Calamity Jane]] was reputed to have led a mob that threatened McCall with lynching, but at the time of Hickok's death, Jane was being held by military authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Griske (2005). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

After bragging about killing Hickok, McCall was re-arrested. The second trial was not considered [[double jeopardy]] because of the irregular jury in the first trial and because Deadwood was in Indian country. The new trial was held in [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]], the capital of the [[Dakota Territory]]. Hickok's brother, Lorenzo Butler, traveled from Illinois to attend the retrial. McCall was found guilty and sentenced to death.

[[Leander Richardson]], a reporter, interviewed McCall shortly before his execution and wrote an article about him for the April 1877 issue of [[Charles Scribner's Sons|''Scribner's Monthly'']]. Butler spoke with McCall after the trial and said McCall showed no remorse.&lt;ref name=richardson&gt;{{cite journal|title =A Trip to the Black Hills  |first1=Leander P. |last1=Richardson |journal =Scribner's |date=April 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As I write the closing lines of this brief sketch, word reaches me that the slayer of Wild Bill has been rearrested by the United State authorities, and after trial has been sentenced to death for willful murder. He is now at Yankton, D.T. awaiting execution.

When Varnes could not be found, McCall then implicated Tim Brady in the plot. Brady, like Varnes, had disappeared from Deadwood and could not be found.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=richardson/&gt;}}

Jack McCall was [[hanged]] on March 1, 1877 and buried in a Roman Catholic cemetery. The cemetery was moved in 1881, and when McCall's body was exhumed, the [[noose]] was found still around his neck.&lt;ref name=blackhills&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/main.asp?id=14&amp;cat_id=30247 |title="Jack McCall and the Murder of Wild Bill Hickok" |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313061946/http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/main.asp?id=14&amp;cat_id=30247 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df=mdy}}. ''Black Hills Visitor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dead man's hand===
{{Main|Dead man's hand}}
Hickok was playing [[five-card stud]] when he was shot. He was holding two pairs: black aces and black eights as his "up cards". The identity of the fifth card (his "[[hole card]]") is the subject of debate.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;''[[Dead man's hand]]'' was an established poker [[idiom]] for various different hands long before Hickok died. In 1886, ten years after Hickok's death, the dead man's hand was described as "three Jacks and a pair of Tens" in a [[North Dakota]] newspaper, which attributed the term to a specific game held in Illinois 40 years earlier, indicating Hickok's hand had yet to gain widespread popularity. Eventually, Hickok's aces and eights became widely known as the dead man's hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial===
[[Charlie Utter]], Hickok's friend and companion, claimed Hickok's body and placed a notice in the local newspaper, the ''Black Hills Pioneer'', which read:

{{quote|Died in Deadwood, Black Hills, August 2, 1876, from the effects of a [[Handgun|pistol]] shot, J. B. Hickock{{sic}} (Wild Bill) formerly of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], Wyoming. Funeral services will be held at Charlie Utter's Camp, on Thursday afternoon, August 3, 1876, at 3 o'clock P. M. All are respectfully invited to attend.}}

Almost the entire town attended the funeral, and Utter had Hickok buried with a wooden grave marker reading:

{{quote|Wild Bill, J. B. Hickock{{sic}} killed by the assassin Jack McCall in Deadwood, [[Black Hills]], August 2, 1876. Pard, we will meet again in the happy hunting ground to part no more. Good bye, Colorado Charlie, C. H. Utter.}}

[[Image:Steve and Charlie Utter.jpg|left|thumb|Steve and Charlie Utter at Hickok's grave, photograph date unknown]]
Hickok is known to have fatally shot six men and is suspected of having killed a seventh (McCanles). Despite his reputation,&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, Joseph G. [http://www.historynet.com/wild-bill-hickok-pistoleer-peace-officer-and-folk-hero.htm "Wild Bill Hickok: Pistoleer, Peace Officer and Folk Hero"]. History net. Accessed September 2015. Originally published in ''Wild West''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hickok was buried in the Ingelside Cemetery, Deadwood's original graveyard. This cemetery filled quickly, and in 1879, on the third anniversary of his original burial, Utter paid to move Hickok's remains to the new [[Mount Moriah Cemetery (South Dakota)|Mount Moriah Cemetery]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The old cemetery was in an area that was better suited for the constant influx of new settlers to live on, so the remaining bodies there were eventually also moved up the hill to the Mount Moriah Cemetery (in the 1880s).&lt;/ref&gt; Utter supervised the move and noted that, while perfectly preserved, Hickok had been imperfectly embalmed. As a result, [[calcium carbonate]] from the surrounding soil had replaced the flesh, leading to [[petrifaction]]. One of the workers, Joseph McLintock, wrote a detailed description of the re-interment. McLintock used a cane to tap the body, face, and head, finding no soft tissue anywhere. He noted that the sound was similar to tapping a brick wall, and believed the remains to weigh more than {{convert|400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. William Austin, the cemetery caretaker, estimated {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, which made it difficult for the men to carry the remains to the new site. The original wooden grave marker was moved to the new site, but by 1891 it had been destroyed by souvenir hunters whittling pieces from it, and it was replaced with a statue. This, in turn, was destroyed by souvenir hunters and replaced in 1902 by a life-sized sandstone sculpture of Hickok. This, too, was badly defaced, and was then enclosed in a cage for protection. The enclosure was cut open by souvenir hunters in the 1950s, and the statue was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, Joseph G. (1979). ''They Called Him Wild Bill''.

It has been reported that Calamity Jane was buried next to him, according to her dying wish. Four of the men on the self-appointed committee who planned Calamity's funeral (Albert Malter, Frank Ankeney, Jim Carson, and Anson Higby) later stated that, since Hickok had "absolutely no use" for Jane in this life, they decided to play a posthumous joke on him by laying her to rest by his side.&lt;ref&gt;Griske (2005). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Potato Creek Johnny, a local Deadwood celebrity from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is also buried next to Wild Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Dakota Legends – John Perrett, aka: Potato Creek Johnny |author=Weiser, Kathy |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/sd-potatocreekjohnny.html |publisher=Legends of America |year=2011 |accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pistols known to have been carried by Hickok==
Hickok's favorite guns were a pair of [[Colt 1851 Navy Revolver|Colt 1851 Navy]] Model (.36 caliber) cap-and-ball revolvers. They had ivory grips and nickel plating and were ornately engraved with "J.B. Hickok–1869" on the backstrap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/ctarchives/4522702735/ Photograph of Wild Bill Hickok's Colt Model 1851 Navys]. Connecticut State Library, State Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; He wore his revolvers butt-forward in a belt or sash (when wearing city clothes or buckskins, respectively), and seldom used holsters per se; he drew the pistols using a "reverse", "twist" or [[cavalry draw]], as would a cavalryman.&lt;ref name="Martin1"/&gt;

At the time of his death Hickok was wearing a [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 2]] Army Revolver, a newly released five-shot, single-action 38 cal. weapon.

The series shows Hickok as a self-destructive, compulsive gambler who is eventually murdered while playing poker and subsequently laid to rest in Deadwood's cemetery.

In the early 1990's, the ABC television series, the ''[[Young Riders]]'', a fictional account of [[Pony Express]] riders, Hickok is portrayed by [[Josh Brolin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/tv2/theyoungriders1/WHOSWHO/jimmy.html |title=Josh Brolin as James Butler Hickok (aka Wild Bill) |year=1997 |access-date=20 July 2018 |work=[[Angelfire]] |publisher=Rider Web Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorials and honorable distinctions===
Hickok's birthplace is now the [[Wild Bill Hickok Memorial]] and is a listed [[historic site]] under the supervision of the [[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]]. The town of Deadwood, South Dakota re-enacts Hickok's murder and McCall's capture every summer evening.&lt;ref name=blackhills/&gt;

In 1979, Hickok was inducted into the [[Poker Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poker Hall of Fame|url=http://www.wsop.com/pokerhalloffame/default.aspx|website=WSOP.com|publisher=Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc.|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14711">In [[cognitive psychology]], the '''word superiority effect''' ('''WSE''') refers to the phenomenon that people have better recognition of letters presented within words as compared to isolated letters and to letters presented within nonword (orthographically illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings.&lt;ref name="Falikman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falikman | first1 = M. V. | year = 2011 | title = Word superiority effects across the varieties of attention | url = | journal = Journal of Russian and East European Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 45–61 | doi=10.2753/rpo1061-0405490503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found a WSE when letter identification within words is compared to letter identification within pseudowords&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McClelland| first = J.

Johnston  | title = The role of familiar units in perception of words and nonwords  | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics  | volume = 22  | pages = 249–261  | year = 1977  | url = http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/papers/PublicationFiles/73-79_Add_To_ONLINE_Pubs/McClellandJohnston77TheRoleofFamilUnitsInPercept.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-06-30 | doi=10.3758/bf03199687}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. "WOSK") and [[Homophone#Pseudo-homophones|pseudohomophones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ferraro| first = F. R.  |author2=G. Chastain  | title = An analysis of Reicher-task effects  | journal = Journal of General Psychology  | volume = 121  | pages = 411–442  | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. "WERK").

The effect was first described by Cattell (1886),&lt;ref name="Cattell 1886"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Cattell  | first = J. M.  | title = The time it takes to see and name objects  | journal = Mind  | year = 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt; and important contributions came from Reicher (1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Reicher  | first = G. M.  | title = Perceptual recognition as a function of meaningfulness of stimulus material   | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology  | volume = 81  | pages = 275–280  | year = 1969  | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=main.landing  | accessdate = 2008-06-30  | doi = 10.1037/h0027768  | pmid = 5811803  | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wheeler (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Wheeler  | first = D. D.  | title = Processes in word recognition  | journal = Cognitive Psychology  | volume = 1  | issue = 1  | pages = 59–85  | year = 1970  | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/32833  | accessdate = 2008-06-30  | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(70)90005-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell first wrote, "I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no [[wikt:connexion|connexion]] as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters".&lt;ref name="Cattell 1886"/&gt;

G. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a [[two-alternative forced choice]] (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word "card", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as "cqrd".&lt;ref name="Falikman"/&gt; Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word.

The WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during [[Reading (process)|reading]]. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using [[Connectionism|connectionist networks]].

==Experimental task==
The WSE has traditionally been tested using a [[tachistoscope]], as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prinzmetal  | first = W.  | title = The word-superiority effect does not require a T-scope  | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics  | volume = 51  | pages = 473–484  | year = 1992  | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=5231389  | accessdate = 2008-06-30 | issue = 5 | doi=10.3758/bf03211643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if "WOSK" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether "K" or "H" had been in "WOSK". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. "WKRG") or single letters.

==Hypotheses==
The existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have [[semantic]] value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind).

Other studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Johnston | first = J. C.  |author2=J. L. McClelland  | title = Visual factors in word perception  | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics  | volume = 14  | pages = 365–370  | year = 1973  | url = http://psychology.stanford.edu/~jlm/papers/PublicationFiles/73-79_Add_To_ONLINE_Pubs/JohnstonMcClelland73VisualFactors.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-06-30 | doi=10.3758/bf03212406}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the duration of the masks.

==Models==
The two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the [[Interactive activation and competition networks|interactive activation model]] (IAM)&lt;ref name="McCelland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCelland | first1 = J. | last2 = Rumelhart | first2 = D. | year = 1981 | title = An interactive activation model of context effects in letter perception: part 1. An account of basic findings | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 375–407 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.88.5.375}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[reading for special needs#Approaches and Models of Reading|dual-route coding model]] (DRC)&lt;ref name="Ziegler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ziegler | first1 = J. | last2 = Rastle | first2 = K. | last3 = Perry | first3 = C. | last4 = Langdon | first4 = R. | last5 = Coltheart | first5 = M. | year = 2001 | title = DRC: A dual route cascaded model of visual word recognition and reading aloud | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 204–56 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204 | pmid=11212628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer’s conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing.&lt;ref name="Falikman"/&gt;

The activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from [[Lexical decision task|lexical decision]] and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision.&lt;ref name="Paap"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paap | first1 = K. R. | last2 = Newsome | first2 = S. L. | last3 = McDonald | first3 = J. E. | last4 = Schvaneveldt | first4 = R. W. | year = 1982 | title = An activation-verification model for letter and word recognition: the word superiority effect | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 573–594 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.89.5.573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top-down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase "A cow says..." a person would guess "moo" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters).&lt;ref name="Paap" /&gt;

===The WSE and an interactive-activation model===
[[Image:Word superiority effect.svg|right|300px|thumb|Rumelhart &amp; McClelland's interactive-activation model.]]
The WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. &lt;!-- Can we reference this? --&gt; According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for "C", horizontal and vertical bars for "H", etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chase|first=Christopher H.|last2=Tallal|first2=Paula|title=A developmental, interactive activation model of the word superiority effect|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0965(90)90069-K|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=448–487|doi=10.1016/0022-0965(90)90069-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word "WORK" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader).

According to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus.  However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE.

===Activation-verification model===
The AVM&lt;ref name=Paap/&gt; deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification.

==Adverse word superiority effect==
One of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland report&lt;!-- Can we reference this? --&gt;was that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword. Rather, it depends somewhat upon the strategies that readers use during a task. If readers paid more attention to the letter in a particular ''position'', they would experience the adverse word superiority effect&lt;!-- This needs a basic definition.--&gt;. This is because the reader would no longer have the benefit of having the word detector level activated with as much weight if they neglected to focus on the full word.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6426">'''Workers' Awaaz''' (or '''"Workers' Voice"''') is a [[nonprofit]], [[nonpartisan]] female [[domestic worker]]s' group based in [[New York City]]. Although the group supports all women in domestic services, its primary focus is on women from [[South Asia]] ([[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Nepal]]).

Workers' Awaaz was founded in June 1997 by a group of South Asian women activists and domestic workers. Workers' Awaaz assists workers in ensuring that they are paid the [[Minimum wage#United States|minimum wage]], receive [[overtime]] pay, are aware of their rights under [[workers' compensation]] laws, and receive training in basic employee rights and protection under state and federal law. The organization also sues employers on behalf of domestic workers for violations of federal and state laws, and organizes [[Picketing (protest)|pickets]] and demonstrations against abusive employers.

Workers' Awaaz also works to build public awareness of the sometimes abusive conditions under which many South Asian domestic workers labor in the U.S.

Since many immigrant domestics are isolated by language, working conditions and restrictions placed on them by employers, Workers' Awaaz uses a variety of outreach efforts to reach workers in need. It places advertisements in various South Asian-related newspapers, sets up tables at South Asian community events, and engages in face-to-face conversations in markets and stores.

==Lawsuits==
Workers' Awaaz has won several lawsuits filed on behalf of workers against employers who did not pay minimum wage, withhold taxes or make [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and other required government payments.

In 1998, Workers' Awaaz, working with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], won a $20,000 back pay settlement. In January 2000, the organization won a back pay award for $50,000 from physicians who refused to pay a domestic worker for nearly three years.

==Awards and grants==
In 1997, Workers' Awaaz won a $5,000 grassroots grant from the Ben &amp; Jerry's Foundation.[http://www.benjerry.com/foundation/grl_oct1997.html]

In 1998, Ahmed was honored as a fellow of the Petra Foundation for her advocacy work with Workers' Awaaz. In 2000, the organization was awarded a Union Square Award from the Tides Center for its grassroots activism and strengthening of immigrant communities in New York City.[http://www.unionsquareawards.org/v2/awardees/bio.asp?aID=69]

In 2000, Shahbano Aliani, M. Bala, Shahensha Begum, Rekha Devi, Rokeya Mollah and Rokeya Begum—lead organizers and board members—received the Union Square Award from the Fund for the City of New York.  [http://www.unionsquareawards.org/social-justice-orgs/44-2000/283-workers-awaaz.html]

'''Yucuita''' ([[Mixtec language|Mixtec]]: ''Yúku'ita'', meaning ''Hill-flower'', or ''Hill of Flowers'') is an archaeological site located in the Mixtec municipality of [[San Juan Yucuita]] in the Mexican state of [[Oaxaca]]. It was founded by the [[Mixtec|Mixtec civilization]] in the [[Formative stage|pre-Classic Period]] as a small village dedicated to [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|agriculture]] and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]].

Because of its antiquity and its long-term continuous occupation (from the fourteenth century [[Common Era|BCE]] to the ninth century CE), Yucuita is one of the most studied Mixtec archaeological sites.

==Description==
Located in a small plain of Oaxaca's [[Sierra Mixteca]], Yucuita is some {{convert|86|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], the capital of the state.

Although the precolumbian Mixtecs were not characterized by monumental architecture, in Yucuita there are two architectonic complexes that have been the object of numerous investigations since the 1930s, when [[Esteban Avendaño]] explored the zone (1933).&lt;ref&gt;Vela and Solanes (2001, p.40)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent excavations at the site were in 1976-80 by the [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH).

One of these complexes was dedicated to the living quarters of the governing elite. It consists of a platform constructed on the slope of a hill. The platform supports the remains of living quarters set around a central patio. The second complex was a ceremonial center, of which only part of the platform and two long walls remain. One wall is 70 m long by 4&amp;nbsp;m high (230&amp;nbsp;ft by 13&amp;nbsp;ft). At right angles to it is another wall, {{convert|52|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. On the northern side of the first wall is a narrow stairway leading to the top of the platform. Near the stairway is a narrow tunnel roughly {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, which served for drainage and as a passageway.
