Hunt is the author of several books (see below), and is a columnist for the ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'' where he regularly comments on politics and world affairs. Hunt has said that his research and effort for writing his first book (''The Turning: A History of Vietnam Veterans Against the War''&lt;ref name=Turning/&gt;) was part of his own quest "to understand the environment and the society that swept my family away and broke us apart."&lt;ref name=elve/&gt; He is currently writing a book on [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Cold War]] culture in the United States in the 1980s.

Hunt resides in [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. He is the father of two teenagers: Madeline (daughter)&lt;ref name=Turning/&gt;{{Rp|page=x}} and Aidan (son).&lt;ref name=Turning/&gt;{{Rp|page=xi}} Hunt is a [[Veganism|vegan]] and a supporter of [[animal rights]].

Hunt has written this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For about two years, I had a Blog called Andrew's Tiki Lounge: Helping Canadians (and Anyone Else Who's Interested) Make Sense of the United States...
&lt;p&gt;
I discontinued Andrew's Tiki Lounge. My new Blog, titled "We're All Animals," is an animal rights and vegan blog. Because I believe that animal rights is one of the most important issues confronting humanity, I have decided to turn all of my Blogging attention to this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~aehunt/fiveanddime.html |title= Andrew's Five &amp; Dime |first= Andrew |last= Hunt |authorlink= Andrew Hunt (historian) |accessdate= 2011-07-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110623211256/http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~aehunt/fiveanddime.html| archivedate= 23 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Otumba''' was a battle during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The battle was fought at [[Otumba de Gómez Farías]], Mexico in 1520.

== Background ==
Around the end of March 1519, [[Hernán Cortés]] landed with a Spanish [[conquistador]] force at [[Potonchán]] on the coast of modern-day [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Invasion31&gt;{{cite book| title = The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519&amp;ndash;1521| pages = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortés had been commissioned by Governor [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] of Spanish-controlled [[Cuba]] to lead an expedition in the area,&lt;ref name=Invasion12&gt;{{cite book| title = The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519&amp;ndash;1521| pages = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was dominated by the [[Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name=Invasion13&gt;{{cite book| title = The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519&amp;ndash;1521| pages = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the last moment, though, Velázquez revoked Cortés's commission, but he decided to launch his expedition regardless.

Through a combination of raw force and political maneuvering, Cortés was able to secure the allegiance of the [[Totonacs]] and the [[Tlaxcaltec]] (subjugated enemies of the Aztec empire) among other groups during his advance on the Empire's main settlement, [[Tenochtitlan]].&lt;ref name=Invasion35&gt;{{cite book| title = The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519&amp;ndash;1521| pages = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November, a Spanish force entered the city and was greeted by its ruler, [[Moctezuma II]].&lt;ref name=Invasion44&gt;{{cite book| title = The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519&amp;ndash;1521| pages = 44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the conquistadors were treated well by the Aztecs whilst they stayed in the city,&lt;ref name=Invasion45&gt;{{cite book| title = The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519&amp;ndash;1521| pages = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until Velázquez, angered at Cortés' disobedience, sent an armed force at the command of Pánfilo Narváez against Cortés to bring him to justice and claim the lands and riches he had conquered. Cortés was forced to leave a small garrison of men in Tenochtitlan at the command of one of his lieutenants, Pedro de Alvarado,  whilst he took his small force to meet Narváez in battle. After securing a quick and brilliant victory, Cortés joined Narvaez' forces to his own, and marched back to Tenochtitlán, as he had heard word that the city was up in arms against the remaining Spaniards. Upon arriving, Alvarado told Cortés' he had been convinced that the Aztecs planned to attack the Spaniards and thus struck preemptively during an Aztec ritual ceremony, which caused an outrage in Tenochtitlán. The Aztecs named a new emperor to replace Moctezuma, whom they regarded now as weak and easily influenced by the Spaniards. Cortés attempted to negotiate a peace, and as a last resort, urged Moctezuma to speak with his people to achieve a truce, but the angry Aztecs struck down Moctezuma in a hail of rocks. This was the state of affairs  by the end of June 1520. Desperate to escape the city, and further convinced by an omen one of the Spaniards claimed to have received, the Spaniards resolved to leave the city that night in an event called ''[[La Noche Triste]]'' (The Night of Sorrows).&lt;ref name=Invasion53&gt;{{cite book| title = The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519&amp;ndash;1521| pages = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this attempt at salvation, however, Cortés' forces and entourage (consisting of civilian-grade women and men of both Spanish and Indian extraction) were severely cut down. Of the Spanish force of approximately 1300, only less than 500 men at arms escaped with their lives, along with a few hundred Tlaxcalans and civilians. Cortés then started a retreat to [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], during which his force was harassed by Aztec [[skirmishers]], and the Aztec leadership resolved to eliminate them as they withdrew.&lt;ref name=Invasion53/&gt;

== Battle ==
After being beleaguered on the causeway leading out of the city, the surviving Spanish forces arrived at the plain of [[Otumba de Gómez Farías|Otumba]], where they encountered a vast Aztec army. Despite their opponents' exhaustion and hunger, the Aztecs failed to capitalize on their numerical superiority by not attacking right away. &lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;

According to conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo's account of the events, it was the Castilian Cavalry that was decisive for victory in the perilous battle. The Aztecs regarded the Spaniards as already defeated, and were looking to gain glory from capturing live Spaniards to sacrifice to their gods. The Castilian cavalry spearheaded the attack, breaking through the ranks and decimating the Aztec lines, preparing them for the assault of the Castilian [[rodeleros]] and Tlaxcalan infantry. Though this approach was successful, the sheer numbers of the Aztecs still managed to overwhelm the Castilians.

The Aztecs, meanwhile, had not encountered Castilians in battle, despite their long exposure to them during the Spaniards' time in Tenochtitlan. They were unfamiliar with the use of troops mounted on horses as shock troops and were taken aback when mounted Spanish soldiers continually charged at them. For all of their numbers, they were unprepared to endure cavalry charges.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|303–305}}

Spaniard success was also thanks to Cortés strategy, he had instructed his troops to strike primarily at the captains and leaders of their opponent. Cortés himself recognized the Aztec leader Matlatzincatl for his rich armor, headdress, and flag. He correctly assumed that defeating their leader and capturing their flag would result in the defeat of the Aztecs. He communicated his idea to his captains and led a charge for Matlatzincatl, followed by Gonzalo de Sandoval, Pedro de Alvarado, Cristóbal de Olid, Juan de Salamanca and Alonso Dávila. Cortés attacked the Aztec leader with his lance, and the rest of his captains broke the ranks of the warriors around him. Matlatzincatl was slain by Juan de Salamanca, who retrieved the Aztec battle-standard and delivered it to Cortés. With their leader slain, the Aztec force diminished gradually, and the Tlaxcalan and Castilian warriors routed them.

With this hard-fought victory, the Spanish conquistadors were able to reach the safe haven of Tlaxcala, regroup and gather their strength for an eventual counter-attack deep into the Aztec territory, which would result in the fall of Tenochtitlán and the foundation of New Spain.

{{Refimprove|article|date=March 2011}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''calque''' {{IPAc-en|k|æ|l|k}} or '''loan translation''' is a [[word]] or [[phrase]] borrowed from another language by [[literal translation|literal]], word-for-word or root-for-root translation. Used as a [[verb]], "to calque" means to borrow a word or phrase from another language while translating its components, so as to create a new [[lexeme]] in the target language.

"Calque" itself is a [[loanword]] from the French [[noun]] ''calque'' ("tracing; imitation; close copy"); the [[verb]] ''calquer'' means "to trace; to copy, to imitate closely"; ''papier calque'' is "[[tracing paper]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cassell's French Dictionary: French-English, English-French'', New York, Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, 1962, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "loanword" is itself a calque of the [[German language|German]] word ''Lehnwort'', just as "loan translation" is a calque of ''Lehnübersetzung''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://germanenglishwords.com/ Robb: German English Words germanenglishwords.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proving that a word is a calque sometimes requires more documentation than does an untranslated loanword because, in some cases, a similar phrase might have arisen in both languages independently. This is less likely to be the case when the grammar of the proposed calque is quite different from that of the borrowing language, or when the calque contains less obvious imagery.

Calquing is distinct from [[phono-semantic matching]].&lt;ref name="palgrave.com"&gt;{{cite book |last= [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann]] |first= Ghil'ad |title= Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-4039-1723-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; While calquing includes [[semantic]] [[translation]], it does not consist of [[phonetic]] matching (i.e. retaining the approximate [[sound]] of the borrowed word through matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existing word or [[morpheme]] in the target language).

==Types==
One system classifies calques into five groups:&lt;ref&gt;May Smith, ''The Influence of French on Eighteenth-century Literary Russian'', p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

* the '''phraseological calque''', with [[idiom|idiomatic phrase]]s being translated word-for-word. For example, "[[:wiktionary:go without saying|it goes without saying]]" calques the French ''"ça va sans dire"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/116/105.html Foreign Words. Fowler, H. W. 1908. The King's English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the '''syntactic calque''', with syntactic functions or constructions of the source language being imitated in the target language, in violation of their meaning. For example, in Spanish the legal term for “to find guilty” is properly ''"declarar culpable"'' (“to declare guilty”). Informal usage, however, is shifting to ''"encontrar culpable"'': a syntactic mapping of "to find" without a semantic correspondence in Spanish of “find” to mean “determine as true”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paulweston80.wordpress.com/2016/01/13/if-my-calqueulations-are-correct/ If my Calqueulations are Correct, Paul Weston]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the '''loan-translation''', with words being translated [[morpheme]]-by-morpheme or [[component (linguistics)|component]]-by-component into another language. The two morphemes of the Swedish word ''tonåring'' calque each part of the English "teenager": ''fem'''ton''''' = "fif'''teen'''"; ''åring'' = "annual harvest".
* the '''semantic calque''', with additional meanings of the source word being transferred to the word with the same primary meaning in the target language. This is also called a "[[semantic loan]]". As described below, the "[[computer mouse]]" was named in English for its resemblance to the animal; many other languages have extended their own native word for "mouse" to include the computer mouse. 
* the '''morphological calque''', with the inflection of a word being transferred.

This terminology is not universal. Some authors call a morphological calque a "morpheme-by-morpheme translation".&lt;ref name="gilliot"&gt;Claude Gilliot, "The Authorship of the Qur'ān" in Gabriel Said Reynolds, ''The Qur'an in its Historical Context'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Other linguists refer to the '''phonological calque''', where the pronunciation of a word is imitated in the other language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vP2jibCnejQC Specialised Dictionaries for Learners edited by Pedro Antonio Fuertes Olivera, p. 187]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the English word ''"radar"'' becomes the similar-sounding Chinese word ''[https://en.bab.la/dictionary/chinese-english/雷达 "雷达"]'' (pinyin ''"léi dá"'').

=={{anchor|Loan blend}}Loan blend==
'''Loan blends''' or '''partial calques''' translate some parts of a compound, but not others.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Durkin, ''The Oxford Guide to Etymology'', sec. 5.1.4&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the name of the Irish digital television service [[Saorview]] is a partial calque of that of the UK service [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], translating the first half of the word from English to Irish but leaving the second half unchanged. Other examples are: "[[liverwurst]]" (&lt; German ''Leberwurst''), "[[apple strudel]]" (&lt; German ''Apfelstrudel'').

=== Loan translation: ''translatio'' and ''traductio'' ===
The [[Latin]] word ''translatio'' ("a transferring") derives from ''trans'', "across" + ''latus'', "borne".  (''Latus'' is the past participle of ''ferre'', "to carry".)

The [[Germanic languages]] and some [[Slavic languages]] calqued their words for "[[translation]]" from the Latin word, ''translatio'', substituting their respective Germanic or Slavic root words for the Latin roots.

The remaining Slavic languages instead calqued their words for "translation" from an alternative Latin word, ''traductio'', itself derived from ''traducere'' ("to lead across" or "to bring across", from ''trans'', "across" + ''ducere'', "to lead" or "to bring").&lt;ref name="The Translator 1983, p. 83" /&gt;

The [[West Slavic languages]] adopted the ''"translatio"'' pattern.  The [[East Slavic languages]] (except for [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) and the [[South Slavic languages]] adopted the ''"traductio"'' pattern.

The [[Romance language]]s, deriving directly from Latin, did not need to ''calque'' their equivalent words for "translation".  Instead, they simply adapted the second of the two alternative Latin words, '''''traductio'''''. Thus,  [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]: {{lang|an|[[:an:Traducción|traducción]]}}; [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: {{lang|ca|[[:ca:Traducció lingüística|traducció]]}}; [[French language|French]]: {{lang|fr|[[:fr:Traduction|traduction]]}}; [[Italian language|Italian]]: {{lang|it|[[:it:traduzione|traduzione]]}}; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: {{lang|pt|[[:pt:Tradução|tradução]]}}; [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: {{lang|ro|[[:ro:Traducere|traducere]]}}; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: {{lang|es|[[:es:traducción|traducción]]}}. 

The English verb "to translate" similarly derives from the Latin ''translatio'', itself derived from ''transferre'', "to transfer":  in this case, "transferred" (''translatus'') from one language to another.&lt;ref name="The Translator 1983, p. 83"&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 1983, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Were the English verb "translate" calqued, it would be "overset", akin to the calques in other Germanic languages.

The '''Children of Paul's''' was the name of a troupe of [[boy player|boy actors]] in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] London. Along with the [[Children of the Chapel]], they were the most important of the companies of boy players that constituted a distinctive feature of [[English Renaissance theatre]].{{according to whom|date=October 2017}}

== Education ==
The children who would become choirboys and boy players for the Children of Paul's ranged in age from six to their mid-teens. They would be educated and boarded at the choir school, trained in not only singing but in grammar and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hentschell|first=Roze F.|date=2016|title=‘Our Children Made Enterluders’: Choristers, Actors, and Students in St Paul’s Cathedral Precinct|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.12745/et.19.2.2837|journal=Early Theatre|volume=19|issue=2|pages=181-182|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their basic needs were taken care of, choirboys sometimes made some money for themselves. When fashionably dressed men wearing spurs, which could be loud and distracting to other church-goers, would enter the chapel, the choirboys would sometimes demand money as a fee. This fee was called "spur money".&lt;ref&gt;Hentschell 2016, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Choirboys were allowed time to play on Thursday afternoons, and in one document from 1598, a verger named John Howe notes an occasion when the boys broke windows and disrupted churchgoers.&lt;ref&gt;Hentschell 2016, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;
== The Early Years ==
[[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London had a boys' choir since the 12th century; it was only in the 16th century that they began to act in dramatic performances. Playing may have become a part of the boys' education as a result of the influence of [[Humanism|humanist]] teachings, which encouraged students to "develop poise and improve their skill in speaking Latin by acting"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Kinney|editor1-first=Arthur F.|title=A Companion to Renaissance Drama|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-2179-3|page=315|chapter=Boy Companies and Private Theaters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1527-1528, the Children of Paul's performed for [[King Henry VIII]], and for [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]].

[[Sebastian Westcott]] was Master of the Children of Paul's in the years 1557&amp;ndash;82; in his era, the boys performed 27 times at court, more than any other troupe, adult or child. In 1560-1572 [[Master of the Revels]] Sir [[Thomas Benger]] used them throughout his tenure, as later mentioned in [[William Shakespeare]]' play ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act 2 Scene 2. One example is when the company performed for [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and her guest at the time, [[Princess Cecilia of Sweden|Cecilia of Sweden]], in 1566. They performed a  play by Sixt Birk, called Sapientia Solomonis, which "dramatized the relationship between King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in a way appropriate for schoolboys".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under Master Thomas Giles (1584&amp;ndash;99?), the Children of Paul's became closely identified with the plays of [[John Lyly]]; they performed at Court nine times in the years 1587&amp;ndash;90. The boys acted Lyly's ''[[Gallathea]]'' at Court, probably on 1 January 1588; they acted his ''[[Endymion (play)|Endymion]]'' at Court a month and a day later, on 2 February; and his ''[[Midas (Lyly play)|Midas]]'' on 6 January 1590.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Other of Lyly's plays, ''[[Mother Bombie]]'' and ''[[Love's Metamorphosis]]'', were also presented at Court in these years.

Also in the 1580s the Children of Paul's joined the [[Children of the Chapel]] in public performances at the first [[Blackfriars Theatre]] (1583&amp;ndash;4), a foretaste of the period of public performance that was to follow for both companies at the start of the 17th century.

In 1590, the Children of Paul's were implicated in the [[Marprelate Controversy|Martin Marprelate controversy]], as not only were they associated with John Lyly, they had "helped to publicise his contributions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gurr|first1=Andrew|title=The Shakespearean Stage 1574-1642|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-42240-X|page=33|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; All theatrical companies, including adult companies, were forced to curb their productions. Boy companies became scarce until the Children of Paul's returned a decade later at the turn of the century, in 1599-1600.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr 1992, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of its reopening, the Children of Paul's may have had up to seventeen boy players (84 Roslyn Lander Knutson)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knutson|first1=Roslyn Lander|title=Playing Companies and Commerce in Shakespeare's Time|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139428373|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Mqurh3QxoYC&amp;dq=rosyln+lander+knutson+children+of+pauls&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For the next ten years the boy companies were out of fashion on the stage.

== The Later Years ==
By 1600, conditions had changed; a new Master, Edward Peers (d.1612),&lt;ref&gt;Parish registers of St Gregory by St Paul, London. The full entry reads: "Edward Pierce, maister of the Children of Paules, buried 15 June 1612".&lt;/ref&gt; allowed the Children of Paul's to resume acting, and apparently faced no significant opposition. The company operated at a smaller scale than before, though, only playiing on Sundays and Mondays and charging half the amount for the attendance fee than they had in 1590.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr 1992, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous plays ''[[The Maid's Metamorphosis]]'' and ''[[The Wisdom of Doctor Dodypoll]]'' illustrate the kind of drama the boys acted in their first year. The Children of Paul's performed the works of [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[George Chapman]], and [[Thomas Middleton]],  among other dramatists of their generation. Marston was mainly identified with the Children of Paul's, as Jonson was identified with the Children of the Chapel; in the ''Poetomachia'', the [[War of the Theatres]] of 1599&amp;ndash;1601, the Children of Paul's acted Marston's side of the contest, with the plays ''[[Jack Drum's Entertainment]]'' (1600) and ''[[What You Will]]'' (1601), plus [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[Satiromastix]]'' (1601).

However, unlike the Children of the Chapel, who worked in the second [[Blackfriars Theatre]], the Children of Paul's had no dedicated theatrical space of their own; when they weren't playing at Court, they acted in the church where they trained as choristers – [[St Gregory by St Paul's]] Church, just to the southwest of St Paul's Cathedral. This tended to limit their drama; sometimes plays had to be cut short to accommodate the schedules of the religious institutions in the middle of which the boy players operated.

The Children of Paul's ceased playing around 1606, for unclear reasons. Some scholars have believed that the [[King's Revels Children]], another company that formed c. 1606, might have been, to some significant degree, the Children of Paul's under another name; but this is uncertain. (The King's Revels Children never gelled as an enterprise; they collapsed in litigation among their backers in 1609.)

However, instead of disappearing altogether, it could also be that the company simply merged with the Children of the Blackfriars.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr 1992, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dame Claudia Josepha Orange''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|DNZM|OBE}} (née '''Bell''', born 17 April 1938) is a New Zealand historian best known for her 1987 book ''The Treaty of Waitangi'', which won 'Book of the Year' at the [[Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Award]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/43561/claudia-orange | title=History and historians – The growth of history – since 1970 | publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] | author-link=Jock Phillips | first=Jock | last=Phillips | accessdate=28 April 2018 | date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013 she has been the head of research at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] in [[Wellington]], where she was previously the director of collections and research. In 2018 she was made a Companion of the [[Royal Society Te Apārangi]] in recognition of her service to the humanities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC1807/S00029/six-women-recognised-for-leadership-in-science.htm|title=Six women recognised for leadership in science {{!}} Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Orange was born in [[Auckland]] in 1938. Her father, Monty Bell, was a fluent speaker of [[te reo Māori]], knew [[Āpirana Ngata]] and joined the [[Department of Māori Affairs]] in Gisborne, so she grew up well aware of [[Māori people|Māori]] issues.&lt;ref name=bwb&gt;[http://www.bwb.co.nz/store/comment_book.asp?idAuth=95 "Claudia Orange: A clear voice on the Treaty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604012125/http://www.bwb.co.nz/store/comment_book.asp?idAuth=95 |date=4 June 2010 }}, Bridget Williams Books&lt;/ref&gt; She trained and practised as a dental nurse for 15 years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10550116 "Honours List: Getting her teeth into the Treaty"], Phoebe Falconer, 31 Dec 2008, ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''&lt;/ref&gt; before starting university studies. She is married to Rod Orange and has three adult children.&lt;ref name=bwb /&gt;

==Career==
From 1975 to 1983 Orange was a history lecturer at the [[University of Auckland]]. From 1990 she was general editor of the ''[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]'', having been associate editor previously; she also worked on ''[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]''. She was also an associate editor for the new ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Britain).

Between 1997 and 2000 she was acting chief historian of the History Branch in the [[Department of Internal Affairs]]. Late in 2003 she became director of history and Pacific cultures at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] in [[Wellington]]. Since 2013 Orange has been the head of research at Te Papa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/ResearchAtTePapa/Pages/Listofexperts.aspx |title=Our experts – directory of curators |date= |website= |publisher=[[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] |accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orange was the historian custodian of the "Treaty Road show", which was a tour around New Zealand sponsored by the New Zealand government. It attracted some public criticism as being ineffective and "an enormous disappointment" from her fellow historian [[Paul Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ED0704/S00088/governments-treaty-roadshow-failing.htm | title=Government's Treaty roadshow failing | work=Scoop.co.nz | date=26 April 2007 | last=Moon |first=Paul|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Treaty of Waitangi'' (1987)===
The 1987 book was derived from her 1984 PhD thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nippert|first=Matt|title=Dr. Claudia Orange|work=[[New Zealand Listener]]|date=12 March 2005|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3383/features/3590/dr_claudia_orange.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being an academic history, it was a popular success, due primarily to an upsurge in interest in the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] caused by the increasing importance of the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] and also major Māori protests at [[Waitangi Day]] celebrations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The book has become a definitive reference for interpreting the relevance of the Treaty of Waitangi.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several shorter versions of the book have been published for young and non-academic audiences, and a revised edition was released in 2011.

==Honours==
In the [[1993 New Year Honours]], Orange was made an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=53154 |date=31 December 1992 |page=30 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]], also for services to historical research, in the [[2009 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2009 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/node/366 |title=New Year honours list 2009 |date=31 December 2008 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accepted re-designation as a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in August 2009 following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/node/364 |title=Special honours list |date=1 August 2009 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 she was made a Companion of the Royal Society Te Apārangi in recognition of her work to improve awareness, knowledge and understanding of the Treaty of Waitangi, of New Zealand biography, and of the role of museums in communicating New Zealand's story.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3152">'''David Ogg''' (1887 - 1965) was an historian specialising in the history of England during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the Europe dominated by [[Louis XIV of France]].

In 1963 [[H. E. Bell]] and [[Richard Ollard|R. L. Ollard]] edited Ogg's ''festschrift'' and said of Ogg:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who have had the privilege of knowing David Ogg as a tutor or a colleague will not need to be reminded of those qualities of wit and intellectual elegance, of originality of thought and expression, of common sense applied in an uncommon way, that characterise his talk as unmistakenly as his writing. The deceptive ease with which his exact scholarship and wide erudition have been put at our disposal is no small part of the pleasant debt we all owe him...It would be an imperceptive reader who failed to notice that in both the fields that Ogg has made his own, the England of Charles II and the Europe of Louis XIV, he has challenged both the accepted historiography of the period and the fashionable portrayal of the two eponymous figures of the age. It could be imperceptive, but it would not be impossible. The modulations of irony, the subtle effects of tone, the humility in which, above all, the style reveals the man, will be lost on such as prefer vulgar colours, familiar platitudes, and the techniques of self-advertisement in which modern scholarship can report such notable advances. But the continued and increasing success of ''Europe in the Seventeenth Century'' and ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' gives good ground for believing that [his] rare qualities...have been recognised and valued by a far wider public. Of the influence exerted by these books on students of the period there can be no doubt.&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Bell and R. L. Ollard, ‘Preface’, in Bell and Ollard (eds.), ''Historical Essays. 1600-1750. Presented to David Ogg'' (London: Adam and Charles Black, 1963), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Deistic evolution''' is a position in the [[origins debate]] which involves accepting the [[scientific]] evidence for [[evolution]] and age of the [[universe]] whilst advocating the view that a [[deist]]ic [[God]] created the universe but has not interfered since. The position is a counterpoint to [[theistic evolution]] and is endorsed by those who believe in both [[deism]] and the veracity of science.

==Various views on deistic evolution==

In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8birAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;dq=deistic+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMI2NPFwPLdxgIViBo-Ch1TWwAE#v=onepage&amp;q=deistic%20evolution&amp;f=false Christian Theology]'', by Millard J. Erickson, 2013, is written:

{{quote|Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws its development has followed. Thus, he programmed the process and then withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator Emeritus. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution, for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process.
Deistic evolution has little difficulty with the scientific data. There is a definite conflict, however, between deism's view of an absentee God and the biblical picture of a God who has been involved in a whole series of creative acts. In particular, both Genesis accounts of the origin of human beings indicate that God definitely and distinctly willed and acted to bring them into existence. In addition, deistic evolution conflicts with the scriptural doctrine of providence, according to which God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation.}}

The [[psychologist]] Steve Stewart-Williams&lt;ref&gt;[http://psy.swan.ac.uk/staff/stewart-williams/ Homepage for Dr Steve Stewart-Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' (2010) states:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolutionists hold that God created the universe and the laws of nature... but that once the ball was rolling, he ceased to intervene in the day-today running of the world or in the course of natural law. God was like the ether after Einstein: he no longer had any role to play in the universe'''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' 2010 p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stewart-Williams further writes that deistic evolution strips [[God]] of what most religious believers consider central. Any deistic God is not around for [[prayer]]s, [[miracles]] or to intervene in people's lives and that because of this it is unpopular with [[monotheistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic Evolution adheres to the concept of some form of God, but denies any personal God. A recent defender of deistic evolution was [[Michael Anthony Corey]], author of the book ''Back to Darwin: The Scientific Case for Deistic Evolution'' (1994).

Some scholars have written that [[Charles Darwin]] was an advocate of deistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Christian C. Young, Mark A. Largent ''Evolution and Creationism: A Documentary and Reference Guide'' 2007, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic evolution is similarly the operative idea  in [[Pandeism]], which has been counted amongst the handful of spiritual beliefs which "are compatible with modern [[science]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Some of us think that postmodernity represents a similar change of dominant worldviews, one which could turn out to be just as singular as modernity by being a stunning amalgam of James and Weber. If we are correct, then the changed attitudes, assumptions, and values might work together to change ways of life which in turn transform our geographies of mind and being, that is, both the actual physical landscapes and the mental valuescapes we inhabit. One increasingly common outcome of this ongoing transformation, itself a symptom perhaps of post-industrial secular societies, is the movement away from self-denial toward a denial of the supernatural. This development promises to fundamentally alter future geographies of mind and being by shifting the locus of causality from an exalted Godhead to the domain of Nature. How this Nature is ultimately defined has broad repercussions for the, at times, artificial distinction between religious and secular worldviews. For Levine (2011), "secularism is a positive, not a negative, condition, not a denial of the  world of spirit and of religion, but an affirmation of the world we're living in now ... such a world is capable of bringing us to the condition of 'fullness' that religion has always promised" (Levine quoted in Wood 2011). For others, this "fullness" is present in more religious-oriented pantheistic or pandeistic belief systems with, in the latter case, the inclusion of God as the ever unfolding expression of a complex universe with an identifiable beginning but no teleological direction necessarily present.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theistic predeterminism==
Deistic evolution is not the same as [[theistic evolution]], yet they are sometimes confused. The difference rests on the difference between a theistic god that is interested in, if not actively involved in, the outcome of his creation and humanity specifically and a [[deism|deistic god]] that is either disinterested in the outcome, and holds no special place for humanity, or will not intervene. Often, there is no discernible difference between the two positions—the choice of terminology has more to do with the believer and her or his need for a god, than fitting into a mostly arbitrary dictionary or academic definition.

==Criticism from Christian Creationists==

Deistic evolution has been criticised by Christian [[creationists]] as being incompatible with [[Christianity]] since it contradicts a literal reading of the [[Bible]] and more importantly, leaves no role for the "Christian personal God".&lt;ref&gt;James K. A. Smith, Amos Yong ''Science and the Spirit: A Pentecostal Engagement With the Sciences'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liberty: a magazine of religious freedom: Volumes 86-88, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

M. J. Erickson wrote that deistic evolution is in conflict with the scriptural doctrine of providence according to which "God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation."&lt;ref&gt;Erickson M.J., "Christian Theology", 1985, Baker, Grand Rapids, MI, pp. 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles P. Grannan wrote in 1894, "Another baseless assumption of negative critics is that the general principles of Atheistic and Deistic evolution, admitted by many scientists to account for the origin of the various species of plants and animals, should also be applied to explain the origin of the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;"Higher Criticism and the Bible," by Charles P. Grannan, DD, PhD, in ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', 1894, Volume 19, Page 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Wesley Rishell criticized the concept in 1899, comparing it to the notion (false, in his view), that [[gravity]] was a property of matter instead of a continued action of God:

{{quote|If evolution is God's method of creating he is still at work. Theistic Deism and evolution is possible, but deistic evolution is a contradiction in terms. Again, it is all a mere supposition that God created the world and endowed it with forces which will of necessity work out his will. It is impossible for us to say that God put forth energy in the beginning and then ceased. It is, to say the least, as probable that gravitation is a divine force constantly exerted on matter in a certain way as that it is a divine force deposited in matter once for all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of the Christian Faith'' by Charles Wesley Rishell, 1899, Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Science==

Deistic evolution does not oppose or contradict [[evolution]] or come into conflict with [[science]] as it says that a God started the process and then left it to natural processes. However deism is still a religious philosophy.

Stewart-Williams wrote regarding deistic evolution and science:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolution eliminates any immediate conflict between science and belief in God. Anyone who believes that God's role was merely to create the laws of nature can accept the scientific worldview in its totality; they simply add the proviso that 'God did it' - i.e., that God is responsible for the world that science describes'''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is considerable room for this "[[god of the gaps]]" view, since scientific observation is entirely unable to shed any light on what happened during the [[Planck epoch]], the earliest 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds in the history of the universe. All development since this initial creative act merely follows laws and principles which He created:

*God created the universe, perhaps using the "big bang" about 15,000 million years ago as his method. He set up basic laws to govern the running of the universe, and then left the scene entirely. God has not been seen since. The earth coalesced about 4 or 5 thousand million years ago without any input from God. Later, elementary life forms formed, which evolved into the animals and plant life that we see today through purely natural forces. It is essentially identical to naturalistic evolution, excepts that it reserves one action for God: that of initially creating the matter of the universe. This belief is common among Deists. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_world3.htm]
*Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws which its devel- opment has followed. Thus, he programmed the process. Then he withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator emeritus. The progress of the created order is free of direct influence by God. He is the Creator of everything, but only the first living form was directly created. All the rest of God's creating has been done indirectly. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process. [http://www.asa3.org/archive/evolution/199505-10/0171.html]

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] disagrees with the doctrine of deistic evolution. In November 2005, Pope Benedict addressed a general audience of 25,000 in [[St. Peter's Square]]:

:When the Pontiff finished his address, he put his papers to one side and commented on the thought of St. Basil the Great, a Doctor of the Church, who said that some, "deceived by the atheism they bear within them, imagined the universe deprived of a guide and order, at the mercy of chance. I believe the words of this fourth-century Father are of amazing timeliness," said Benedict XVI. "How many are these 'some' today? Deceived by atheism, they believe and try to demonstrate that it is scientific to think that everything lacks a guide and order," he continued.

'''Domenico Santoro''' (... - dead after 1688) was a local historian and physician closely related to the city of [[Altamura]], [[Kingdom of Naples]]. He's known mostly for his essay "Description of the city of Altamura" ({{lang-it|Descrizione della città di Altamura}}, 1688),which was the first complete essay on the history of [[Altamura]], [[Kingdom of Naples]] ([[Italy]]).

In his work, the author provides precious information on the history and the life of Altamura, perhaps drawing from documents now lost. The work has also been copied by priest D. Vitangelo Frizzale. The clearest limit of his work is perhaps the absence of critical analysis of the socurces, and the commingling of history and legendary facts, as Ottavio Serena later pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;[[#storie-inedite|storie-inedite]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
There is very little or no information on his life. Local historian Tommaso Berloco claimed that he may have been a jurist and that he belonged to a noble family living in Altamura, which originated in [[Caserta]].&lt;ref name=storie-inedite_p7&gt;[[#storie-inedite |storie-inedite, p. 7]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to more recent research, it was a physician (then called ''dottor fisico'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugliaindifesa.org/files/Saponaro_Di-alcuni-vasi-figurati-ecc.pdf|format=PDF|title=Elena Silvana Saponaro : Di alcuni vasi figurati rinvenuti in Altamura nell’Ottocento nelle relazioni all’Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica di Roma|website=Pugliaindifesa.org|accessdate=23 October 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt; His only work - ''Descrizione della città di Altamura'' (1688) - provided plenty of information about the history of the city of Altamura. A street in Altamura has been named after him.

[[Cesare Orlandi]], in his work ''Delle Città d'Italia'' ([[1770]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Cesare|last=Orlandi|title=Delle città d'Italia e sue isole adjacenti compendiose notizie|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=UGUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|access-date=2017-08-25|year=1774|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentions [[Giovanni Donato (giurista) |Giovanni Donato]], which was also a jurist from Altamura and he was more famous than him.&lt;ref name=storie-inedite_p8&gt;[[#storie-inedite |storie-inedite, p. 8]]&lt;/ref&gt; Local historian [[Tommaso Berloco]] suggested that Orlandi mentioned Donato in order to thank him for the source, and he suggested that Giovanni Donato may have used pseudonym "Domenico Santoro". Another hypothesis is that Giovanni Donato was a relative of Domenico Santoro's.&lt;ref name=storie-inedite_p8/&gt;

The original edition of his work, as well as the following, went lost. The manuscript which survived dates back to the XIX century or the early years of the XX century. Even though the manuscript is a faithful reproduction of his original work, it contains a few copying mstakes and parts added  by other writers.&lt;ref name=storie-inedite_p7/&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ethnohistory''' is the study of cultures and [[indigenous peoples]]' customs by examining historical records as well as other sources of information on their lives and history. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the [[history of the Americas]].

Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi=10.2307/481465| jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
Scholars studying the history of [[Mexico]]'s indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]'', edited by archeologist [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] was involved with creating a multiple volumes on [[Mesoamerican]] ethnohistory, published as ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', appearing in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', volumes 12-16, Howard F. Cline, general editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the volumes were published, "both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 12, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources "which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory."&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the [[New Philology]]. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the [[history of Mexico]] that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html | title=Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, Provisional Version, James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood, editors (2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist [[Howard F. Cline]], who was commissioned to work on Florda Indians and [[Jicarilla Apache]].  

The field has also reached into [[Melanesia]], where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. [[Michael Harkin]] argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Harkin, "Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory," ''Social Science History,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 34#2 pp 113-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = N. | year = 1961 | title = Ethnohistory: An Ethnological Point of View | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 83 | doi=10.2307/480349| jstor = 480349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/482586 | last1 = DeMallie | first1 = Raymond J. | year = 1993 | title = These Have No Ears": Narrative and the Ethnohistorical Method | jstor = 482586| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 515–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related [[methodology|methodologies]] in that it embraces [[emic]] perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past.

The definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically "the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material," as described by [[William N. Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenton | first1 = W. N. | year = 1966 | title = Field Work, Museum Studies, and Ethnohistorical Research | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 13 | issue = 1/2| page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[James Axtell]] described ethnohistory as "the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories."&lt;ref name="Axtell1979" /&gt; Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. [[Ed Schieffelin]] asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, E. and D. Gewertz (1985), ''History and Ethnohistory in Papua New Guinea'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as "a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow."

'''Gagra choli''' or '''ghagra choli''', which is also known as  '''lehenga choli''' and locally as '''chaniya choli''', is the traditional clothing of women from the [[Indian subcontinent]], notable in Indian states of [[Rajasthan]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=m2NjTqTpCYHDgQfq37ixCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=tU5uAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=lehenga+Rajasthan&amp;q=lehenga+#search_anchor Rajasthan (district Gazetteers) – Rajsamand]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nqvloPNdEZgC&amp;dq=marathi+sari&amp;q=lehenga#v=snippet&amp;q=ghagra&amp;f=false People of India: Rajasthan, Part 1 – K. S.

In [[Punjab region|Punjab]] it was traditionally worn with the [[Kurti top|kurti]] and [[Shalwar kameez|salwar]].&lt;ref&gt;Punjabi Sabhiachaar barey by Jit Singh Joshi Waris Shah Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It is a combination of the ''gagra'' or ''lehenga'' (long skirt) and the ''choli'' (blouse).

==Terms and history==
Historically, the gagra choli evolved from the three-piece attire worn by women in ancient India. The attire consisted of the ''[[antriya]]'' lower garment, the ''[[uttariya]]'' veil worn over shoulder or head and ''stanapatta'' a chestband, which finds mentioned in [[Sanskrit]] literature and Buddhist [[Pali]] literature during the 6th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Agam Kala Prakashan, 1991 "Costume, coiffure, and ornaments in the temple sculpture of northern Andhra", p.118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choli===
{{Main|Choli}}
[[File:Gagra Choli.jpg|thumb|170px|Woman in traditional style of gagra choli worn in [[Hindi belt]]]]
A ''choli'' ([[Hindi]]: चोली, {{lang-ne|चोलो}}), (''ravike'' in South India [[Telugu language|Telugu]]: రవికె, [[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ರವಿಕೆ) is a [[midriff]]-baring [[blouse]] commonly worn with the Indian [[sari]] costume (worn in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and other surrounding countries). It evolved from the ancient ''Stanapatta'' (also known as ''Kanchuki'') and is cut to fit tightly to the body with its short sleeves and low neck. The choli is usually cropped, allowing exposure of the [[navel]]; the cropped design is particularly well-suited for wear in the hot summers of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

===Gagra===
{{Main|Lehenga}}
[[File:Lengha Choli.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of different regional variations of ghagra choli worn by women in India]]
''Lehenga'', ''gagra''/''ghagra'' ([[Hindi]]: घाघरा ''ghāghrā'') also ''chaniya''&lt;ref name="Fashions from India - Tom Tierney"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hdOsQadR9_cC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=waist+chain+india&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gLtuTsTaLajZ0QGp8qmCCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=midriff&amp;f=false Fashions from India – Tom Tierney]&lt;/ref&gt; (known as ''pavadai'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: பாவாடை) is a form of skirt which is long, embroidered and pleated. It is secured at the waist or hips and leaves the lower back and [[midriff]] bare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W7c8TBQhoAIC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=lehenga+saree&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J1VjTvuNEZTUgAfvvuGsCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Social Science a Textbook in History for Class IX as per New Syllabus – FK Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient version of skirt or ''ghagri'' evolved from ''bhairnivasani'', which in turn evolved from the [[antriya]] when stitching on one side became tabular and was worn gathered together at the waist, and held by a girdle. This was one of the earliest forms of a clumsily stitched skirt. It was worn using a ''nada'' or drawstring. The ''ghagri'' was a narrow skirt {{convert|6|feet}} long—the same length as the original ''antriya''—and can still be seen worn by [[Jain nun]]s in India.

Until the early 20th century, women irrespective of class largely wore gagras which reached down to ankles, especially in the [[Hindi belt]]. This was largely due to jeweled toes indicating the marital status of women, as both married and unmarried women observed the [[ghoonghat]] veil. Gagras were made out of two to three layers of coarse khadi fabric which created large flared look and remained largely plain but were decorated with ''gota'' and ''badla'' embroidery  on special occasions. Most commonly used dyes were indigo, lac and turmeric. This style can still be seen in rural areas of [[Haryana]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] &amp; [[Madhya Pradesh]] particularly during folk festivals.

The ancient, unstitched form of gagra has survived in folk theater costumes across India, particularly in [[Kathakali]] of Kerala, where layers of pleated khadi fabric are laid over a nada and tied around the waist, creating layers of flared skirt. This reflects the simplistic early style of unstitched gagras worn in ancient times.

===Dupatta===
{{Main|Dupatta}}
The '''dupatta''' ([[Hindi]]: दुपट्टा, [[Urdu]]: دوپٹا) or '''chunri''' (known as ''oṛna'' in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: ওড়না) is a scarf that is like a shawl and is worn with the gagra and choli. It is also used as part of the women's [[shalwar kameez]] costume. It is an evolved form of the [[Uttariya]]. Until the early 21st century, the dupatta was the most decorative part of gagra choli, while the rest of the garment was plainer, especially the gagra was an everyday one. Dupatta is worn in many regional styles across India. The most common style since early medieval times was to pleat the dupatta on one end, so it can be anchored by tucking it into the front waist of the gagra. The loose end is then wrapped across the waist and/or draped diagonally across the upper body to fall over the shoulder, or up and over to cover the head. This is similar to the way a sari is generally worn. Women farming or doing manual work tuck both ends of the dupatta into their choli.

The dupatta is traditionally seen as a symbol of modesty, as its main purpose is to serve as a [[veil]]. There is no single way of wearing it, so as time passed and fashion changed, the styling of the dupatta also evolved.

==Fabrics==
The lehengas are made of a number of fabrics such as [[silk]], [[cotton]], [[khadi]],&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dhanwanti Keshavrao|title=Dressed for dandiya|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051008/saturday/main4.htm|accessdate=12 April 2012|newspaper=The Tribune|date=October 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgette (fabric)|georgette]], [[crape]], [[Net (textile)|net]], [[satin]], [[brocade]] and [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrigujarati.co.in/14/1/women/a-types-of-indian-lehengas.html Types of Indian Lehengas – nrigujarati.co.in]&lt;/ref&gt; Although designers have successfully used various fabrics for lehenga, silk is still the preferred fabric.

==Decorative stitching==
Apart from the fabric, decorative stitching patterns also play a role. Lehengas come with a wide variety of decoration and embroidery work like [[Gota Work|Gota]], [[Phulkari]], [[Shisha (embroidery)|Shisha]], [[Chikankari]], [[Zari]], [[Zardozi]], [[Nakshi Kantha|Nakshi]], [[Kundan]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsbycompany.com/post/view/8826/The-latest-fashion-trends-in-saree-collection/ The latest fashion trends in saree collection – newsbycompany.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For festivals like [[Navratri]], the ethnic [[Shisha (embroidery)|Shisha]] embroidery is popular with a bit of patchwork. For formal wear and weddings, the embroidery is heavier in pearls, silk, sequins and zari.&lt;ref name="ch" /&gt;

[[Kutch]] embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the [[Rabari]]s, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread.The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes.This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=K.JESHI|title=Exquisite embroidery|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2004/07/19/stories/2004071900860300.htm|accessdate=12 April 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=Jul 19, 2004|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The [[Sodha]]s use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia [[Jats of Kutch|Jats]] are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The [[Jats of Kutch|Dhanetah Jats]] love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch.&lt;ref name="ch" /&gt;

==Festive attire==
The lehenga choli is the favourite female apparel worn during festivals, weddings or special events in India. This is due to traditions as well as of the fact that it is available in a number of fabrics with many different decorative choices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articlesnatch.com/Article/Lehengas--An-Elegant-Wear/2036015 Lehengas-An Elegant Wear – Pooja Lapasia]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally the sari and the lehenga choli are the most popular garments for the bride in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/24/stories/2007012400610500.htm Fashionable wedding attire –  The Hindu]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a common bridal attire mostly in [[North India]] and is also the traditional wear of Garba festival in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lsai4v554d8C&amp;dq=lehenga+saree&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s India – R.I.C. Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritu Kala – significance in rite of passage==
{{main| Langa Voni|Ritu Kala}}
In southern India, coming of age ceremony or rites of passage (''langa voni'' Telugu: లంగా వోని, ''Pattu Pavadai'' Tamil: பட்டு பாவாடை, ''Langa Davani'' Kannada: ಲಂಗ ದ್ವನಿ) are celebrated when a girl reaches puberty. She wears [[langa voni]] during the first part of the ceremony and then she is given her first sari, which she wears during the second half of the ceremony. This marks her transition into womanhood.

The tradition of presenting langa voni begins with the girl's first naming ceremony called [[Naming ceremony|Namakaran]] and her first rice feeding ceremony called [[Annaprashana]]. She receives her last one at her coming of age ceremony. Langa voni is traditional clothing for unmarried girls in southern India.

==Luanchari==
{{Main|Luanchari}}
Luanchari ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]: लुआंचणी) is a full-dress garment. The luanchari is made up of two parts. The upper part is called choli, and is made of the same fabric as of the lehanga, but it is not uncommon to find the two pieces of the garment in different colours. The choli is stitched to the lehanga, to make a one-piece luanchari. This is commonly worn by the women in Pahari miniatures, and is quite similar to lehanga.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.in"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFPnh9B5zncC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=Launchari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nvmkULS7O-bwmAWSgIHoDw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Launchari&amp;f=false |title=Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya – Omacanda Hāṇḍā – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may take over 21 yards of cloth to make a complete luanchari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7JmR6_-oMjcC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=Luanchari&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=To8uvukEAZ&amp;sig=dJ4pT1p6nf59VbtOK79wKyV2qMY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rRKlULCsMueZiAeR0ICoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Luanchari&amp;f=false |title=Life Style, Indian Tribes: Locational Practice – Shiva Tosh Das – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a traditional garment worn by Gaddis of [[Himachal Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.in"/&gt;

'''Gilbert Fite''' (1918–2010) was an American historian, especially influential for his work in [[agricultural history]].

==Biography==
Fite lived his early life in South Dakota and received his education through the master's level in that state. After completing an M.A. in history at the [[University of South Dakota]], he completed his doctoral studies at the [[University of Missouri]], where he received the Ph.D.&lt;ref name="my605"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pure Pierre Politics|url=http://my605.com/pierrereview/?p=2432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fite spent most of his academic career at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. He also held the Richard B. Russell chair in American history at the [[University of Georgia]].  Fite wrote many books and articles for academic historical journals.

Fite also served as president of the Agricultural History Society (1960–1961), and from 1971 to 1976 he was president of [[Eastern Illinois University]].&lt;ref name="castle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://castle.eiu.edu/media/viewstory.php?action=118|title=Former EIU President Gilbert Fite Dies at 92|publisher=Eastern Illinois University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Headwater Diversion Plan''' was an [[Arab League]] plan to divert two of the three sources of the [[Jordan River]], and prevent them from flowing into the [[Sea of Galilee]], in order to thwart [[Israel]]'s plans to use the water of the [[Hasbani]] and [[Banias]] in its National Water Carrier project for out of Basin irrigation. The plan was approved by the Arab League in 1964 but Israel prevented the project's development by conducting airstrikes in Syrian territory in April 1967.

==Background==
In 1955 the [[Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan|Unified (Johnston) Plan]] for the multinational development of [[Jordan River]] basin between the [[Water right|riparian rights]] holders was finalized. The Plan was accepted by the technical committees from both Israel and the [[Arab League]]. A discussion in the [[Knesset]] in July 1955 ended without a vote. The Arab Experts Committee approved the plan in September 1955 and referred it for final approval to the Arab League Council. On 11 October 1955, the Council voted not to ratify the plan, due to the League's opposition to formal recognition of Israel.&lt;ref name=UNU/&gt; After the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 however, the Arab states (with the exception of Jordan) considerably hardened their position against Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; and now opposed the plan, arguing that by strengthening its economy the plan would increase the potential threat from Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, pp. 228–230.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab leadership also argued that the increase to Israel's water supply would encourage the immigration of more Jewish settlers, thus reducing the possibility of repatriation for Palestinian refugees of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|1948 war]].&lt;ref name=UNU/&gt; However, Nasser, the Egyptian president, assured the Americans that the Arabs would not exceed the water quotas prescribed by the Johnston plan&lt;ref  name="Gat2003p101"/&gt;

Nevertheless, both [[Jordan]] and Israel undertook to operate within the allocations laid out within the "Johnston Plan" {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Two civil engineering projects were completed successfully; the diversion of water from the Jordan River (1.7 million cubic metres in a day) at Eshed Kinrot, carried by the Israeli [[National Water Carrier of Israel|National Water Carrier]] from 1955 to 1964 and the Jordanian construction of the East Ghor Canal (now known as the [[King Abdullah Canal]]) from 1957 to 1966.&lt;ref name="UNU"&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0m.htm United Nations University] In 1955 the Unified (Johnston) Plan to develop a multilateral approach to water management failed to be ratified, which reinforced unilateral development. Nevertheless, both Jordan and Israel undertook to operate within their allocations, and two major successful projects were undertaken: the Israeli National Water Carrier and Jordan's East Ghor Main Canal.... Design of the East Ghor canal was begun by Jordan in 1957. It was intended as the first section of a much more ambitious plan known as the Greater Yarmouk project. Additional sections included (1) construction of two Dams on the Yarmouk (Mukheiba and Maqarin) for storage and hydroelectricity, (2) construction of a 47-km West Ghor canal, together with a siphon across the Jordan River near wadi Faria to connect it with the East Ghor Canal, (3) construction of seven dams to utilise seasonal flow on side wadis flowing into the Jordan, and (4) construction of pumping stations, lateral canals, and flood protection and drainage facilities. In the original Greater Yarmouk project the East Ghor Canal was scheduled to provide only 25% of the total irrigation scheme.... Construction of the Canal began in 1959. By 1961 its first section was completed; sections two and three, down Wadi Zarqa, were in service by June 1966. Shortly before completion of the Israeli Water Carrier in 1964, an Arab summit conference decided to try to thwart it. Discarding direct military attack, the Arab states chose to divert the Jordan headwaters. Two options were considered: either the diversion of the Hasbani to the Litani and the diversion of the Banias to the Yarmouk, or the diversion of both the Hasbani and the Banias to the Yarmouk. The latter was chosen, with the diverted waters to be stored behind the Mukhaiba dam.... The Arabs started work on the Headwater Diversion Project in 1965. Israel declared that it would regard such diversion as an infringement of its sovereign rights. According to the estimates completion of the project would have deprived Israel of 35% of its contemplated withdrawal from the upper Jordan, constituting one ninth of Israel's annual water budget. Murakami, Masahiro (1995) Managing Water for Peace in the Middle East: Alternative Strategies, {{ISBN|92-808-0858-3}} pp. 295–297&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversion Plan==
In 1964 when Israel's [[National Water Carrier of Israel|National Water Carrier]] was nearing completion, the second [[Arab League]] summit conference voted on a plan designed to circumvent and frustrate it.&lt;ref name=Shemesh2008p67/&gt; Their resolution stated: &lt;blockquote&gt; The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And Since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.&lt;ref name="AS229"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Arab and North African states chose to divert the Jordan headwaters rather than to use direct military intervention.&lt;ref name="IKandHG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AS229"/&gt; The heads of State of the Arab League considered two options:
#The diversion of the [[Hasbani]] to the [[Litani River|Litani]] combined with the diversion of the [[Banias]] to the [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]],
#The diversion of both the Hasbani and the Banias to the Yarmouk.

The second option was selected. The scheme was only marginally feasible, was technically difficult and expensive. Arab political considerations were cited to justify the diversion scheme.&lt;ref  name="Murakami1995p296"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shemesh2008p49/&gt; [[Syria]] began its part of the overall Arab diversion plan with the construction of the Banias to Yarmouk canal in 1965, with financing from [[Egypt]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. Once completed, the diversion of the flow would have transported the water into a dam at Mukhaiba for use by Jordan and Syria and prevent the water from reaching the Sea of Galilee.  Lebanon also started a canal to divert the waters of the Hasbani, whose source is in [[Lebanon]], into the Banias. The Hasbani and Banias diversion works would have had the effect of reducing the capacity of the Israeli carrier from the Sea of Galilee by about 35% and Israel's overall water supply by about 11%. Additionally, it would have increased the salinity of the Sea of Galilee by 60 ppm.&lt;ref name="IKandHG" /&gt; 
{{see also|War over Water (Jordan river){{!}}The "War over Water"}}
Israel declared that it would regard such diversion as an infringement of its sovereign rights.&lt;ref name="UNU"/&gt; Israel exploited the [[Israel–Syria Mixed Armistice Commission|DMZ]] incidents as pretexts for bombing the diversion project,&lt;ref name="Oren2002p23"/&gt; culminating in air strikes deep in Syrian territory in April 1967.&lt;ref name="UNU"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The increase in water-related Arab-Israeli hostility was a major factor leading to the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name="IKandHG"/&gt;

&lt;ref name=Shemesh2008p67&gt;The first Arab summit conference ratified the Arab strategy to thwart Israel’s NWC Plan. The strategy was designed to divert the Jordan’s tributaries and prepare the Arab armies for the defence of the engineering operations.

&lt;ref name="AS229"&gt;Shlaim, Avi (200) ibid pp 229–230 In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo. The main item on the agenda was the threat posed by Israel's diversion of water from the north to irrigate the south and the expected reduction in the water supplies available to Syria and Jordan. The reaction of the summit to this threat was deadly serious. The preamble to its decision stated,
:The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And Since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular emphasis was placed on the Carrier's capability to enhance Israel's capacity to absorb immigrants to the detriment of Palestinian refugees."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Shemesh2008p49&gt;The diversion consisted of:-
# Diversion of tributaries in Lebanon.
:A The upper Hasbani- the excavation of a canal from the Hasbani springs in the Hasbaya region and a canal from the wadi Shab’a for carrying water to the kawkaba tunnels and from there to the Litani River. (This project would transport 40–60 million cubic metres of water annually).
:B. The Middle hasbani-two diversion points-the first in the hasbani riverbed; the second in wadi sarid. The Hasbani and Sarid would flow in a canal to the banias and from there to the Yarmuk. According to the plan, 20–30 million cubic metres of water would flow annually to Syria (if Lebanon did not divert the hasbani’s floodwater to the Litani, the Sarid canal could transport up to 60 million cubic metres of water a year).
:C. The Wazani Spring in the Lower Hasbani Riverbed-this would include an irrigation canal (carrying 16 million cubic metres of water a year) for local use in Lebanon; an irrigation canal in Syria (8 million cubic metres a year); and three pumping units to transport the Wanzani’s overflow to Syria via the Sarid-Banias canal at a rate of 26 million cubic metres a year.
:2. Diversions in Syrian territory
:A. Diversion of the Banias-The diversion plan for the banias called for a 73 kilometre long canal to be dug 350 metres above sea level that would link the banias with the Yamuk. The canal would carry the Banias’s fixed flow plus the overflow from the hasbani (including water from the Sarid and Wazani). The Banias diversion would provide 90 million cubic metres of water for irrigation of riverine areas. The designers calculated that eighteen months would be sufficient for executing the plan. The cost was estimated at five million Pounds Sterling (including two tunnels), that is, approximately two million pounds more than the Arab plan.
:B. The butayha Project-The Syrians feared that if the Arabs implemented their diversion plan, Israel would block the batayha Valley inhabitants, annual pumping of 22 million cubic metres from the Jordan as proposed in the Johnson plan. To guarantee the villagers their vital water supply, the Arab plan contained a proviso designed to incorporate primary and secondary canals from the Sea of Galilee.
:3. The water plans in Jordan.
:The construction of a dam in the Kingdom of Jordan (the Mukheiba dam on the Yarmuk River) was designed to hold 200 million cubic metres of water. Work on the dam would take 30 months at a cost of ten and one quarter million Pounds Sterling. The Mukheiba Dam (and the Makarin Dam) would hurt Israel if incorporated into the diversion plans for the Jordan River’s northern sources, and without the Mukheiba dam all of the diverted water would flow back to the Yarmuk and return to the Jordan’s riverbed south of the Sea of Galilee. Excluding this plan, the rest of the Jordan’s water projects correspond with the main parts of the Johnson Plan.

'''Józef Dominik "Kresowiec" Bartłomiej [[Chołodecki]]''' (15 August 1852 – 30 January 1934) was a [[Poland|Polish]] historian.

==Biography==
Chołodecki was born in 1852 in {{ill|Stawki, Yavoriv Raion|lt=Stawki|uk|Ставки (Яворівський район)}} in the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] region of the then [[Austro-Hungarian]] empire, close to the present day city of [[L'viv]]  in the Ukraine. His adopted middle name of [[Bialynia Coat of Arms|Bialynia]] refers to the clan and Coat of Arms of his family. Chołodecki was the son of Celestyn, a writer and a ''nadleśniczy'' of the forestry department in Galicia, and Emilia from the house of [[Setti da Forli]]. His academic studies began at home, and continued at primary school in [[Stryi|Stryj]] located in present-day Ukraine. He attended high school in Lwów, and took his maturity exam on 10 October 1870. That same year he enrolled at the University of  Lwów to study law, graduating in 1874.

He had to work even while attending high school due to his father's death. In 1873, a year prior to finishing his law degree, Józef applied to the Directors of the Lwów postal service. He received a position with the postal service in Czerlany, later in Niżniów, Stanisławów, and finally in Lwów. In 1880 he became the regional director of the commisars postal service in Czerniowce, he quickly rose up the ranks of the postal service until he became the director of the account departments of the Lwów postal service. He retired while at this position in 1909. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Patriotic traditions==
Chołodecki left his home with a strong patriotic tradition.  His father, who took part in two uprisings and was jailed as a political dissident as a result, as well as other close family like [[Tomasz Chołodecki]], a veteran of the [[November Uprising]], had a strong influence on his upbringing.  At the age of 12, he took part in the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 as [[courier]] in the territories surrounding [[Lwów]].  In 1867 while still in high school he was part of an underground student organization which was later dissolved by  the Austrian authorities. While a student at the [[University of Lwów]], Chołodecki was the most active member of the highly regarded Academic Reading room (''Czytelnia Akademicka''), he took an active part in an assortment of Polish organizations throughout the region.  In Czerniowce he became a contributor to ''Gazeta Polska'', a newspaper run by [[Klemens Kolakowski|Klemens Kościesz Kołakowski]]. He became a member of the board of ''Czytelnia Polska'', founded a library and wrote a history of the ''Czytelnia'' in 1885. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In his first literary endeavors, books and pamphlets printed from the presses of ''Gazeta Polska'', Chołodecki wrote under the pseudonym of Walenty Ćwik, this included his historical book about Bukowina in 1884, an examination of the history of the Polish Navy and Polish artillery in 1885, and a biography of Henryk Schmitt in 1888. He used an  assumed name fearing repression by the Austrian authorities.  Finally he presented his literary ambitions to the minister of trade, and due to his influence through his position  at the postal service in Lwów, he was granted the right to publish books under his name.

==Life in Lwów==
After moving to Lwów, Chołodecki joined numerous organizations, becoming the president of the Postal Club, and he was able to create many other organizations that were able to  grow through his support. He was verbally attacked by the president of the Lwów postal service, a man surnamed Seferowicz, in 1906 for his  vigorous activity in these organizations, which the President claimed discredited him as a director at the Lwów postal service. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Chołodecki vehemntly denied the charge and accused Seferowicz of a personal attack. Chołodecki was also part of many of intellectual circles and organizations, including the Organization for Polish Education, the Heraldic Organization, Organization of Studies in Przemyśl, and the Organization of Lwów Historians (''Tow. Miłośników przeszłości Lwowa''), which printed many of his most famous and renowned works. Between 1902 and 1908 Chołodecki was a ''radny'' for the city of Lwów. During [[World War I]] Chołodecki was jailed by  the Tsarist authorities in Kiev, and he took part in the defense of Lwów during the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Life as a writer==
As a writer, many of Chołodecki's works dealt with the Polish [[November Uprising]] of 1830 and [[January Uprising]] of 1863. He also wrote the biographies of many prominent individuals in Poland's fight for independence. Chołodecki was a chronicler of the family history and genealogy of the Chołodecki family. He was awarded the order [[Polonia Restituta]]. He died in Lwów on 30 January 1934, aged 81.

The '''Liceu Escolar de Lleida''' was a school in [[Lleida]], [[Catalonia]], Spain founded by [[Frederic Godàs]] and [[Victorina Vila Badia]] in 1906, who wanted to introduce a modern, progressive pedagogy system, part of the [[New Catalan School]] movement, in the country's outdated and authoritarian school system. The Liceu Escolar is now famous for the [[Spanish Civil War]] November 2, 1937 bombing during which it was bombed by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italian]] aviation, during which 12,000&amp;nbsp;kg. of bombs were dropped in the city,&lt;ref&gt;http://dignidadmemoriayvida.blogspot.com/2007/11/tv3.html&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 700 casualties. 48 children and several teachers died during the raid in the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paeria.es/cat/ajuntament/noticies.asp?Detall%3DTrue%26IdNoticia%3D5076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720143456/http://www.paeria.es/cat/ajuntament/noticies.asp?Detall=True&amp;IdNoticia=5076 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is still not exactly known if it the bombing of the Liceu was planned or a mistake.

Students include poet [[Màrius Torres]]. A monument by [[Agustín Ortega Bragado]] now commemorates the tragedy, on [[Avinguda Blondel, Lleida|Avinguda Blondel]], in front of the [[Institut d'Estudis Ilerdencs]], the [[Institut Municipal d'Acció Cultural]] and [[CaixaForum Lleida]].

This article lists the '''oldest extant freestanding buildings in Scotland'''. In order to qualify for the list a [[structure]] must:
* be a recognisable building (defined as any human-made structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or continuous [[occupancy]]);
*incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} in height and/or be a [[listed building]].

This consciously excludes ruins of limited height, roads and statues. Bridges may be included if they otherwise fulfill the above criteria. Dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by [[radiocarbon dating]] and should be considered approximate.

The main chronological list includes buildings that date from no later than 1199 AD. Although the oldest building on the list is the Neolithic farmhouse at [[Knap of Howar]], the earliest period is dominated by [[chambered cairn]]s, numerous examples of which can be found from the 4th millennium BC through to the early Bronze Age.

Estimates of the number of [[broch]] sites throughout the country, which date from the [[Iron Age]], range from just over 100 to over 500.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2003) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small percentage are sufficiently well preserved for them to be included here and some of those that could be remain undated.

As there are  relatively few structures from the latter half of the first millennium AD and a significant number from the 12th century, the latter group is  placed in a sub-list. There are larger numbers of extant qualifying structures from 1200 onwards and separate lists for 13th-century castles and religious buildings are provided. As the oldest buildings in many of the [[council area]]s in the more urbanised [[Central Belt]] date from after the 14th century a separate list showing oldest buildings by council area is provided.
[[File:Skara Brae - geograph.org.uk - 888338.jpg|thumb|Dwelling at [[Skara Brae]], part of the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]] [[World Heritage Site]]]]
There is also a supplementary list of qualifying structures for which no confirmed date of construction is available and a short listing of substantial prehistoric structures that are not buildings as defined above.

'''Lord Protector''' (pl. '''Lords Protectors''') is a title that has been used in British [[constitutional law]] for the head of state. It is also a particular title for the British heads of state in respect to the established church. It is sometimes used to refer to holders of other temporary posts, for example, a [[regent]] acting for the absent monarch.

==Feudal Royal Regent==
The title of "The Lord Protector" was originally used by royal princes or other nobles exercising an individual [[Regent|regency]] (i.e. not merely as a member of a collegial regency council) while the English monarch was still a [[minor (law)|minor]] or otherwise unable to rule.

Notable cases in England are:
* [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John, Duke of Bedford]], and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], were (5 December 1422 – 6 November 1429) jointly Lords Protectors for [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] (1421–1471);
* [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York]], was thrice (3 April 1454 – February 1455; 19 November 1455 – 25 February 1456; and [[Act of Accord|31 October]] – [[Battle of Wakefield|30 December 1460]]) Lord Protector for Henry VI;
* [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], was "Lord Protector of the Realm" (10 May 1483 – 26 June 1483), during the nominal reign of [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] (one of the [[Princes in the Tower]]) before claiming the throne for himself as [[Richard III of England|Richard III]];
* [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], [[Duke of Somerset]], was Lord Protector (4 February 1547 – 11 October 1549), during the early years of the reign of the young [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]];
and in Scotland:
* [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany]], was "Governor and Protector of the Realm" (12 July 1515 – 16 November 1524) for [[James V of Scotland]] (1512–1542);
* [[James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault]], was "Governor and Protector of the Kingdom" (3 January 1543 – 12 April 1554) for [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].

[[File:Standard of Oliver Cromwell (1653–1659).svg|thumb|left|250px|Standard of the Lord Protector]]
The '''Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland''' was the title of the [[head of state]] during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Instrument of Government |volume=14 |pages=655–656 |first=Arthur William |last=Holland}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or, to monarchists, the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]]), following the first period when a [[English Council of State|Council of State]] held executive power. The title was held by [[Oliver Cromwell]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (December 1653 – September 1658) and subsequently his son and designated successor [[Richard Cromwell]] (September 1658 – May 1659) during what is now known as [[The Protectorate]].

The 1653 [[Instrument of Government (1653)|Instrument of Government]] (republican constitution) stated that—
&lt;blockquote&gt;Oliver Cromwell, [[Captain-General]] of the forces of England, Scotland and Ireland, shall be, and is hereby declared to be, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging, for his life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The replacement constitution of 1657, the [[Humble Petition and Advice]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; gave "His Highness the Lord Protector" the power to nominate his successor. Cromwell chose his eldest surviving son, the politically inexperienced Richard. This was a non-representative and de facto dynastic mode of succession, with royal connotations in both styles awarded, (even a double invocation 16 December 1653 &amp;ndash; 3 September 1658 "[[By the Grace of God]] and Republic Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland") and many other monarchic prerogatives, such as that of awarding knighthoods.

The younger Cromwell, who succeeded on his father's death in September 1658, held the position for only eight months before resigning in May 1659, being followed by the second period of Commonwealth rule until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the exiled heir to the Stuart throne [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in May 1660.

==Post-Cromwell==
Since the Restoration the title has not been used in either of the above manners. [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]], appointed to the regency in 1811, was referred to as "His Royal Highness the [[Prince Regent]]". George exercised the powers of the monarchy, just as Lords Protectors had, but the title's republican associations had rendered it distasteful.

== Protector of the church ==
Lord Protector has also been used as a rendering of the Latin ''Advocatus'' in the sense of a temporal Lord (such as a Monarch) who acted as the protector of the mainly secular interests of a part of the church; compare [[vidame]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3699">'''Mathieu Auguste Geffroy''' (21 April 1820 – 16 August 1895) was a [[France|French]] historian born in [[Paris]].

After studying at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], he held history professorships at various [[Lyceum|lyceés]]. His French thesis for the doctorate of letters, ''Etude sur les pamphlets politiques et religieux de Milton'' (1848), showed that he was attracted towards foreign history, a study for which he soon qualified himself by mastering the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian language]]s.

In 1851, he published a ''Histoire des états scandinaves'', which is especially valuable for clear arrangement and for the trustworthiness of its facts. Later, a long stay in [[Sweden]] furnished him with valuable documents for a political and social history of Sweden and France at the end of the 18th century.

In 1864 and 1865. he published. in the ''Revue des deux inondés''. a series of articles on [[Gustav III of Sweden]] and the French court, which were republished in book form in 1867. To the second volume he appended a critical study on ''Marie Anloinette et Louis XVI apocryphes'', in which he proved, by evidence drawn from documents in the private archives of the emperor of Austria, that the letters published by [[Feuillet de Conches]] (''Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette et Madame Elisabeth'', 1864-1873) and [[Hunolstein]] (''Corresp. indite de Marie Antoinette'', 1864) are forgeries. With the collaboration of Alfred von Arneth, director of the imperial archives at [[Vienna]], he edited the ''{{lang|fr|Correspondance secrete enire Marie-Thérése et le comte de Mercy-Argenieau}}'' (3 vols., 1874), the first account based on trustworthy documents of [[Marie Antoinette]]'s character, private conduct and policy.

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] drew Geffroy's attention to the origins of [[Germany]], and his ''Rome et les Barbares: Étude sur la Germanie de Tacite'' (1874) set forth some of the results of German scholarship. He was then appointed to superintend the opening of the French school of [[archaeology]] at Rome, and drew up two useful reports (1877 and 1884) on its origin and early work. But his personal tastes always led him back to the study of modern history.

When the Paris archives of foreign affairs were thrown open to students, it was decided to publish a collection of the instructions given to French ambassadors since 1648 (''{{lang|fr|Recueil des instructions donnas aux ambassadeurs et ministres de France depuis le traité de Westphalie}}''), and Geffroy was commissioned to edit the volumes dealing with Sweden (vol.ii., 1885) and [[Denmark]] (vol. xiii., 1895). In the interval he wrote ''{{lang|fr|Madame de Maintenon d'aprés sa correspondance authentique}}'' (2 vols., 1887), in which he displayed his penetrating critical faculty in discriminating between authentic documents and the additions and corrections of arrangers like La Beaumelle and Lavalle. His last works were an ''Essai sur la formation des collections d'antiques de la Suede'' and ''Des institutions et des moeurs du paganisme scandinave: l'Islande avant le Christianisme'', both published posthumously. He died at Bivre on 16 August 1895.

Artamonov's scholarly career was centered on [[Leningrad University]], where he was a professor from 1935 and the head of the department of [[archaeology]] from 1949.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd edition, entry on "Артамонов", available online [http://slovari.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00004/47100.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt;

He researched [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] settlements by the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], in the [[North Caucasus]] and in the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;  He excavated a great number of [[Scythian]] and Khazar [[kurgans]] and settlements (most famously, the Khazar fortress of [[Sarkel]]), and published a hefty monograph (''Istoriya Khazar'') on the [[Khazars]] in 1962. Early editions of this work (1937, 1939), which emphasized the enormous influence of the Khazars on the development of the early [[Rus' people|Rus']] and other peoples, were denounced by Soviet authorities, compelling him to add a conclusion to his work stating essentially that they had in fact had no lasting influence.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Artamonov was appointed director of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in 1951. Thirteen years later, he was ousted from office for having connived at exhibitions of [[Russian Non-Conformist]]s. {{cn|date=June 2018}}

Artamonov was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]], the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] and various medals.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt; His many disciples include [[Lev Gumilyov]], [[Anatoly Kirpichnikov]], [[Dmitry Machinsky]], and [[Igor Dubov]].

'''Mohammad-Taqi Bahar''' ({{lang-fa|محمدتقی بهار}}; also [[Romanize]]d as Mohammad-Taqí Bahār; December 9, 1886 in [[Mashhad]] – April 22, 1951 in [[Tehran]]), widely known as '''Malek o-Sho'arā''' ({{lang-fa|ملک‌الشعراء}}) and '''Malek o-Sho'arā Bahār''' (literally: ''the king of poets''), is a renowned Iranian [[poet]] and [[scholar]], who was also a [[politician]], [[journalist]], [[historian]] and Professor of [[Literature]]. Although he was a 20th-century poet, his poems are fairly traditional and strongly nationalistic in character.

== Biography==
Mohammad-Taqí Bahār was born on December 9, 1886. His father was '''Mohammad Kazem Sabouri''', and his mother was '''Sakineh Tehrani''' (daughter of Haj Abbas Gholi Tehrani). in the Sarshoor District of [[Mashhad]], the capital city of the [[Khorasan Province]] in the north-east of [[Iran]]. Bahār began his primary [[education]] when he was three, with his father, Mohammad Kāzem Sabouri, as his [[tutor]]. Mohammad Kāzem Sabouri was the [[Poet Laureate]] of the shrine in Mashad and had the honorific title of ''Malek o-Sho'arā'', The King of Poets.&lt;ref&gt;A relatively detailed biography of Mohammad-Taqí Bahār, by his youngest son, [[Mehrdad Bahar]], is available on the Official Website of Bahār: [http://www.bahar-site.fr/zendaginama.htm] (in Persian). Bahār's first autobiography is also made available by this Website: [http://www.bahar-site.fr/khodNeweshtZendagiBahar.pdf] (in Persian, 12 pages).

Amongst others, these biographies indicate that Mohammad-Taqi Bahār is through his paternal lineage related to Amir Ghiāss od-Din, the patriarch of the Zarrābi family in [[Kashan]], one of the Generals of the [[Safavid]] King [[Shah Abbas II]] who accompanied Shah Abbas in the wars leading to the conquest of [[Kandahar]] in 1648. The ancestors of Amir Ghiāss od-Din were [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] aristocrats and Heads of the Danbali Tribe in the region between the West of [[Khoy]], [[West Azarbaijan Province]], to the mountains of Diārbakr (now called [[Diyarbakir]]). This family had been throughout the Safavid Era, from [[Shah Ismail I]] onwards, in positions of power, both civilian and military. For instance, Amir Soleiman Danbali, a maternal cousin of Shah Ismail I, fought alongside Shah Ismail in the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514. With some caution, the family traces its roots to the [[Barmakids]] and from thence to the [[Sassanid]] King, [[Khosrau I]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A detailed chronology of the life of Mohammad-Taqí Bahār has been prepared by Mohammad Golbon and is made available on the Official Website of Bahār: [http://www.bahar.fr/zendaginama.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his private schooling, Bahār attended one of the traditional schools, ''Maktab Khāneh'', in Mashhad. To enhance his knowledge of the [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], he further attended the classes of Adib Nai'shābouri, a traditional poet and literary scholar who promoted the style of the poets of Khorasan in the early Islamic era, in the tradition of the so-called ''bāzgasht-e adabī'' (literary regress).&lt;ref&gt;M.B. Loraine and J. Matíní, ''Bahār, Mohammad-Taqī Malek Al-Šoʿarāʾ'', [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f5/v3f5a004.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022074155/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f5/v3f5a004.html |archivedate=2008-10-22 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Bahār knew by heart a very good portion of the [[Koran]] at a very early age. According to Bahār himself, at seven he read [[Shahnameh]] and fully grasped the meaning of Ferdowsi's Epic poems.

Bahār composed his first poem at age eight, at which time he also chose the name ''Bahār'', meaning Spring, as his pen name (''takhallos'' in Persian). It is known that Bahār chose this pen name after [[Bahār Shirvāni]], a poet and close friend of his father's, after Shirvāni's death. Shirvāni was a renowned poet during [[Nasser-al-Din Shah Qajar]].

At 14, Bahār was fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and later he achieved spoken and written fluency in [[French language|French]]. At 18, he lost his father and started to work as a [[Muslim]] [[preacher]] and [[clergy]]. It was during this time that he composed a long [[ode]] (''[[Qasideh]]'' in Persian) and sent it to Mozzafar-al-Din Shah who became so deeply impressed by this ode that he immediately appointed Bahār as his Poet Laureate and by [[Royal Decree]] conferred on him, at the age of 19 (1903), the title of ''Malek o-Sho'arā'' at the shrine of Imam REZA in Mashad.

At the onset of the [[Constitutional Revolution of Iran]] (1906–1911), Bahār laid down his position of Poet Laureateship and joined the revolutionary movement for establishing the parliamentary system of [[democracy]] in Iran. Bahār became an active member of the Mashhad branch of ''Anjoman-e Sa'ādat'' (Society for Prosperity) that campaigned for establishment of [[Parliament]] of Iran (''[[Majles of Iran|Majles]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Majles'' is more completely referred to as ''Majles-e Shorā-ye Melli-e Iran'', that is, National Consultative Assembly of Iran.&lt;/ref&gt;). He published the semi-covert newspaper ''Khorāsān'',&lt;ref&gt;The first edition of ''Khorāsān'' was published on March 19, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with Hossein Ardebili, ''Nou-bahār'' (New Spring), and ''Tāzeh-bahār'' (Fresh Spring), both in collaboration with his cousin [[Haj Sheikh Ahmad Bahar]] who operated a printing company and who acted as the Senior Editor first in Mashhad and later in [[Tehran]].

Bahār published numerous articles in his newspapers in which he passionately exhorted his readers to stand up and help bring about the establishment of a functioning Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar]] aborted democracy in Iran through his [[coup d'état]] in June 1908. For some relevant details, see the biographies of [[Mirza Jahangir Khan]] and [[Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh]].&lt;/ref&gt; He equally forcefully advocated creation of new and reformed public institutions, a new social and political order and of new forms of expression. After the triumph of the Constitutional Revolution, Bahār was repeatedly elected as Member of Parliament.

In 1918, when [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the seventh and the last ruler of the Qajar dynasty, was in power, Bahār reinvented himself: he ceased all his clerical activities and became an entirely new man. At the same time, he together with the writer and poet [[Said Nafisi|Saeed Nafisi]], the poet and historian [[Rashid Yasemi|Gholam-Reza Rashid Yasemi]] the historian [[Abbas Eqbal Ashtiani|Abbas Eqbāl Ashtiāni]], and his talented friend [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]] founded The Literary Association of the Academy (''Anjoman-e Adabi-ye Dāneshkadeh''). The Magazine of the Academy (''Majaleh-ye Dāneshkadeh'') was the monthly publication of this Association, in which, in addition to works of prose and poetry, other very informative and useful articles were published, under such divers titles as "Literary Revolution", "How other nations view us" and "The Literary History of Iran". In fact, this magazine became Bahār's vehicle for publication of the results of his literary researches and introduction of [[Western Literature]] to Iranians. The magazine also played a key role in developing and strengthening the present-day form of Persian Literature.

[[Image:Bahar tomb.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bahār's tomb in [[Zahir-od-dowleh cemetery]],Tehran]]

Following establishment of [[Tehran University]] in 1934 (during the reign of [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]]), Bahār became Professor of Persian Literature at the Faculty of Literature of this University. In the course of his tenure as Professor, he dedicated most of his time to writing and editing books on Persian Literature and History. Notable amongst numerous works written and edited by Bahār are:&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive bibliography consult: Works of Bahār ([http://www.bahar-site.fr/asarBahar.htm ''Āsār-e Bahār'']) in  [http://www.bahar-site.fr/index.htm Bahār's Official Website].&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Moj'malal ol-Tavārikh o val Qesās'' (Concise Histories and Tales),
* ''Javāme' ol-Hekāyāt'' (Anthology of Stories),
* Two volumes of verse, consisting of his own poems.

In 1945, during [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]]'s reign, Bahār served for a short period as the Minister of Culture and Education in the Cabinet of the then Prime Minister [[Ahmad Ghavam]] (aka Ghavam o-Saltaneh). Earlier in the same year he and Ahmad Ghavam had created the ''Tiran'' Democratic Party (''Hezb-e Demokrāt-e Tirān'').

In the last years of his life, Bahār suffered from [[Tuberculosis]]. He sought medical treatment in [[Leysin]], [[Switzerland]], in a sanatorium, where he stayed between 1947 and 1949. It was not long after his return to Iran that his health quickly deteriorated. He died on April 21, 1951,&lt;ref&gt;1 [[Iranian calendar|Ordibehesht]] 1330 AH, at 8 O'clock in the morning.&lt;/ref&gt;  at his home in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahār's home in Tehran was located on Malek o-Sh'sho'arā-ye Bahār Street, Takht-e Jamshid Avenue.&lt;/ref&gt; He is entombed in [[Zahir o-dowleh|Zahir o-Dowleh]] Cemetery in [[Darband, Tehran|Darband]], located in [[Shemiran]], north of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;A close-up of Bahār's gravestone can be viewed here: Dream Land, ''Mohammad-Taqi Bahār'', [https://flickr.com/photos/dreamlandblog/467576008/sizes/o/ flickr].&lt;/ref&gt;

== His Poems ==
Although Bahār was a 20th-century poet, his poems are quite traditional and decidedly [[patriotic]]. Many scholars have strongly emphasized and documented that Bahār's style of writing and the beauty of his [[poetry]], in addition to his deep passion for [[Iran]] and his persistent opposition to [[fanaticism]], have indeed made him one of the greatest cultural icons of modern Iran. Although he worked for some period of time as a clergyman and preacher, his first and foremost passion had always been writing, especially of poetry, as well as carrying out historical researches and teaching.

Through his literary magazine, The Magazine of the Academy (''Majaleh-ye Dāneshkadeh''), Bahār had a significant impact on the development of modern [[Persian literature|Persian poetry and literature]]. One may argue that, to varying degrees, almost all the early advocates of modernism in Persian Poetry and Literature found their inspirations in the new developments and changes that had taken place in [[Western literature]]. Nonetheless, such inspirations would not have easily resulted in changes without the efforts and support of such figures as Bahār, whose literary contributions were, and remain consonant with Iranian culture. In Bahār's collection of poems, one finds poems composed in almost every tradition of Persian Poetry. To name a few, he wrote [[Panegyric]] (''Setāyeshi'' or ''Madiheh''), [[Epic poetry|Epic]] (''Hamāsi''), [[Patriotic]] (''Mihaní''), [[Heraldic]] and [[Mysticism|Mystic]] (''Ramzi'' or ''Sufi'āneh''), [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] (''Āasheghāneh''), [[Ethical]] (''Akhlāghi''), [[Didactic]] (''Āmuzeshi'' or ''Pandi''), [[Colloquial]] (''Goft-o-gu'í''), and [[Satirical]] (''Tanzi'' or ''Hajvi''). Bahār's Official Website&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mostafavi, editor, Selected poems from the poetical works of Malek o-Sh'sho'arā Bahār (''Gozideh-ye Divān-e Ash'ār-e Malek o-Sh'sho'arā-ye Bahār''), in Persian, 56 pages, Bahār's Official Website: ([http://www.bahar-site.fr/Dievan_malekolshoaraye_bahar.pdf pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt; has made a selection of Bahār's poetry available to the general public, which the interested reader may wish to consult.

=== The Chained White Beast ===
The Chained White Beast is a poem by Bahar, in which he praises [[Mount Damavand|Damavand]], the highest mountain in Iran, and presents it as a symbol of patriotism. The poem is written in 1922, at the height of the reign of [[Reza Shah Pahlavi|Reza Shah]], the tyrant and modernist king of Iran. While Reza Shah was trying to limit the power of other institutions, such as parliament and religious system of clergies, the opportunity has come for the nationalists to take the floor and criticize the regime. Bahar’s symbolism for provoking patriotic upheavals is a reflection of the growth for notion of nationalism which had been introduced to Iranians only few decades before. In this passage, Bahar describes Damavand as a beast, and asks it to rise and wipe out the injustice, and let the real Iran flourish.

The '''National Opera and Ballet Theatre of Moldova''' ({{lang-ro|Teatrul Naţional de Operă şi Balet "Maria Bieșu" din Republica Moldova}}) in [[Chişinău]], Moldova, is one of the leading opera and ballet theatres in Eastern Europe. It is housed in a building on the Boulevard Stefan the Great, one of the main roads in Chişinău, the capital of [[Moldova]]. In 2012, it was given the name of the renowned opera singer [[Maria Bieșu]].

==Opera company==
The ''Chişinău National Opera'', the national opera company of Moldova, was founded in the mid-1940s and became a professional company in 1956. Following the collapse of the [[USSR]], the company is one of the few ex-Soviet opera companies to retain its own orchestra, chorus, soloists and  ballet company.

It is housed in the '''National Opera and Ballet Theatre of Moldova'''.

==History==
Built during the years of the Soviet Union, the theatre has superb equipment and facilities. Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], this theatre was one of the few to retain its own ballet, opera and orchestra, with its own soloists and chorus.

===National Ballet history===
Professional ballet began in Chişinău in 1957, after a group of Moldovan dancers trained in [[Leningrad]]. New works were soon provided for the company: the Moldovan composer Vasile Zagorsky wrote the ballet ''Rassvet'' (Sunrise), while another composer Eduard Lazarev wrote ''Broken Sword'', based on the poem "Ghosts", by [[Mihai Eminescu]], a leading Romanian writer.

In its first ten years, the company added many well-known classical ballets to its repertoire, including ''[[Giselle]]'', ''The Sleeping Beauty'', ''Spartacus'' and ''[[Coppélia|Coppelia]]''. It toured to Moscow, [[Kiev]] and [[Bulgaria]]. The most successful of the company’s modern ballet productions was ''A Young Lady and a Hooligan'', based on music by [[Shostakovitch]], in which the lead dancer was [[Mihai Caftanat]], who is still working with the company. Born in Chişinău, Caftanat studied ballet in [[Moscow]], returning to his native city to dance ''Siegfried'', ''Prince Desire'', Arald in ''Broken Sword'' and Antony in ''Antony and Cleopatra''.
[[File:Stamp of Moldova md085cvs.jpg|thumb|Moldovan 85 bani postage stamp commemorating the company's 50th anniversary in 2007]]
Other notable productions at this time were: the ''Carmen Suite''; ''Sonnets'', using [[Benjamin Britten]]’s music; the ''Arabesques'', with Lazarev’s music. Attempts to create national works included the children’s ballet ''Andriesh'' by Zlata Tkach and ''Luceafarul'' by Eugen Doga based on Eminescu’s best-known poem; while ''O Seara de Balet'' re-introduced audiences to the classical choreography of [[Marius Petipa]], Ivanov, [[Fokine]] and Gorski. The [[Kirov Ballet]] production of ''La Bayadère'' was carefully re-created by Tatiana Leagt and showed how well the company could handle a difficult work requiring first-class performers.

In 1998, the renowned choreographer [[Yuri Grigorovich]] from the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi]] came to Chişinău to direct his version of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', originally played at the Bolshoi in 1966. The company now toured to Moscow, [[Vietnam]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Greece]], [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Los Angeles]]. In 1999 it brought productions of [[Swan Lake]] and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' to the UK. Since 2001 the company performed Grigorovich’s ''Nutcracker'' several times in the UK. This was the first time the production had been seen in this country since the Bolshoi performed it in London in the early seventies. The Moldova National Ballet has toured regularly in Spain since 2005, in January 2007 it performed ''The Best of Tchaikovsky'' in Spain and northern Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3511">'''Nathaniel Crouch''' (born c. 1632) was an English [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] and bookseller, and under the pseudonym '''Richard Burton''' (or '''R.B.''') wrote historical books as well. As a historian, he is considered a hack, borrowing material from other books and rewriting them under his pseudonym, then publishing and marketing them under the Crouch imprint. Though he was the type of writer/publisher denounced in the following century by writers such as [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] (''Prose Observations'') and [[Alexander Pope]] (''[[The Dunciad]]''), more recent assessments of his life and career see him as an important figure in the development of [[historiography]], especially in the popularization of a hitherto high-culture genre of discourse.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Robert|year=1994|title=Nathaniel Crouch, Bookseller and Historian: Popular Historiography and Cultural Power in Late Seventeenth-Century England|journal=[[Eighteenth-Century Studies]]|volume=27|issue=3|pages=391–419|jstor=2739362|doi=10.2307/2739362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crouch was one of the authors who covered the 1655 [[Whitehall Conference]] to consider the [[resettlement of the Jews in England]] (the other being [[Henry Jessey]]). The report is found in the 1719 edition of his ''Two Journeys to Jerusalem''. It is different from Jessey’s version in two respects: firstly it actually names the participants and secondly it includes some anti-Semitic additions to the conclusions of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Crome, Andrew (2014). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qcokBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198 ''The Restoration of the Jews: Early Modern Hermeneutics, Eschatology, and National Identity in the Works of Thomas Brightman'']. Springer. {{ISBN|9783319047614}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the date September 30, 1681, an unlikely forerunner of ''Readers' Digest'', called ''Historical Rarities in London and Westminster'' was first published by Crouch. [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Chambers Book of Days|Book of Days]]'' (1864) elaborated:

"With probably little education, but something of a natural gift for writing, Crouch had the sagacity to see that the works of the learned, from their form and price, were kept within a narrow circle of readers, while there was a vast multitude outside who were able and willing to read, provided that a literature suited to their means and capacities was supplied to them. He accordingly set himself the task of transfusing large and pompous books into a series of small, cheap volumes, modestly concealing his authorship under his ''nom de plume''. Thus, he produced ''Surprising Miracles of Nature and Art'', and many other treatises on very plain paper, and sold [them] at an exceedingly reasonable rate. His enterprise and diligence were rewarded by large sales and considerable wealth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kacirk|first=Jeff|year=1997|title=Forgotten English|url=http://forgottenenglish.com/Forgotten_English.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017070819/http://forgottenenglish.com/Forgotten_English.htm|archivedate=2013-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nennius''' — or '''Nemnius''' or '''Nemnivus''' — was a Welsh monk of the 9th century. He has traditionally been attributed with the authorship of the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', based on the prologue affixed to that work,&lt;ref&gt;[[J. A. Giles]] (translator), ''Nennius: The History of the Britons'', in ''Six Old English Chronicles'' (1847)[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/nennius-full.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This attribution is widely considered a secondary (10th century) tradition.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[David Dumville]], quoted at: http://www.britishhistoryclub.com/bhc/sources/nennius_hb.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907061426/http://www.britishhistoryclub.com/bhc/sources/nennius_hb.html |date=7 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nennius was a student of Elvodugus, commonly identified with the bishop [[Elfodd]] of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]]&lt;Ref name=lambdin&gt;{{Cite web| title = Arthurian Writers: A Biographical Encyclopedia - Google Books| accessdate = 2018-04-14| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Arthurian_Writers.html?id=6LBFCZY-ml8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; who convinced British ecclesiastics to accept the Continental [[Easter controversy|dating for Easter]], and who died in 809 according to the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]''.

Nennius is believed to have lived in the area made up by [[Brecknockshire]] and [[Radnorshire]] in present-day [[Powys]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nennius|volume=40|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he lived outside the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, isolated by mountains in a rural society.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, Antonia. ''Historical Writing in England''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell UP, 1974. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the lack of evidence concerning the life of Nennius he has become the subject of legend himself. Welsh traditions include Nennius with Elbodug and others said to have escaped the massacre of Welsh monks by [[Ethelfrid]] in 613, fleeing to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sidney, ed. "Nennius." ''Dictionary of National Biography''. XL. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., 1894. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship of the ''Historia Brittonum''==
{{Main article|Historia Brittonum}}
Nennius was traditionally credited with having written the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' c. 830.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, Antonia. ''Historical Writing in England''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell UP, 1974. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Historia Brittonum'' was highly influential, becoming a major contributor to the [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]], in particular for its inclusion of events relevant to debate about the [[historicity of King Arthur]].&lt;ref name=lambdin /&gt; It also includes the legendary origins of the [[Picts]], [[Scoti|Scots]], [[St. Germanus]] and [[Vortigern]], and documents events associated with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] invasion of the 7th century as contributed by a Northumbrian document.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Henry. ''Dark Age Britain: Some Sources of History''. Hamden, Connecticut: Archon Books, 1970. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests that this medieval literature was a compilation of several sources, some of which are named by Nennius while others are not. Some experts say that this was not the first compiled history of the Britons and that it was largely based on [[Gildas]]' ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' written some two centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, Antonia. ''Historical Writing in England''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell UP, 1974. 7&lt;/ref&gt;   Scholarship indicates that other sources included a ''Life of St Germanus'' and a number of royal pedigrees.&lt;ref name="FS75-6"&gt;[[Frank Stenton|Stenton, Frank]]. ''Anglo Saxon England''. New York: Oxford UP, 1971. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;  Most other sources have not survived and therefore cannot be confirmed.  The surviving manuscripts of the ''Historia Brittonum'' appear to be redacted from several lost versions: information about Nennius contained in the ''Prologue'' and in the ''Apology'' differs, the ''Prologue'' containing an expanded form of the ''Apology'' that is only found in editions copied during the 12th century, leading experts to believe that later versions of the document were altered.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sidney, ed. "Nennius." ''Dictionary of National Biography''. XL. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., 1894. 218-19&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest known edition contains seventy-six sections including the ''Prologue'' and the ''Apology''.  The work was translated into Irish by Giolla Coemgin in c. 1071 and is the earliest example of the original ''Historia Brittonum'',&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sidney, ed. "Nennius." ''Dictionary of National Biography''. XL. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., 1894. 219&lt;/ref&gt; but includes the author’s name, Nennius.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, Antonia. ''Historical Writing in England''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell UP, 1974. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally written as a history of the Britons in an attempt to document a legitimate past, the ''Historia Brittonum'' contains stories of legend and superstition alike.&lt;ref name="Gransden, Antonia 1974"&gt;Gransden, Antonia. ''Historical Writing in England''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell UP, 1974. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The historical accuracy of the ''Historia Brittonum'' is at best questionable, but the document is internally consistent and provides information from and indirectly about Nennius' sources.&lt;ref name="FS75-6" /&gt;   Some historians{{who|date=April 2014}} argue that the ''Historia Brittonum'' gives good insight into the way 9th century Britons viewed themselves and their past.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Henry. ''Dark Age Britain: Some Sources of History''. Hamden, Connecticut: Archon Books, 1970. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Nennius makes several attempts to trace the history of the Britons back to the Romans and Celts through his empirical observations of what he refers to as ''"The Marvels"'' or ''"Wonders of Britain"''.&lt;ref name="Gransden, Antonia 1974"/&gt;  These include ruins, landmarks and other aspects of the British countryside that Nennius deems worthy of documentation.  His explanation of the physical landmarks and ruins take on a very mystical interpretation despite Nennius being a Christian monk.  Within the writing of Nennius is a sense of nationalist pride attempting to legitimise the people of Britain and embellish the past through legend much as the Romans used the story of ''[[Romulus and Remus]]'' to legitimise the founding of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, Antonia. ''Historical Writing in England''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell UP, 1974. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  One such example of Nennius stressing legend is in his accounts of Arthur and his twelve battles.  The ''Historia Brittonum'' would come to be the basis on which later medieval authors such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] would write the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', one of the early [[Welsh chronicles]] and romantic histories of King Arthur.&lt;ref name=lambdin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Henry. ''Dark Age Britain: Some Sources of History''. Hamden, Connecticut: Archon Books, 1970. 65&lt;/ref&gt; .

==Debate regarding his life and works==
The Prologue, in which Nennius introduces his purpose and means for writing the ''British History'', first appears in a manuscript from the twelfth century.  The prologues of all other manuscripts, though only included marginally, so closely resemble this first prologue that William Newell claims they must be copies. "The preface has evidently been prepared by some one who had before him the completed text of the treatise. It appears in the first instance as a marginal gloss contained in a MS. of the twelfth century;' under ordinary conditions, the chapter would unhesitatingly be set aside as a forgery."&lt;ref&gt;Newell, William Wells. "Doubts Concerning the British History Attributed to Nennius." ''PMLA''. 20.3 (1905): 622–72.&lt;/ref&gt; He counters Zimmer's argument by reasoning that the Irishman responsible for the "superior" Irish translations might have added his own touches, further claiming that if a Latin version of the ''Historia'' had been available in the 12th century, it would have been replicated in that language, not translated.

David N. Dumville argues that the manuscript tradition and nature of the Prologue in particular fail to substantiate the claim that Nennius authored ''Historia Brittonum''.  In his argument against Zimmer, he cites a textual inconsistency in the Irish translation regarding a place called Beulan, concluding that "we must admit to ignorance of the name of [the ''Historia'''s] ninth-century author."&lt;ref&gt;Dumville, D. N.  ''Histories and Pseudo-histories of the Insular Middle Ages''. Aldershot: Variorum, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated historians and authors==
* [[Gildas]] – Sixth-century historian who lived in South-west Britain.  Wrote ''[[De excidio et conquestu Britanniae]]'', which focused largely on the history of Christian Britain but fails to give an in depth look of the Pagan period.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, Antonia. ''Historical Writing in England.'' Ithaca, New York: Cornell UP, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bede (the [[Venerable Bede]]) – Lived in Northumbria about half a century prior to Nennius. He wrote ''[[Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum]]'' (Ecclesiastical History of the English People) over many years (completed 731 or 732). It includes a geographical description of the British Isles and focuses on the history of the Anglo-Saxon Church from [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine]]'s 597 mission though his preamble covers earlier ages.
* [[William of Malmesbury]] – Early twelfth-century historian.  Recorded history of Britain by compiling both Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman traditions.  He was the first historian of England to make use of topography and ancient monuments as historical sources.
* [[Geoffrey Gaimar]] – Twelfth-century Norman historian who wrote ''[[L'Estoire des Engleis]]''.  It was the first known Romance in vernacular verse written in England.

'''New constitutionalism''' is derived from the classical [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] framework and represents a set of political policies that promote a new global order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dierckx|first=Sacha|date=2013-12-01|title=After the Crisis and Beyond the New Constitutionalism?

The development of new constitutionalism is the result of [[globalization]] and the growing need for [[global hegemony]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[European Union]] are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

New constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academic[[Stephen Gill (political scientist)|Stephen Gill]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Cold War]] as well as the progress of [[globalization]] through technological means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbink|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Assessing the New Constitutionalism|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/20434076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=40 [2]|pages=227–245|issn=0010-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
New constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the “worldwide market revolution.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The end of the [[Cold War]] represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This shift was reiterated by [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] declaring the depletion of [[socialism]] and the rise of [[conservatism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporation]] and the expansion of the world market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[Great Depression]] and the aftermath of [[World War II]] reflected the need for reform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Falk, R. (2014). New Constitutionalism and geopolitics: notes on legality and legitimacy and prospects for a just new constitutionalism. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 295-312. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government using [[Constitution|constitutional framework]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cutler, A. Claire. (2016) "Transformations in Statehood, the Investor-State Regime, and the New Constitutionalism." ''Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies'' 23, no. 1: 95-125.&lt;/ref&gt; New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 global financial crisis]] as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneiderman, D.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
There are four main [[Policy|policies]] to define new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These international economic agreements or “[[constitution]]s” resemble political constitutions and thus ensure [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Second is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''' ''' This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Economic Liberation Movement|Economic liberation]] is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly is creating “locking in” mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Agreements are formulated to “lock in” [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] content through legal guarantees and sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to [[Multinational corporation|international corporations]] and private entities creating a “double” legal standard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This concept diminished the “watchdog” and gives the flexibility for self-regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]] which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Cutler, C. (2011). The Privatization of Authority in the Global Political Economy''.'' Edited by McBride, S., &amp; Teeple, G. ''In'' ''Relations of global power: Neoliberal order and disorder''. (p.41-59). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4426-0365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions ==
At the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance [[global governance]] by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  These institutions policies will ensure [[economic growth]] at the global level.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sinclair, S. (2014). Trade agreements, the new constitutionalism and public services. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 179-195. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global ===
The [[World Trade Organization]] [[World Trade Organization|(WTO)]] is a prominent figure in governing the [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Formally it was the responsibility of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade]] built on [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]] represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a [[world economy]], by doing so provides protection to the private sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Stephen McBride describes the [[World Trade Organization]] as having “quasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Regional ===
The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] ([[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Regan]] referred to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] as a “new economic constitution.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore [[public service]]s in [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Focus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control [[capitalism]] politically, democracy and socially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Human rights]], [[Environmental issue|environmental concerns]] and [[public service]]s are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New constitutionalism favours the [[Elitism|elitists]] providing preferential treatment and widening the [[Economic inequality|social gap]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[International financial institutions]], [[investor]]s and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concerns as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their [[sovereignty]] as independent nations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Australia]] has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many [[South America]] states have begun to exit the global regime completely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Cara-oculta-luna.jpg|thumb|The Moon's heavily cratered [[Far side of the Moon|far-side]]]]

The '''origin of the Moon''' is usually explained by a [[Mars]]-sized body striking the Earth, making a debris ring that eventually collected into a single [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], but there are a number of variations on this [[giant-impact hypothesis]], as well as alternate explanations, and research into how the Moon came to be continues.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140907"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Revisiting the Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/revisiting-the-moon.html |date=September 7, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=September 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed scenarios include captured body, fission, formed together (condensation theory), [[planetesimal]] collisions (formed from asteroid-like bodies), and collision theories.&lt;ref name=theories&gt;[http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/moon/moon_formation.html Theories of Formation for the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard giant-impact hypothesis suggests the Mars-sized body, called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], impacted Earth, creating a large debris ring around Earth, which then accreted to form the Moon. This collision also resulted in the 23.5° [[Axial tilt|tilted axis]] of the earth, thus causing the seasons.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt; The Moon's [[Isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotopic]] ratios seem to be essentially identical to Earth's.&lt;ref name=wiechert&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Oxygen Isotopes and the Moon-Forming Giant Impact  | last1=Wiechert | first1=U. | last2=Halliday | first2=A.

== Formation ==
{{main|Giant impact hypothesis}}
{{quote box|width=22em|"One of the challenges to the longstanding theory of the collision, is that a Mars-sized impacting body, whose composition likely would have differed substantially from that of Earth, likely would have left Earth and the moon with different chemical compositions, which they are not."|—NASA&lt;ref name=nasa1&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/moon_formation.html NASA Lunar Scientists Develop New Theory on Earth and Moon Formation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Lunar Sample 61016 - Big Muley.jpg|thumb|right|Lunar sample 61016, better known as "[[Big Muley]]"]]
Some theories have been stated that presume the Earth had no large moons early in the formation of the Solar System, 4.6 billion years ago, Earth being basically rock and lava. Theia, an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of this ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.

The hypothesis requires a collision between a body about 90% of the present size of Earth, and another the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial radius and a tenth of its mass). The colliding body has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient angular momentum to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.

[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tons of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the [[temperature]] would have risen to 10,000&amp;nbsp;°C (18,000&amp;nbsp;°F).

The Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core is explained by Theia's core accreting into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccreation of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[magma]] ocean.

The newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small pre-existing satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth–Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = J.

Another issue is lunar and Earth isotope comparisons. In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.&lt;ref name=wiechert/&gt; Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar system bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from Caltech showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth is very small (&lt;1 percent).&lt;ref name=ps2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Pahlevan | first1=Kaveh | last2=Stevenson | first2=David | title=Equilibration in the Aftermath of the Lunar-forming Giant Impact | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=262 | issue=3–4 |date=October 2007 | pages=438–449 | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.055 | bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.262..438P |arxiv = 1012.5323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth,&lt;ref name="test"&gt;
[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/4673/titanium-paternity-test-says-earth-is-the-moons-only-parent Titanium Paternity Test Says Earth is the Moon's Only Parent (University of Chicago)]&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Giant impact hypothesis#Difficulties|conflicts]] with the Moon forming far from Earth's orbit.

To help resolve these problems, a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies—each five times the size of Mars—collided, then re-collided, forming a large disc of debris that eventually formed Earth and the Moon.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt; The paper was called “Forming a Moon with an Earth-like composition via a Giant Impact,” by R.M Canup.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt;

A 2012 study on the depletion of [[zinc]] isotopes on the Moon supported the giant-impact origin for Earth and the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7420/full/nature11507.html Paniello, et al. - Zinc isotopic evidence for the origin of the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a study was released that indicated that water in lunar magma is indistinguishable from [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s and nearly the same as that of Earth in [[Isotopic signature|isotopic composition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/05/earth-moon-a-watery-double-planet/ Earth-Moon: A Watery "Double-Planet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807172422/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/05/earth-moon-a-watery-double-planet/ |date=2013-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6138/1317.abstract A. Saal, et al. - Hydrogen Isotopes in Lunar Volcanic Glasses and Melt Inclusions Reveal a Carbonaceous Chondrite Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant-impact hypothesis was again challenged in September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | author = Daniel Clery | title = Impact Theory Gets Whacked | volume = 342 | page = 183 | date = 11 October 2013 | doi=10.1126/science.342.6155.183 | pmid=24115419}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a growing sense that lunar origins are more complicated.{{Vague|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name=clery&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6155/183 Daniel Clery -Impact Theory Gets Whacked]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and the [[University of California]] developed computer models demonstrating that one possible outcome of a [[Disrupted planet|planetary collision]] is that it creates a [[synestia]], a mass of vaporized rock and metal which form a [[torus]] extending beyond the lunar orbit. The synestia will eventually shrink and cool to create the satellite and reform the impacted planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Javier Barbuzano |title=Could a Giant Impact Have Vaporized Earth to Create the Moon? |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/could-a-giant-impact-have-vaporized-earth-to-create-the-moon/ |date=March 1, 2018 |work=Sky and Telescope |accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is that before the giant impact, Earth had one or more normal satellites that shared its composition. Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and so Earth.

In 2017, planetary researchers at Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel offered a new theory that suggests the moon was forged in a brutal rain of cosmic debris that repeatedly hammered the fledgling Earth over millions of years. They determined that a series of smaller impacts, which were likely more common in the early solar system, could blast enough Earth rocks and dirt into orbit to form a small moonlet. As repeated impacts created more balls of debris, the moonlets could merge over time into one large moon.&lt;ref name="WSJ-20170109"&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Lee Hotz |title=Researchers Suggest New Theory for the Moon’s Origin |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-suggest-new-theory-for-the-moons-origin-1483977602|date=January 9, 2017 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=January 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capture ===
This hypothesis states that the Moon was captured by the Earth.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; This was popular until the 1980s, and some things in favor of this model include the Moon's size, orbit, and tidal locking.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt;

One problem is understanding the capture mechanism.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; A close encounter with Earth typically results in either collision or altered trajectories. For this hypothesis to function, there might have been a large [[atmosphere]] around the primitive Earth, which would slow the movement of the Moon by natural [[aerobraking]] before it could escape. That hypothesis may also explain the [[irregular satellite]] orbits of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Image:Earth-moon-to-scale.svg|thumb|center|800px|Earth and Moon to scale, 500 km per pixel]]

===Fission===
This is the now discredited hypothesis that an ancient, rapidly spinning Earth expelled a piece of its mass.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180323131439/http://lunarorigin.com:80/lunar-origin-models/ Lunar Origin]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was proposed by [[George Darwin]] (son of the famous biologist [[Charles Darwin]]) in the 1800s and retained some popularity until Apollo.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; The Austrian geologist Otto Ampherer in 1925 also suggested the emerging of the Moon as cause for [[continental drift]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01558835?LI=true#page-1 Die Naturwissenschaften, July 1925 (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was proposed that the [[Pacific Ocean]] represented the scar of this event.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; Today it is known that the oceanic crust that makes up this ocean basin is relatively young, about 200 million years old or less, whereas the Moon is much older. The Moon does not consist of oceanic crust but of mantle material, which originated inside the proto-Earth in the Precambrian.&lt;ref name=Zhang/&gt;

[[File:Lunar Thorium concentrations.jpg|thumb|Thorium concentrations on the Moon, as mapped by ''[[Lunar Prospector]]'']]

===Accretion===
The hypothesis of accretion suggests that the Earth and the Moon formed together as a double system from the primordial [[accretion disk]] of the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name="The Formation of the Moon"&gt;[http://burro.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/lunaform.html The Formation of the Moon] burro.cwru.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
The problem with this hypothesis is that it does not explain the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system or why the Moon has a relatively small iron core compared to the Earth (25% of its radius compared to 50% for the Earth).&lt;ref name="The Formation of the Moon"/&gt;

===2011===
In 2011, it was theorized that a second moon existed 4.5 billion years ago, and later had an impact with the Moon, as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10289 | volume=476 | title=Forming the lunar farside highlands by accretion of a companion moon | year=2011 | journal=Nature | pages=69–72 | last1 = Jutzi | first1 = M.| bibcode=2011Natur.476...69J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paolo Emiliani Giudici''' (13 June 1812 – 8 September 1872), Italian writer, was born in [[Mussomeli]], [[Sicily]].

==Biography==
His ''History of Italian Literature'' (1844) brought him to the front, and in 1848 he became professor of Italian literature at [[Pisa]], but after a few months was deprived of the chair on account of his liberal views in politics. On the re-establishment of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] he became professor of aesthetics (resigning 1862) and secretary of the Academy of Fine Arts at [[Florence]], and in 1867 was elected to the chamber of deputies. He held a prominent place as an historian, his works including a ''Storia del teatro'' (1860), and ''Storia dei comuni italiani'' (1861), besides a translation of ''Macaulay's History of England'' (1856). He died at [[Tonbridge]] in England, on 8 September 1872.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=52}}

'''Francesco Petrarca''' ({{IPA-it|franˈtʃesko peˈtrarka|lang}}; July 20, 1304 – July 18/19, 1374), commonly [[anglicized]] as '''Petrarch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|t|r|ɑr|k|,_|ˈ|p|ɛ|-}}), was a scholar and [[poet]] of [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] who was one of the earliest [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]]. His rediscovery of [[Cicero]]'s letters is often credited with initiating the 14th-century [[Renaissance]]. Petrarch is often considered the founder of [[Renaissance humanism|Humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;This designation appears, for instance, in a recent [http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=15299 review] of Carol Quillen's ''Rereading the Renaissance.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, [[Pietro Bembo]] created the model for the modern [[Italian language]] based on Petrarch's works, as well as those of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Prose_della_volgar_lingua/Libro_primo/XIX Prose della volgar lingua], Bembo proposes Petrarch and Boccaccio as models of Italian style, while expressing reservations about emulating Dante's usage.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrarch would be later endorsed as a model for Italian style by the [[Accademia della Crusca]].

Petrarch's sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for [[lyrical poetry]]. He is also known for being the first to develop the concept of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]."&lt;ref name="DarkAges"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707236 Renaissance or Prenaissance], ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan. 1943), pp. 69–74; [[Theodor Ernst Mommsen|Theodore E. Mommsen]], "Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages'" ''Speculum'' '''17'''.2 (April 1942: 226–242); [[JSTOR]] link to a collection of several letters in the same issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Youth and early career===
Petrarch was born in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] city of [[Arezzo]] in 1304. He was the son of [[Ser Petracco]] and his wife Eletta Canigiani. His given name was ''Francesco Petracco.'' The [[name was Latinized]] to ''Petrarca.'' Petrarch's younger brother was born in [[Incisa in Val d'Arno]] in 1307. [[Dante]] was a friend of his father.&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;[[J.H. Plumb]], ''The Italian Renaissance'', 1961; Chapter XI by Morris Bishop "Petrarch", pp. 161–175; New York, [[American Heritage Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-618-12738-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrarch spent his early childhood in the village of [[Incisa in Val d'Arno|Incisa]], near [[Florence]]. He spent much of his early life at [[Avignon]] and nearby [[Carpentras]], where his family moved to follow [[Pope Clement V]] who moved there in 1309 to begin the [[Avignon Papacy]]. He studied law at the [[University of Montpellier]] (1316–20) and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] (1320–23) with a lifelong friend and schoolmate called Guido Sette. Because his father was in the profession of law, he insisted that Petrarch and his brother study law also. Petrarch however, was primarily interested in writing and [[Latin literature]] and considered these seven years wasted. Additionally, he proclaimed that through legal manipulation his guardians robbed him of his small property inheritance in Florence, which only reinforced his dislike for the legal system. He protested, "I couldn't face making a merchandise of my mind," as he viewed the legal system as the art of selling justice.&lt;ref name="Bishop" /&gt;

Petrarch was a prolific letter writer and counted [[Boccaccio]] among his notable friends to whom he wrote often. After the death of their parents, Petrarch and his brother Gherardo went back to [[Avignon]] in 1326, where he worked in numerous clerical offices. This work gave him much time to devote to his writing. With his first large-scale work, ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in [[Latin]] about the great Roman general [[Scipio Africanus]], Petrarch emerged as a European celebrity. On April 8, 1341, he became the second &lt;ref&gt;after "Albertino Mussato" who was the first to be so crowned according to Robert Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; [[poet laureate]] since antiquity and was crowned by Roman ''Senatori'' [[Giordano Orsini (Senatore 1341)|Giordano Orsini]] and Orso dell'Anguillara on the holy grounds of [[Rome's Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pie32&gt;Pietrangeli (1981), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkham|first1=Victoria|title=Petrarch: A Critical Guide to the Complete Works|date=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iGDdF667hosC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=giordano+orsini+1341#v=onepage&amp;q=giordano%20orsini%201341&amp;f=false|isbn=9780226437439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He traveled widely in Europe, served as an ambassador, and has been called "the first [[Tourist#History|tourist]]"&lt;ref&gt;NSA Family Encyclopedia, ''Petrarch, Francesco'', Volume 11, page 240, Standard Education Corp. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  because he traveled just for pleasure,&lt;ref&gt;[[Morris Bishop|Bishop, Morris]] ''Petrarch and his World'', p. 92; [[Indiana University Press]] 1963, {{ISBN|0-8046-1730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reason he climbed [[Mont Ventoux]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance Profiles|last=Plumb|first=J.H.|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1965|isbn=9780061311628|location=|pages=4|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1187655.files/E2-Origins%20of%20the%20Renaissance%20in%20Western%20Europe/petrarch.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels, he collected crumbling Latin [[manuscripts]] and was a prime mover in the recovery of knowledge from writers of Rome and Greece. He encouraged and advised [[Leontius Pilatus]]'s translation of [[Homer]] from a manuscript purchased by [[Boccaccio]], although he was severely critical of the result. Petrarch had acquired a copy, which he did not entrust to Leontius,&lt;ref&gt;Vittore Branca, ''Boccaccio; The Man and His Works'', tr. Richard Monges, p.113–118&lt;/ref&gt;  but he knew no [[Greek language|Greek]]; [[Homer]], Petrarch said, "was [[Muteness|dumb]] to him, while he was [[Hearing impairment|deaf]] to Homer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuttotempolibero.altervista.org//poesia/trecento/francescopetrarca/epistolefamiliares.html Ep. Fam.'' 18.2 §9]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1345 he personally discovered a collection of [[Cicero]]'s letters not previously known to have existed, the collection ''[[Epistulae ad Atticum]]'', in the [[Chapter Library of Verona|Chapter Library]] (''Biblioteca Capitolare'') of [[Verona Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecacapitolare.it/en/history/|title=History - Biblioteca Capitolare Verona|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disdaining what he believed to be the ignorance of the [[Early Middle Ages|centuries preceding the era]] in which he lived, Petrarch is credited or charged with creating the concept of a historical "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]".&lt;ref name="DarkAges"/&gt;

===Mount Ventoux===
{{Main|Ascent of Mont Ventoux}}
[[File:140608 Mont-Ventoux-04.jpg|thumb|left|Summit of [[Mont Ventoux]]]]
Petrarch recounts that on April 26, 1336, with his brother and two servants, he climbed to the top of [[Mont Ventoux]] ({{convert|1912|m|ft|sp=us}}, a feat which he undertook for recreation rather than necessity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marjorie Hope Nicolson|Nicolson, Marjorie Hope]]; ''Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite'' (1997), p. 49; {{ISBN|0-295-97577-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exploit is described in a celebrated letter addressed to his friend and confessor, the monk [[Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro]], composed some time after the fact. In it, Petrarch claimed to have been inspired by [[Philip V of Macedon]]'s ascent of [[Beklemeto Pass|Mount Haemo]] and that an aged peasant had told him that nobody had ascended Ventoux before or after himself, 50 years before, and warned him against attempting to do so. The nineteenth-century Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] noted that [[Jean Buridan]] had climbed the same mountain a few years before, and ascents accomplished during the [[Middle Ages]] have been recorded, including that of [[Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob. ''[https://archive.org/details/civilisationren02middgoog The Civilisation of the Period of the Renaissance in Italy]'' (1860).  Translated by S. G. C. Middlemore.  [[Swan Sonnenschein]] (1904), pp. 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Thorndike]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707236 Renaissance or Prenaissance], ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan. 1943), pp. 69–74. [[JSTOR]] link to a collection of several letters in the same issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[J. H. Plumb]], in his book ''The Italian Renaissance'',&lt;/ref&gt; note that Petrarch's letter&lt;ref name=AMV&gt;[http://petrarch.petersadlon.com/read_letters.html?s=pet17.html Familiares 4.1] translated by Morris Bishop, quoted in Plumb.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 462985|title = Petrarch at the Peak of Fame|journal = PMLA|volume = 108|issue = 5|pages = 1050–1063|last1 = Asher|first1 = Lyell|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Dionigi displays a strikingly "modern" attitude of aesthetic gratification in the grandeur of the scenery and is still often cited in books and journals devoted to the sport of [[mountaineering]]. In Petrarch, this attitude is coupled with an aspiration for a virtuous Christian life, and on reaching the summit, he took from his pocket a volume by his beloved mentor, Saint Augustine, that he always carried with him.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Edward Tompkins; ''Studies in Medieval Life and Literature'', p. 6, New York: [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]], 1894&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For pleasure alone he climbed Mont Ventoux, which rises to more than six thousand feet, beyond Vaucluse. It was no great feat, of course; but he was the first recorded [[Mountaineering|Alpinist]] of modern times, the first to climb a mountain merely for the delight of looking from its top. (Or almost the first; for in a high pasture he met an old shepherd, who said that fifty years before he had attained the summit, and had got nothing from it save toil and repentance and torn clothing.) Petrarch was dazed and stirred by the view of the Alps, the mountains around [[Lyon]]s, the [[Rhone]], the Bay of [[Marseilles]]. He took [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[Confessions of St. Augustine|Confessions]]'' from his pocket and reflected that his climb was merely an [[allegory]] of aspiration toward a better life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plumb |first=J. H. |date=1961 |title=The Horizon Book of the Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7FKVBjaLtJsC&amp;q=%22climb+was+merely+an+allegory%22&amp;dq=%22climb+was+merely+an+allegory%22 |location=New York |publisher=American Heritage |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As [[Bibliomancy|the book fell open]], Petrarch's eyes were immediately drawn to the following words:

{{quote|And men go about to wonder at the heights of the mountains, and the mighty waves of the sea, and the wide sweep of rivers, and the circuit of the ocean, and the revolution of the stars, but themselves they consider not.&lt;ref name=AMV/&gt;}}
Petrarch's response was to turn from the outer world of nature to the inner world of "soul":

{{quote|I closed the book, angry with myself that I should still be admiring earthly things who might long ago have learned from even the pagan philosophers that nothing is wonderful but the soul, which, when great itself, finds nothing great outside itself. Then, in truth, I was satisfied that I had seen enough of the mountain; I turned my inward eye upon myself, and from that time not a syllable fell from my lips until we reached the bottom again.

[[James Hillman]] argues that this rediscovery of the inner world is the real significance of the Ventoux event.&lt;ref name=RP&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Hillman|authorlink=James Hillman| year=1977 | title=Revisioning Psychology | isbn=978-0-06-090563-7|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]] | pages=197|title-link=Revisioning Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance begins not with the ascent of Mont Ventoux but with the subsequent descent—the "return [...] to the valley of soul", as Hillman puts it. Arguing against such a singular and hyperbolic periodization, Paul James suggests a different reading:

===Later years===
Petrarch spent the later part of his life journeying through northern Italy as an international scholar and poet-[[diplomacy|diplomat]]. His career in [[Catholicism|the Church]] did not allow him to marry, but he is believed to have fathered two children by a woman or women unknown to posterity. A son, Giovanni, was born in 1337, and a daughter, Francesca, was born in 1343. Both he later legitimized.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arquà Petrarca Punto di vista di un'aquila.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Petrarch's [[Arquà Petrarca|Arquà]] house near [[Padua]] where he retired to spend his last years]]
Giovanni died of the [[bubonic plague|plague]] in 1361. In the same year Petrarch was named canon in [[Monselice]] near Padua. Francesca married [[Francescuolo da Brossano]] (who was later named executor of Petrarch's [[Last Will and Testament|will]]) that same year. In 1362, shortly after the birth of a daughter, Eletta (the same name as Petrarch's mother), they joined Petrarch in [[Venice]] to flee the plague then ravaging parts of Europe. A second grandchild, Francesco, was born in 1366, but died before his second birthday. Francesca and her family lived with Petrarch in Venice for five years from 1362 to 1367 at [[Palazzo Molina]]; although Petrarch continued to travel in those years. Between 1361 and 1369 the younger Boccaccio paid the older Petrarch two visits. The first was in Venice, the second was in Padua.

About 1368 Petrarch and his daughter Francesca (with her family) moved to the small town of [[Arquà Petrarca|Arquà]] in the [[Euganean Hills]] near [[Padua]], where he passed his remaining years in religious contemplation. He died in his house in Arquà early on July 20, 1374 – his seventieth birthday. The house hosts now a permanent exhibition of Petrarchian works and curiosities; among others you find the famous tomb of Petrarch's beloved cat who was embalmed. On the marble slab there is a Latin inscription written by Antonio Quarenghi:&lt;br /&gt;
{{quote|text=&lt;poem&gt;Etruscus gemino vates ardebat amore:
Maximus ignis ego; Laura secundus erat.
Quid rides? divinæ illam si gratia formæ,
Me dignam eximio fecit amante fides.
Si numeros geniumque sacris dedit illa libellis
Causa ego ne sævis muribus esca forent.
Arcebam sacro vivens a limine mures,

Incutio trepidis eadem defuncta pavorem,

Petrarch's will (dated April 4, 1370) leaves 50 [[Italian coin florin|florins]] to Boccaccio "to buy a warm winter dressing gown"; various legacies (a horse, a silver cup, a lute, a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]) to his brother and his friends; his house in Vaucluse to its caretaker;  for his [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and for the poor; and the bulk of his estate to his son-in-law, Francescuolo da Brossano, who is to give half of it to "the person to whom, as he knows, I wish it to go"; presumably his daughter, Francesca, Brossano's wife.  The will mentions neither the property in Arquà nor his library; [[Petrarch's library]] of notable manuscripts was already promised to Venice, in exchange for the Palazzo Molina.  This arrangement was probably cancelled when he moved to Padua, the enemy of Venice, in 1368.  The library was seized by the lords of [[Padua]], and his books and manuscripts are now widely scattered over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, pp. 360, 366. Francesca and the quotes from there;{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} Bishop adds that the dressing-gown was a piece of tact: "fifty florins would have bought twenty dressing-gowns".&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] traditionally claimed this bequest as its founding, although it was in fact founded by [[Cardinal Bessarion]] in 1468.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Libraries |display=Libraries § Italy. |volume=16 |page=573 |first1=Henry Richard |last1=Tedder |first2=James Duff |last2=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrarch is best known for his Italian poetry, notably the ''[[Canzoniere]]'' ("Songbook") and the ''Trionfi'' ("Triumphs"). However, Petrarch was an enthusiastic Latin scholar and did most of his writing in this language. His Latin writings include scholarly works, introspective essays, letters, and more poetry. Among them are ''[[Secretum (book)|Secretum Meum]]'' ("My Secret Book"), an intensely personal, guilt-ridden imaginary dialogue with [[Augustine of Hippo]]; ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)|De Viris Illustribus]]'' ("On Famous Men"), a series of moral biographies; ''Rerum Memorandarum Libri'', an incomplete treatise on the [[cardinal virtues]]; ''De Otio Religiosorum'' ("On Religious Leisure")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italicapress.com/index186.html Francesco Petrarch, ''On Religious Leisure (De otio religioso),''] edited &amp; translated by Susan S.

[[File:Thorvaldsen Cicero.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Petrarch revived the work and letters of the ancient [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]Petrarch also published many volumes of his letters, including a few written to his long-dead friends from history such as [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]]. Cicero, Virgil, and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were his literary models. Most of his Latin writings are difficult to find today, but several of his works are available in English translations. Several of his Latin works are scheduled to appear in the Harvard University Press series ''I Tatti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/itatti/forthcoming.html |title=I Tatti Renaissance Library/Forthcoming and Published Volumes |publisher=Hup.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to assign any precise dates to his writings because he tended to revise them throughout his life.

Petrarch collected his letters into two major sets of books called ''[[Epistolae familiares]]'' ("[http://www.italicapress.com/index260.html Letters on Familiar Matters]") and ''[[Seniles]]'' ("[http://www.italicapress.com/index262.html Letters of Old Age]"), both of which are available in English translation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.italicapress.com/index260.html Letters on Familiar Matters] (Rerum familiarium libri),''  translated by Aldo S. Bernardo, 3 vols.' and ''[http://www.italicapress.com/index262.html Letters of Old Age] (Rerum senilium libri),'' translated by Aldo S. Bernardo, Saul Levin &amp;  Reta A. Bernardo, 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan for his letters was suggested to him by knowledge of [[Cicero]]'s letters. These were published "without names" to protect the recipients, all of whom had close relationships to Petrarch. The recipients of these letters included [[Philippe de Cabassoles]], [[bishop of Cavaillon]]; [[Ildebrandino Conti]], [[bishop of Padua]]; [[Cola di Rienzo]], [[tribune]] of Rome; [[Francesco Nelli]], priest of the Prior of the Church of the Holy Apostles in [[Florence]]; and [[Niccolò di Capoccia]], a cardinal and priest of [[San Vitale (Rome)|Saint Vitalis]]. His "Letter to Posterity" (the last letter in ''Seniles'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/petrarch/pet01.html Petrarch's Letter to Posterity] (1909 English translation, with notes, by [[James Harvey Robinson]])&lt;/ref&gt; gives an [http://petrarch.petersadlon.com/read_letters.html?s=pet01.html autobiography] and a synopsis of his philosophy in life. It was originally written in Latin and was completed in 1371 or 1372 - the first such autobiography in a thousand years (since [[Saint Augustine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilkins Ernest H | year = 1964| title = On the Evolution of Petrarch's Letter to Posterity | url = | journal = Speculum | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 304–308 | doi = 10.2307/2852733 | jstor = 2852733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

While Petrarch's poetry was set to music frequently after his death, especially by Italian [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]] composers of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] in the 16th century, only one musical setting composed during Petrarch's lifetime survives. This is ''Non al suo amante'' by [[Jacopo da Bologna]], written around 1350.

===Laura and poetry===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
On April 6, 1327,&lt;ref&gt;April 6, 1327 is often thought to be [[Good Friday]] based on poems 3 and 211 of Petrarch's ''[[Il Canzoniere]]'', but in fact that date fell on Monday in 1327. The apparent explanation is that Petrarch was not referring to the variable date of Good Friday but to the date fixed by the death of Christ in absolute time, which at the time was thought to be April 6 (Mark Musa, ''Petrarch's Canzoniere'', Indiana University Press, 1996, p. 522).&lt;/ref&gt; after Petrarch gave up his vocation as a priest, the sight of a woman called "Laura" in the church of Sainte-Claire d'[[Avignon]] awoke in him a lasting passion, celebrated in the ''Rime sparse'' ("Scattered rhymes"). Later, Renaissance poets who copied Petrarch's style named this collection of 366 poems ''[[Il Canzoniere]]'' ("Song Book").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/petrarch|title=Petrarch|last=Petrarch|date=2004-03-04|website=Petrarch|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura may have been [[Laura de Noves]], the wife of Count [[Hugues de Sade]] (an ancestor of the [[Marquis de Sade]]). There is little definite information in Petrarch's work concerning Laura, except that she is lovely to look at, fair-haired, with a modest, dignified bearing. Laura and Petrarch had little or no personal contact. According to his "Secretum", she refused him because she was already married. He channeled his feelings into love poems that were exclamatory rather than persuasive, and wrote prose that showed his contempt for men who pursue women.  Upon her death in 1348, the poet found that his [[grief]] was as difficult to live with as was his former despair.  Later in his "Letter to Posterity", Petrarch wrote: "In my younger days I struggled constantly with an overwhelming but pure love affair – my only one, and I would have struggled with it longer had not premature death, bitter but salutary for me, extinguished the cooling flames. I certainly wish I could say that I have always been entirely free from desires of the flesh, but I would be lying if I did".

[[File:Francesco Petrarca01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Laura de Noves]]]]
While it is possible she was an idealized or pseudonymous character – particularly since the name "Laura" has a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] connection to the poetic "laurels" Petrarch coveted – Petrarch himself always denied it. His frequent use of ''l'aura'' is also remarkable: for example, the line "Erano i capei d'oro a ''l'aura'' sparsi" may both mean "her hair was all over Laura's body", and "the wind ("l'aura") blew through her hair". There is psychological realism in the description of Laura, although Petrarch draws heavily on conventionalised descriptions of love and lovers from [[troubadour]] songs and other literature of [[courtly love]]. Her presence causes him unspeakable joy, but his unrequited love creates unendurable desires, inner conflicts between the ardent lover and the [[Christian mysticism|mystic Christian]], making it impossible to reconcile the two. Petrarch's quest for love leads to hopelessness and irreconcilable anguish, as he expresses in the series of paradoxes in Rima 134 "Pace non trovo, et non ò da far guerra;/e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio": "I find no peace, and yet I make no war:/and fear, and hope: and burn, and I am ice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Italian/PetrarchCanzoniere123-183.htm#_Toc10863123|title=Petrarch (1304–1374) - The Complete Canzoniere: 123-183|website=www.poetryintranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laura is unreachable – the few physical descriptions of her are vague, almost impalpable as the love he pines for, and such is perhaps the power of his verse, which lives off the melodies it evokes against the fading, diaphanous image that is no more consistent than a ghost. [[Francesco De Sanctis (critic)|Francesco De Sanctis]] remarks much the same thing in his ''Storia della letteratura italiana'', and contemporary critics agree on the powerful music of his verse. Perhaps the poet was inspired by a famous singer he met in [[Veneto]] around the 1350s.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Chiappinelli, "La Dolce Musica Nova di Francesco Landini" Sidereus Nuncius, 2007, pp. 55-91 [http://www.sidereus-nuncius.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091815/http://sidereus-nuncius.com/ |date=February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gianfranco Contini, in a famous essay on Petrarch's language ("Preliminari sulla lingua del Petrarca". Petrarca, Canzoniere. Turin, Einaudi, 1964) has spoken of linguistic indeterminacy – Petrarch never rises above the "bel pié" (her lovely foot): Laura is too holy to be painted; she is an awe-inspiring goddess. Sensuality and passion are suggested rather by the rhythm and music that shape the vague contours of the lady. In addition, some today consider Laura to be a representation of an "ideal Renaissance woman", based on her nature and definitive characteristics.

and I wander searching for my treasure,

==Dante==
[[File:Dante Luca.jpg|thumb|left|Dante Alighieri, detail from a [[Luca Signorelli]] [[fresco]] in the chapel of [[Orvieto Cathedral#Chapel of the Madonna di San Brizio|San Brizio]], Duomo, Orvieto.]]
Petrarch is a world apart from [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. In spite of the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] subject, the ''Commedia'' is deeply rooted in the cultural and social milieu of turn-of-the-century [[Florence]]: Dante's rise to power (1300) and exile (1302), his political passions call for a "violent" use of language, where he uses all the registers, from low and trivial to sublime and philosophical. Petrarch confessed to Boccaccio that he had never read the ''Commedia'', remarks Contini, wondering whether this was true or Petrarch wanted to distance himself from Dante. Dante's language evolves as he grows old, from the courtly love of his early [[Dolce Stil Novo|stilnovistic]] ''Rime'' and ''Vita nuova'' to the ''Convivio'' and ''Divina Commedia'', where [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is sanctified as the goddess of philosophy – the philosophy announced by the Donna Gentile at the death of Beatrice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insulaeuropea.eu/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112102335/http://www.insulaeuropea.eu/pulsoni/il_metodo_di_lavoro.pdf |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Petrarch's thought and style are relatively uniform throughout his life – he spent much of it revising the songs and sonnets of the ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'' rather than moving to new subjects or poetry. Here, poetry alone provides a consolation for personal grief, much less philosophy or politics (as in Dante), for Petrarch fights within himself (sensuality versus [[mysticism]], profane versus [[Christian]] literature), not against anything outside of himself. The strong moral and political convictions which had inspired Dante belong to the Middle Ages and the libertarian spirit of the [[Medieval commune|commune]]; Petrarch's moral dilemmas, his refusal to take a stand in politics, his reclusive life point to a different direction, or time. The free commune, the place that had made Dante an eminent politician and scholar, was being dismantled: the ''signoria'' was taking its place. Humanism and its spirit of empirical inquiry, however, were making progress – but the papacy (especially after Avignon) and the empire ([[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], the last hope of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|white Guelphs]], died near Siena in 1313) had lost much of their original prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petrarch.uoregon.edu/|title=The Oregon Petrarch Open Book - "Petrarch is again in sight"|website=petrarch.uoregon.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrarch polished and perfected the sonnet form inherited from [[Giacomo da Lentini]] and which Dante widely used in his ''[[Vita nuova]]'' to popularise the new courtly love of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]''. The tercet benefits from Dante's [[terza rima]] (compare the ''Divina Commedia''), the [[quatrain]]s prefer the ABBA-ABBA to the ABAB-ABAB scheme of the [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]]. The imperfect rhymes of ''u'' with closed ''o'' and ''i'' with closed ''e'' (inherited from Guittone's mistaken rendering of [[Sicilian School|Sicilian verse]]) are excluded, but the rhyme of open and closed ''o'' is kept. Finally, Petrarch's [[enjambment]] creates longer semantic units by connecting one line to the following. The vast majority (317) of Petrarch's 366 poems collected in the ''[[Canzoniere]]'' (dedicated to Laura) were ''sonnets'', and the [[Petrarchan sonnet]] still bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/poetry/home_movements.html|title=Movements : Poetry through the Ages|website=www.webexhibits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:Francesco Petrarca00.jpg|thumb|right|Petrarch]]
[[File:Francesco Petrarca2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Petrarch on the Uffizi Palace, in Florence]]Petrarch is traditionally called the father of Humanism and considered by many to be the "father of the [[Renaissance]]."&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Rudolf Pfeiffer]], ''History of Classical Scholarship 1300-1850'', Oxford University Press, 1976, p. 1;  Gilbert Highet, ''The Classical Tradition,'' Oxford University Press, 1949, p. 81-88.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''[[Secretum (book)|Secretum meum]]'' he points out that [[secular]] achievements did not necessarily preclude an authentic relationship with [[God]]. Petrarch argued instead that God had given humans their vast intellectual and creative potential to be used to their fullest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Famous First Facts]] International, [[H. W. Wilson Company]], New York 2000, {{ISBN|0-8242-0958-3}}, page 303, item 4567.&lt;/ref&gt; He inspired humanist philosophy which led to the intellectual flowering of the Renaissance. He believed in the immense moral and practical value of the study of ancient history and literature – that is, the study of human thought and action. Petrarch was a devout Catholic and did not see a conflict between realizing humanity's potential and having [[religious faith]].

A highly introspective man, he shaped the nascent humanist movement a great deal because many of the internal conflicts and musings expressed in his writings were seized upon by Renaissance humanist philosophers and argued continually for the next 200 years. For example, Petrarch struggled with the proper relation between the active and contemplative life, and tended to emphasize the importance of solitude and study. In a clear disagreement with Dante, in 1346 Petrarch argued in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' that [[Pope Celestine V]]'s refusal of the papacy in 1294 was as a virtuous example of solitary life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Petrarca | first = Francesco | title = De vita Solitaria | location = Bologna | publisher = Gaetano Romagnoli | year = 1879 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Lmo9AAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22De%20vita%20Solitaria%22%20petrarch | language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the politician and thinker [[Leonardo Bruni]] (1370-1444) argued for the active life, or "[[civic humanism]]". As a result, a number of political, military, and religious leaders during the Renaissance were inculcated with the notion that their pursuit of personal fulfillment should be grounded in [[Classical era|classical]] example and philosophical contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.skuola.net/storia-arte/rinascimento-romanticismo/rinascimento-storia-arte.html | language = Italian | title=Skuola.net, Il Rinascimento|publisher=Skuola.net| accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Petrarca Tomb (Arqua).JPG|thumb|right|Petrarch's tomb at [[Arquà Petrarca]]]]
Petrarch's influence is evident in the works of [[Serafino dell' Aquila|Serafino Ciminelli]] from [[L'Aquila|Aquila]] (1466-1500) and in the works of [[Marin Držić]] (1508-1567) from [[Dubrovnik]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Renaissance: Class-Furió Ceriol, Volume 2, page 106, Paul F. Grendler, Renaissance Society of America, Scribner's published in association with the Renaissance Society of America, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-684-80509-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romantic era|Romantic]] composer [[Franz Liszt]] set three of Petrarch's Sonnets (47, 104, and 123) to music for voice, ''Tre sonetti del Petrarca'', which he later would transcribe for solo piano for inclusion in the suite ''[[Années de Pèlerinage]]''. Liszt also set a poem by Victor Hugo, " O quand je dors" in which Petrarch and Laura are invoked as the epitome of erotic love.

While in Avignon in 1991, [[Modernist]] composer [[Elliott Carter]] completed his solo flute piece ''Scrivo in Vento'' which is in part inspired by and structured by Petrarch's Sonnet 212, ''Beato in sogno''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2249.2011.00295.x | volume=28 | issue=2–3 | title=An Imagined Drama of Competitive Opposition in Carter's Scrivo in Vento, with Notes on Narrative, Symmetry, Quantitative Flux and Heraclitus | year=2009 | journal=Music Analysis | pages=373–422 | last1 = Mailman | first1 = Joshua B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was premiered on Petrarch's 687th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriciaspencerflute.com/images/CarterInterviewFQ.pdf Spencer, Patricia (2008) "Regarding ''Scrivo in Vento'': A Conversation with Elliott Carter"] ''Flutest Quarterly'' summer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, it was announced that [[pathology|pathological]] [[anatomy|anatomists]] would be exhuming Petrarch's body from his casket in [[Arquà Petrarca]], in order to verify 19th-century reports that he had stood 1.83 meters (about six feet), which would have been tall for his period. The team from the [[University of Padua]] also hoped to reconstruct his cranium in order to generate a computerized image of his features to coincide with his 700th birthday. The tomb had been opened previously in 1873 by Professor Giovanni Canestrini, also of Padua University. When the tomb was opened, the skull was discovered in fragments and a [[DNA]] test revealed that the skull was not Petrarch's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Caramelli D, Lalueza-Fox C, Capelli C, etal |title=Genetic analysis of the skeletal remains attributed to Francesco Petrarch |journal=Forensic Sci.

The researchers are fairly certain that the body in the tomb is Petrarch's due to the fact that the [[skeleton]] bears evidence of injuries mentioned by Petrarch in his writings, including a kick from a [[donkey]] when he was 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.upf.edu/bioevo/2007BioEvo/BE2007-Caramelli-FSI.pdf |title=UPF.edu |access-date=March 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306013340/http://www.upf.edu/bioevo/2007BioEvo/BE2007-Caramelli-FSI.pdf |archive-date=March 6, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radoslav Katičić''' ({{IPA-sh|rǎdoslaʋ kâtitʃitɕ|pron}}; 3 July 1930) is a [[Croats|Croatian]] [[linguistics|linguist]], [[classical philology|classical philologist]], [[Indo-European studies|Indo-Europeanist]], [[Slavic studies|Slavist]] and [[Indology|Indologist]], one of the most prominent Croatian scholars in the field of [[humanities]].

==Biography==
Radoslav Katičić was born on July 3, 1930 in Zagreb. In his birth city he attended [[primary school]], and in 1949 he graduated at the Classical [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]].

At the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb]], he received a degree in Classical Philology in 1954. The same year he started working as a part-time librarian at the Seminar for Classical Philology at the same faculty. His first scientific works were on the subjects of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] philology and [[Byzantine studies]].

As a [[stipend]]ist of the Greek government he visited [[Athens]] in 1956-57, and in 1958 he was elected as an assistant at the Department for Comparative Indo-European Grammar at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb.

In 1959 he received his Ph.D. with the thesis ''Pitanje jedinstva indoeuropske glagolske fleksije'' ('The question of unity of Indo-European verbal flexion'). During the period of 1960-61 he was a stipendist of the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] in [[Tübingen]]. After the return to his main university, he became a [[docent]] on Indo-European and general linguistics. Soon after, he served as a head of the newly formed Department for General Linguistics and Oriental Studies. In 1966 he became associate, and in 1973 full professor. Beside general and Indo-European linguistics, he also taught Old Iranian and [[Old Indic#Old Indic|Old Indic]] philology.

In 1977 he became full professor of Slavic philology at the [[University of Vienna]], Austria.

In 1973 he was selected as an extraordinary member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]), and in 1986 he became a full member. In 1981 he became a corresponding member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], in 1989 becoming a full member, and since 1989 serving as a head of the renowned ''Balkan commission''. In 1984 he became a member of the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], in 1987 member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], and in 1991 member of the [[Academia Europaea]]. In 1989 he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Osijek]], and in 1999 an honorary degree and professorship at the [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in [[Budapest]].

In 2005 he became the head of [[Council for Standard Croatian Language Norm]]. He was on that function until council's abolition in 2012.

==Work==
In the past twenty years he chiefly researched on the topic of history of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] grammar, philology, early Croatian Middle Ages, engaging in extensive synthetic research of the key periods of history of Croatian literature and the reconstruction of [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] ceremonial texts, sacral poetry of mythological content, and legislative literature.

Katičić's scholarly contributions which consists of more than 150 titles (books and papers) can be divided in four fields:
* General [[linguistics]] and [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan]] studies (mainly based on transformational grammar approach), consisting of works written in English:
** ''A Contribution to the General Theory of Comparative Linguistics'' (the Hague-Paris, 1970)
** ''The Ancient Languages of the Balkans, 1-2'' (the Hague-Paris, 1976)
* Linguistic-stylistic works on aspects and history of various European (Ancient Greek, Byzantine) and non-European literatures:
** ''Stara indijska književnost/Old Indian literature'', Zagreb 1973
* Numerous studies on Croatian language history, from the inception of the [[Croats]] in the 7th century onwards. Katičić has charted the meanderings in the continuity of Croatian language and literature, from the earliest stone inscriptions and [[Glagolitic]] medieval literature in the Croatian recension of [[Church Slavonic]] to the works of [[Renaissance]] writers such as [[Marin Držić]] and [[Marko Marulić]], who wrote in a Croatian vernacular. He also explored language standardization and wrote a syntactic description of modern Croatian (''Sintaksa hrvatskoga književnoga jezika''/''Syntax of Standard Croatian'', Zagreb 1986), based on texts by contemporary authors such as [[Miroslav Krleža]] and [[Tin Ujević]].
* Synthetic works that explore the beginnings of Croatian civilization in a multidisciplinary fashion based on philology, [[archeology]], culturology, [[paleography]] and textual analysis
** ''Uz početke hrvatskih početaka/Roots of Croatian roots'', Split 1993
** ''Litterarium studia'', Vienna-Zagreb, 1999 (in German and Croatian)

Some aspects of his work meet criticism, primarily his puristic approach to the linguistic terminology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=1995 |language=Serbo-Croatian |title=Relativna rečenica |trans-title=Relative Clauses |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426507.Kordic_Relativna_recenica.pdf |deadurl=no |series=Znanstvena biblioteka Hrvatskog filološkog društva ; 25 |location=Zagreb |publisher=Matica hrvatska &amp; Hrvatsko filološko društvo |pages=317–321 |isbn=953-6050-04-8 |oclc=37606491 |lccn=97154457 |ol=2863536W |archivedate=8 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690B8xaDu?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426507.Kordic_Relativna_recenica.pdf |accessdate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the primordialist view of nations,&lt;ref name=Groeschel&gt;{{cite book|last=Gröschel |first=Bernhard| authorlink=Bernhard Gröschel |year=2009 |language=German |title=Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik: mit einer Bibliographie zum postjugoslavischen Sprachenstreit |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics: With a Bibliography of the Post-Yugoslav Language Dispute |series=Lincom Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; vol 34 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |pages=323, 359 |isbn=978-3-929075-79-3 |oclc=428012015 |lccn=2009473660 |ol=15295665W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Svijet o nama: Bernhard Gröschel, ''Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik'' |trans-title=About us – World point of view: Bernhard Gröschel, ''Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics'' |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/445818.rec_GROSCHEL_u_KR.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Književna republika |location=Zagreb |volume=7 |issue=10-12 |page=324 |year=2009 |issn=1334-1057 |id={{ZDB|2122129-7}} |archivedate=23 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A7zhZJ9N?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/445818.rec_GROSCHEL_u_KR.PDF |accessdate=6 May 2013 |df= }} &lt;small&gt;[http://katalog.nsk.hr/F/?func=direct&amp;doc_number=000742298 (NSK)]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and subjectivity in articles on language policy.&lt;ref name=Groeschel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=2010 |language=Serbo-Croatian |title=Jezik i nacionalizam |trans-title=Language and Nationalism |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf |deadurl=no |series=Rotulus Universitas |location=Zagreb |publisher=Durieux |pages=376–377 |isbn=978-953-188-311-5 |lccn=2011520778 |oclc=729837512 |ol=15270636W |archivedate=8 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, his syntactic description has been judged negatively by other Croatian syntacticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pranjković, Ivo |authorlink=Ivo Pranjković |title=Nekoliko napomena o ''Sintaksi'' prof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">[[File:Monte Cassino interior 02.jpg|Monte Cassino, Altar of the Basilica|300px|thumb]]'''Richard of San Germano''' ({{lang-it|Riccardo}}; before 1170 &amp;ndash; after October 1243) was a [[Notary public|notary]] at the monastery of [[Monte Cassino]], in the then [[Cassino|San Germano]], in the [[Latin Valley]], from February 1186 to March 1232. He wrote a [[chronicle]] (sometimes ''Chronica regni Siciliae'') of the [[Mezzogiorno]] from the death of [[William II of Sicily]] in 1189 to 1243. It is the fullest source of information on the [[Hohenstaufen]] in Italy. 

Richard was a companion of [[Stephen of Marsia]], the [[abbot]] of [[Montecassino]], and dedicated his chronicle to him. His brother John was also a notary, though in the [[chancellor|chancery]] of [[Emperor Frederick II]]. In the early 1220s, Richard was found in the service of Frederick, perhaps alongside his brother. In the late 1230s, Richard became an imperial [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] (until 1242). 

His chronicle was originally intended as a continuation of the ''[[Annales Casinenses]]''. It is largely, but far from mostly, focused on the ''[[Terra Sancti Benedicti]]'', the lands of the abbey of Montecassino. The first part was written beginning in 1216 and covers the time between the papal visit to San Germano and the death of Stephen of Marsia in July 1227. This survives in manuscript form in [[Bologna]]. Altered and expanded to stand on its own, the chronicle was finished after the [[Rome|Roman]] visit of [[Pope Innocent IV]] in October 1243. It then began with the conquest of Sicily by [[Henry VI of Germany|Henry VI]]. 

Richard was personally involved in many of the event he recounts. [[Pope Innocent III]] visited his monastery in June 1208. He accompanied Stephen of Marsia to the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215. He was at the siege of [[Milan]] in 1239.

{{Culture of Romania}}
'''Romanian philosophy''' is a name covering either a) the philosophy done in [[Romania]] or by [[Romanians]], or b) an ethnic philosophy, which expresses at a high level the fundamental features of the Romanian spirituality, or which elevates to a philosophical level the [[Weltanschauung]] of the Romanian people, as deposited in language and folklore, traditions, architecture and other linguistic and cultural artifacts.

== The specificity of the Romanian philosophy ==
The discussion concerning the existence of a Romanian philosophy has known three stages.

Between the two World Wars, after the emergence of [[Greater Romania]], Romanian national identity went through a crisis. Since it was not centered anymore on immediate political goals (national rights, independence, national unity etc.), the idea now had a more pronounced cultural character. Therefore, discussions of "national specificity" in historiography, literature and philosophy became very common. The first history of Romanian philosophy was published in 1922 by Marin Ştefănescu, proving that philosophical thinking in Romania had reached the level of self-reflexivity; in other words, it had become conscious of itself. The general conclusion of [[interbellum]] discussions, which involved almost every notable philosopher, was that there is a Romanian philosophy proper, with a distinct profile among other national philosophies.  [[Constantin Noica]], who became one of the most prominent Romanian philosophers, thought early on that Romanian philosophy is characterized by [[paganism]], [[cosmicism]] (i.e. no acute separation of the world of the man from, transcendence) and [[determinism]] (or rather, "fatalism").

During the post-1965 communism period, the existence of a specific Romanian philosophy became an uncontested dogma. The official narratives, heavily influenced by national-communist and so-called protochronistic ideology, spoke even of the "philosophy of the [[Geto-Dacians]]". They were affirming a continuity of philosophical vision from Dacians, via folklore, to contemporary authors. Needless to say, the "materialistic" character of Romanian philosophy and other pretensions of the official dogma were inexistent or wildly exaggerated. However, some important non-Marxist authors, like [[Noica]], also insisted on the singularity of Romanian philosophical thinking. Noica even wrote a book titled ''The Romanian Sentiment of Being''.

After the communist regime fell in 1989, this discussion resurfaced. One opinion is that there are Romanian philosophers, but there is no Romanian philosophy. In other words, the phrase "Romanian philosophy" has a mere historical-geographical content. The opposite point of view consists in two theses: 1) not all the European nations have their own national philosophy; 2) the Romanian nation has its own, distinctive, national philosophy, which continues at a higher level its traditional world-view. The article from the ''Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'' concerning the philosophy in Romania seems rather to adopt a weaker version of the second position. The existence of a Romanian philosophy is recognized, but is not connected to the national ethos, nor to the ethnic substance of the Romanians. Thus, the authors say: "At the peak of its evolution between the two world wars, Romanian philosophy had the following characteristic features: it was closely related to literature, in the sense that most Romanian philosophers were also important writers; it showed excessive preoccupation with the issue of Romanian identity; it was involved in Romania's historical, political and ideological debates, fueling attitudes in favour of or against [[Westernization]] and modernization; it synchronized quickly with Western philosophical thinking; and it was (and still is) lacking in ethical thought." (Marta Petreu, Mircea Flonta, Ioan Lucian Muntean, "Romania, philosophy in" from the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2004)

== Historical outline ==

=== Beginnings ===
 [[File:Neagoe Basarab.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Prince Neagoe Basarab and his son Theodosius]]

The first broadly philosophical texts attested on the Romanian territory are the [[Patristic]] writings. Among this corpus of texts, in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] translations, the most important are the works of [[Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite]] and the ''Dialectics'' of [[St. John Damascene]] . Excerpts from ancient philosophers circulated also. The only notable indigenous production of the epoch is ''The Teachings of Neagoe Basarab to his Son, Theodosius'', written around 1521. The book is a compilation of patristic and biblical sources, with many moral and political reflections, from an ascetic viewpoint. It illustrates Byzantine theocracy and proposes the model of a prince-monk.

=== 17th century ===
[[File:Dimitrie Cantemir - Foto01.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Dimitrie Cantemir, philosopher prince]]
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:103mare.jpg|thumb|140px|right|The frontpage of Cantemir's ''The Divan'']] --&gt;

In the middle of the 17th century, Romanian acquires the status of liturgical language alongside Greek and Slavonic, and begins to develop a philosophical vocabulary. [[Nicolae Milescu]] (1638–1708) authored the first translation of a philosophical text into Romanian (the treatise ''On the Dominant Reason'' of Pseudo-Josephus Flavius, translated towards 1688). [[Miron Costin]] (1633–1691) wrote the first philosophical poem in Romanian, "The Life of the World" (1672), an ethical reflection on the earthly happiness. The most important philosophical production of this century is ''The Divan'' (1698) of [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] (1673–1723), a philosophical treatise which supports the Orthodox ethics with rational arguments. This treatise was translated into [[Arabic]] for the use of the [[Syrian]] Christians, and, later, into Bulgarian.

Some philosophical texts were written in Latin. [[Gavril Ivul]] (1619–1678), a [[Jesuit]] who taught philosophy in the [[University of Vienna]], wrote a logical treatise, ''Propositiones ex universa logica'' (1654). Cantemir authored a textbook of logic and a treatise of "theologo-physics", ''Sacrosanctae scientiae indepingibilis imago'' (1700) which, besides discussing the nature of time, and the problem of the universals, tries to justify Biblical cosmogony with non-theological arguments drawing on the philosophy of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]. He left also a text on the philosophy of history, ''Monarchiarum physica examinatio''.

=== 18th century ===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Tf102micu400.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Samuil Micu, a Romanian Wolffian]] --&gt;
In the 18th century, the dominant philosophy in Moldavia and Walachia is the neo-Aristotelianism of [[Theophilos Corydalleus]], which was in fact the Paduan neo-Aristotelianism of [[Jacopo Zabarella|Zabarella]], [[Pietro Pomponazzi|Pomponazzi]] and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cremonini]]. Towards the last quarter of the century, this was challenged by the spread of [[rationalism]] ([[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]) and [[empiricism]] ([[John Locke]]). Important figures may be considered [[Samuel Micu]] (1745–1806) in Transylvania, and Iosif [[Moisiodax]] (1730–1800) in Moldavia. The first translated intensively from the Wolffian Baumeister, implicitly promoting German enlightenment. The last contributed decisively at the modernization of the philosophical curriculum in the Princely Academies. He wrote an essay called ''The Apology'', a splendid plea for modern European philosophy and against the old Aristotelian Chorydaleian scholasticism. The philosophical language of this century was mostly Greek. One notable exception is provided by the [[clucer]] Ioan Geanetu (Jean Zanetti), who published in 1787, in Greek and French, a treatise called ''Réfutation du traité d'Ocellus de la nature de l'univers''. Here he criticised an ancient conception regarding the eternity of the universe, in order to reinforce the faith of his correligionaries.

=== 19th century ===
The 19th century can be divided from the point of view of a history of philosophy into three periods: that of the final days of the Phanariote regime, that of the restoration of the Romanian dynasties and, finally, that of Charles I, who came from a foreign dynasty (Hohenzollern).

==== The End of the Phanariote Regime ====
In the first two decades of the 19th century the most prominent philosophers in the Romanian Principalities are still the Greek professors of the Princely Academies. Among them, we can mention [[Lambros Photiades]], [[Konstantinos Vardalachos]], [[Neophyte Doucas]] and [[Benjamin Lesvios]] in Bucharest, as well as [[Daniel Philippidis]], [[Stephanos Doungas]] and [[Dimitrios Panayotou Govdelas]] in Iaşi. Some of them were alumni of the Academies from the Principalities, as Vardalachos, who studied with Photiades, himself an ancient student of the Princely Academy from Bucharest. Daniel Philippidis also studied at this Academy in the 1780s, under the famous philologist [[Neophyte Cavsocalyvitis]]. But they had studied also (with the exception of Photiades) in major Western universities. Doungas, for example, was a student of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. In his ''Physics'' he tried to reconcile the dogmatic Orthodox theology with the science of nature, following Schelling's system.

They were not only proponents of modern philosophy and natural sciences, but also of Enlightenment ideas. The philosophy of the French "philosophes" had thus a major impact on the Romanian intelligentsia through their courses and published books. Philosophically, the most interesting of these authors is Beniamin Lesvios, whose ''Metaphysics'' contains, among other valuable things, a theory of perception involving the discussion of the conceptual possibility of colour-inversion. Also, it is worth mentioning that Philippides is the first follower of Kant in the Romanian Principalities.

==== The Epoch of the Restored Autochthonous Dynasties ====
After 1821, the ruling Princes will be once again elected by local noblemen i.e. the boyars (and validated by the Sultan). The Greek will be replaced in the Academies with the Romanian. It is an era of exalted patriotism and de-hellenization of Romanian culture and habits. Romanians begin to go directly to Western sources and to practice philosophy in their own language.

[[File:Gheorghe Lazar.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Gheorghe Lazăr, an early Kantian]]
As early as 1818 the Transylvanian [[Gheorghe Lazăr]] (1779–1821), who studied in Vienna, began teaching philosophy in Romanian in the Greek-speaking Academy. We do not have any of his courses left, but we know that he was a follower of Kant. It is debatable whether he had first-hand knowledge of Kant or not. We know that for didactical purposes he decided to make a Romanian translation of some of Krug's works, which he subsequently used as a textbook. Krug's ''Handbook of Philosophy and Philosophical Literature'' will be translated in the first period of the 19th century another three times, by [[August Treboniu Laurian]] (1810–1881), [[Timotei Cipariu]] (1805–1887) and [[Simeon Barnutiu]] (1808–1864). They were all Transylvanian, and they all studied in Vienna. Cipariu was a teacher of philosophy in the Romanian College from Blaj, where he taught using Krug's works in the 1828's. As such, philosophical criticism was mainly a Transylvanian specialty.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:200px-Eufrosin Poteca.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Eufrosin Poteca, Enlightenment philosopher]] --&gt;
An important philosopher of this period is [[Eufrosin Poteca]] (1786–1858). He studied in the [[Princely Academy from Bucharest]] with Vardalachos, Doukas and Lesvios and at the universities of Pisa and Paris (1820–1825). Eufrosin Poteca taught philosophy at the Saint Sava Academy, and was a prolific translator of philosophical and theological works. His own philosophy was strongly influenced by the [[Sensualism]] of [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], de Tracy and Soave, by [[Rousseau]]'s political philosophy and by his strong Christian beliefs. He maintained that there are three metaphysical first principles, body, soul and spirit, studied by three distinct sciences: physics (the study of unanimated bodies), psychology (the study of animated things) and ideology (in the sense of de Tracy, the science of ideas). The whole universe displays this triadic structure, as it is permeated by matter, life and logos. He identified the laws of nature with the laws of God, and he drew from this conception many moral conclusions, e.g. the lack of foundation of celibacy. Also, he thought that the foundation of all morals, politics and rights is the golden rule. From here he argued against slavery, and that got him exiled to a remote monastery, where he lived until the end of his life.

Another important name is that of [[Ionică Tăutul]] (1798–1828), a Moldavian boyar. He was educated at home by some French refugees, acquiring an extensive knowledge of political philosophy. Indeed, he quotes Locke, [[Rousseau]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], but also obscure writers such as Sabatier de Castre. His ideas are disseminated mostly in his correspondence and political pamphlets. But he left also some interesting works, like a ''Construction of Politics according to Human Nature'' or an ''Essay against Deists and Materialists''. His intention was to build a political theory starting from a Christian anthropology of the state of nature. The political system to be justified by such a procedure was an "aristo-democratic republic". The second essay, whose title is obviously inspired by [[Mersenne]], criticises the materialist vision of the man-machine ([[La Mettrie]]) on the bases of a rather Paulinic doctrine of the "amphibian" character of man, character which clearly distinguishes him from the natural world.

An important philosopher is also [[Alexandru Hâjdeu]] (1811–1872), a student of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] in Berlin. This man, although very proud of his Moldavian origin, was an ardent Russian patriot, since he lived in [[Bessarabia]], Moldavian territory annexed by Russia. His philosophy is concerned with the destiny of Russia, and he is a slavophile and a messianistic. He argues for the development of a purely Russian philosophy, emerging from the careful study of the Russian language. According to him, Only such a philosophy can be national, an only this way the Russian element can be brought to universality. The way to arrive at such a philosophy is to continue the thinking of [[Skovoroda]], the only authentic Russian philosopher up to then. This will fulfil the moment of existence for itself of the Russian nation.

[[Ioan Zalomit]] (1820–1885) studied the philosophy in France and in Germany, at Berlin, with [[Victor Cousin]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. He obtained here the title of doctor of philosophy with a thesis on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (1848). In his [[inaugural dissertation]], Zalomit tries to overcome the Kantian opposition between laws of nature and moral laws. He affirms that liberty is inherent to nature, so that the moral laws are in fact laws of nature. All the moral actions are thus the result of a "duty towards nature". It is only this way that a rational theodicy is possible.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Simion Barnutiu 5.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Simeon Barnutiu]] --&gt;
[[Simeon Bărnuţiu]] (1808–1864) taught philosophy at the Blaj College, at the [[Mihaileana Academy]] and, finally, at the [[University of Iaşi]]. His remaining published courses are mostly adaptations after Krug, Beck, Rottek and Niemeyers. His most interesting contributions are to be found in the philosophy of right. A revolutionary, Bărnuţiu wanted to defend the right to self-determination of the Transylvanian Romanians. He found ideas suitable for his purpose in the philosophy of Krug, widely diffused in Transylvania by the Hungarian exponents of the "philosophy of harmony" - [[Samuel Köteles]], [[János Hetény]] and [[Gusztáv Szontágh]]. Other influences came from [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]]. In his ''The Public Law of Romanians'' (1867) Bărnuţiu wanted to prove that Romanian law was in fact Roman law, which had been perpetuated throughout history. Further more, Roman law seemed to him to respect the natural rights of the individuals, as formulated in the Enlightenment theories of natural law.

[[File:Heliade 1850s.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Ion Heliade Rădulescu]]
At the end of this period, the most important and original thinker is [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] (1802–1872). Rădulescu studied at the [[Princely Academy from Bucharest]], under Neophyte Doukas, and from 1818 migrated to the Romanian classes of [[Gheorghe Lazăr]]. After the death of Lazar he became a teacher in the Academy and he had a prodigious activity as a cultural animator. In 1828 he published an "almost philosophical" (in his words) ''Romanian Grammar'', influenced by [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], which he knew from his Greek teachers. After the turmoil of the 1848 Revolution, Heliade Rădulescu comes up with a philosophical system, inspired from [[kabbalah|kabala]] and the socialism of [[Proudhon]] and [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]]. There are also traces of [[Hegel]]'s influence, but not directly read (he knew him probably from the works of Cousin). His two most important works are ''The Universal Critical History'' and ''Equilibrium between Antitheses''.

Heliade Rădulescu proposes, against monisms and dualisms of all kind, a trinitarian philosophy. He affirms that all philosophical concepts come in dualities, which can be classified in two categories: sympathetic (or parallel) and antipathetic. A sympathetic duality is formed by two "positive" terms, which indicate an existence: time / space; spirit / matter; right / duty etc. An antipathetic duality contains a positive and a negative term: life / death; movement / inertia; good / evil etc. Now, each sympathetic duality produces a third term, through which the dualism is overcome. Here are some examples: spirit / matter / universe; form / substance / body; progress / conservation / perfectibility; spiritual man / physical man / moral man. Beginning from here, Heliade Rădulescu develops a kind of cosmology, by means of naïve although ingenious geometrical considerations. He means thus to offer a metaphysical explanation of progress and then, armed with this metaphysics, to fight the liberalism. For his final purpose is to offer an argument in support of his political position, called "progressive conservatism". To those who reply that this is an inconsistent position, he answers that the duality progress / conservation is not antipathetic, but sympathetic, and that only a progressive conservatism is perfectible.

==== The Epoch of Charles I (Carol I) ====
In 1860 and 1864 [[Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] founds the Universities of Iaşi and Bucharest, and in 1866 Karl von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen becomes, under the name Carol I, [[Domnitor]] of the [[Principality of Romania]], which will later become the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. This event marks a new wave of westernization, as well as a reaction against the formerly prevalent cultural model, that of Enlightenment. Almost at the same time, in 1863, the "Junimnea" literary society is founded in Iaşi.

The last thirty years of the 19th century are culturally dominated by the Junimea society. The Romanian philosophy will have a new beginning and, for the first time, an international echo. The philosophers from Junimea were [[Titu Maiorescu]] (1840–1917), [[Vasile Conta]] (1846–1882), [[Alexandru Xenopol]] (1847–1920), [[Mihai Eminescu]] (1850–1889), [[Constantin Leonardescu]] (1844–1907), [[Ioan Pop Florantin]] (1843–1926).

[[File:Titu Maiorescu.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Titu Maiorescu]]
Titu Maiorescu studied the philosophy in Berlin, and obtained his two doctorates from the [[University of Giessen]], and later from the University of Paris. His first philosophical paper was ''Einiges Philosophische in gemeinfasslicher Form'' (1860), a work that was rather well received, written under the influence of Herbart and Feuerbach. In Romanian, his most important contribution was a ''Logic'' (1876), influenced by [[Herbart]], who had numerous reprints and served as a textbook until the years 1930. He was a proponent of Kant's philosophy, and he was skeptical with respect to the possibility of an original, creative, Romanian philosophy.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Conta.gif|thumb|140px|left|Materialist philosopher Vasile Conta]] --&gt;
Vasile Conta obtained his doctorate from the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] and functioned as a Professor of Law at the [[University of Iaşi]]. His works, published in Romanian and French, included ''La théorie du fatalisme'' (1877) and ''La théorie de l’ondulation universelle'' (1895). Conta was influenced by three sources: the evolutionist philosophy of [[Herbert Spencer]], the positivism of [[August Compte]], and the German materialism of [[Büchner]], [[Vogt]], and [[Moleschott]]. In his first work he defends a version of determinism, called "fatalism", and proposes a materialist theory of knowledge (or rather, a materialist model of cognition). Cognition is accounted for in terms of material modifications of the brain. He thought that sensorial input is transmitted through the nervous fibres under the form of "shakings", or vibrations, which provoke the apparition of physiological changes in the brain, called "imprintings". In the second cited work, Conta proposes a materialist metaphysics, affirming the wave-like character of the universe; according to this conception, the evolution of the universe as a whole, and of each entity in this universe has a wave-like character. Conta wrote also books on the history of metaphysics, on the nature of metaphysics, on the "first principles that constitute the world". He dissociated from the positivists of his time by arguing for the importance of metaphysics and for the presence of an artistic element in the construction of the metaphysical systems.

Alexandru Xenopol, historian and philosopher, had two doctorates, one of them in philosophy, conferred from the [[University of Giessen]]. His philosophy emerged from his constant preoccupations with history. In his most famous work, La théorie de l’histoire, Xenopol presents a philosophy of science of the utmost importance and interest. He draws a distinction between facts of repetition, and facts of succession. The facts of repetition are studied by the natural sciences, and are characterised by natural laws. The facts of succession are studied by the sciences of the spirit, notably by history, and they are not subsumed to any law, but they form series. Xenopol was considered by [[Rickert]] one of his precursors. He also discussed the concept of causality, the notion of hypothesis and of the verification of hypothesis. His views on space and time oppose Kantian doctrines, and he argues explicitly against the German philosopher, who in his opinion had turned history into a mere fairy tale.

Mihai Eminescu, the Romanian national poet, studied philosophy at Viena and Berline. Apparently he was preparing a thesis on the philosophy of history, but he never got his PhD. He is the author of the first Romanian (partial) translation of the ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Many of his poems and prose contain, in appropriate literary form, quite a few philosophical ideas, mainly influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Schopenhauer]], and [[Buddhism]], but he never wrote philosophical texts proper. On the other hand, his political philosophy, exposed in newspaper articles and editorials is quite distinctive. Eminescu is one of the most important and influential Romanian conservative political thinkers of the last decades of the 19th century.

Constantin Leonardescu studied at the Universities of Bucharest and Paris, and was a professor of philosophy in the [[University of Iaşi]]. Generally, he was influenced by the French eclecticism and he had a thoroughly "scientific" attitude in philosophy. Like many of his time, Leonardescu had a great interested in psychology, science which he tried to apply to diverse domains of philosophy, such as epistemology and aesthetics. His long list of published books includes ''Philosophy Face to the Progress of Positive Sciences'' (1876), ''Metaphysics, Religion and Science'' (1884), ''The Principles of Psychology'' (1892), ''The Inductive Morals or the Science of the Human Behaviour'' (1885) etc.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Pers141.JPG|thumb|120px|right|Ioan Pop Florantin, the author of the first Romanian treatise of aesthetics]] --&gt;
Ioan Pop Florantin, a doctor of philosophy of the [[University of Vienna]], taught philosophy in several high-schools in Iaşi. He authored several books on logic, psychology, and general philosophy, as well as the first Romania treatise on aesthetics (1874). He advanced also a personal conception called "the universal consecutionism", a kind of materialistic process metaphysics. From this position he summoned "the true Einstein" to the "tribunal of logic" towards the end of his life.

Prince [[Grigore Sturdza]] (1821–1901) was a learned man, who had philosophical preoccupations. He published some philosophical works in French, among which ''Les lois fondamentales de l'Univers''(1891) is the most important. The book's subject-matter is chiefly the astronomy, or the scientific cosmology, which eventually serves as a basis for metaphysical speculations.

Outside the borders of the Principality, later Kingdom, of Romania, we can notice the activity of [[Vasile Lucaciu]] (1852–1922), from Maramures, a northern part of Transylvania. Of Greek-catholic confession, he studied at Rome where he obtained his doctorate in theology and philosophy. He is the author of a Thomist philosophical system, ''Institutions of Philosophy'', published between 1881 and 1884 in three volumes: ''Logic'' (1881), ''Metaphysics'' (1882), and ''Moral Philosophy'' (1884).

=== 20th century ===
During the 20th century, the history of Romanian philosophy can be divided in three periods: the pre-communist period, the communist period, and the post-communist period.

==== Pre-communist period ====
Two major "schools" of philosophy have produced, in the first half of the century, two peaks of Romanian philosophy: the school of Maiorescu, and the school of [[Nae Ionescu]]. Transylvanian philosophers can also be grouped together, mostly by reason of their non affiliation to the two other schools, but also on the reason of their belonging to the same spiritual family. Apart this three "schools" or orientations, there are many other authors, cultivating with predilection the philosophical essay. A special mention deserve the members of the Onicescu circle, aptly characterised as analytic philosophers.

===== The Maiorescians =====
The "Maiorescians" are [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] (1868–1957), [[P. P. Negulescu]] (1872–1951), [[Dumitru Draghicescu]] (1875–1945), [[Ion Petrovici]] (1882–1972), and [[Mircea Florian]] (1888–1960).

Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, the grandson of [[Eufrosin Poteca]], called his philosophical system "Energetic Personalism", influenced by the Otswald's energetism and Stern's personalism. An expert in experimental psychology (he studied under Wundt, getting his doctorate with a dissertation on Kant), he followed the inductivist trend in metaphysics. The human personality was considered by him a superior form of energy, the final stage of the evolution of the universe. His metaphysics implies a political program as well as an ethics of labor. The purpose of the political life must be the transition from the "anarchic personalism" that governed the Romanian society to "energetic personalism".

P. P. Negulescu published a ''Philosophy of the Renaissance'' still readable and a capital study in the philosophy of culture, called ''The Genesis of the Forms of the Culture''.

Dumitru Draghicescu obtained his licence in philosophy with a memoir on the ''Influence of Kant on Auguste Compte'' (1901) at the [[University of Bucharest]], continuing his studies in Paris, where he did his doctorate with [[Durkheim]]. In his youth he was under the influence of Conta's materialist philosophy. Draghicescu had major contributions in social philosophy (he was also an important sociologist). One of Draghicescu's books, ''Vérité et révelation: vers une nouvelle idée de Dieu'' (2 volumes, 1934), was very well received by [[Charles Hartshorne]], for the authentically new aspects of the concept of God which it put forth. Draghicescu considered that man is the being the limit of whose development is divinity, saying that all of God's attributes can be applied as such to man, considered in his potentiality and historical destiny.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Ion Petrovici.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Ion Petrovici]] --&gt;
Ion Petrovici wrote on logic and metaphysics. In logic he contributed to the logical theory of notions, mainly regarding the relations between the intension and the extension of a term; he contradicted the law of their inverse dependence. In metaphysics perhaps the most well known of his contributions is the lecture "The Idea of Nothingness" (1933), in which the nothingness was determined as a "transcendent substance", preceding existence and transcending it, but manifesting itself immanently in the existent things.

Mircea Florian, who studied in Germany with the Neokantian Rehmke, elaborated between the wars a philosophy of the "pure datum", trying to overcome the epistemology based on the subject-object dichotomy. His results are published in the volume ''Philosophical Reconstruction'' (1943).

===== The Ionescians =====
The "Ionescians" grouped around their teacher and/or friend, [[Nae Ionescu]] (1890–1940). He earned his PhD in Germany, with a study on "logistic", i.e., in the terminology of the epoch, mathematical logic. He actually rejected mathematical logic, thinking it is reductive even in comparison to classical logic. His thinking on logic in general may be regarded as a form of intuitionism. He published only newspaper articles, where he held strongly conservative, reactionary views, and he quickly moved toward the extreme right. After his death, some of his students and associates (Noica, Amzăr, Eliade, Onicescu, Vulcănescu) published his various lectures on Logic, History of Logic, Epistemology (i.e. Theory of Knowledge) and on Metaphysics and The History of Metaphysics. His approach to the History of Philosophy is mostly typological, not chronological. Nae Ionescu's thought could be described overall as an existential philosophy of Christian authenticity, called "Trăirism" (from the verb "a trăi", to live), an autochthonous version of [[Existentialism]] influenced by vitalism and Orthodox theology. Many late commentators have accused him of "plagiarism", neglecting that he never wrote his lectures, not even lecture notes; Ionescu creatively improvised, and on many occasions one can recognise ideas initiated by Bergson, Scheler, Heidegger; his charisma was impressive, and students were completely captivated by the fact that he philosophised on the spot, in the course room, without preconceptions, giving interesting answers to issues they raised, and provoking a certain spiritual tension, with an impetus toward thinking on one's own. Because he was quite ironic, always disposed toward revising his thought and never wrote philosophy proper, his disciples compared him to Socrates.

The most important of his adherents were [[Mircea Vulcanescu]] (1904–1952), [[Mircea Eliade]] (1907–1986), [[Emil Cioran]] (1911–1995), [[Constantin Noica]] (1909–1987). Others like [[Petre Ţuţea]] were also influenced by his personality, and philosophers like [[Alexandru Dragomir]] and [[Mihai Şora]] attended some of his courses.

Mircea Vulcanescu had an enormous erudition, being considered by many the chief of the "generation", but did not publish significant philosophical papers. He did, however, influence Romanian philosophy with his seminal essay ''The Romanian Dimension of Existence''. In this work he analyses the conceptual paradigm that serves as a means of evaluation of diverse philosophical visions by Romanians. By analysing certain Romanian phrases, in what he calls a phenomenological manner, he claims to unravel the inherent worldview. For example, from an analysis of the linguistic particularities of negation in the Romanian language, he deduces the Romanian ethos, with traits like fatalism or indifference regarding death, an easygoing attitude toward life, the conception that there is no alternative but also nothing irremediable.

Mircea Eliade, the well-known scholar of the history of religions, published a few essays showing the influence of his teacher Ionescu, but through these early works he brought nothing essentially new in the landscape of the Romanian philosophy. He was, however, a very important person in the intellectual landscape of the 1930s, another possible "leader" of a new generation.

Emil Cioran, in his early books written in Romanian, proposed a philosophy of despair, shows a morbid obsession with death, all expressed in a deeply lyrical manner. He wrote mostly on [[Nihilism|nihilist]] themes of Nietzschean and Schopeanhaurean provenance, with some contemporary influences like Giovanni Papini and Nicolai Berdiaev.

Constantin Noica debuted with an essay called ''Mathesis, or Simple Joys''. The short book glosses on the distinction between life and geometry. After this essay Noica will orientate himself towards the history of philosophy, writing on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Descartes]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[David Hume|Hume]] etc. His PhD thesis was called ''A Sketch for the History of How Something New May be Possible'', where he tries to answer how the spirit is not "endlessly tautologous", analysing European philosophy from Plato to Hume.

===== The Transylvanians =====
Transylvania produced between the Wars three remarkable thinkers: [[Lucian Blaga]] (1895–1961), [[D. D. Rosca]] (1895–1980), and [[Eugeniu Sperantia]] (1888–1972).

Lucian Blaga's philosophical system, called "ekstatic intellectualism" is a highly original construction, with roots in the philosophy of Kant, [[psychoanalysis]], and [[Patristic]] philosophy. The system was projected in five monumental "trilogies", but only three were achieved and a fourth was partially elaborated. The trilogies are, in order: ''The Trilogy of Knowledge'', ''The Trilogy of Culture'', ''The Trilogy of Values'', and ''The Cosmological Trilogy''.

The metaphysical vision of Blaga centres around a mysterious metaphysical source or principle he called "The Great Anonymous", which creates the Universe indirectly, by mutilating the forms of existence that emanate from him, in order to avoid the possibility of the apparition of another Great Anonymous. The results of these acts of mutilation are infinitesimal fragments, structured in types, and called "divine differentials". The extant beings appear by the aggregation of these differentials. The speculative cosmology of Blaga also includes an entelechial interpretation of evolutionist biology.

His theory of knowledge asserts the existence of an "unconscious spirit" endowed with his own set of categories which double the Kantian categories of the conscious spirit. These categories of the unconscious prevent humans from completely revealing the mystery of existence, since all his knowledge must fit into this categorical framework. Thus, the Great Anonymous maintains an isolated "centrality of existence", because a complete knowledge would make the man godlike, but also infuses human activity with a creative tension. Blaga's metaphysical axiology also follows this conception. All categories encompass human powers of expression, and their dynamic influence is finally projected into values. In other words, what we can not overcome, we idolise. This "finalist self-deluding" repetitively ensures the creative destiny of mankind.

All human culture is according to Blaga the result of man's trying to reveal the mysteries of existence, it constitutes the man's being. Since man can not reveal completely the mysteries, because of the "transcendent censure" exerted by the unconscious categorial scheme, all his productions bear the mark of this dynamic framework. The totality of these categories at some point is called a "stylistic matrix", and they have the structure of a "cosmoid", that is of a small universe, i.e. a self-sufficient order. Thus, each culture is characterised by a style, in which different categories activate and wear off successively, until the complete exhaustion of the stylistic matrix. At that moment, the culture generated by the attempts of revelation within the respective stylistic matrix dies. This vision is inspired by, but significantly detached from the morphological theory of culture, as exposed by a [[Leo Frobenius|Frobenius]] or a [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]]. Blaga discusses extensively, with many illustrations why all these theories missed the point.

D. D. Rosca, who would later be the coordinator and translator of the series of complete works of [[Hegel]] into Romanian, arrived at a philosophical synthesis presented in his book ''The Tragic Existence''. It is a personal blend of [[existentialism]], with roots in [[Kierkegaard]], but influenced also by Hegel. His PhD thesis at the [[Sorbonne]], ''The Influence of Hegel on Taine'', as well as his translation in French of the ''Life of Jesus'' made him a known name in the French-speaking world.

Eugeniu Sperantia was a very prolific author. He began his list of publications with his PhD thesis, ''The Pragmatic Apriorism'', a rethinking of Kant's Transcendental Analytic from a [[Pragmatism|Pragmatist]] stand-point. He wrote subsequently on various subjects, like the biology from a [[Hegelian]] perspective, gaining a reputation especially in the field of the philosophy of right. He was a pioneer in the field of erotetic logic (the logic of interrogatives), which he called "problematology". A very interesting and most neglected work is his ''System of Metaphysics: Implicit in the Postulates of Any Possible Knowledge''. We have here a theoretical innovation in metaphysics: Sperantia replaces the categorial theories of classical metaphysics with the analysis of the most general questions, analysis rendered possible by his problematology. Thus, the framework-theory of metaphysics becomes the logic of the interrogatives. Recently, his conception of metaphysics was compared to that of [[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]].

===== Other philosophers =====
From the multitude of philosophical authors unaffiliated to the previous three currents we can mention here (almost randomly) [[Vasile Bancilă]] (1897–1979), [[Ionel Gherea]], [[Anton Dumitriu]] (1905–1992) and [[Stéphane Lupasco]] (1900–1988).

Vasile Bancilă wrote two important commentaries on Blaga and [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru|Radulescu-Motru]], and gave a valuable reply to Blaga's ''Mioritic Space'', also called "plai", opposing what Bancilă called ''The Space of Bărăgan''. Blaga's book maintained that the unconscious category of space which operates in the Romanian stylistic matrix was "the space indefinitely wave-like", an alternation on ups and downs, as a sinusoid. The name "mioritical" comes from "mioriţa", diminutive of sheep, i.e. an Ewe, the famous title of a popular ballad that is widely considered as quite relevant of the Romanian worldview, written in a peculiar alternating style. These are highly metaphorical and playful descriptions of a specific ethos common to significant cultural regions loosely related to a geographical space. Blaga also contends one may live in a plain but reflect a "mioritic plai" ethos, and that a specific ethos may become dominant even while it remains "minor" (the term is not loaded with value in Blaga's philosophy) and this "style" may absorb others while also being influenced by them. Bancilă on the other hand tried to show that Romanian culture as a whole does not reflect only a single "abysmal" category of space, the "plai" structure pointed out by Blaga, and he subsequently tried to show the existence of a "Bărăgan space" (Bărăgan is the name of the greatest plain in Romania); a space not determined by the alternating relief of hills or mountains, but by the flat plain.

Ionel Gherea, son of the noted Marxist sociologist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], published a book called ''The I and the World: Essay in Anthropomorphic Cosmogony''. This much too neglected work contains a still interesting discussion of the concept of personal identity. The author does an unusual amount of conceptual analysis, although in extremely general lines he is a phenomenologist of Husserlian orientation.

Anton Dumitriu, mathematician by initial formation, obtained a PhD in philosophy then became the assistant of P. P. Negulescu. He was among the first philosophers in Romania interested in the philosophy of science, subject he treated in ''The Philosophical bases of Science''. He introduces in Romania the latest mathematical logic, mostly by his works ''The New Logic'' and ''The Polyvalent Logic'', where he presents the [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]–[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] axiomatic system of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', and [[C.I. Lewis]]’ system of strict implication. Also, he researched intensively the problem of logical - semantic paradoxes, having the conviction that the solution to them was already available in the works of the Scholastic philosophers.

Stéphane Lupasco, renowned francophone philosopher of science, tried to lay the basis of a new epistemology, consonant with the then newly developed quantum mechanics. He advocated a logic of the included third, which conducted him to sustain the existence of third state, beyond matter and energy.

In the 1940s the mathematician [[Octav Onicescu]] conducted a seminar in philosophy of science at the University of Bucharest. Among the most important members of this group of scientific philosophy were fellow mathematicians [[Grigore Moisil]] and [[Dan Barbilian]] as well as other notorious scientists like [[Şerban Ţiţeica]] or [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]]. They were engaged in foundational research, using mathematics as a formal instrument of conceptual analysis. Their results were published in the anthology ''The Problem of Determinism'', or in some monographs as Onicescu's ''Principles of Scientific Knowledge'', Georgescu-Roegen's ''The Statistical Method'' or P. Sergescu's ''Mathematical Thinking''.

==== Communist period ====
Within the first decade of totalitarianism, Romanian philosophical life was dominated by the persecution of all important interbellum philosophers. [[Lucretiu Patrascanu]] (1900–1954) was the author of a work, ''Currents and Tendencies in Romanian Philosophy'', which will establish for decades the status of the Romanian philosophers. With mostly rudimentary means, over-simplifications, appealing to the "Marxist-Leninist" doctrine, Patrascanu polemicized with major philosophers as Blaga, Radulescu-Motru, Florian, [[Emil Cioran|Cioran]] and "exposed" them as idealists, irrationalists, mystics, bourgeois, imperialists and sometimes fascists. Among the local pseudo-Marxists a new star emerged quickly, [[Constantin I. Gulian]] (1914-2011), a member of the Romanian Academy since 1955 until his death. Gulian produced at the peak of his career several expositions of Hegelian philosophy, completely lacking any value. During these first decades, philosophy was taught in Universities by dentists or illiterate workers turned into professors virtually overnight: Following Stalin's death, hardcore communist dogma slowly lost some of its force.

After 1964, the date of the great amnesty of all political prisoners, philosophical life had a chance to come back into existence, partly catalysed by the professional reinsertion of the relatively few surviving philosophers, who were either imprisoned or marginalized. Thus, we can distinguish several "schools" of philosophers: the interbellum school, the Păltiniş school and the Epistemological School of Bucharest. Independent figures existed, of course, mostly as university professors.

===== The Interbellum School =====
The name of "school" may be even more inappropriate in this case than it was before, when we spoke of [[Nae Ionescu]]'s school or of that of [[Titu Maiorescu]]. The Interbellum school should be seen in the same manner we speak of "the old school". The most important philosophers formed in the interbellum period, that could practice again philosophy, and remained significantly creative are: [[Mircea Florian]], [[Constantin Noica]], [[Anton Dumitriu]], [[Mihai Şora]] (b. 1916), [[Petre Ţuţea]] (1902–1991), [[Alexandru Dragomir]] (1916–2002).

Mircea Florian wrote in the 1960s in solitude a system of philosophy presented in a two-volume treatise called ''Recessivity as the Structure of the World''. Inspired by an analogy with genetic biology, Florian arrives at the conclusion that experience is characterised by an invariant, the relation of recessivity that holds between two concepts. This relation is neither a relation of opposition, like the contrariety, nor one of concordance, like the subordination. It is a special relation which exhibits features of both types of inter-notional relation acknowledged by logic. It is both a relation of subordination, and a relation of opposition. In a pair of concepts united by this relation, there is one which is hierarchically superior, called the "dominant" concept, and another which, although hierarchically inferior, is [[ontological]]ly superior, called the "recessive" concept. Florian shows that every important concept of philosophy belongs to a pair which instantiates recessivity. He analysed several dozens of such pairs, writing for each term practically a micro-monograph.

Constantin Noica became during this time, after his release from prison, a continental metaphysician of European dimensions, arguably one of the greatest of the late 20th century. His first book published after detention was ''27 Steps of the Real'' in which he unifies three categorial systems, those of Plato, Aristotle, and Kant. Under a Hegelian, but maybe also influenced by Nicolai Hartmann, he thought that reality, divided in three realms, inorganic, organic and spiritual, is characterised by three distinct sets of categories. At the peak of this categorial ladder he put a new category, which reflects the impact that physics had on his thought: the undulation, or the wave, which became thus the supreme category.

He later developed the theory initiated by [[Vulcănescu]], and wrote several books which brought him overnight celebrity, especially in literary circles. Books as ''Creation and Beauty in Romanian Speech'', or ''The Romanian Sentiment of Being'', masterpieces of etymological speculation and [[hermeneutics|philosophical hermeneutics]], have obviously limited universal value, of interest only to those researching Romanian spirituality per se. In these books Noica arrived at the conclusion that the Romanian language possesses a word, a preposition, which mediates its unique access to the realm of being. It is the preposition ''întru'', which expresses the processuality of the being or what he calls "the becoming in-towards (întru) Being". This idiomatic preposition, of Latin provenance (''intro'') stands for more than a spatial inclusion: it indicates a going on, a movement both toward something, and within that something i.e. a movement of participation.

His ontology (more correctly called metaphysics) is edified without the idiomatic peculiarities in two later works, and consists of ''The Becoming in-to the Being'' and ''Letters on the Logic of Hermes'', but it was incipient since ''Six Maladies of the Contemporary Spirit''. In these works Noica shows how the monolithic unity of being is broken, and being displays three instances; The being of first instance is arrived at phenomenologically. As such, the being of things appears as a functional model, the structure Individual – Determinations – General (I-D-G), which the things are striving to realise. But the model of the being is rarely found realised like that; most currently it is incomplete, only two of the three terms being present. Thus, there are six incomplete, unsaturated formations, called by Noica "ontological precariousness" or "maladies of being" (or "of the spirit", in ''Six maladies...''). These maladies, schematically represented as I-G, G-I, I-D, D-I, D-G, and G-D, are what he calls the rule of the real. Then, the being of second instance is the "element", characterised as an individual-general, which is an entity that is not a particular, i.e. its conditions of identity do not make reference to a single spatio-temporal location. Something is an individual-general if it distributes itself without dividing. Like the Whiteheadian ingression, the "distribution without dividing" is a rethinking of the Platonic participation. A favourite exemplification of the nature of an element is for Noica the concept of biological species. The elements are characterised by different categories than the things, of a speculative nature, like unity-multiplicity-totality, reality-possibility-necessity. The being of the third instance, or the being qua being, is theorised in several pages of an incredible density, and in a language close to theology. Noica attempts to rethink here the problem of the one and the many, in a Parmenidean – Platonic style. He formulates as a criterion for being the same "distribution without dividing".

Methodologically, Noica can be considered, paradoxically, an anti-Hegelian Hegelian. He revises Hegelian dialectics, accused explicitly by Noica of being dominated by the "ethos of neutrality". In Hegelian logic, Noica contends, Hegel himself must intervene in order to give the concepts the necessary impetus for their movement. They do not have in themselves the power to move dialectically. Noica considers that dialectics is circular and tetradic. The scheme thesis – antithesis – synthesis is replaced by him with the rival scheme theme – anti-theme – thesis – theme (refound). The spirit, Noica says, begins not with a thesis, but with a thematic horizon in which it moves, and into which it digs repeatedly, going more and more toward the intimacy of this horizon. Several of Noica's peculiar paradoxical concepts, which allow him to articulate his views on dialectics, are difficult to comprehend, and require much sympathy from the reader: "the non-limiting limitation", "the opening closure" etc.

Noica's philosophy is also concerned with the problem of reason and the problem of the individual. He redefines reason as "the conscience of the becoming in-to being". The philosopher wanted to save the individual from "the tyranny of the general", to give to the individual an "ontological dignity". He was deeply disturbed by the image of the individual as a simple instance of something general, as a simple particular case of a general rule. But he also intended to maintain the reality of the general natures, not wanting to reduce them to mere collections or classes of individuals. Thus, he rejected both [[Platonic realism]], and [[nominalism]] of all kinds. Instead of choosing between nominalism and realism, he proposes a third version, which insists on the solidarity existent between the individual and the general, linked by their determinations. His triangle I-D-G forms thus an irreducible unity, reminiscent of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]'s triad.

Constantin Noica formed around him an unofficial school of philosophy, based at [[Păltiniş]], a mountain location where he spent his last living years. Păltiniş became a place of pilgrimage for young Romanian intellectuals, who went there in search of a spiritual mentor. Noica became thus a kind of national institution with an influence unequalled by any other intellectual figure before or after him. He imposed to his disciples the intensive study of Greek and German, and he asked them to approach "cultures", not authors and certainly not isolated books. He had an effervescent activity of translation, initiating in collaboration with Petru Creţia the integral edition of Plato in Romanian. He also translated from neo-Platonic Aristotelian commentators, [[Dexippus (350AD)|Dexippus]], [[Ammonius Hermiae|Ammonius]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and others. He contributed to the translation of Kant's ''Critique of Judgement'', and he translated from Chorydaleus, the ''Introduction to logic'' and the ''Commentary to Metaphysics''. He himself wrote commentaries and interpretations of Plato, Aristotle, and Hegel, and encouraged the introduction of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s writings. He was by far the most brilliant philosopher of post-war Romania.

[[Anton Dumitriu]] continued after 1964 his initial preoccupations, publishing in the philosophy of mathematics and in the theory and history of logic. His monumental ''History of Logic'', although a landmark of Romanian philosophy and of the discipline, suffered from notable shortcomings and had a rather bad reception in the West. Dumitriu included too much on some topics of his history, with chapters on the transcendental and dialectical logic, and too little on others, not treating many branches of recent logic, or treating them completely sketchily and insufficiently, as in the case of modal logic. Also, he was misinformed on issues concerning Scholastic philosophy. However, there are many parts of this work that are still valuable today.

Anton Dumitriu wrote also a series of essays, more literary in style, which made him appreciated by the Romanian intellectual milieu, centered on literature. His book ''Philosophia Mirabilis'' is an essay on the esoteric dimension of the Greek philosophy,  ''Eleatic Cultures and Heracleitean Cultures'', a comparative essay in the philosophy of culture, and ''Aletheia'', a study of the Greek meaning of truth and of philosophy, where he criticises [[Heidegger]]'s position in ''Introduction to Metaphysics''.

[[Mihai Şora]] was a student of [[Nae Ionescu]] and [[Mircea Eliade]], but younger than the members of the so-called ’27 generation. He obtained in 1938 a bourse at the [[Sorbonne]], where he went for preparing a thesis on [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]. During wartime he wrote a book called ''On the Interior Dialogue'', published only in 1947 at [[Gallimard]], and well received by [[Jacques Maritain]] and [[Étienne Gilson]]. In this work Sora explores the problem of human authenticity, in an existential tone, but influenced greatly by Scholastic philosophy (notably that of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Nicolaus Cusanus]]) and by [[Marxism]] (he was a member of the French communist party and a member of the Résistance).

In 1948 he returned to Romania, and couldn't leave the country anymore. He did not publish anything until the end of the 70s, when he began a cycle of four books, containing a philosophical system, achieved only in 2005. During the communist regime he wrote and published three of the four books composing the cycle: ''The Salt of the Earth'', ''To be, the do, to have'' and ''I &amp; You &amp; He &amp; She or the Generalised Dialogue''. His last book is called ''The Instant and the Time''. His system consists of an ontology, a poetics, an ethics and a political philosophy, all deriving from an original "ontological model". The influences comes from [[Charles Péguy|Péguy]], Pascal, the Scholastics and from [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]. Sora considered himself ever since his first book as "Cartesian of the utmost consequence", i.e. a phenomenologist.

His concept of intentionality, crucial for the comprehension of his philosophy, was neither that of [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], nor that of Husserl, but an original one with deep roots in the Scholastic philosophy. In-tentio, derived from ''IN aliud TENDERE'' is the penetrating act of the spirit, which goes beyond the things into their origin, which is the Unum with his three transcendentals: ''Bonum, Verum'' and ''Pulchrum''. Thus, there are three forms of intentionality, moral, theoretical and esthetical, characterising three types of human attitudes toward the world. The ''Unum'' is not viewed only as an actus purus, but rather as an "universal potentiality of being". As such, i.e. is placed, in Şora's metaphorical model, at the centre of a sphere of null radius, which has, thus, the same topos as the periphery. The surface of this sphere represents the pure exteriority, composed of "terminal actualities". The radius is the geometrical locus of the interiority, where we find the "intermediary potentialities".

Mihai Şora is considered the mentor of another "school", much more discrete and heterogeneous than the school of Noica, and there is currently an increasing interest in his work, especially from the young philosophers grouped around the ''[[Studia Phaenomonelogica]]'' philosophical review.

[[Petre Ţuţea]] had a PhD in Administrative Law. Before and during the Second World War he worked as a director in the Ministry of National Economy, and was known and appreciated by all members of the '27 generation as one of their own, even though he was a little older. He widely gained the reputation of a rhetorical genius, when he spoke everybody stood and listened. Some even considered him "a leader of his generation". Initially having youthful Marxist convictions, he developed right-wing nationalist sympathies, that would later lead to his arrest and conviction. In prison he rediscovered Christianity, and after his release he considered himself a Christian philosopher. Although due to his political antecedents and uncompromising content of philosophical ideas and religious faith Ţuţea could not publish very much, he wrote a considerable amount, including a late work projected in five volumes, "Problems, Systems, Styles, Sciences" and finally "Dogmas". He completed the first two, and a small part of "Styles" and "Dogmas" – of which the first two volumes were published posthumously. "The Philosophy of Nuances" is also an important essay, a veritable manifesto for a new philosophy, dating back to 1969. Ţuţea was influenced by a whole plethora of intellectual personalities, but mostly by Plato, Greek Skepticism, Leibniz, Nietzsche, Bergson, Simmel and the fictionalism of [[Hans Vaihinger]]. The only significant Romanian philosophical influences were [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Nae Ionescu]]. Theologically, he was under the sway of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and later [[Thomas Aquinas]], while he also knew and admired the major contemporary Romanian theologian, Fr. [[Dumitru Stăniloae]], whom he met in prison. Ţuţea also appreciated various thinkers like [[Werner Sombart]], and frequently refers to scientists like Heisenberg and Poincaré.

Initially Ţuţea rejected the categories of Western idealism, replacing the Kantian conceptual framework with a spectrum of empirical-phenomenological nuances. His later philosophy, as he declares, is an effort of "theologal" (not theological) thinking. He argues that Truth is unique, but human reason cannot find it by itself, although it can be a receptacle of truth. Thus, in order to really know the truth, man needs inspiration and revelation. Man is never autonomous, and all intellectual efforts like science or philosophy are only means of producing fictions, at the level of material and cultural comfort. Ţuţea believed that science and philosophy by themselves don’t even have a consoling function, being essentially irrelevant with respect to the most dramatic issues, like death. Thus, only religion (specifically, Christianity) possesses the truth and bears relevance to the destiny of humankind. Without it, he says, man is just "a rational animal that comes from nowhere and doesn't go anywhere". Anthropologically, Ţuţea analyzed what he calls "Christian man"; the anthropological model to be pursued is that of the saint.

Ţuţea was undoubtedly an unusual, Socratic figure, in the sense of a major, exemplary personality, and his writing style is quite peculiar. His various writings are hardly classifiable, and even though he never finished whatever he started, after his release from prison Ţuţea elaborated at least three original literary-philosophical styles: The Philosophy of Nuances, Theatre as Seminar and Religious-theologal Reflections. One of Ţuţea's singular features, the so-called "substantivization" of predicates, related to his manner of writing sentences without verbs, as well as the many resonant repetitions he calls "leit-motifs" and constant nuancing of terms, coupled with a rejection of systems and the absence of philosophical speculation stuns most critics, who have no idea what to make of this unusual manner of thinking and writing, in a cultural environment mostly dominated by belletristic writing or academic exegesis. The Romanian public came to know his personality only after 1989, when several interviews of Ţuţea, who was 89 years old were broadcast on TV and gained the admiration of a broad audience.

The subsequent publication of a collection of aphorisms gathered from interviews became a best seller, while his major writings are still not very well known or appreciated, although Ţuţea was always surrounded by friends who typed and multiplied his manuscripts. Neighbours usually called him "Professor", because he always seemed to lecture, but as he ironically pointed out, his legendary tenured "chair" was under the blue sky, in the campus of Cişmigiu - a central park in Bucharest, very close to his studio apartment. Several of his close friends and companions such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Petre Pandrea]], later [[Marcel Petrişor]], [[Aurel-Dragoş Munteanu]] and from the younger generation [[Radu Preda]] and [[Alexandru Popescu (philosopher)|Alexandru Popescu]] are also accomplished philosophers, writers and scholars.

[[Alexandru Dragomir]] is a late discovery of the Romanian public, actively promoted by the Humanitas Publishing House (led by Gabriel Liiceanu), which edited some of his notebooks. Dragomir, a former doctoral student of [[Heidegger]], was a reticent man who wrote secretly and never intended to publish anything. In his old days he began giving private seminaries, which he carried on until his death; only a very narrow group of intellectuals attended. After he died several loosely thematic notebooks were found, proving that Dragomir was a phenomenologist of great class. Among these manuscripts, whose publication is not finished, there are several with reflections on time, which form the most consistent part of his thought. The influence of Dragomir on Romanian philosophy is still developing. ''[[Studia Phaenomenologica]]'' dedicated one of its issues to him.

===== The School of Paltinis =====
[[Constantin Noica]] was in a continuous search for the gifted young philosophers, which he discovered and trained. Among these (at that time) young men, there are several which have manifested themselves in the philosophical and literary, or rather literary-philosophical Romanian environment. Such are [[Gabriel Liiceanu]] (b. 1942), [[Andrei Pleşu]] (b. 1948), [[Sorin Vieru]] (b. 1933), [[Andrei Cornea]] (b. 1952), [[Vasile Dem. Zamfirescu]], [[Alexandru Surdu]] (b. 1938) and [[Corneliu Mircea]].

Gabriel Liiceanu grew to prominence after he published ''The Păltiniş Diary'', where he described his paideic adventure under Noica's guidance. It was also the book that transformed Noica into a sort of philosophical star. The ''Diary'' is perhaps the most influent Romanian philosophical publication of the late 1980s, initiating a fascination of younger generations with Păltiniş, and encouraging the study ancient Greek, Latin and German as prerequisites for the serious study of philosophy. Liiceanu's own philosophical project initially centered around the idea of "limit", and he therefore called his hermeneutic inquiry into the nature and history of this concept "peratology" (from the Greek ''peras'' = limit). This program initiated with ''The Tragic. A Phenomenology of Limit and Overcoming'', his PhD thesis, where he lays much accent on [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and accomplished with ''On Limit'', the final and more general expression of his peratology. ''On Limit'' touches on various topics such as of liberty, destiny, responsibility, encounter with the other, in a framework basically [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]]. Liiceanu also accomplished the translation of Heidegger into Romanian.

Andrei Pleşu was first known as an art historian, but also as a subtle philosopher. He avows being more interested in the "light" side of philosophy, as he had a "respectful antipathy" towards Aristotle, and considered that he had absolutely no use for Hegel. He oriented himself toward ethics and the philosophy of religion. His focal idea is that of the "interval", the in-between of existence, as a space of itinerancy. Plesu wrote one of the very few Romanian treatises of ethics, ''Minima Moralia'', which is subtitled "an ethics of the interval". It begins by affirming that only the man in the condition of itinerancy has moral competence, needing to make choices at every step of the way. Thus, true ethics is not a major one of the great problems and puzzles, but a minor ethics of the quotidian life and of ordinary situations. Further on, he explored the theme of the interval in his ''On Angels'', a book of angelology, arising at the intersection between metaphysics and the philosophy of religion. In this book, the entities called angels are analysed as a cases of "beings of the interval". The entire exercise has thus the secondary value of ontology of the interval.

Sorin Vieru is one of the few Păltiniş logicians. He established his reputation by his researches on the classical syllogistic, which he axiomatised. He was also a specialist in [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], from whom he translated abundantly. His interests covered also Greek philosophy, mostly Plato's political philosophy. He translated several of Plato's most difficult dialogues. Finally, he published an essay on ''The Risk of Thinking'', in collaboration with the mathematician Uther Morgenstern, alias Terente Robert.

Andrei Cornea is a specialist in the ancient Greek philosophy and also a political thinker. During the communist regime he published little in the domain of philosophy, but he translated Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. After 1989 he published intensively. Thus, we can cite his interpretation to Plato from ''Plato. Philosophy and Censorship'', his interesting rehabilitation of the points of view sophistically rejected by Plato's [[Socrates]] from ''When Socrates is not Right'', or his proposing of replacing the concept of utopia with that of ek-topia, as opposed to en-topia, in ''From the School of Athens to the School of Paltinis''. But perhaps his most important contribution is the valuable critique of contemporary relativism from ''The Khazar Tournament''. He translated Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and a great part of [[Plotinus]]'s ''[[Enneads]]''.

Vasile Dem. Zamfirescu's main interests are in [[psychoanalysis]]. Therefore, his philosophy bears the marks of these interests. He wrote a book on ''The Logic of the Heart and the Logic of the Mind'', well liked by Noica, and after 1989 he published his ''Philosophy of the Unconscious'' (2 volumes), exploring the philosophical potential of the psychoanalytical idea of unconscious.

Alexandru Surdu was one of the earliest collaborators on Noica, but in a great measure independent. He specialised initially in logic, publishing books on ''Intuitionism'' and ''Intuitionist logic''. He also studied the Aristotelian logic, thus arriving to his ''The Theory of Pre-judicative Forms'', a rethinking of the categories with the means of formal logic. After 1989 he published on the Romanian philosophy and speculative philosophy. Notable volumes are ''The Pentamorphosis of the Art'' and ''The Speculative Philosophy''. Alexandru Surdu is, like Noica, an anti-Hegelian Hegelian. Thus, he criticises Hegel for his "absolutisation" of triadic dialectics, he criticises also Noica for absolutising the tetradic dialectics, while proposing his version of a pentadic dialectics. He maintains, though, that diverse experiential realms are to be investigated by diverse dialectics, binary, triadic, tetradic or pentadic. His philosophy continues the long-time discredited epistemology of the faculties, which he complicates by speaking of five faculties of thinking. Thus, we have: intellect, rational intellect, reason, speculative reason, and speculation. The categories of the systematic philosophy, as determined by Surdu, are also five: Transcendence/Subsistence, Being, Existence, Real Existence, and Reality. Surdu was one of the translators of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' into Romanian and he translated also from Kant.

Corneliu Mircea is a psychiatrist and also a philosopher, encouraged by Noica, but not actually one of his disciples. Still, his interests, themes, and style, places him in the Păltiniş circle, where he paid visits regularly. He published quite consistently. During communism he gave, among other publications, ''The Book of Being'', ''Being and Consciousness'', ''Discourse on Being'', and after 1989 he published (among other things) ''The Originary'', ''Being and Ek-stasis'', ''The Making. A Treatise on Being''. Influenced by Hegel and by [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], his philosophy is an inquiry into the meaning of being, commencing with nothingness, in an attempt of rethinking both Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic|Logic]]'' and Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''. He cultivates a deliberate literary expression, maintaining that the philosophical discourse must have two sides, one conceptually objective, the other subjective, aesthetic, persuasive. Lately, Corneliu Mircea seems close to some form of mystical philosophy.

=====The Epistemological School of Bucharest =====
Following the examples of [[Anton Dumitriu]], [[Grigore Moisil]] or [[Octav Onicescu]], several teachers at the University of Bucharest oriented themselves toward epistemology and the philosophy of science, which due to its technical nature lacked ideological control and interference. After the demise of the communism, they continued their preoccupations, but also wrote on many other subjects. The protagonists of this school were [[Mircea Flonta]] (b. 1932), [[Ilie Parvu]] (b. 1941), [[Vasile Tonoiu]] (b. 1941), and [[Marin Turlea]] (b. 1940).

Mircea Flonta wrote a valuable monograph on the theme of the analytic/synthetic distinction in contemporary philosophy, and a study on the ''Philosophical Presuppositions of the Exact Sciences''. He can be considered the first analytical philosopher in Romania, understanding philosophy as a critical study of presuppositions. His activity continued after 1989 and diversified, as he approached such themes as the perception of philosophy in the Romanian culture. Among his perennial interests are the philosophy of Kant (he translated from Kant and wrote a book on him) and that of Wittgenstein (likewise, he translated several of his books and published a book on his philosophy).

Ilie Parvu is an epistemologist, philosopher of science, metaphysician and interpreter of Kant. His ''Introduction to Epistemology'' was the first book of this kind who had a European level, after the period in which the only epistemology was the Marxist–Leninist "gnoseology". It is still the best autochthon introduction available. His studies in the philosophy of science (''The Scientific Theory'', ''The Semantics and the Logic of Science'') laid accent mostly on the contemporary formal instruments of analysis of the scientific theories. Parvu can be considered as belonging to the structuralist current in the philosophy of science, following J. Sneed, W. Stegmüller, C. U. Moulines, W. Balzer etc.

The structuralist analysis of theories was applied by Ilie Parvu in the domain of the reconstruction of some crucial philosophical works, like the ''Tractatus'' of Wittgenstein or the ''Critique of Pure Reason''.

As a metaphysician, Parvu published the two-volume ''The Architecture of Existence''. In the first volume he analyses the structural-generative paradigm in ontology. He conceives of an ontological theory as having an abstract-structural core, which generates its applications not by direct instantiation, but by restrictions and specialisations of this core, which evolves at the same time with the application. Professor Parvu analysed also the theories capable of furnishing decisive mediations between the structural abstraction of the nucleus and the world of [[empirical evidence]]. In the second volume he analysed the contemporary analytic metaphysics, the great ontological contemporary constructive programs, as that of Carnap or Quine, as well as diverse local metaphysics, like that of dispositions, powers, the ontologies of events, and different theories of the individual. He presented also important discussions concerning the metaontology, constructional apparatus, style and techniques in recent metaphysics.

Vasile Tonoiu was interested mostly in continental philosophy of science, translating [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[Ferdinand Gonseth|Gonseth]], [[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard]], and writing monographs on Gonseth and Bachelard. He also published a book on [[Edgar Morin|Morin]]'s epistemological vision of complexity. Another chief interest of Tonoiu's is the dialogic philosophy, or the [[philosophy of dialogue]]. He wrote also an excellent book on [[Mircea Eliade]], ''Archaic Ontologies in Actuality''.

Marin Turlea dedicated his career to the philosophy of mathematics. His work on ''The Philosophy and the [[Foundations of Mathematics]]'' traces a distinction between the foundational and the foundationist research in mathematics, i.e. between mathematicians’ own research on its foundations, and the philosophical research of the foundations of the mathematics. In this book he soundly establishes the possibilities, sphere of action and relevance of the philosophical study of mathematics. Following the lines of the program indicated in this first work, Turlea will elaborate a ''Philosophy of Mathematics'', more like a history of the philosophical problems connected with systems of mathematics, from Plato and [[Proclus]] to ''Principia Mathematica''. He analyzes the metaphysics of mathematical entities in his ''Existence and Truth in Mathematics'', and he studies [[Wittgenstein]]'s philosophy (or rather anti-philosophy) of mathematics.

===== The Marxism =====
In Romania [[Marxism]] did not produce any notable philosophers. The only Marxist philosopher of any importance born in Romania, [[Lucien Goldman]], flourished in France. Within the mass of ideologists with philosophical pretensions, several figures detach though as honest philosophers.

This is the case of [[Athanase Joja]] (1904–1972), logician and interpreter of the ancient philosophy, with contributions to Marxist "dialectical logic". He founded the Romanian Academy's Institute of Logic, where many interbellic philosophers, including Noica, were reinserted professionally.

Another Marxist figure was [[Henri Wald]] (1920–2002), whose thinking was a mixture of French [[Structuralism]] and Marxism, and who wrote also an ''Introduction to the Dialectical Logic''.

[[Ion Ianoşi]] (b. 1928) is a Marxist philosopher from a different class, closer to literature, being for many years the secretary of the literary critique section of the Union of the Writers from Romania. He published a trilogy on the aesthetical category of the sublime, a volume on ''Hegel and the Art'' and many others, among which a study of the Romanian philosophy in its relation with literature, ''Philosophy and Literature''.

==== Post-communist period ====
After the Revolution from 1989, the philosophy in Romania began rapidly to synchronize with the Western contemporary philosophy.

Thus, [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] is represented especially by two groups, one from [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], with [[Virgil Ciomoş]] and [[Ion Copoeru]] as main characters, the other from Bucharest, developed as a consequence of Liiceanu's influence. This later group includes the editors of ''[[Studia Phaenomenologica]]'', [[Cristian Ciocan (philosopher)|Cristian Ciocan]] and [[Gabriel Cercel]], and the Heideggerians like [[Catalin Cioaba]] or [[Bogdan Minca]]. Virgil Ciomoş published phenomenological interpretations of Aristotle and Kant, while Copoeru is a Husserlian scholar.

[[Post-modernism]] in Romanian philosophy has as recent notable exponents such as [[Ciprian Mihali]] and [[Bogdan Ghiu]]. Although Mihali is more interested in the phenomenological analysis of the quotidian, his thinking is deeply rooted in French post-Structuralism. Ghiu, through his translations on Deleuze and various essays spread the influence of postmodern and poststructuralist French philosophy in Romania, although it remains rather subdued, without any mature philosophers.

[[Analytic philosophy]] has developed mostly at the University of Bucharest, by such names as [[Mircea Dumitru]], [[Adrian-Paul Iliescu]], [[Adrian Miroiu]], [[Valentin Mureşan]], [[Mihail-Radu Solcan]]. Mircea Dumitru wrote on philosophical logic, the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind. Iliescu is a political philosopher (liberalism and conservatism), but also has interests in the philosophy of language, publishing a book on Wittgenstein. Adrian Miroiu published works in the fields of modal logic, philosophy of science and political philosophy. More recently, after joining the National School of Political Science and Public Administration, he has moved to other fields which are intimately related to political science, such as [[social choice theory]], rational choice theory, electoral competition, public policies and educational policies. Valentin Muresan works in the field of ethics, cultivating the philosophical commentary. He published commentaries of Plato, Aristotle, and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]. Professor Solcan contributed to the development of the philosophy of mind in Romania, publishing an introduction to the philosophy of mind form the perspective of the cognitive sciences.

A philosopher intellectually affiliated to the interbellic tradition, very close to the members of the Păltiniş school, who also attended some of Dragomir's seminars is [[Horia-Roman Patapievici]]. He was saluted by Liiceanu as a "Romanian [[Kierkegaard]]" for his first published essays, but later had to bear the unfair weight of this exaggerated remark. His most ambitious book to date is on ''The Recent Man, or What is lost when Something is won''. In this essay of cultural and political philosophy Patapievici develops a conservative critique of late modernity, of vast scope and unequal pertinence, making him however the most notable contemporary Romanian liberal-conservative thinker. More recently his thinking seems to have adopted some [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] influences.

Professor Ștefan Aloroaei from the University of Iași is a specialist in hermeneutics. The books that made his reputation are ''The Negative Reason. Historico-symbolic Scenarios'' and ''How is Philosophy in Eastern Europe Possible?''. He published also ''Our Metaphysics of All Days'', where he tries to hermeneutically investigate the ''metaphysica naturalis'' implicit in the ordinary intercourse of the commonsense with the world.

Finally, many university philosophers, mostly exponents of a continental style, continue the interbellic tradition of the Jack-of-all-trades philosophers, producing mostly works of history of the philosophy and of philosophical hermeneutics.

'''Stefano Magno''' (around 1499 – 14 October 1572) was a [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] [[chronicler]].

== Biography ==

According to [[Kenneth Setton]], Stefano Magno was born around 1499 (his father's name was Andrea) and died on 14 October 1572.&lt;ref name="Setton"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Papacy and the Levant, 1204–1571 |volume=four volumes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Sz2VYI0l1IC&amp;pg=PA329 |year= 1976–1984 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-0-87169-114-9 |page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Marios Philippides he was born in 1490 and died in 1557.{{sfn|Philippides|Hanak|2011|pp=105–106}} He was a member of the noble Venetian Magno family.

=== Cronaca Magno ===

The authorship of the [[manuscript]] often named as ''Cronaca Magno'' is attributed to Stefano Magno.{{sfn|Philippides|Hanak|2011|p=105}} This work is based on the work of [[Aeneas Sylvius]] (Pope Pius II).{{sfn|Philippides|Hanak|2011|pp=105–106}} Stefano Magno frequently quotes ''dispacci'' of [[Bartolomeo Minio]] in his chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilliland Wright|first=Diana|title=The Greek Correspondence of Bartolomeo Minio: Dispacci from Nauplion, 1479–1483 |url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4711476/i-pm-INTRODUCTION-Bartolomeo-Minio-s-letters-are-preserved|accessdate=19 January 2012|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annali Veneti e del Mondo ===

His work ''Annali Veneti e del Mondo'' is a five-volume manuscript archived in the library of the [[Museo Correr]].&lt;ref name=Setton /&gt; This manuscript is described as "one of the more important literary sources for the last two decades of fifteenth century", providing "extraordinary coverage" of events almost all over Europe and [[Levant]].&lt;ref name=Setton /&gt; It also covers the process of Islamization of [[Albanians]] and presents information about the Muslim conquest of [[Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg's]] stronghold, [[Krujë]].&lt;ref name=Setton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Islamic studies, Volume 36, Issues 1–4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?ei=9-YVT_-pLIPO4QTuzbyfAg&amp;id=w1DrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22stefano+magno%22+skanderbeg&amp;q=%22Stefano+Magno%27s+chronicle+Annali+Veneti+e+del+Mondo+contains+the+most+objective+Christian+coverage+of+Islamization+of+Albanians+%28Shqeptaret%29+and+the+historical+details+about+the+Muslim+conquest+of+George+Kastrioti-Skanderbeg%27s%22#search_anchor |accessdate= 17 January 2012 |year= 1997 |publisher=Islamic Research Institute |location=Pakistan |page=201 |quote=Stefano Magno's chronicle Annali Veneti e del Mondo contains the most objective Christian coverage of Islamization of Albanians (Shqeptaret) and the historical details about the Muslim conquest of George Kastrioti-Skanderbeg's stronghold in Akce Hisar (Kruje, Kroia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Greeks|Greek]] historian and researcher [[Constantine Sathas]] published extracts of the Venetian chronicle of Stefano Magno connected with the history of Greece (''Mnemeia Hellenikes Historias [Monuments of Greek History]''), which Kenneth Setton considers carelessly transcribed.&lt;ref name=Setton /&gt;

The '''Stolpersteine in Weingarten''' lists all [[Stolpersteine]] that have been collocated in [[Weingarten, Württemberg|Weingarten]] in the very south of [[Germany]]. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. [[Stolperschwellen]] are much larger and they usually remember a group of victims.

| '''{{SortKeyName|Joachim|Brunner|nl=1}}''' was born in 1884. He originated from [[Bad Waldsee]] in the district [[Ravensburg (district)|Ravensburg]]. In 1912 he moved to Weingarten. He was trained as an ironworker but worked as a peddler. First he travelled with a bike, later on with a moped. He came around, knew a lot of people, discussed the state of the nation and exchanged news with other citizens critical to the Nazi regime. He was accused of undermining military morale and was arrested in 1943, kept imprisoned in [[Welzheim]], deported to [[Dachau concentration camp]] in 1944 and murdered in [[Mauthausen concentration camp]] on 12 March 1945. Eight weeks later the Nazi regime perished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]]: ''[http://www.swr.de/swr2/stolpersteine/menschen/joachim-brunner-weingarten/-/id=12117596/did=13601724/nid=12117596/1u8g2m9/index.html Joachim Brunner: Unbequemer Quergänger]'', 17 June 2014, retrieved 21 February 2017 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denkort am Ravensburger Erinnerungsweg: ''[http://www.dsk-nsdoku-oberschwaben.de/fileadmin/benutzerdaten/dsk-nsdoku-oberschwaben-de/pdf/ravensburg/weingarten-joachim-brunner-kz-opfer-aus-der-arbeiterschaft-stolperstein-wilhelmstr-30.pdf Weingarten: Joachim Brunner (KZ-Opfer aus der Arbeiterschaft), Stolperstein Wilhelmstr. 30]'', retrieved 21 February 2017 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry, along with her husband George, is a strong supporter of the [[exoneration]] of [[Louis Riel]] and has been quoted on her support of the [[Private member's bill#Canada|Private member's bill]] introduced by [[Pat Martin]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aborigin.sasktelwebhosting.com/Resources/January_2011.pdf |title=Justice for Louis Riel requires exoneration |author=Eagle Feather News |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125134056/http://aborigin.sasktelwebhosting.com/Resources/January_2011.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Terry and her husband George spoke before a [[Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples|Standing Committee]] of the [[Senate of Canada]] to examine and report on the legal and political recognition of [[Metis (Canada)|Métis identity in Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/SenCommitteeBusiness/Notice.aspx?parl=41&amp;ses=1&amp;comm_id=1&amp;Language=E&amp;meeting_id=13275|title=Senate Committees Notice of Meeting|author=Parliament of Canada website|accessdate=2012-09-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515060838/http://www.parl.gc.ca/SenCommitteeBusiness/Notice.aspx?parl=41&amp;ses=1&amp;comm_id=1&amp;Language=E&amp;meeting_id=13275|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/411/APPA/49705-E.HTM|title=The Standing Senate Committee on Aboroginal Peoples Evidence|author=Parliament of Canada website |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tursunbai Bakir Uulu''' (born March 17, 1958 in Kara-Suu, [[Osh]] Oblast) is a [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] politician, former [[ombudsman]] and [[Kyrgyz presidential election, 2005|presidential]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bakiyev wins Kyrgyz presidency |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/11/world/asia/11iht-web.0711kyrgyz.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 July 2005 |accessdate=18 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is leader of the political party [[Erkin Kyrgyzstan]] (ErK).  A teacher by training, a historian, and a doctor of philosophy he is married with four children.

==Biography==
He graduated at the [[Kyrgyz National University]]'s history faculty (1982). He also studied in Ukraine. In 1989-95, he was a member of the Association of the Young Historians of Kyrgyzstan. He worked at the [[Osh State University]] in the city of Osh in Southern Kyrgyzstan as a teacher (1990–1992).

He was first elected in 1995 as a member of the legislative assembly, after he helped set up the [[Erkin Kyrgyzstan Progressive Democratic Party]] political party. In 2000 he was given a fresh mandate, and two years later was elected Kyrgyzstan's first Ombudsman. He served in the position until February 2008.

Regularly vocal in his opposition to [[Askar Akayev]], the Kyrgyz President ousted on 24 March 2005 during the [[Tulip Revolution]], Bakir Uulu called for the abolishment of the [[death penalty]], the release of [[Felix Kulov]] from prison, an end to the ban on the Islamic movement [[Hizb ut Tahrir]], and called the [[Kyrgyz parliamentary elections, 2005|2005 legislative election]] the least free and fair the nation had ever seen.

Bakir Uulu ran in July 2005 presidential elections and lost to former president [[Kurmanbek Bakiev]].

Since 2009 he is the Kyrgyz Ambassador to [[Malaysia]].

He was elected to the Kyrgyz Parliament in October 2010 as a member of the [[Ar-Namys]] party, and was sworn in as a member of parliament on November 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.24.kg/politic/2010/11/10/14729.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112155105/http://eng.24.kg/politic/2010/11/10/14729.html |archivedate=2010-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Moscow in 1892 and entered the "Moscow Workers' Union" and distributed illegal literature. Since 1895 he was active in the [[social-democratic]] circles. In 1896 he emigrated to Switzerland and organized shipments of Russian revolutionary literature and printing equipment and became an active member of [[Iskra]].

==Researching dissenters and supporting Doukhobors==
One of Bonch-Bruyevich's research interests were Russia's dissenting religious minorities ("sects"), which were usually persecuted to various extent by both the established Orthodox Church and the Tsarist government. In the late 1890s, he collaborated with Vladimir Chertkov and Leo Tolstoy,&lt;ref name=pozdnyakov&gt;O.A. Golinenko (О.А. ГОЛИНЕНКО) [http://next.feb-web.ru/feb/tolstoy/critics/nta/nta-194-.htm "Leo Tolstoy's questions to a Doukhobor" (ВОПРОСЫ Л.Н. ТОЛСТОГО ДУХОБОРУ)] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in the arrangement of the [[Doukhobor]]s' emigration to Canada in 1899. Bonch-Bruyevich sailed with the Doukhobors, and spent a year with them in Canada. During that time, he was able to record much of their orally transmitted tradition, in particular the Doukhobor "psalms" (hymns). He published them later (1909) as "The Doukhobor Book of Life" ({{lang-ru|«[[:ru:Животная книга духоборцев|Животная книга духоборцев]]»}},  ''Zhivotnaya Kniga Dukhobortsev'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukhobors.narod.ru/zhivotnaya_book/content.htm]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chri-soc.narod.ru/duhobor.htm Н.

(''The Doukhobor Book of Life'' — Complete Russian book at www.archive.org) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
Between 1903–1905 he was the head of the expedition of the Central Committee of the RSDLP (Geneva) and one of the founders of the archive. In 1905 he returned to Russia and worked in the newspaper "New Life." In 1905 he participated in the preparation for an armed uprising in [[Saint Petersburg]] and organized the underground storage of weapons.

Between 1906–1907 he was the secretary and member of the editorial board of a journal. Between 1908–1918 he led the Bolshevik publishing house "The Life and Knowledge." Since 1912 he was a member of the editorial board of the newspaper ''[[Pravda]]''. During this time he was repeatedly arrested, but did not serve a long prison sentence.

In 1917 he was a member of the executive committee of the [[Petrograd Soviet]], the interim editor of the newspaper "The Worker and Soldier" (another name for "Evening Petersburg"). He was managing the affairs of the Council of People's Commissars until October 1920.

Between December 1917 and March 1918 he was the chairman of the Committee against the pogroms and in February – March 1918 a member of the Committee for the Revolutionary Defense of Petrograd. From 1918 he was Deputy Chairman of the Board of Medical Colleges. In 1919 he was Chairman of the Committee for the construction of sanitary checkpoints at railway stations in Moscow and the Special Committee for Rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation in Moscow. Between 1918–1919 he was the head of the publishing house of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "[[Kommunist]]."

Bonch-Bruevich took an active part in the nationalization of the banks in the preparation of the Soviet government moving to Moscow in March 1918. In 1918 as Managing Director of the Council of the People's Commissars, he endorsed setting in motion the [[Red Terror]].

In 1918 he was elected a member of the Socialist Academy of Social Sciences. After Lenin's death, he did research and authored works on the history of the revolutionary movement in Russia, the history of religion and atheism, sectarianism, ethnography and literature.  In the Soviet Union, Bonch-Bruyevich was best known as the author of a canonical Soviet book about Vladimir Lenin, whom Bonch-Bruyevich served as secretary in the years immediately following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cheka: Lenin's Political Police", NY, Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Lenin's death, Bonch-Bruevich was one of the key people involved in organising the funeral. He personally opposed the mummification of Lenin's body.&lt;ref name=Tumarkin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tumarkin|first=Nina|title=Religion, Bolshevism, and the Origins of the Lenin Cult|journal=Russian Review|year=1981|volume=40|issue=1|pages=35–46|doi=10.2307/128733|jstor=128733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1920 and 1929 he was the organizer and leader of a farm that supplied its products mostly to the leaders of the Communist party and the government.

Beginning in 1933, he was the director of the State Literary Museum in Moscow. Between 1945 and 1955 he was the director of the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism, Academy of Sciences of the USSR in [[Leningrad]].

Bonch-Bruevich died on 14 July 1955. He was buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.

{{About|the History prizes|the Economics prize|Wolfson Economics Prize}}

The '''Wolfson History Prizes''' are [[literary award]]s given annually in the United Kingdom to promote and encourage standards of excellence in the writing of [[history]] for the general public.  Prizes are given annually for two or three exceptional works published during the year, with an occasional oeuvre prize (a general award for an individual's distinguished contribution to the writing of history). They are awarded and administered by the [[Wolfson Foundation]], with winning books being chosen by a panel of judges composed of eminent historians.

In order to qualify for consideration, a book must be published in the United Kingdom and the author must be a British subject at the time the award is made and normally resident in the UK.  Books should be readable and scholarly and be accessible to the lay reader. Prizes are awarded in the summer following the year of the books' publication; however, until 1987 prizes were awarded at the end of the competition year.

Established in 1972 by the Wolfson Foundation, a UK [[charitable foundation]], they were originally known as the '''Wolfson Literary Awards'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfson.org.uk/history-prize/ |title=Wolfson History Prize - The Wolfson Foundation |publisher=Wolfson.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/8037-wolfson-history-prize |title=Wolfson History Prize Winners |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Monuments Fund''' ('''WMF''') is a private, international, [[non-profit]] organization dedicated to the [[historic preservation|preservation]] of historic [[architecture]] and cultural heritage sites around the world through fieldwork, advocacy, grantmaking, education, and training.

Founded in 1965, WMF is headquartered in [[New York City|New York]], and has offices and affiliates around the world, including [[Cambodia]], [[France]], [[Peru]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. In addition to hands-on management, the affiliates identify, develop, and manage projects, negotiate local partnerships, and attract local support to complement funds provided by donors.

==Mission==

WMF describes its mission as "to preserve important historic architectural sites and works of art without regard to national boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?partner=justgivews&amp;ein=13-2571900 |title=source |publisher=GuideStar |date= |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===International Fund for Monuments (1965-1984)===

The ''International Fund for Monuments'' (IFM) was an organization created by Colonel James A. Gray (1909-1994) after his retirement from the [[U.S. Army]] in 1960. Gray had conceived of a visionary project to arrest the settlement of the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] by freezing the soil underneath, and formed the organization in 1965 as a vehicle for the implementation of this idea. Even though this project did not materialize, an opportunity arose for the young organization to participate in the conservation of the [[Rock cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches of [[Lalibela]] in [[Ethiopia]]. In 1966 Gray secured the support of philanthropist [[Lila Acheson Wallace]] (1889-1984), who offered $150,000 to the ''International Fund for Monuments'' and [[UNESCO]] for this project. The project continued until the Communist overthrow of [[Haile Selassie I]] and the subsequent expulsion of foreigners from Ethiopia. After Ethiopia, Gray's interests shifted to [[Easter Island|Easter Island (Rapa Nui)]] in [[Chile]]. Gray formed the ''Easter Island Committee'', with Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (1914–2002) as its honorary chairman. Gray arranged to have one of the monolithic human figures known as ''[[moai]]'' exhibited in the United States. With the help of anthropologist [[William Mulloy]] (1917-1978), Gray selected an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, five-ton head, which was exhibited in front of the [[Seagram Building]] in New York and in the Pan American Union building in Washington, D.C.

An important chapter for the organization started with its involvement in the broad international effort led by [[UNESCO]] for the protection of the city of [[Venice]], [[Italy]] from catastrophic flooding. After the extremely high tide of 4 November 1966, the city, including the historic [[Piazza San Marco]], was inundated for more than twenty-four hours. The ''International Fund for Monuments'' set up a ''Venice Committee'', with Professor John McAndrew (1904-1978) of [[Wellesley College]] as chairman and Gray as executive secretary. On the part of the Committee, appeals were made to the American public, and local chapters set up in American cities. This early initiative led to the formation of the independent organization Save Venice in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.savevenice.org/about/history-mission History &amp; Mission: History]". Save Venice. savevenice.org. Retrieved 21 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts helped establish a reputation for IFM. In [[Spain]], the organization formed a ''Committee for Spain'' under the leadership of American diplomat and [[United States Ambassador to Spain|U.S. Ambassador to Spain]] in 1965-67 [[Angier Biddle Duke]] (1915-1995).

At the invitation of UNESCO in the 1970s IFM became involved in architectural conservation in [[Nepal]], where the organization adopted the Mahadev temple complex in [[Gokarna, Nepal|Gokarna]], in Nepal's [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The 14th-century temple building was surveyed, rotten timbers were replaced, and the foundations were strengthened. Sculpted wooden architectural elements were painstakingly cleaned of layers of a [[motor oil]] coating that had been applied annually for protection.

[[Image:Citadelle Laferrière.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Aerial view of the Citadelle Laferrière|Aerial view of the [[Citadelle Laferrière]], in northern [[Haiti]], a conservation project of the World Monuments Fund (1985-87).]]Also at the request of UNESCO, IFM launched a project for the preservation of the [[Citadelle Laferrière]], a large mountaintop [[fortress]] near [[Milot, Haiti|Milot]], [[Haiti]]. The site was the keystone of a defensive system constructed in the early period of Haitian independence to protect the young state from French attempts to reclaim it as a  colony. Local artisans reconstructed wooden and tile roofs over the grand gallery and batteries using traditional carpentry methods, and consolidated the stone galleries of the fortress. IFM also sponsored a traveling exhibition and a film about the history of the ''Citadelle'', which was used for educational purposes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/World%20Monuments%20Fund_The%20First%20Thirty%20Years.pdf World Monuments Fund. 1996.

==Programs==
[[File:Craco0001.jpg|thumbnail|The ghost town of [[Craco]], [[Italy]], a conservation project of the World Monuments Fund (2010)]]
Through donations and matching funds, WMF has worked with local community and government partners worldwide to safeguard and conserve places of historic value for future generations. To date, WMF has worked at more than 500 sites in 91 countries, including many [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]. WMF has worked at internationally famous tourist attractions as well as lesser-known sites. Highly prominent projects are many temples at [[Angkor]], [[Cambodia]], starting in 1990, including [[Preah Khan]] and [[Phnom Bakheng]]; the [[Château de Chantilly]] in Chantilly, France; the ghost town of [[Craco]], Italy; many structures in [[Rome]], including the [[Temple of Hercules]], [[Santa Maria Antiqua]], and the [[House of Augustus]]; several sites on [[Easter Island]]; various sites at ancient [[Luxor]] in Egypt; [[Lalibela]] in Ethiopia; [[San Ignacio Miní]] in Argentina; the ancient Maya city of [[Naranjo, Guatemala]]; the [[Segovia Aqueduct]] in Segovia, Spain; as well as 25 projects in [[Venice]], Italy, over 20 years. WMF has also participated in projects in the United States, including [[Ellis Island]], [[Taos Pueblo]], [[Mesa Verde National Park]], the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society]], and many sites in [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]].

===World Monuments Watch===

Every two years WMF publishes the ''World Monuments Watch'' (formerly the ''World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites''). Since the first list was compiled in 1996, this program has drawn international attention to cultural heritage sites around the world threatened by neglect, vandalism, armed conflict, commercial development, natural disasters, and climate change. Through the ''World Monuments Watch'', WMF fosters community support for the protection of endangered sites, and attracts technical and financial support for the sites.

The sites are nominated by international and local preservation groups and professionals, including local authorities. Sites of all types, including secular and religious architecture, archaeological sites, landscapes and townscapes, and dating from all time periods, from ancient to contemporary, are eligible. An independent panel of international experts reviews and selects the sites that make up the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf Press Release: World Monuments Watch List ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521092007/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf |date=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the panelists were [[Christina Cameron]], Alfredo Conti, Pierre-André Lablaude, Jeanne Marie Teutonico, and Christopher Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/downloads/2010_Watch_Panelists_Bios.pdf |title=2010 World Monuments Watch Panelist Bios |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Initiatives===

WMF also operates a number of special initiatives that transcend individual projects at specific sites and address broader themes in heritage preservation.

[[File:WMF Future of Babylon.ogv|thumb|This video details WMF's site management plan for Babylon, a blueprint for working on the site today as well as planning for the future.]]

====Iraq's Cultural Heritage====
Following the [[Iraq War]] WMF created the ''Iraq Cultural Heritage Conservation Initiative'' to address the many threats to Iraq’s cultural heritage resulting from the occupation and from a long period of political isolation and conflict. At the ancient city of [[Babylon]] WMF has launched a program with the support of the [[United States Department of State]] to develop a comprehensive site management plan, help local officials prepare a nomination for [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] listing, and establish site boundaries for the long-term protection of the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/science/23babylon.html John Noble Wilford. "After Years of War and Abuse, New Hope for Ancient Babylon." ''New York Times'', March 22, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modernism at Risk====

In 2006, with the support of [[Knoll (company)|Knoll]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knoll.com/news/prstory.jsp?story_id=4045 |title="World Monuments Fund Responds to Modern Buildings at Risk: New Initiative Launched With Major Gift From Knoll as Program's Founding Sponsor," June 9, 2006 |publisher=Knoll.com |date=9 June 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WMF launched ''Modernism at Risk'', an advocacy and conservation program for [[Modernist architecture]]. Through this initiative, the biennial ''World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism Prize'' was established in 2008. The inaugural prize was awarded to Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten mbH for the restoration of the former [[ADGB Trade Union School]], an important [[Bauhaus]] structure in [[Bernau bei Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The 2010 prize was awarded to Bierman Henket Architecten and Wessel de Jonge Architecten for the restoration of the [[Zonnestraal (estate)|Zonnestraal Sanatorium]], an aftercare colony for tubercular patients near [[Hilversum]], in the [[Netherlands]], built in 1931. The 2012 prize was awarded to the Architectural Consortium for Hizuchi Elementary School for the restoration of Hizuchi Elementary School in Hizuchi, Yawatahama City, Ehime Prefecture, Japan.
