'''Associação Portuguesa da Cortiça''' is the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Cork (material)|Cork]] Association, a [[consortium]] of cork growers and manufacturers. It was founded in 1956 and is based in the town of Santa Maria de Lamas in northern Portugal. The current president of APCOR is [[António Rios de Amorim]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realcork.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

A current issue for the association is the decreasing support for cork as a [[bottle]] seal, as the popularity of [[plastic]] and other [[stopper (plug)|stopper]]s rises.

There is a major discussion about which closure suits [[wine]] the best. There are several reports defending the use of [[screw cap (wine)|screwcaps]], mostly coming from [[New Zealand]], but for each report defending the use of screwcaps, there is also another report defending the use of corks.

'''Abraham-Louis Perrelet''', (9 January 1729 &amp;ndash; 1826), born in [[Neuchâtel]] in Switzerland, was a Swiss [[horologist]].

His father, Daniel was a carpenter and a farmer and as soon as the young man was in a position to do some favours, he helped his parents on the farm. At the age of twenty years he gave up his modest work to learn watchmaking. After an apprenticeship of fifteen days at one named Prince, in Le Locle, who worked little and very badly, and where he learnt absolutely nothing, he started to work independently and so became his own master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Richard|title=The Origins of Self-Winding Watches, 1773 to 1779|url=http://www.watkinsr.id.au/Origins.html|accessdate=November 23, 2016}} page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-winding watch==
About the beginning of 1777, Perrelet invented a self-winding mechanism for [[automatic watch]]es. It worked on the same principle as a modern [[wristwatch]], and was designed to wind as the owner walked, using an oscillating weight inside the large watch that moved up and down.

The [[Geneva]] Society of Arts reported in 1777 that fifteen minutes walking was necessary to wind the watch sufficiently for eight days, and the following year reported that it was selling well.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Perrelet is thus widely acknowledged as the inventor of the "automatic" watch. However, his watch probably used a weight pivoting at the side of the movement. The first drawing and accurate description of an automatic watch with a central rotor was created in 1778 by the watchmaker Hubert Sarton ([[:fr:Hubert Sarton]]) and that design is attributed to him. Following the work of Perrelet, other watchmakers also created automatic watches from about 1777 on.

==Breguet==
Perrelet sold some of his watches to a contemporary watchmaking luminary, [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] around 1780, who improved upon the mechanism in his own version of the design, calling his watches "perpetuelles", the French word for perpetual.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 120.&lt;/ref&gt; They did not work reliably and Breguet stopped producing them around 1810.

==Famous grandson==
[[File:Abraham-Louis Perrelet.jpg|thumb|Louis-Frédéric Perrelet (1781–1852)]]
Louis-Frédéric Perrelet (1781–1852), a grandson of Abraham-Louis Perrelet, was trained by his grandfather and went into business in Paris. Louis-Frédéric invented marine watches with measuring instruments and a split-second precision [[chronograph]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.worldtempus.com/article/insider/perrelet-louis-frederic-perrelet Perrelet - Louis-Frédéric Perrelet, Industry News, WorldTempus]&lt;/ref&gt; He won one of three [[Lalande Prize|Lalande award]]s for 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=LES LAURÉATS DU PRIX LALANDE|journal=La Revue scientifique|volume=TOME 40|year=1887|location=Paris|pages=460–463|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=biIgAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marlès, Jean Lacroix de|chapter=M. Perrelet a remporté le prix fondé par Lalande ...|title=Les cent merveilles des sciences et des arts, 2&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; éd.|year=1852|page=113|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnwsys;view=1up;seq=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brand==
While the factory claims to have been in continuous production since the late eighteenth century, the brand has only recently begun to command attention worthy of its heritage. The brand, acquired in 2004 by Miguel Rodriguez of the [[Festina]] Group, appointed Marc Bernhardt as CEO of Perrelet in 2007, and under his direction the company released a few highly regarded watches. These included watches with retrograde, jumping hour, and double-rotor complications.

In terms of pricing, Bernhardt positioned Perrelet in the lower middle of the [[Luxury good|luxury]] market, with most of their releases priced between five and ten thousand (US) dollars. Their upper-range watches featuring costlier complications, such as [[tourbillon]]s or minute-repeaters, typically retailed in the thirty-forty thousand (US) dollar range. 

In 2009 Rodriguez appointed Fausto Salvi as CEO of Perrelet.

==Biography==
===Early and personal life===
Kiska was born in [[Poprad]]. He studied [[electrical engineering]]. His father was an active member of the ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. He also applied for Communist party membership, but was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;https://domov.sme.sk/c/7154011/podnikatel-filantrop-a-uz-aj-prezident-andrej-kiska.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiska was married to {{ill|Mária Kisková|sk}}, an educator and politician from 1985 until 2001. They had two children, Andrej Kiska (1986) and Natália Kisková (1990).&lt;ref name=ssp&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=President Kiska has a new baby son |url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20578740/president-kiska-has-a-new-baby-son.html |work=The Slovak Spectator |date=2017-07-10 |accessdate=2018-08-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117161812/http://www.pluska.sk/spravy/z-domova/prva-dama-martina-kiskova-co-odkazuje-vsetkym-neprajnikom.html |archivedate=2014-11-17 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 2001 after 18 years of marriage. 

Kiska married his second wife, [[Martina Kisková]], in 2003. The couple have three children- - Veronika (born 2005), Viktor (born 2009), and Martin (born July 2017 during his presidency).&lt;ref name=ssp/&gt;

===Career===
In 1990, after the [[Velvet Revolution]], he moved to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/331929-novym-slovenskym-prezidentem-bude-andrej-kiska.html|title=Novým slovenským prezidentem bude Andrej Kiska|date=29 March 2014|publisher=[[novinky.cz]]|language=Czech|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he founded ''Triangel'' and ''Quatro'',&lt;ref name="databazeknih"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.databazeknih.cz/zivotopis/andrej-kiska-23188 | title=Andrej Kiska - životopis | publisher=DatabazeKnih | accessdate=March 17, 2014 | language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt; two Slovakia-based [[hire-purchase]] companies that give the buyer the possibility to pay for goods in several installments over a number of months instead of paying the full price at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hire-purchase.asp | title=Hire-purchase definition | publisher=Investopedia | accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax authorities accused his co-owned company KTAG (with his brother Jaroslav) of tax non-compliance and under-payments, regarding expenses for his presidential campaign. The company eventually agreed to pay the taxes and a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;http://hnonline.sk/slovensko/1025396-kiska-sklamal-transparency-vyhovorky-mal-prijat-zodpovednost-a-ospravedlnit-sa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://domov.sme.sk/c/20647309/kiska-bol-som-presvedceny-ze-firma-kona-spravne.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax non-compliance and legal problems===

Andrej Kiska’s companies were involved in a number of tax-non compliance issues. Unproperly reported income from various business activities resulted in a smaller VAT and Income tax payments. &lt;ref&gt;https://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/441545-otazky-a-odpovede-v-com-spociva-trestna-cinnost-v-kauze-kiskovej-firmy/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nazory.pravda.sk/komentare-a-glosy/clanok/441818-kiska-bez-svatoziary/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his personal tax filing he did not disclose personal propagation before elections performed by his company as a non-cash income, but claimed that he paid for it. Eventually tax office confirmed he did not pay, did not report non-cash income, and his company did not report income from propagation activities but fully deducted all VAT. Remaining costs additionally decreased tax base.  &lt;ref&gt;https://slovensko.hnonline.sk/1025396-kiska-sklamal-transparency-vyhovorky-mal-prijat-zodpovednost-a-ospravedlnit-sa&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://domov.sme.sk/c/20649096/tlak-na-kisku-sa-stupnuje-unikli-dalsie-dokumenty.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hnonline.sk/slovensko/1025081-kisku-vysetrovala-policia-pre-vydavky-na-kampan-jeho-firma-musela-dan-doplatit&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
In 2006, Kiska co-founded a [[non-profit]] [[charitable organization]] called [[Dobrý anjel]] (translated as ''Good Angel''), in which donors help families that have found themselves in a difficult financial situation as a result of a family member contracting a serious disease (such as [[cancer]]).&lt;ref name="databazeknih" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dobryanjel.sk/viac-o-dobrom-anjelovi/ |title=Čo je systém Dobrý anjel | publisher=Dobrý anjel |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, more than 170,000 people have donated to this organization in Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dobryanjel.sk/zoznam-dobrych-anjelov/|title=Zoznam Dobrých anjelov|last=|first=|date=March 1, 2014|website=|publisher=Dobrý anjel|language=Slovak|access-date=|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Good Angel expanded their activities also to Czech Republic, where 60.000 are paying their monthly contributions in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dobryandel.cz/en/|title=DOBRÝ ANDĚL, nadace|website=DOBRÝ ANDĚL|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, Kiska donates his monthly presidential salary to people in need.

==Presidency==
In the first round of the [[Slovak presidential election, 2014]], Kiska placed second with 24% of the vote, behind Prime Minister [[Robert Fico]] (28%). As none of candidates got more than 50% of votes, Kiska and Fico progressed to a presidential runoff vote on 29 March 2014. With the support of right-wing parties and other defeated candidates, Kiska won decisively in the second round, receiving nearly 60% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/slovakia/10732435/Millionaire-Andrej-Kiska-elected-first-Slovak-president-with-no-communist-past.html "Millionaire Andrej Kiska elected first Slovak president with no communist past"], ''[[Telegraph Online]]'', 30 March 2014, accessed 30 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He took office on 15 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/andrej-kiska-inaugurated-as-slovakian-president_341202.html|title=Andrej Kiska inaugurated as Slovakian president|date=15 June 2014|publisher=Europe Online Magazine|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiska announced on 15 May 2018 that he will not participate in [[Slovak presidential election, 2019|2019 presidential election]], arguing that this move might end "the era of political confrontation" his country faced and citing a desire to spend more time with his family.&lt;ref name="Kiska nebude kandidovať na prezidenta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiska nebude kandidovať na prezidenta|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20826159/andrej-kiska-prezidentske-volby-2019-oznamenie.html?ref=st-bno-1|website=domov.sme.sk|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-15/eu-to-lose-key-ally-in-slovakia-as-president-won-t-seek-new-term|title=EU to Lose Key Ally in Slovakia as President Won't Seek New Term|date=2018-05-15|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Kiska made the announcement, polls indicated that he was Slovakia's most trusted politician and that he would have likely been the frontrunner in the election had he chosen to present himself as a candidate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Foreign policy==
Kiska supports [[Kosovo independence]] and is in favour of Slovakia diplomatically [[International recognition of Kosovo|recognising]] [[Kosovo]] as an independent sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=30&amp;nav_category=78&amp;nav_id=830326|title=Milioner na čelu Slovačke|date=2014-03-30|accessdate=2014-03-31|publisher=[[B92]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article126354035/Parteiloser-Millionaer-wird-slowakischer-Praesident.html|title=Parteiloser Millionär wird slowakischer Präsident|accessdate=2014-03-31|publisher=[[Die Welt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Graham received his early education in the investment business working during summer holidays at his father's brokerage firm Oswald, Drinkwater and Graham Ltd.

In 1976, he joined Wood Gundy Ltd&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cibc.com/en/private-wealth-management/about-us.html?utrc=S190:33&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4740!3!195629735239!e!!g!!wood%20gundy&amp;ef_id=WUmF7gAAAHyWEzT7:20170802210519:s#wood-gundy|title=About Us {{!}} CIBC Private Wealth Management|website=www.cibc.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;., becoming one of the youngest stockbrokers in Canada.

==History==
The company was founded in 1935 by Sarkis Arapian, an [[Armenians|Armenian]] refugee who escaped his native [[Kayseri]] during the [[Asia Minor Catastrophe]].&lt;ref name=Athensnews /&gt;&lt;ref name=pappa /&gt;&lt;ref name =tanea/&gt;&lt;ref name=athinorama&gt;{{cite news|title=The Shop Αραπιάν: Αλλαντικά με ιστορία|url=http://www.athinorama.gr/umami/food/editorschoice/?edtId=11791|accessdate=25 February 2013|newspaper=Athinorama|quote=Πρόκειται για ένα χώρο 75 ετών. ιδρύθηκε το 1935 από τον Σαρκίς Αραπιάν, ο οποίος έφερε μαζί του από την ''Καισαρεία'' τις αγαπημένες του γεύσεις.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually managed to settle in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] and opened a [[pastourma]] and [[Sujuk|soutzouki]] charcuterie on 41 Euripidou Street. In 1965, Sarkis Arapian appointed Dimitris Theodoropoulos as his business partner. The shop is currently in its third generation of management, as it remains in the hands of the Theodoropoulos family, which is now managed by Dimitris's son Fanis.&lt;ref name=Athensnews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Company|url=http://www.arapian.gr/main/index.php/about/|publisher=Arapian Official Website|accessdate=7 February 2013|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the shop is currently 15 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Athensnews /&gt;

Under the management of Fanis Theodoropoulos, the company has moved its production facilities in [[Prosotsani]], [[Drama (regional unit)|Drama]] beneath the [[Falakro]] mountains in order to be surrounded by a more natural environment.&lt;ref name=Companies /&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Kathimerini]]'', Fanis Theodoropoulos mentions that he tries to design new products for the younger generation and also introduce them to the traditional products that their parents consumed.&lt;ref name =kathimerini3&gt;[http://news.kathimerini.gr/4Dcgi/4Dcgi/_w_articles_ell_3_27/11/2010_424045  Ταξίδι στο παρελθόν μέσα από τις μυρωδιές της Ευριπίδου] Του Αποστολου Λακασα {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''I Kathimerini'' praises Arapian for the quality products and good service. The paper describes the company's produce as excellent snacks for connoisseurs and also mentions that Arapian uses no preservatives for its products.&lt;ref name=kathimerini&gt;[https://archive.is/20130412220231/http://portal.kathimerini.gr/4Dcgi/4dcgi/_w_articles_oiko1_1_13/10/2009_301997  Kathimerini] ''Γεύσεις για μερακλήδες'' Mουστάρδα από τη Σκωτία, κονφί από τη Γαλλία και μια αγκαλιά νοστιμιές από την Ελλάδα για τους φίλους των εκλεκτών προϊόντων ΤΟΥ ΑΓΓΕΛΟΥ ΡΕΝΤΟΥΛΑ, ΦΩΤΟΓΡΑΦΙΕΣ: ΑΚΗΣ ΟΡΦΑΝΙΔΗΣ {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Christmas article from the paper titled "The ritual of pastourmas" mentions that Arapian's pastourma is a [[sine qua non]] for a Christmas table and that the annual "pilgrimage" to the store is on their agenda, remarking on Arapian's old-recipe pastourma, cut in thin, almost transparent slices with or without fat.&lt;ref name=Kathimerini2&gt;

''[[Lifo (magazine)|Lifo]]'' magazine praises the quality of the Arapian products and the care for selecting the ingredients and meat which come from various locations in Greece. The variety and flavour of the products is also praised as "reminiscent of another era" which are guaranteed to please the consumer.&lt;ref name=Lifomagazine&gt;[http://www.lifo.gr/market/marketnews/13594 Lifo magazine] 17.7.2012 12:41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lifo'' marks out both Arapian and Miran Pastourma as the market's best sources for such speciality meats.&lt;ref name=Lifomagazine2&gt;[http://www.lifo.gr/mag/features/1802 Βαρβάκειος Αγορά Το στομάχι της πόλης]  Η ΓΕΥΣΗ ΤΗΣ ΑΘΗΝΑΣ 17.7.2012 12:41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lifo'''s Νiki Mitarea calls green-[[pea soup]] with Arapian's sausage and [[fried egg]], served at restaurants in Athens, a "classic dish".&lt;ref name=Lifo2&gt;[http://www.lifo.gr/week/taste_review/481  Trapezaria Κριτική Γεύσης Από τη Νίκη Μηταρέα] Ξεχωριστές ελληνικές νοστιμιές για μερακλήδες με γούστο και άποψη.&lt;/ref&gt; Gastronomos online calls the same dish a "tasty dynamite for gourmets".&lt;ref name=Gastronomos2&gt;[http://www.gastronomos.gr/estiatoria/2322/Trapezaria Gastronomos online] {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article by ''[[Athens Voice]]'', Arapian is famous for its Eastern delicacies. The article finds the aged cheese of Xanthi, sold at Arapian's, to be at the top of the taste scale and makes similar evaluations for the pastourma, goat sausage, soutzouki and kavourma. It is also mentioned that Fanis Theodoropoulos provides his customers with gourmet-related advice.&lt;ref name =kathimerini3/&gt;&lt;ref name=AthensVoice&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110515202852/http://www.athensvoice.gr/the-paper/article/346/taste-voice-%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B9-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%84%CF%8C-trend-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B6%CF%8C%CE%BD  Αραπιάν με τ’ όνομα!

Arapian's ''louza'' or ''loutza'', a kind of sausage made of pork [[sirloin]] found in the [[Cyclades]] and also [[Cyprus]], and ''apaki'' smoked sausage made of pork [[marinated]] in [[vinegar]] and a traditional [[Cretan]] sausage, are on the list of recommended products by ''Kathimerini''.&lt;ref name=Kathimerini4&gt;[https://archive.is/20130412222655/http://trans.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_qsite7_1_03/12/2009_311354  Μανιτάρια πορτομπέλο φουρνιστά με σπανάκι, λούτζα και τυρί Από τη Μυρσίνη Λαμπράκη]  Επιμέλεια - food styling: Τίνα Webb, Styling: Alice Bean Bοηθός food stylist: Αλεξάνδρα Τασουνίδου, Φωτογραφίες: Γιώργος Δρακόπουλος Kathimerini {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2878">'''Sir Bernard Oppenheimer, 1st Baronet''' (13 February 1866 – 13 June 1921) was a [[South Africa]]n-[[United Kingdom|British]] [[diamond]] merchant and [[philanthropist]].

Oppenheimer was chairman of Pniel's Ltd, the New [[Vaal River]] Diamond &amp; Exploration Company, and Blaauwbosch Diamonds Ltd, and [[managing director]] of Lewis &amp; Marks Ltd of [[Holborn]]. His brother, [[Ernest Oppenheimer|Sir Ernest Oppenheimer]], was also heavily involved in the diamond industry.

In July 1917, Oppenheimer established a scheme for training disabled soldiers in [[diamond cutting]] at [[Brighton]], [[England]]. The Bernard Oppenheimer Diamond Works (National Diamond Factories Ltd) opened on Lewes Road/Coombe Road (north side) on 17 May 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''Brighton Gazette'', 18 May 1918&lt;/ref&gt; It was mainly paid for by Oppenheimer himself and by Lewis &amp; Marks. In 1920 it also opened branches in [[Cambridge]], [[Wrexham]] and [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]]. By 1921 the works, including a second building on the opposite side of Coombe Road, employed about 2,000 men who were referred to it by the [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour]]. New men received six months training, during which they were paid a maintenance allowance by the government, and were then virtually guaranteed employment at a good wage. The factory had a well-equipped [[clinic]] to provide ongoing care for the employees, many of whom were [[amputee]]s or otherwise severely disabled. The business did not do well and closed in 1923, but reopened later the same year. It finally went into [[receivership]] in 1924.

For his work with the disabled, Oppenheimer was created a [[baronet]] in the 1921 New Year Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32178|supp=y|page=2|date=31 December 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died suddenly six months later at the age of 55.

A single jurisdiction often requires multiple licenses that are issued by multiple government departments and agencies. Business licenses vary between countries, states, and local municipalities. There are often many licenses, registrations and certifications required to conduct a business in a single location.

Typically, a company's business activity and physical location (address) determines which licenses are required to operate lawfully. Other determining factors may include the number of employees and the [[business#Basic forms of ownership|form of business ownership]], such as sole proprietor or corporation. Government agencies can fine or close a business operating without the required business licenses.

==Licensing and business registration requirements==
===United States===
In the United States, the [[Small Business Administration]] has a list of links to State websites for State licensing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/hotlist/license.html SBA: Where to Obtain Business Licenses] Accessed 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Each State has its own business registration and licensing requirements. [[Business.usa.gov]] is an official business link to the U.S. Government. Business.gov, managed by the U.S. Small Business Administration.

====Example: Washington, D.C.====
In [[Washington, D.C.]]
::The '''Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs''' (DCRA) is the District of Columbia's regulatory agency. DCRA ensures the health, safety, and economic welfare of District residents through licensing, inspection, compliance, and enforcement programs. In addition, '''Department of Health''' (DOH) issues certain professional licenses, '''[[District of Columbia Department of Transportation|District Department of Transportation]]''' (DDOT) regulates public space, and '''Office of Zoning''' (DCOZ) controls land use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brc.dc.gov/licenses/licenses.asp Washington, D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs - Licenses and Permits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404044839/http://brc.dc.gov/licenses/licenses.asp |date=April 4, 2007 }} Accessed 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most individuals and companies doing business in the District of Columbia must obtain a Basic Business License from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mblr.dc.gov/ Washington, D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs - Basic Business License Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401143835/http://mblr.dc.gov/ |date=April 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, organizations (including non-profits and cooperatives, but not including sole-proprietorships and general partnerships) must register their business. Many types of businesses require additional certification or permits beyond the Basic Business License and registration. D.C. requires a "Clean Hands Self-Certification" from most applicants, which is an affidavit stating that the applicant does not owe more than $100 to the District. Tour Guides must submit a Physician's Certificate. Fees for businesses licenses vary. The fee for a Special Event license such as a marathon is $209. The license for a movie theater costs $1,079 per year, for a grocery store $289 per year, for a beauty shop $78 per year. (2003 schedule of fees, current as of March 2007) A Project Management Firm does not require a Basic Business License, nor does a Handyman. Residential House Painters must submit a Home Improvement Contract signed by the homeowner.

Physicians and other health care professionals require licenses from the Professional Licensing Administration in the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpla.doh.dc.gov/hpla/cwp/view,a,1195,q,488169,hplaNav, |30661|,.asp Washington, D.C. Health Professional Licensing Administration: Professional Licensing Boards]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example: Pennsylvania====
Pennsylvania allows online registration of small business start-ups, but does not provide licensing guidance.
::The Pennsylvania Open for Business Online Business Registration Interview (OBRI) is a step-by-step wizard that guides users through the process of registering an enterprise with the Departments of Labor &amp; Industry, Revenue, and State. 
::The OBRI is a business registration tool and is not intended to be a replacement for professional consultation with qualified practitioners.  The laws and regulations governing business start-up, practice, and expansion are varied and compliance with such standards depends upon the particular circumstances of a business.  If legal advice or other expert assistance is required, the services of a competent professional should be sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sohanroy.com Pennsylvania Online Business Registration Interview] Accessed 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Certain actions are required by all businesses in Pennsylvania in order for them to continue in business in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paopen4businessbriefcase.state.pa.us/tax/default.asp?LN=380&amp;LG=41 Pennsylvania - Forms for all Businesses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513050047/http://www.paopen4businessbriefcase.state.pa.us/tax/default.asp?LN=380&amp;LG=41 |date=May 13, 2007 }} Accessed 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes New Hire Reporting (including reporting oneself as a new hire when starting a business).

Higgins]] on 23 December 2014 to regulate [[company|companies]] under [[law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]]. It was a [[consolidation bill|consolidating]] and reforming piece of legislation, incorporating many of the provisions of the previous Companies Act 1963–2012 listed below.

==Previous Companies Acts==
To facilitate easy [[citation]] of the entire body of law affecting companies, each of the acts prior to 2005 includes a collective citation section which enables them to be collectively cited as "The Companies Acts 1963 - [year of current enactment]". The Interpretation Act, 2005 provided that the Companies Acts 1963 to 2001 may be referred to as "The Companies Acts". Legislation enacted subsequent to the Interpretation Act, 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0023/print.html#sched-partii Interpretation Act, 2005] Retrieved 2011-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; includes a section providing that "the Companies Acts and this Act shall be read as one" (e.g. Section 11 of The Companies (Amendment) Act 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0020/sec0011.html#sec11 Section 11 of The Companies (Amendment) Act 2009] Retrieved 2011-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;). Therefore, it was then appropriate to cite the entire body of legislation in Ireland affecting companies as "The Companies Acts".

In business dealings, [[Financial transaction|transactions]] often occur that include variables based on future events that can be difficult to ascertain (for example, a company may sell in an amount stock along with a percentage of that company’s net profits.)  As these transactions are contingent on payments that occur in the future, and the total selling price cannot be determined as of the end of the taxable year of the sale, they are known as '''Contingent Payment Sales'''.&lt;ref&gt;See Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 734 (2nd. Ed. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the uncertainty surrounding the final amounts of these transactions, they are difficult to evaluate for the purpose of tax liability.

== Methods of computing tax liability for contingent sales ==

===Maximum Selling Price===
If the maximum  amount of sales can be determined in the year in which they occur by assuming that all contingencies are met, the price can be calculated in a manner similar to the installment sales method.  If the amount is reduced in subsequent years, than the formula is recomputed accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg §15.A453-1(c)(2)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed Period===
If the maximum selling price cannot be determined, but the period over which payments may be received is fixed, then the seller’s basis is recovered ratably over the period during which payment may be received under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg. §15.A453-1(c)(3)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the agreement neither specifies a stated maximum price nor limits payments to a fixed period, than a question arises as to whether a sale has realistically occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg. §15.A453-1(c)(4)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example in Finance ==

===General Mills Acquisition Case===

====Origin of the Transaction====
Seeking to build growth [[momentum]], [[General Mills]] studied areas of potential growth and value creation in the spring of 1998. This had generated some smaller acquisitions and a general receptivity to acquisition proposals by the firm. In early 2000, the firm’s financial advisers suggested that Diageo might be interested in selling Pillsbury, in an effort to focus Diageo on its beverage business, and that Pillsbury would complement General Mills’ existing businesses.

In March 2000, Diageo’s chief operating officer contacted General Mills’ chairman and CEO to explore a possible sale of Pillsbury. General Mills submitted its proposed deal terms to Diageo in June 2000—the total proposed payment was $10.0 billion. Diageo submitted an [[asking price]] of $10.5 billion. The two sides would budge no further, and it looked as if the negotiations would
founder. General Mills did not want to issue more than one-third of its post-transaction shares to Diageo, and believed that its shares were undervalued in the stock market. Diageo believed it was necessary to value General Mills’ shares at the current trading prices. In an effort to bridge the difference in positions, the two firms agreed upon including in the terms of the deal a '''contingent payment''' on the first anniversary of the transaction that would depend on General Mills’ share price. James Lawrence, chief financial officer of General Mills, said, “We genuinely believe this is a way in which they could have their [[cake]] and we could eat it, too. There’s no question in my mind that, absent this [[Instrumentation (music)|instrument]], we wouldn’t have been able to reach this deal.”

David Van Benschoten, General Mills’ treasurer, added that the contingent payment was another example of the “development of the use of [options] in the past 20 years as finance has come to first understand, and work with, the constructs of optionality.”

==History==
In 1959, the family of [[Hugh Roy Cullen]], an oil businessperson and philanthropist who was recently deceased, announced that they would build a skyscraper complex in Downtown Houston. To the surprise of everyone the family planned for the {{convert|12|acre|ha}}, 5½ city block site to accommodate several sites. The first two buildings were to be a 500-room, 15-18 story hotel and a 25-story office building. Next, a 40-45 story office building was to be completed. Other buildings were planned to be added at later times. Gerald E. Veitmann, president of the Cullen Center, said that it was going to be "a memorium to Mr. and Mrs. Cullen, an investment in excess of 100 million dollars," and "to Houston what [[Rockefeller Center]] is to [[New York City]]." Work for clearing the land was scheduled to begin in December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=85392791 Cullen Family Plans Skyscraper Center]."

Veltmann, the president of Cullen Center, Inc. said that the development "represents a marked departure from the traditional downtown scene and colors" because the development "centers around a planning concept with four separate levels structures: sub surface, used for parking and mechanical equipment; surface, used for vehicular traffic, parking, entrance lobbies, and service entrances, a second level, used for pedestrian-oriented facilities such as main lobbies, shops, displays, galleries, lounges, and restaurants; and the top space, into which will rise the main towers containing hotel rooms and offices."&lt;ref name="CSMonitortrad"&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/200601872.html?dids=200601872:200601872&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Jul+05%2C+1963&amp;author=Special+to+The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Traditions+Shattered+by+Houston's+Cullen+Center&amp;pqatl=google Traditions Shattered by Houston's Cullen Center]." ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.  July 5, 1963. Real Estate Start Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the building design separated the pedestrian and vehicular traffic from one another. The first levels were to have open plazas. The developer planned to establish air-conditioned bridges connecting the buildings at their second levels. The architect, Welton Becket of FAIA, said that the two original buildings were "esthetically related through the use of a common material—concrete—in a variety of forms—physically related by the second-level pedestrian bridges, and visually related around open plaza parking areas and a common exposed aggregate sidewalk roads."&lt;ref name="CSMonitortrad"/&gt;

The ''' Demarest building ''' is a multi-purpose commercial building located at 339 [[Fifth Avenue]] in the borough of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] (United States). It was built by [[Aaron T. Demarest]] in 1890 in the downtown commerce district to showcase the high-end carriages that he manufactured. The building is notable for being the first with an electric elevator.

== Description ==
The Demarest building is situated on the northeast corner at Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street. It was designed by [[James Renwick, Jr.|Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Russell]].&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; The building, with the first electric elevator,&lt;ref name=LasCruces&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Demarest Building |url= |newspaper= Las Cruces Sun-News |location= page 11 |date= 18 September 1972 |access-date= |quote= The Otis brothers installed the first electric elevator in New York's Demarest Building in 1889. }} &lt;/ref&gt; was on Fifth Avenue directly across the street from [[William Waldorf Astor]]’s mansion, where the [[Waldorf–Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf–Astoria]] hotels were built later. The Demarest building housed the high-end carriage manufacturer A. T. Demarest &amp; Company. There were three mansion houses of [[brownstone]] construction previously at this location, with the addresses of 335, 337, and 339 Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref name=Daytonian&gt; {{cite web |url=http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-1890-demarest-building-nos-335-339.html |title=The 1890 Demarest Building -- Nos. 335-339 5th Avenue |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Daytonian in Manhattan |access-date= December 23, 2015 |quote=The Demarest Building could boast having the world’s first electric-operated elevator.

The iron-framed building, built by [[Aaron T. Demarest]], is four stories high and originally had a stone-clad base.{{sfn|Kane|1997|p=97}} The exterior brick is buff-colored and has [[terra cotta]] [[medallion]]s and panels that accent the [[façade]]. The three-story arched openings are separated by brick [[pilaster]]s on the front of the building. The architects designed these arches with windows so the interior's showrooms were illuminated with plenty of light. The original two-story windows were cast metal bays built within the building's front arches.&lt;ref name=Daytonian/&gt; This [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style building with large arches is said to resemble [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/realestate/03scap.html?_r=0 |title=Echoes of Carnegie Hall on Fifth Avenue |first1=Christopher |last1=Gray |date=August 3, 2008 |accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:LaGrecque underware.jpg|thumb|100px]]
In 1893 the Demarest building caught fire which destroyed many of the carriages. The Hotel Waldorf was across the street and the guests were awakened by the noise of the fire engines. They watched as the fire ravaged the building and its contents. At the time there were over 200 high-end carriages in the building valued at $150,000. The fire totally destroyed twenty carriages in the repair shop and damaged the others throughout the building to one degree or another. The fire was fueled by the seasoned wood, paints, oils, and varnishes used in production. The fire was not extinguished until almost 6 A.M.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coachbuilt&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/d/demarest/demarest.htm|title= A.T. Demarest|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website=COACHBUILT |publisher= Coachbuilt.com, Inc |access-date=December 23, 2015 |quote=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008185436/http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/d/demarest/demarest.htm|archivedate=8 October 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Demarest building was later converted to offices and work areas for small manufacturers. In 1913 Dr. [[Friedrich Franz Friedmann]], who claimed to have a cure for [[tuberculosis]], set up a medical practice on the second floor. The building's leasing agent would not allow the doctor to treat patients there and he ultimately moved to another location.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daytonian/&gt;

Teitelbaum &amp; De Marinis had a business on the third floor from 1911 to 1914 producing high-end [[headwear]]. From 1917, the ground floor space was used by the Harris Store to sell high-end men's clothing. The firm of Flapper Coats moved into the building in 1919. Going into the 1920s much of the building's space was used by apparel firms like La Grecque Underwear Company. However Allied Steel and Supply Company did have offices there at the time. The hat manufacturer Hirschberg &amp; Company was located in the building as was the decorative glassware company E. &amp; J. Bass, Inc.&lt;ref name=Daytonian/&gt;

As of 2015, there were plans for developer Pi Capital Partners to replace the building and neighboring structures with a new residential tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/02/first-look-339-fifth-avenue.html | title=First Look: 339 Fifth Avenue | publisher=NEW YORK YIMBY | accessdate=8 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008185814/http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/02/first-look-339-fifth-avenue.html |archivedate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Energy Management Software''' ('''EMS''') is a general term and category referring to a variety of energy-related software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications which may provide utility bill tracking, real-time metering, building HVAC and lighting control systems, building simulation and modeling, carbon and sustainability reporting, IT equipment management, [[demand response]], and/or energy audits. Managing energy can require a system of systems approach.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2012. [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/Curry_LinkedDataspaceForSOS_SOSE.pdf “System of Systems Information Interoperability Using a Linked Dataspace.”] In IEEE 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE 2012), 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy management software often provides tools for reducing energy costs and consumption for buildings or communities. EMS collects energy data and uses it for three main purposes: Reporting, Monitoring and Engagement. Reporting may include verification of energy data, benchmarking, and setting high-level energy use reduction targets. Monitoring may include trend analysis and tracking [[energy consumption]] to identify cost-saving opportunities. Engagement can mean real-time responses (automated or manual), or the initiation of a dialogue between occupants and building managers to promote [[energy conservation]]. One engagement method that has recently gained popularity is the real-time energy consumption display available in web applications or an onsite energy dashboard/display.

==Data collection==
Energy Management Software collects historic and/or [[real-time data|real-time]] [[interval data]], with intervals varying from quarterly billing statements to minute-by-minute [[smart meter]] readings. The data are collected from interval meters, [[Building automation|Building Automation Systems (BAS)]], directly from utilities, directly from sensors on electrical circuits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SiteSage EMS architecture|url=https://powerhousedynamics.com/solutions/sitesage/#architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other sources. Past bills can be used to provide a comparison between pre- and post-EMS energy consumption.

Electricity and Natural Gas are the most common utilities measured, though systems may monitor steam, petroleum or other energy uses, water use, and even locally generated energy. Renewable energy sources have contributed to the spurred growth in EMS data collection markets.

==Reporting==
Reporting tools are targeted at owners and executives who want to automate energy and emissions auditing. Cost and consumption data from a number of buildings can be aggregated or compared with the software, saving time relative to manual reporting. EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures.

Bill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect [[Greenhouse gas emissions|GHG emissions]], which may be used for internal reporting or [[enterprise carbon accounting]].

==Monitoring==
Monitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modeling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.

Initiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives.

EMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious Energy Management Software uses Smartphones |url=http://www.seriousenergy.com/energy-management/software/sem.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619012549/http://www.seriousenergy.com:80/energy-management/software/sem.html |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerhouse Dynamics’ mobile app expands real-time facility ops and energy management capabilities|url=http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/powerhouse-dynamics-mobile-app-expands-real-time-facility-ops-and-energy-management-capabil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement==
Engagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echome.co.uk/renewable-energy-services/heating-and-lighting-controls/ "Building Automation and Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objective of Engagement is to connect occupants’ daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real-time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives.

People-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. 

Letting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ "The Prius Effect"] by [http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ Elizabeth Dickinson]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Founder's Pie Calculator''' is a tool for distributing [[Share (finance)|shares]] when starting a [[business venture]]. It was first described in an article by Frank Demmler, who is an Adjunct Teaching Professor of Entrepreneurship at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tepper.cmu.edu/our-faculty-and-research/about-our-faculty/faculty-profiles/fd0n/demmler-l|title=L. Frank Demmler|website=Tepper School of Business|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fd0n/index.html|title=Frank Demmler's Home Page|last=|first=|date=|website=www.andrew.cmu.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to popular notion, the shares are not distributed equally (because "it's fair") but using a system of 5 important aspects of any business venture, assigning a relative weight to them and then rating the founders in each of these aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fd0n/35%20Founders'%20Pie%20Calculator.htm|title=Cutting Up the Founder’s Pie|website=www.andrew.cmu.edu|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade barriers are restrictions on [[international trade]] that are put in place by the government. They are typically looked at as negative for the economy. This is because  barriers that restrict the flow of goods tend to raise the price of said good.However, there are many different types of trade barriers that can effect global trading such as [[Tariff|tariffs]], quotas and regulatory barriers.   

== Types of Trade Barriers ==

=== Tariffs ===
The most common barrier to trade is the tariff barrier. Tariffs typically are higher than average taxes on imported goods. These taxes are put in place by the government in hopes to raises revenue and for protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/tariff-barriers|title=Tariff barriers definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries and their trade barriers ==

=== United States of America ===
In the last five or so year the United States has been dealing with the implication's of [https://ustr.gov/trade-topics/localization-barriers Localization Barriers]. These barriers are put in place to benefit the domestic industries that the U.S deals with. They place restrictions on not only peoples goods and services but also their [[Intellectual property]]. This practice is widely though after to have a negative affect on ones economy so the U.S tends to try and stay away from it. Also, the jury is still out on whether or not this barriers align with the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/trade-topics/localization-barriers|title=Localization Barriers to Trade {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States Trade Partners ====
[[United Kingdom]] and the U.S

* U.K Exported 65,729 Million dollars worth of goods in 2016 to the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/reports-and-publications/2018/2018-national-trade-estimate|title=2018 National Trade Estimate Report {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* U.S Exported 51,698 million dollars worth of goods in 2016 to the U.K.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Mexico]] and the U.S

* Mexico exported 32,045 million dollar's worth of goods to the U.S in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* U.S exported 24,569 million dollar's worth of goods to Mexico in 2016&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
While being one of the larger countries the U.K has very little in the ways of trade barriers. Different from the U.S the U.K must follow the rules of the [[European Union|E.U]]. With that said, the few barriers that the U.K does have tend to be because of the rules they need to follow for being a part of the E.U.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=United-Kingdom-Trade-Barriers|title=United Kingdom - Trade Barriers {{!}} export.gov|website=www.export.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indrek Toome''' (born 19 September 1943 in [[Tallinn]]) is a former [[communist]] Estonian politician and businessman.&lt;ref name=epl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/439158|title=Indrek Toome: suurim rikkus on elu oma maal ja oma rahva keskel|last=Anvelt |first=Kärt |date=21 August 2008|work=[[Eesti Päevaleht]]|language=Estonian|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served from 1988 to 1990, and was the last Prime Minister (head of the Council of Ministers) of the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name=epl/&gt;

== Early life ==
Toome was born into a working-class family. He completed his studies in 1968 as an electrical engineer at the Polytechnic Institute in Tallinn (Estonian ''Tallinna Polütehniline Instituut,'' now [[Tallinn University of Technology]]).

== Career ==
From 1972 to 1990, Toome held various senior posts in the [[All-Union Leninist Young Communist League]] Union of Estonia (''Eestimaa Leninlik Kommunistlik Noorsooühing'' - ELKNÜ) and the Communist Party of Estonia (ERP).

From 16 November 1988 until 1990, Toome was chairman of the Ministers of the Estonian SSR and therefore communist prime minister of Estonia.  It was under his leadership that the government succumb to pressure from the [[Singing Revolution]], the peaceful liberation of Estonia from the domination of the Soviet Communist Party. With the collapse of Soviet rule in Estonia, on 3 April 1990, he handed over his office to the first freely elected prime minister of Estonia after the Second World War, [[Edgar Savisaar]]. On 20 January 1991, Estonia was once again an independent state.

From 1990 to 1992, Toome was a member of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia (Eesti Vabariigi Ülemnõukogu) to Parliament until the first meeting of the [[Riigikogu]]. Since 1992, Indrek Toome is a partner in a real estate firm.  In 1995, he was convicted of attempted bribery of Tallinn District Court sentenced to a fine.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Industrial property''' is one of two subsets of [[intellectual property]] (the other being [[copyright]]) takes a range of forms, including [[patent]]s for [[invention]]s, [[industrial design]]s (aesthetic creations related to the appearance of industrial products), [[trademark]]s, [[service mark]]s, layout-designs of [[integrated circuit]]s, [[commercial name]]s and designations, [[geographical indication]]s and protection against [[unfair competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/36/intellectual-industrial-and-commercial-property|title=Intellectual, industrial and commercial property {{!}} Fact Sheets on the European Union {{!}} European Parliament|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, aspects of an intellectual creation, although present, are less clearly defined. The object of industrial property consists of signs conveying information, in particular to consumers, regarding products and services offered on the market. Protection is directed against unauthorized use of such signs that could mislead consumers, and against misleading practices in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_909_2016.pdf|title=Understanding Copyright and Related Rights|last=|first=|publisher=WIPO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-805-2799-5|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad application of the term “industrial property” is set out in the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention,]] Industrial property legislation is part of the wider body of law known as [[intellectual property]] (IP) which refers broadly to the creations of the human mind. IP rights protect the interests of innovators and creators by giving them rights over their creations. The [[Convention establishing the world intellectual property organization|Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization]] (1967) does not seek to define [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property]], but lists the following as protected by IP [[Intellectual Property Rights|rights]]:[[Literature|literary]], [[art]]istic and [[scientific works]]; [[performance]]s of [[Performing arts|performing artists]], phonograms and broadcasts; inventions in all fields of human endeavor; scientific discoveries; industrial designs; trademarks, service marks, and commercial names and designations; protection against unfair competition; “''all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields''”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_895_2016.pdf|title=Understanding Industrial Property|last=|first=|publisher=WIPO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-805-2588-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries generally have laws to protect IP for two main reasons:
# To  give  statutory  expression  to  the rights  of  creators  and  innovators  in their  creations  and  innovations,  balanced  against  the  public  interest  in accessing creations and innovations;
# To  promote  creativity  and  innovation, so contributing to economic and social development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The importance of protecting Industrial property was first recognized in the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] in 1883 and the [[Berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works|Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1886. Both treaties are administered by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Patents for Invention ==
{{Main|Patent}}
[[Patent]]s, also referred to as patents for invention, are the most widespread means of protecting technical inventions. The patent system is designed to contribute to the promotion of [[innovation]] and the transfer and dissemination of [[technology]], to the mutual advantage of inventors, users of inventions and the [[general public]]. Once a patent is granted by a state or by a regional office acting for several states, the owner of a patent has the right to prevent anyone else from commercially exploiting the invention for a limited period, generally 20 years. The patent applicant must disclose the invention in order to obtain protection, and their rights can be enforced only within the territory in which the patent was granted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Definitions ===
Most laws dealing with the protection of [[invention]]s do not actually define what an invention is. A number of countries, however, define inventions as new solutions to technical problems. The problem may be old or new, but the solution, in order to be considered an invention, must be a new one. Merely discovering something that already exists in [[nature]] will not generally qualify as an invention; an adequate amount of human [[ingenuity]], [[creativity]] and inventiveness must be involved. But an invention need not be technically complex: the [[safety pin]] was an invention that solved a “technical” problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Exclusive rights ===
By granting an exclusive right, patents provide incentives, offering inventors recognition for their creativity and material reward for their marketable inventions. These incentives encourage innovation, which in turn contributes to continued enhancement of the quality of life. In return for the exclusive right, the inventor must adequately disclose the patented invention to the public, so that others have access to the new knowledge, leading to further innovation. The disclosure of the invention is thus an essential consideration in any patent granting procedure. The word “patent”, or “letters patent”, also denotes the document issued by the relevant government authority. In order to obtain a patent for an invention, the inventor, or often the inventor’s employer, submits an application to the national or regional patent office concerned. In the application, the applicant must describe the invention in detail and compare it with previous existing technologies in the same field in order to demonstrate that it is new.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Patentability ===
Not all inventions are patentable. Patent laws generally require that an invention fulfill the following conditions, known as the requirements or conditions of patentability:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Patentable subject matter:''' The invention must fall within the scope of patentable subject matter as defined by national law. This varies from one country to another. Many countries exclude from patentability such subject matter as scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, methods for medical treatment (as opposed to medical products), and any invention where prevention of commercial exploitation is necessary to protect public order, morality or public health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Industrial applicability (utility):''' The invention must be of practical use, or capable of some kind of industrial application.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Novelty:''' The invention must show some new characteristic that is not known in the body of existing knowledge (referred to as prior art) in its technical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Inventive step (non-obviousness):''' The invention must show an inventive step that could not be deduced by a person with average knowledge of the technical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Disclosure of the invention:''' The invention must be disclosed in a clear and complete manner in the patent application to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (a person conversant in the field of technology concerned).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The conditions of novelty and inventive step must be fulfilled by a certain date, generally the date on which the application is filed. An exception to this rule, covered by an applicant’s right of priority, is regulated by the Paris Convention. The right of priority means that, having filed an application in one member country of the Paris Convention, the same applicant (or their successor in title) may, within a specified time period, apply for protection for the same invention in any of the other member countries. These subsequent applications will not be invalidated by reason of any acts occurred between the filing date of the earliest application and the subsequent applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example, if an inventor first files an application for patent protection in Japan, and later a second application, with respect to the same invention, in France, it is sufficient that the conditions of novelty and non-obviousness existed at the date on which the Japanese application was filed. In other words, the later, French application retains priority over any applications relating to the same invention filed by other applicants between the date of the inventor’s first and second application. This is subject to the period between the two dates not exceeding 12 months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Products and processes ===
It is customary to distinguish between inventions that consist of products and inventions that consist of processes. The creation of a new alloy is an example of a product invention. The invention of a new method or process of making a known or new alloy is a process invention. The corresponding patents are usually referred to respectively as a product patent and a process patent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Patentees ===
The person to whom a patent is granted is known as the patentee, the owner of the patent or the patent holder. Once a patent has been granted with respect to a particular country, anyone who wishes to exploit the invention commercially in that country must obtain the patentee’s authorization. In principle, anyone who exploits a patented invention without the patentee’s authorization commits an illegal act. Protection is granted for a limited period, generally 20 years. Once a patent expires, the protection ends, and the invention enters the public domain (also known as being “off patent”). The patentee no longer holds exclusive rights to the invention, which then becomes available for commercial exploitation by others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Rights conferred by a patent ===
The rights conferred by a patent are described in the patent law of the country in which the patent is granted. The patent owner’s exclusive rights generally consist of the following: 
* in the case of a product patent, the right to prevent third parties from making, using, offering for sale or selling the product, or importing it for these purposes, without the owner’s consent; and 
* in the case of a process patent, the right to prevent third parties from using the process without the owner’s consent; and to prevent third parties from using, offering for sale or selling the products obtained directly by that process, or importing them for these purposes, without the owner’s consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The patentee is not given a statutory right to exploit the invention, but rather a statutory right to prevent others from commercially exploiting it. Patentees may give permission, or grant a license, to other parties to use their inventions on mutually agreed terms. They may also sell their patent rights to someone else, who then becomes the new patent owner. There are certain exceptions to the principle that a patented invention cannot legally be exploited without the authorization of the patent owner. These exceptions take into account the balance between the legitimate interests of the patent holder and those of competitors, consumers and others. For example, many patent laws allow a patented invention to be exploited without the patentee’s authorization: private acts for non-commercial purposes; acts for experimental purposes or scientific research; and acts for obtaining regulatory approval for pharmaceuticals. In addition, many laws provide for various situations under which compulsory licenses may be granted and government’s use of patented inventions without the authorization of the patent owner may be allowed in the wider public interest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Utility Models ==
{{Main|Utility model}}
Although not as widespread as patents, [[utility model]]s are also used to protect inventions. The rights conferred by utility models are similar to patent rights. Utility models are found in the laws of more than 50 countries, as well as in the regional agreements of the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI). In addition, certain countries, such as Australia and Malaysia, provide for titles of protection called innovation patents or utility innovations which are similar to utility models. Other countries, like Ireland and Slovenia, have a short-term patent equivalent to the utility model. The expression “utility model” refers to a title of protection for certain inventions, such as inventions in the mechanical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Utility model protection is usually sought for technically less complex inventions or for inventions that have a short commercial life. The procedure for obtaining protection for a utility model is usually simpler than that for seeking patent protection. Substantive and procedural requirements under the applicable laws vary widely among the countries and regions with a utility model system; however, utility models usually differ from patents for invention in the following main respects:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The requirements for acquiring a utility model are less stringent than for patents. While the “novelty” requirement must always be met, that of “inventive step” (or “non-obviousness”) may be much less evident or absent altogether. In practice, protection for utility models is often sought for innovations of an incremental nature that may not meet patentability criteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The maximum term of protectio provided for by law for a utility model is generally shorter than that provided for a patent for invention, usually between 7 and 10 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The fees required for obtaining and maintaining the right are generally lower than those for patents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Industrial Designs ==
{{Main|Industrial design}}
[[Industrial design]]s are applied to a wide variety of industrial products and handicrafts. They refer to the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of an article, including compositions of lines or colors or any three-dimensional forms that give a special appearance to a product or handicraft. The design must have aesthetic appeal. Moreover, it must be able to be reproduced by industrial means; this is the essential purpose of the design and the reason the design is called “industrial”. In a legal sense, an industrial design refers to the right granted in many countries, pursuant to a registration system, to protect the original, ornamental and nonfunctional features of a product resulting from design activity.Aesthetic appeal is one of the main factors influencing consumers in their product choice. Where the technical performance of a product offered by different manufacturers is relatively similar, consumers will make their selection based on price and aesthetic appeal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Aims of industrial design protection ===
By rewarding creators for their efforts, industrial design protection also serves as an incentive to invest in design activity. One of the basic aims of industrial design protection is to stimulate the design element of production. Industrial design laws therefore usually only protect designs that can be used in industry, or that can be produced on a large scale. This condition of industrial production is a notable difference between industrial design protection and copyright, since the latter concerns only aesthetic creations. However, in some cases, industrial designs may qualify for protection under copyright, for example where the design can be categorized as a work of applied art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Originality ===
Industrial designs can generally be protected if they are new or original. Designs may not meet these criteria if they do not differ significantly from other existing designs or combinations thereof. In most industrial design laws, designs dictated solely by the article’s function are excluded from protection. If the design for an article produced by many manufacturers, such as a screw, were to be dictated purely by the function the screw was intended to perform, then protection for that design would have the effect of excluding all other manufacturers from producing items intended to perform the same function. Such exclusion is not warranted unless the design is sufficiently novel and inventive to qualify for patent protection. In other words, the legal protection offered by industrial designs concerns only the design that is applied to, or embodied in, articles or products. This protection does not prevent other manufacturers from producing or dealing in similar articles or products, as long as these do not embody or reproduce the protected design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Protections ===
Industrial design registration protects against unauthorized exploitation of the design in industrial articles. It grants the owner of the design the exclusive right to make, import, sell, hire or offer for sale articles to which the design is applied or in which the design is embodied. The term for an industrial design right varies from country to country. The usual maximum term is from 10 to 25 years, often divided into terms requiring the proprietor to renew the registration in order to obtain an extension of protection. The relatively short period of protection may be related to the association of designs with more general styles of fashion, which tend to enjoy somewhat transient acceptance or success, particularly in highly fashion-conscious areas such as clothing or footwear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Intellectual Property with Regard to Integrated Circuits ==
Although prefabricated components of [[Electrical Circuit|electrical circuitry]] have been used in the manufacture of [[electrical equipment]] (e.g [[radio]]s) for some time, large-scale integration of a multitude of electrical functions in a very small component became possible as a result of advances in [[semiconductor]] technology. Integrated circuits are manufactured in accordance with very detailed plans or layout-designs.The layout-designs of integrated circuits are creations of the [[Mind|human mind]]. They are usually the result of vast investment, in terms both of expertise and financial resources. There is a continuing need for the creation of new layout-designs that simultaneously reduce the dimensions of existing integrated circuits and increase their functions. The smaller an integrated circuit, the less material is needed for its manufacture, and the smaller the space needed to accommodate it. Integrated circuits are used in a wide range of products, including articles of everyday use such as watches, televisions, washing machine sand cars, as well as sophisticated computers and servers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although creating a new layout-design for an integrated circuit involves a major investment, it is possible to copy layout designs for a fraction of that cost. Copying may be done by photographing each layer of an integrated circuit and preparing masks for the production of the integrated circuit on the basis of those photographs. The high cost of creating layout-designs and the relative ease of copying them are the main reasons they need protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Layout-designs of integrated circuits are not considered industrial designs in the sense described in the laws providing for the registration of industrial designs. This is because they do not determine the external appearance of integrated circuits but rather the physical location, within the integrated circuit, of each element having an electronic function. Moreover, layout-designs of integrated circuits are not normally patentable inventions, because their creation usually does not involve an inventive step – even though it requires a great deal of work by an expert. Furthermore, copyright protection may not apply if national law determines that layout-designs cannot be copyrighted. In response to the uncertainty surrounding the protection of layout-designs, the [[WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits]] was adopted on May 26, 1989. The Treaty has not entered into force; however, its substantive provisions have, to a large extent, been incorporated by reference in the [[Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS Agreement), concluded in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trademarks ==
{{Main|Trademark}}
A [[trademark]] is a sign, or a combination of signs, that distinguishes the goods or services of one [[company]] from those of another. Such signs may use [[word]]s, letters, [[Number|numerals]], [[Image|pictures]], [[shape]]s and [[color]]s, or any combination thereof. An increasing number of countries also allow for the registration of less traditional forms of trademarks, such as three-dimensional signs (like the [[Coca-Cola]] bottle or [[Toblerone]] chocolate bar), audible signs (sounds such as the roar of the [[lion]] at the beginning of films produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]), or olfactory signs (such as the smell of a particular type of [[motor oil]] or [[embroidery yarn]]). However, many countries have set limits on what may be registered as a trademark, generally allowing only signs that are visually perceptible or can be represented graphically. Trademarks are used on goods or in connection with the market - ing of goods or services. The trademark may appear not only on the goods themselves but also on the container or packaging in which the goods are marketed. When used in connection with the sale of goods or services, the sign may appear in advertisements, for example, in newspapers, on television or in shop windows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to trademarks identifying the commercial source of goods or services, several other categories of marks exist.

===Collective marks===
Collective marks are owned by an association, such as an association representing accountants or engineers, whose members use the mark to identify them with a particular level of quality and other requirements set by the association.

===Certification marks===
[[Certification mark]]s, such as the [[Woolmark]], are given for compliance with defined standards, but are not confined to any membership of an association.

===Service Mark===
A trademark used in connection with services is called a [[service mark]]. Service marks are used, for example, by [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[airline]]s, [[Tourism agency|tourist agencies]], car-rental agencies, [[Laundry|laundries]] and [[cleaner]]s. All that has been said about trademarks also applies to service marks.

===Functions of trademarks===
Broadly speaking, trademarks perform four main functions:

* Distinguish the products or services of one company from those of other companies. Trademarks facilitate the choice to be made by consumers when buying certain products or using certain services. The trademark helps consumers to identify a product or service they are already familiar with or one that has been advertised. The distinctive character of a mark must be evaluated in relation to the goods or services to which the mark is applied. For example, the word “apple” or the image of an apple cannot distinguish apples, but it is distinctive for computers. Trademarks not only distinguish products or services as such, they also distinguish them in relation to the company offering the products or services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Refer to a particular company, not necessarily known to the consumer, that offers the products or services on the market. Trademarks therefore distinguish products or services from a given source from identical or similar products or services from other sources. This function is important in defining the scope of trademark protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Refer to a particular quality of the product or service for which a mark is used, so that consumers can rely on the consistent quality of the goods or services offered under that mark. This function is commonly referred to as the guarantee function of trademarks. A trademark is not always used by only one company, since the trademark owner may grant licenses to use the trademark to other companies. It is accordingly essential that licensees respect the quality standards of the trademark owner. Moreover, companies often use trademarks for products they acquire from various sources in the course of business. In such cases, trademark owners are not responsible for producing the products, but instead (and this may be equally important) for selecting those that meet their quality standards and requirements. Even where trademark owners are the manufacturers of a particular product, they may use parts they have selected but not produced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promote the marketing and sale of products, and the marketing and provision of services. Trademarks are not only used to distinguish or refer to a particular company or quality, but also to stimulate sales. A trademark used in this way must be carefully selected. It must appeal to the consumer, create interest and inspire a feeling of confidence. This is sometimes called the communication function. The owner of a registered trademark has an exclusive right in respect of the mark: the right to use the mark and to prevent unauthorized third parties from using it, or a confusingly similar mark, so as to prevent consumers and the public in general from being misled. The period of protection varies, but a trademark can be renewed indefinitely on payment of the necessary fees and on condition that the mark is used. Trademark protection is enforced by the courts which, in most systems, have the authority to block trademark infringement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trade Names ==
{{Main|Trade name}}
Another category of industrial property covers commercial names and designations. A commercial or trade name is the name or designation that identifies a company. In most countries, trade names may be registered with a government authority. However, under Article 8 of the Paris Convention, a trade name must be protected without the obligation of filing or registration, whether or not it forms part of a trademark. Protection generally means that the trade name of one company may not be used by another company, either as a trade name or a trade or service mark – and that a name or designation similar to the trade name may not be used by another company if it is likely to mislead the public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Geographical Indications ==
{{Main|Geographical indication}}
A geographical indication is a sign used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation due to that place of origin. Agricultural products typically have qualities deriving from their place of production and that are influenced by specific local factors , such as climate and soil. Whether a sign functions as an indication is a matter of national law and consumer perception. Geographical indications may be used for a wide variety of agricultural products, such as “Tuscany” for olive oil produced in a specific area of Italy, or “Roquefort” for cheese produced in a certain region of France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of geographical indications is not limited to agricultural products. They may also highlight particular qualities of a product that are due to human factors found in the product’s place of origin, such as specific manufacturing skills and traditions. That place of origin may be a village or town, a region or a country. An example of a country geographical indication is “Switzerland” or “Swiss” for products made in Switzerland, in particular watches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An appellation of origin is a special kind of geographical indication used on products that have a specific quality exclusively or essentially due to the geographical environment in which the products are produced. The term geographical indication encompasses appellations of origin. Examples of appellations of origin protected in states party to the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration are “Habana”, for tobacco grown in the Havana region of Cuba, and “Tequila”, for spirits produced in particular areas of Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Protections ===
Geographical indications are protected in accordance with national laws in a wide range of ways, such as under laws against unfair competition, consumer protection laws, laws for the protection of certification marks or special laws for the protection of geographical indications or appellations of origin. In essence, unauthorized parties may not use geographical indications where that use is likely to mislead the public as to the true origin of the product. Applicable sanctions range from court injunctions preventing unauthorized use to the payment of damages and fines or, in serious cases, imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Protection against Unfair Competition ==
Article 10 bis of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] requires member countries to provide for protection against unfair competition. According to this article, the following acts of competition are considered contrary to honest trade and industry practices: 
* All acts of such a nature as to create confusion with the establishment, the goods or the industrial or commercial activities of a competitor; 
* False allegations in the course of trade of such a nature as to discredit the establishment, the goods or the industrial or commercial activities of a competitor; and 
* Indications or allegations, the use of which in the course of trade are liable to mislead the public as to the characteristics of certain goods. 
Protection against unfair competition supplements the protection of inventions, industrial designs, trademarks and geographical indications. It is particularly important for the protection of knowledge, technology or information that is not protected by a patent but that may be required in order to make best use of a patented invention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Role of the World Intellectual Property Organization ==
{{Main|World Intellectual Property Organization}}
The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) is an international organization dedicated to promoting creativity and innovation by ensuring that the rights of creators and owners of IP are protected worldwide, and that inventors and authors are recognized and rewarded for their ingenuity. As a specialized agency of the United Nations, WIPO provides a forum for its member states to create and harmonize rules and practices for protecting IP rights. Most developed countries have protection systems that are centuries old, while developing countries continue to create legal and administrative frameworks to protect their patents, trademarks, designs and copyright. WIPO assists its member states in developing these new systems through treaty negotiation, legal and technical assistance, and training in various forms, including in the area of enforcement of IP rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Systems ===
WIPO also provides international registration systems for trademarks, industrial designs and appellations of origin, and an international filing system for patents. These systems greatly simplify the process of seeking IP protection simultaneously in a large number of countries. Instead of having to file separate national applications, in different languages, in each country in which protection is sought, applicants can file a single application, in one language, with a single application fee. The WIPO-administered systems include four different mechanisms of protection for specific industrial property rights:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) System, for filing patent applications in multiple countries.
* the Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks, for trade and service marks. 
* the Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs. 
* the Lisbon System for the International Registration of Appellations of Origin.

Anyone applying for a patent or registering a trademark or design, whether at the national or international level, needs to determine whether their creation is new or already owned or claimed by someone else. To do this, huge amounts of information must be searched. Four WIPO treaties have created classification systems that organise information on different branches of industrial property into indexed, manageable structures for easy retrieval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">'''International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (INTERTANKO)''' is the association of the owner of the independent [[tanker (ship)|tanker]]s in the world. It started in 1970 to speak out for the independent tankers' owners, non-oil companies and non-state controlled tanker owners, for the safe shipping of [[oil]] and [[chemical]]s and to act as a forum for marine policy creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.londoninternationalshippingweek.com/organizer/intertanko/ |title=London International Shipping Week - INTERTANKO|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership is open to independent tanker owners and operators of oil and chemical tankers, i.e. non-oil companies and non-state controlled tanker owners, who fulfil the Association's membership criteria. Independent owners operate some 80% of the world's tanker fleet and the vast majority are INTERTANKO members. As of January 2012, the organisation had 235 members, whose combined fleet comprises some 3,380 tankers totalling 285 million dwt. INTERTANKO's associate membership stands at some 320 companies with an interest in shipping of oil and chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intertanko.com/About-Us/|title= INTERTANKO Website - About Us|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INTERTANKO are responsible for the compilation of several marine industry books and publications. [[Witherby Seamanship]] are the official distributors of [[INTERTANKO]] publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.intertanko.com/News-Desk/Press-Releases/Year-2013/Witherbys-to-manage-the-sales-and-distribution-of-INTERTANKO-publications/ |title=INTERTANKO and Witherby|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; INTERTANKO's central offices are in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] and in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/FC019382|title=Companies House - INTERTANKO|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Urban''' (or '''Johannes Urban''',{{sfn|Fünfundzwanzig Jahre Erste Österreichische Glanzstoff-Fabrik}} 7 June 1863 – 13 November 1940) was an Austrian chemist and industrialist. He was one of the pioneers of the artificial silk industry.

==Early years==
Johann Urban was born on 7 June 1863 in Wuchern near Marburg (now [[Maribor]]), [[Lower Styria]].
His father was a timber merchant.{{sfn|Büttner|1972}}
He studied mechanical and electrical engineering in [[Graz]], and expected to work as a teacher at a state vocational school.{{sfn|Wieninger|2002|pp=374–375}}
Instead, he found work in a light bulb factory in [[Rotterdam]], where he met [[Max Fremery]].{{sfn|Büttner|1972}}
In the mid-1880s Urban and Fremery took over the technical management of a light bulb factory in [[Gelnhausen]].{{sfn|Beau|1961|pp=400ff}}

==Lamp manufacture (1885–1900)==
The Swiss chemist [[Matthias Eduard Schweizer]] (1818–60) had found in 1857 that cotton could be dissolved in a solution of copper salts and ammonia and then regenerated.{{sfn|Woodings|2001|p=4}}
In 1890 the French chemist Louis Henri Despeissis invented the [[cuprammonium]] process for spinning fibers from  cotton dissolved in [[Schweizer's reagent]].{{sfn|Woodings|2001|p=4}}
Despeissis died in 1892 and his patent was not renewed.{{sfn|Woodings|2001|p=5}}
In 1891 Fremery and Urban adapted the Despaissis process to make electric lamp filaments from carbon fiber.{{sfn|Morgan|2005|p=149}}
In 1892 they founded an incandescent electric lamp manufacturing company, ''Rheinische Glühlampenfabrik'' in [[Oberbruch Industry Park|Oberbruch]], in the [[Heinsberg]] district.{{sfn|Heerding|1988|p=37}}
In 1895 the factory employed 36 men and 46 women, and was producing about 400,000 lamps per year.{{sfn|Heerding|1988|p=37}}
By 1900 the company had 350 employees, but was struggling to remain profitable in the face of the low prices of the major electrical manufacturers.{{sfn|Heerding|1988|p=63}}

==Rayon manufacture (1898–1912)==

Fremery and Urban became involved in developing synthetic fiber (''Glanzstoff'') in the mid-1890s.{{sfn|Beau|1961|pp=400ff}}
The success of the [[nitrocellulose]] fiber developed by [[Hilaire de Chardonnet]] encouraged Fremery and Urban to investigate making artificial silk, which they named "Silkimit" and patented in 1897.
Their cuprammonium process was cheaper and safer than nitrocellulose.{{sfn|Morgan|2005|p=149}}
The company had developed a process by 1897 that used rotating cylinders to stretch the fibers into finer filaments that could be used for making clothes.{{sfn|Woodings|2001|p=91}}
They patented a version of the Despeissis process with the addition of a practical method for spinning the fiber.{{sfn|Woodings|2001|p=5}}
In Oberbruch in 1898 they established the first factory in Germany to economically produce artificial fiber, using a patent for manufacture of rayon made from cellulose in a copper-ammonia solution.
The workforce had grown to 700 people within one year.{{sfn|Beau|1961|pp=400ff}}

Fremery and Urban moved their headquarters to [[Elberfeld]], now a suburb of [[Wuppertal]].{{sfn|Kleinschmidt|2002|loc=PT210}}
[[Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken]] (VGF) was launched on 19 September 1899 with 2 million marks of capital.
The Bergisch-Märkischen bank provided the financing.{{sfn|Woodings|2001|p=94}}
Urban became the technical director of the newly founded VGF.{{sfn|Wieninger|2002|pp=374–375}}
Fremery and Urban, with the Alsatian textile chemist David Emil Bronnert (1868–1928), took out two more basic patents in 1900.{{sfn|Woodings|2001|p=94}}
From 1904 Urban was head of the ''Erste österreichische Glanzstoff-Fabriken'' (First Austrian Rayon Factory) in [[Sankt Pölten]].{{sfn|Wieninger|2002|pp=374–375}}
This was a joint venture of several German and Austrian firms, led by VGF.
It grew rapidly, and by 1913 employed about 1,700 people.{{sfn|Matis|1994|p=399}}

Johann Urban died on 13 November 1940 in Vienna.{{sfn|Wieninger|2002|pp=374–375}}

'''Laurence "Larry" Goodman''' (born 15 September 1937) is an Irish businessman, chiefly involved in the beef industry. His companies attracted controversy in the 1991 [[Beef Tribunal]] and the [[2013 horse meat contamination scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2263628/Horsemeat-supermarket-burgers-Larry-Goodman-multi-millionaire-contaminated-food-supplier.html Revealed: Dirty Larry, the multi-millionaire behind firm sneaking horsemeat into your supermarket], Keith Gladdis, ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 16 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Goodman was born in County Louth. He left school before finishing his [[Intermediate Certificate (Ireland)|Intermediate Certificate]], and followed his father into the meat industry, starting with meat by-products and sheep. He was "born to a well off family who had been in the meat business for six generations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1989/0206/Pg002.html The fiefdom of an enigmatic beef baron], Jim Dunne, ''[[Irish Times]]'', 6 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He lives with his wife Kitty at [[Castlebellingham]], County Louth. His brother Peter Goodman worked as deputy chairman of Goodman International and his other brother Michael was a farmer in County Louth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1987/0619/Pg009.html From scratch to multi-millionaire], Ella Shanahan, ''Irish Times'', 19 June 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business life==
In the late 1960s Goodman bought [[Anglo-Irish Meats]] in [[Dundalk]], which put him into the processing industry in a substantial way. He then began exporting, building up contacts in the Middle East in particular. He sold meat to [[Libya]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]] – often going himself as salesman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1989/0206/Pg002.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He was on the advisory committee for [[HSBC]]'s opening of operations in Ireland in 1979,  along with Dermot Nolan, Michael Carvill and Peter Hutson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1979/0927/Pg014.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1980 Anglo Irish Meat Group purchased a meat plant at [[Bagenalstown|Bagenalstown, County Carlow]] from Meade-Lonsdale for around £2.2m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1980/0501/Pg012.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1980 it was announced that Goodman would invest £10m for a new meat plant in [[Ardee|Ardee, County Louth]], employing 360 people "when it reaches full production". It also announced an additional £10m investment to expand operations at Cahir, Nenagh and Bagenalstown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1980/0618/Pg006.html&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1980, Goodman bought Fermanagh Meats in Enniskillen for about £1.5m. The plant employed 60 people and processed about 1,000 head of cattle a week. By this time Goodman's meat empire was turning over about £100m a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1980/1023/Pg011.html 1980 Profile], irishtimes.com; accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1981 it was announced that the IDA would put £2m towards the £9m expansion of Goodman's plants. One of his companies, Irish Agricultural Feed Co also built a feed manufacturing facility at Castlebellingham, and a complex to "over-winter up to 15,000 cattle to boost supplies to the factories at a time when few cattle are finished for slaughter". The complex "was the result of 14 years research" and cost £2m. By this time Anglo Irish Group employed some 700 people and turnover had reached £120m per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1981/0716/Pg013.html 1981 Profile], irishtimes.com; accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1982 it was announced that Anglo Irish Beef Group had won a £25.5m contract to supply beef to [[Iraq]]. The contract involved supplying 9,000 tonnes of boneless consumer cuts and frozen bone-in meat and was part of an overall order for 54,000 tonnes of beef placed by Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1982/0126/Pg007.html "£25.5m Iraqi order for meat"], ''Irish Times'', 26 January 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1983, AIBG acquired the four [[Northern Ireland]] factories of the animal by-products processors Robert Wilson for around £1m. By this stage AIBP was slaughtering more than 250,000 cattle a year, and 10,000 cattle were being fattened at Goodman's feeding lots in Louth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1983/0331/Pg013.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, in April 1983, he won contracts to supply $50m worth of fresh frozen beef to Iran and Morocco. At the time of the deal, Goodman complained that because there was no Variable Premium subsidy scheme in the UK, exporters there had an effective subsidy of $300 a tonne on beef exporters, thus enabling them to undercut Irish exporters. In September 1983 Goodman won a $33m contract to supply beef to Iran. Goodman praised then Minister for Agriculture [[Austin Deasy]], whose visit to Tehran "greatly facilitated the securing of the new contract".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1983/0924/Pg006.html 1983 Profile], irishtimes.com; accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1984 AIBP purchased the entire fresh meat division of Dalgety PLC, a publicly quoted UK group. It included facilities in York, Blisworth, Wellingborough and Reading, as well as distribution depots in Jersey and Berkshire. By this time turnover at Goodman had reached £300m a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1984/1218/Pg012.html&lt;/ref&gt; The purchased was followed by the acquisition of the Waterford plant of Clover Meats (after that company's collapse) for around £2m in February 1985. It includes the purchase of National Proteins, a by-products plant processing meat and bone meal from edible offal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1985/0208/Pg016.html 1985 Profile], irishtimes.com; accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desmond and Mac Giolla allegations==
On 9 March 1989 TDs [[Barry Desmond]] and [[Tomás Mac Giolla]] made a series of allegations about Goodman International in the Dáil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1989030900006?opendocument]&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged that the Minister of Agriculture had met Goodman on 19 October 1988 and Goodman had expressed interest in Irish Sugar – however in a parliamentary question submitted by Des O'Malley just a month later O'Kennedy denied any "discussions or negotiations" related to Goodman had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1988112900098?opendocument]&lt;/ref&gt; Desmond indicated that the media had been subject to writs, and called for a tribunal of inquiry into the Goodman Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1989030900006?opendocument&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 1989 ''Irish Times'' story, Goodman International denied the allegations made by Desmond and Mac Giolla. Goodman said it was shocked by the allegations made and that they were "false and malicious comments". "The use of the privilege of the Dail to further this campaign against an Irish company is a matter of the gravest concern," the statement read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1989/0311/Pg001.html Goodman denies Dail charges and challenges TDs], Denis Coghlan, ''[[Irish Times]]'', 11 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==War in Iraq and emergency legislation==
On 2 August 1990, [[Saddam Hussein]] ordered his troops to [[Invasion of Kuwait|enter and occupy Kuwait]]. Initially the losses to the Goodman group and its bankers were estimated at £70m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1990/0823/Pg001.html "Goodman may have to sell assets"], Jim Dunne, ''Irish Times'', 23 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Goodman's companies accounted for 40% of the national beef kill, and had turnover in the region of £1 billion, almost all of it in exports. On 24 August 1990, share prices on the Irish Stock Exchange fell by £400m, with some of Goodman's companies including Food Industries (in which he held a 68% stake) falling from 170p to 110p.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1990/0824/Pg001.html £400m wiped off share values in rush of selling], Brendan McGrath, ''[[Irish Times]]'', 24 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

By Friday, 24 August 1990 Taoiseach [[Charles Haughey]] recalled the Dáil for an emergency session to pass a section of the Companies Bill on Tuesday, 28 August. Haughey denied that the legislation was being enacted specifically to aid Goodman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1990/0825/Pg001.html Taoiseach denies Dail recall centres on Goodman], Renagh Holohan, ''[[Irish Times]]'', 25 August 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation allowed for the courts to appoint an examiner who could freeze company assets for up to 12 months – compared at the time to US [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection laws.

It later emerged that Goodman International was owed up to £180 million by Iraq and that the group owed over £400m to banks around the world – and that the group was "insolvent to the tune of somewhat under £100m".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1990/0827/Pg001.html Iraqi debts of £180m major factor in Goodman troubles], John Stanley, ''[[Irish Times]]'', 27 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; As the group holding company, Goodman International, was an unlimited company and Goodman was 98% owner, he could personally be called on to make good any shortfall owing to creditors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1990/0827/Pg002.html "TDs' holidays disrupted by sudden recall of Dail"], Joe Carroll, ''[[Irish Times]]'', 27 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''World in Action'' investigation==
On 13 May 1991 [[Granada Television]] broadcast an episode of the investigative programme, ''[[World in Action]]'' with [[Susan O'Keeffe]]. The show examined the core business of Goodman International, how its operations were funded by national and European Community schemes, including export insurance and credit schemes, EC export subsidies and the variable premium paid on cattle. It claimed that the dominant position of Goodman in the Irish and British beef processing industry may not be in the best interests of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1991/0513/Pg012.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It also made allegations of inappropriate political influence by Goodman. The programme featured Patrick McGuinness, a former Goodman accountant who had left the company and immigrated to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://thestory.ie/2012/04/02/the-beef-tribunal-report-1994/&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Opposition parties called for a full judicial inquiry into the allegations made on the programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1991051400021?opendocument]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman said he would welcome any investigation from any source and that he would co-operate fully with it. He said he was astounded by the allegations made in the programme. He said that the malpractices alleged during the programme in relation to stamping and weighing meat had never been carried out in a "routine fashion", and if they had taken place they had done so without his knowledge or consent.He said systems that meant payment of £3 million in non-taxable wages to employees had existed but that this had been ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1991/0515/Pg001.html ''Irish Times'' coverage of abuses of tax system (1991)], irishtimes.com; accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, also known as the [[Beef Tribunal]], was established on 31 May 1991, chaired by Justice [[Liam Hamilton]]. The Tribunal was tasked with ''"inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance: (i) allegations regarding illegal activities, fraud and malpractice in and in connection with the beef processing industry made or referred to:-- (a) in [[Dáil Éireann]], and (b) on a television programme transmitted by ITV on 13 May 1991; (ii) any matters connected with or relevant to the matters aforesaid which the Tribunal considers it necessary to investigate in connection with its inquiries into the matters mentioned at (i) above; and 2. making such recommendations (if any) as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper."'' The Tribunal began hearings on 21 June 1991 and it reported its conclusions in July 1994, at the time the Irish State's longest running inquiry. The Tribunal was established by the then [[Fianna Fáil]]/Progressive Democrat coalition, though only after the leader of the PDs, Des O'Malley threatened to pull out of the coalition if no inquiry was established. Then [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]] acquiesced to the demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestory.ie/2012/04/02/the-beef-tribunal-report-1994 Beef Tribunal Report], thestory.ie; accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leicester City Centre''' is [[Leicester]]'s historical commercial, cultural and transport hub and is home to its central business district. Its inner core is roughly delineated by the [[A594 road (Leicester)|A594]], Leicester's inner [[ring road]], although the various central campuses of the University of Leicester, De Monfort University and Leicester College are adjacent to the inner ring road and could be considered to be a continuation of the City centre. In a similar way, the Leicester Royal Infirmary precinct, the New Walk business district ([[Southfields, Leicester|Southfields]]), the Welford Road Stadium of Leicester Tigers' RUFC and the King Power Stadium of Premier League Leicester City to the south, and the Golden Mile to the north could also be deemed to be extensions to the central core.

The city centre incorporates most of Leicester's shopping, with the [[Highcross Leicester|Highcross]] and the [[Haymarket Shopping Centre]] as well as the 'Old Town' around [[Leicester Cathedral]], [[Leicester Market]] and the [[Magazine Gateway]]. Politically, the city centre is split between the [[Leicester City Council]] [[ward (politics)|wards]] of Abbey and Castle. A£19 million regeneration project transformed Leicester's city centre. The work won three awards: The Urbis Urban Regeneration Award in 2007 for Gallowtree Gate, The BCSC Town Centre "Gold" Best in Britain award in June 2009 and the Transport Times Walking &amp; Public Realm award in July 2009.

==The old city==

[[File:Stukeley Leicester Map 1722.jpg|thumb|Map of Leicester in 1722]]

The [[Ratae Corieltauvorum|historic city of Leicester]] was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as [[Ratae Corieltauvorum]] - after the Corieltauvi, the local tribe of Britons whose tribal lands these were - at the crossing of the [[River Soar]] by the [[Fosse Way]], between the current path of the river and the modern Gallowtree Gate.

It is thought that the later medieval walls and gates were in approximately the same positions as the Roman ones, with the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] being where the modern inner ring road meets St Nicholas Circle. The Roman baths are nearby and are preserved at [[Jewry Wall]].  [https://web.archive.org/web/20050829162452/http://semper.freelinuxhost.com/historical_maps.htm] The east gate was at the eastern end of High Street (preserved in the street name Eastgates), the north gate was at the northern end of Highcross Street, the west gate was on the town side of West Bridge, and the south gate was in the modern Friar Lane area – the city walls ran along the current Millstone Lane, Horsefair Street, Gallowtree Gate, Church Gate, Sanvey Gate and Soar Lane, with the western wall possibly running along the river Soar (there is some doubt as to whether the western wall existed). The city centre was the High Cross, at the junction of the current High Street and Highcross Street (in mediaeval times, High Street ran between the north and south gates along the line of the current Highcross Street, while the current High Street was called Swinesmarket).  [[Leicester Cathedral]] and the [[Leicester Guildhall|Guildhall]] occupy this old area of town.

[[Leicester Castle]] lay on the south-western corner of the walls, and the Newarke was a separate walled area nearby. The Newarke Gateway (now known as the Magazine) is the only medieval gateway remaining. A small section of the town wall can be seen in the churchyard of [[St Mary de Castro (Leicester)|St Mary de Castro]]. The town's main gates were sold and demolished in the late 18th century, being an impediment to the flow of traffic (the city's hay market was outside the walls for this reason, the main market being situated within the south-east corner of the walls).

==Modern developments==

[[File:Humberstone Gate Leicester.jpg|thumb|The pedestrianised section of Humberstone Gate. The Haymarket Shopping Centre is to the left.]]

With increasing development, particularly in the 19th century, the focal point moved eastwards, with the [[Clock Tower (Leicester)|Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]] roundabout seeing the five-way junction of the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|London to Manchester]], [[A47 road (Great Britain)|Birmingham to Yarmouth]] and [[A46 road (Great Britain)|Fosse Way]] roads. This was influenced by the replacement of the [[A5199 road|Welford Road]] (now the A5199) by the [[Market Harborough]] road (the Harborough Turnpike, now the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]]), as the main route to London, because the Welford Road terminated in the tiny streets of the old town, and was therefore a hindrance for vehicles, while the London Road went past the East Gates of the city.

Meanwhile, the civic centre moved southwards, with the Corporation of Leicester moving to a new [[Leicester Town Hall|town hall]] building in 1876 in the Market Street area, facing onto a new Town Hall Square, and just outside the walled town. Between these areas is the modern market, based to the south-west of the [[Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]] area, which features the permanent outdoor covered [[Leicester Market]] (the largest in Europe), alongside an indoor market building selling fish, dairy produce, meat, etc., and the old Cornmarket building. Much of this old area of town is now in various [[conservation area]]s.

Outside of the ringroad, but close by, are the main campus of [[De Montfort University]], [[Leicester Royal Infirmary]], the [[Leicester City Football Club]]'s [[King Power Stadium]], the [[Leicester Tigers]]' [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] stadium and [[Leicester (HM Prison)|the prison]].  [[Leicester railway station]] is just on the outer side of the ringroad, on the A6. The [[University of Leicester]] is further away to the south-east, linked by the pedestrian-only path [[New Walk]]. When this was laid out in 1785, on the route of an ancient footpath, it passed through open land, becoming the route to the then Leicester Racecourse which later became [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] but it soon saw development of large private houses on both sides of it. It is now largely offices, although the [[New Walk Museum]] makes a strong impact.

The area inside the ringroad has two large shopping malls – [[Highcross Leicester]] (first opened as The Shires on the northern side of High Street and opening in 1991 with a large extension opened on 4 September 2008), and the [[Haymarket Shopping Centre]] (opened in 1974, on the site of the old hay market), both facing onto the [[Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]] area. On the opposite side of Humberstone Gate to the Haymarket is a new building, with no communal space, occupied by a variety of retailers, that incorporates the famous [[Lewis's]] tower from the previous [[department store]] on the site.

[[File:Granby Street, Leicester - geograph.org.uk - 469906.jpg|thumb|Granby Street.]]

Major chain stores can also be found on the pedestrianised Gallowtree Gate, running south-east from the clock tower, and which continues to the railway station as Granby Street. To the south of the Shires and west of Gallowtree Gate is an area known as ''The Lanes'' consisting mostly of small independent shops. This area's centrepiece is the St Martin's Square development (dating from the 1980s), and also features various smaller arcades, the ''Odeon Arcade'', the ''Royal Arcade'' and the ''Malcolm Arcade''. Of particular interest is the recently renovated [[Silver Arcade]], dating from 1899. Further south than this is the market, and then the civic centre (as mentioned above), which also features the main lending and reference libraries, and a number of shops, both chain and independent.

High Street, Eastgates, Cheapside, Gallowtree Gate and Humberstone Gate west of Charles Street are fully pedestrianised but bicycling is permitted. Private cars (but not buses and taxis) are forbidden at certain times from a larger area. Plans exist to fully pedestrianise the Haymarket and Churchgate also which will involve routing buses via Mansfield Street. [https://archive.is/20121223163438/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/your-council--services/regeneration--culture/environmentdevelopment/consultations/streets-spaces/pedestrianzone-]

The area around the junction of Humberstone Gate and the ring-road is the site of two [[strip mall]]s – the larger of which is on the south-east side of the roundabout and called 'St George's Retail Park', the smaller being on the south-west side.

==Transport==
{{update section|date=July 2017}}

The main bus companies serving the city centre are [[Arriva Fox County]], [[Centrebus]], [[First Leicester]] and Roberts Coaches. There are two main bus stations; the larger, St Margaret's Bus Station, is on Gravel Street to the north of the centre and the smaller, Haymarket Bus Station, is on Charles Street. A number of bus services terminate at on-street stops within the city.

[[Leicester railway station|Leicester London Road]] is now the only railway station in the city centre, after the closure of [[Leicester Belgrave Road railway station|Leicester Belgrave Road]] and [[Leicester Central railway station|Leicester Central]] in the 1960s.

There are more than 8,500 off-street car parking spaces available in four distinct parking zones around the city centre. These are complemented by some 1,500 park and ride spaces at hubs around the city. [http://www.leicester.gov.uk/your-council-services/transport-traffic/traffic-management/parking-homepage/city-centre-parking/]

Leicester City used to have a tram network: firstly horse-drawn under Leicester Tramways Company from 1874 then it was taken over by [[Leicester Corporation Tramways]] in 1901 who ran electric trams from 1904 until they ceased operation on 9 November 1949 to be replaced with bus services; a modern light rail network or tram system still a reserved option for the council's planning team.

==Facilities==
Leicester is home to a variety of theatres, such as the [[Curve]], the (currently mothballed) [[Haymarket Theatre]], [[Little Theatre (Leicester)|Little Theatre]] and [[Sue Townsend Theatre]] (formerly [[Phoenix Arts Centre|Phoenix Arts]]) and there is a small pub theatre called "The Theatre Upstairs" at The Western pub, 70 Western Road, Leicester.
In the City centre there is the [[Phoenix Square Digital Arts Centre]], Midland Street, Leicester (which has a regular programme of art-house and world cinema), a Cinema De Lux, part of Highcross Leicester, and an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] at Freemen's Common, some way to the south. The old Odeon building in Rutland Street was refurbished and opened in 2005 as the [[Leicester Athena]], a conferencing and banqueting venue. The former ABC Cinema on Belgrave Gate has now been demolished and is currently being used as a car park, the site will be turned into a new shopping area with shops, casino, theatre and a new link road which will provide access to the new Highcross Leicester and St. Margaret's bus station.

Since the closure of [[St Margaret's baths]], there is no municipal swimming pool in the city centre. Its replacement, the [[Braunstone Leisure Centre]], is some miles away in [[Braunstone Park &amp; Rowley Fields|Braunstone]].

The area in the inside of the ring-road is nearly entirely built up, with only [[Nelson Mandela Park]] (at the extreme south, in [[Southfields, Leicestershire|Southfields]]), [[Museum Square]] (off [[New Walk]]) and Town Hall Square being considerable open spaces. Outside the ring road are [[Castle Gardens, Leicester|Castle Gardens]] (by [[Leicester Castle]]), [[De Montfort Square]] (off [[New Walk]]), [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]], [[Aylestone Meadows]], [[Western Park, Leicester|Western Park]] and [[Abbey Park, Leicester|Abbey Park]].

Musical venues in the city are somewhat limited since the closure in 1998 then the demolition of the [[Granby Halls]] in 2001– the largest two venues, [[De Montfort Hall]] (mentioned above) and [[University of Leicester]]'s students union (now an O2 academy), are both in [[Southfields, Leicestershire|Southfields]], some way from the city centre, whose main venues include the pub-sized ''The Musician'', ''Firebug'', and ''The Shed''.

Several old [[Church of England|Anglican]] churches are based in or around the city centre. St Martin's is now [[Leicester Cathedral]]. The other four historic parishes were St Margaret's, St Mary de Castro, All Saints', and St Nicholas'. The first Anglican Church to be built in the city after the medieval period was St George's – contrary to popular belief, this is not empty and disused but is in fact a Serbian Orthodox Church, used by the Serbian Orthodox people as a place of worship, regularly.
There is a large Roman Catholic church and Priory named [[Holy Cross Church, Leicester|Holy Cross]] on [[New Walk]]/Wellington Street.
The city centre is covered by an extensive system of [[Closed circuit television|CCTV]] cameras, supplemented by CCTV vans. Now that the main police station on Charles Street has closed, City Centre policing is based in a building off Belgrave Gate called Mansfield House.

==Regeneration==
[[Highcross Leicester]] opened on 4 September 2008 and has several flagship stores, including a [[John Lewis Partnership|John Lewis]], a multiplex cinema, apartments, 2 public squares and [[al fresco dining]] and is the start of many regeneration projects in Leicester that have started to come to fruition.

To the east of Charles Street the city centre is dominated by disused factories and warehouses (which also have some presence in the other outer areas of the city centre). Conversion of these to residential accommodation is ongoing, particularly in the area east of Charles Street and around Humberstone Gate, which has been dubbed 'St George's' by the council, and was made a conservation area in 1989.

St George's South has been designated Leicester's new cultural quarter, and is already the site of the [http://www.lcbdepot.co.uk/ Leicester Creative Business Depot](built on the old [[First Leicester|Leicester City Bus]] depot and keeping the initials) and the Athena. The LCB Depot opened in July 2004, and by the time of its first birthday had let 37 of 55 units, with talk starting of finding an additional site. [https://archive.is/20070928101055/http://www.lsep.co.uk/depotcelebratesasuccessfulyear.html]

Opposite the [[Leicester Athena|Athena]], a new flagship £60 million [[Curve Theatre, Leicester]], designed by [[Rafael Vinoly]] Architects, started construction in 2005, on a site that has been long-disused. It is planned to be ready for handover 2007 to the Haymarket company, who will then vacate their existing building ([[Haymarket Theatre (Leicester)|Haymarket Theatre]]). The first productions would be in 2008. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2005/06/22/performing_arts_centre_intro_feature.shtml] The centre is being funded by the various sources including the City Council, the [[Arts Council]], the [[European Regional Development Fund]] and the [[East Midlands Development Agency]]. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2004/07/23/tanda_pacc_money_feature.shtml]

Further to the south of St George's are plans to create a new business area, near the railway station, including re-use of the old police station, and renovation of the [[Leicester Mercury]] building. [http://www.leicesterregeneration.co.uk/project_business.html]

St George's North has been proposed for a residential community by the Leicester Regeneration Company. [http://www.leicesterregeneration.co.uk/project_residential.html] Development has also started on waterfront properties, with a plan to re-use the [[Leicester Central railway station|Great Central station]] site. [http://www.leicesterregeneration.co.uk/project_waterfront.html]

Since the pedestrianisation of the High Street in Leicester city centre many of the independent retail shops have moved into this regenerated area. Some of Leicester's longest running independent shops can now be found in this area. However, the recent economic downturn and the opening of the Highcross Centre have led to a higher than expected number of closures and an increase in Charity outlets. There are current plans to develop a pedestrianised square, 'over-writing' a spend of almost £2m on parking in the square a few years ago.

==Listed buildings==
[[File:Leicester Town Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The town hall.]]
There are a few Grade I [[listed building]]s.
* [[Abbey Park, Leicestershire|Abbey Park]] ruins and wall, remains of Cavendish House
* [[Jewry Wall]]
* [[Leicester Castle|Castle]], Turret Gateway, Castle Hall, and [[St Mary de Castro (Leicester)|St Mary de Castro]]
* [[Leicester Guildhall|The Guildhall]]
* [[The City Rooms (Leicester)|The City Rooms]] on Hotel Street
* The Newarke [[Magazine Gateway]]
* [[St Margaret's Church, Leicester|St Margaret's]] Church
* [[St Nicholas' Church, Leicester|St Nicholas']] Church
* The [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] war memorial

A few of these are also [[scheduled monument]]s. There are many Grade II [[listed building]]s, including
* The Turkey Cafe, Granby Street
* the Charles Street police building
* the [[Clock Tower (Leicester)|Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]]
* [[Leicester Cathedral|St Martin's Cathedral]] (II star)
* [[31 Granby Street]] (HSBC bank)

* [[All Saints Church, Leicester (Leicester)|All Saints Church, Leicester]] is Grade B.

==Skyscrapers==
[[File:The 'Twin Towers' of Humberstone Gate - geograph.org.uk - 175465.jpg|thumb|right|Leicester International Hotel, with the Cardinal Telephone Exchange tower on the left.]]
During the 1960s and 1970s, many large concrete [[tower blocks]] were built in and around the city centre for residential and office purposes, like many other cities across the UK. Cardinal Telephone Exchange and St Georges Tower, at 84 metres and 82 metres high respectively, are the two tallest skyscrapers in the whole [[East Midlands]] region. Many housing association blocks, averaging 55 metres tall with 20 storeys, were also erected in various Council estates – four in [[Highfields, Leicester|Highfields]], two in [[St Matthew's, Leicester|St Matthews]] and a further two in [[Evington|Rowlatts Hill]].

However, in later years, most of Leicester's office towers became disused and abandoned, with the 58 metres tall Thames Tower never achieving more than 50% occupancy since it was completed. Simultaneously, the residential towers became negatively associated with crime and social deprivation. The four residential blocks in St Matthews and Rowlatts Hill were vacated and demolished by [[Leicester City Council]] in 2001.

Thames Tower and St Georges Tower were both refurbished and reclad in 2009 by private developers, for use as residential apartments and hotels. St Georges Tower was painted royal blue, turning it into a very distinctive local landmark, albeit one that attracted mass controversy due to its perceived ugliness and difference from the original architect's renders for the building's renovation.

The 55-metre-tall New Walk Centre has been occupied by the City Council since the 1970s, while the Cardinal Telephone Exchange is occupied by [[British Telecom]]. The International Hotel has been an un-maintained eyesore for many years, and requires demolition or serious maintenance work as it is having a real impact on the image and success of the adjacent 'Cultural Quarter'.

==LE1 Postal district==
The [[postal district]] LE1 is close to the area covered inside ring-road, but is somewhat larger. The only area inside the ring-road but not part of LE1 is the section of Humberstone Road inside the ring-road.

LE1 includes the [[St Matthew's, Leicester|St Matthew's]] estate, and extends as far north as the [[River Soar]], thus including [[Abbey Park (Leicester)|Abbey Park]]. Where the [[A50 road|A50]] crosses the Soar, the boundary runs south, including [[Leicester Central railway station|Great Central Street]] in LE1, but not the waterfront. It then broadly follows the path of the ring-road until it reaches Waterloo Way, where the border diverges substantially, to include the swathe of land between London Road, Victoria Park Road and Waterloo Way in the LE1 postcode, including the [[University of Leicester]], the [[De Montfort Hall]], [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College]], [[Regent College, Leicester|Regent College]], the [[Welford Road cemetery]], and [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]]. However, [[Leicester railway station|London Road station]] remains outside LE1.

The boundary then includes several streets west of the railway line but east of the ring-road as part of LE1, before meeting up with the roundabout again and then going inwards to exclude Humberstone Road from LE1 (as above).

==Nearby places==
To the west, the city centre borders the river, on the other side of this is the [[West End of Leicester]]. To the south-east it borders [[Highfields, Leicester|Highfields]], to the east, [[St Matthew's, Leicester|St Matthew's]], and to the north-east, [[Belgrave, Leicestershire|Belgrave]].

{{for|the process of a solid literally becoming a liquid|liquefaction}}
{{Insolvency}}

'''Liquidation''' is the process in law and business by which a [[company (law)|company]] is brought to an end in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[United States]]. The assets and property of the company are redistributed. Liquidation is also sometimes referred to as '''winding-up''' or '''dissolution''', although [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]] technically refers to the last stage of liquidation. The process of liquidation also arises when [[customs]], an [[authority]] or [[Government agency|agency]] in a [[country]] responsible for collecting and safeguarding [[Duty (economics)|customs duties]], determines the final computation or ascertainment of the duties or drawback accruing on an entry.&lt;ref&gt;19 CFR §159.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquidation may either be compulsory (sometimes referred to as a ''creditors' liquidation'' following [[bankruptcy]], which may result in the court creating a "liquidation trust") or voluntary (sometimes referred to as a ''shareholders' liquidation'', although some voluntary liquidations are controlled by the creditors).

The term "liquidation" is also sometimes used informally to describe a company seeking to [[divestment|divest]] of some of its assets. For instance, a [[retail chain]] may wish to close some of its stores. For efficiency's sake, it will often sell these at a discount to a company specializing in [[real estate company|real estate]] liquidation instead of becoming involved in an area it may lack sufficient expertise in to operate with maximum profitability.

==Compulsory liquidation==
The parties which are entitled by law to [[petition]] for the compulsory liquidation of a company vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally, a petition may be lodged with the court for the compulsory liquidation of a company by:

* The company itself
* Any [[creditor]] which establishes a ''[[prima facie]]'' case
* Contributories: Those shareholders which may be required to contribute to the company's assets on liquidation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986: Section 74|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/74|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986: Section 75|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/75|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Secretary of state (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] (or equivalent)
* The [[Official Receiver]]

===Grounds===
The grounds upon which an entity can apply to the court for an order of compulsory liquidation also vary between jurisdictions, but normally include:

* The company has so resolved
* The company was incorporated as a [[corporation]], and has not been issued with a trading certificate (or equivalent) within 12 months of registration
* It is an "old public company" (i.e. one that has not re-registered as a public company or become a private company under more recent companies legislation requiring this)
* It has not commenced business within the statutorily prescribed time (normally one year) of its incorporation, or has not carried on business for a statutorily prescribed amount of time
* The number of members has fallen below the minimum prescribed by statute
* The company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due
* It is just and equitable to wind up the company, as for example specified by an Insolvency Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986: Section 122|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/122|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the vast majority of compulsory winding-up applications are made under one of the last two grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Mark|title=What is a Winding-Up Order|url=http://www.businessrecovery.co.uk/help-centre/terminology-explained/what-is-a-winding-up-order/|work=Business Recovery|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An order will not generally be made if the purpose of the application is to enforce payment of a debt which is bona fide disputed.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Stonegate Securities Ltd v Gregory'' [1980] Ch 576, per Buckley L.J. at 579&lt;/ref&gt;

A "just and equitable" winding-up enables the grounds to subject the strict legal rights of the shareholders to equitable considerations. It can take account of personal relationships of mutual trust and confidence in small parties, particularly, for example, where there is a breach of an understanding that all of the members may participate in the business,&lt;ref&gt;''Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries'' [1972] 2 AER 492&lt;/ref&gt; or of an implied obligation to participate in management.&lt;ref&gt;''Tay Bok Choon v Tahansan Sdn Bhd'' [1987] BCLC 472&lt;/ref&gt; An order might be made where the majority shareholders deprive the minority of their right to appoint and remove their own director.&lt;ref&gt;''Re A &amp; BC Chewing Gum Ltd'' [1975] 1 WLR 579&lt;/ref&gt;

===The order===
Once liquidation commences (which depends upon applicable law, but will generally be when the petition was originally presented, and not when the court makes the order),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986: Section 129|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/129|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; dispositions of the company's property are generally [[void (law)|void]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986: Section 127|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/127|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[litigation]] involving the company is generally restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986: Section 130|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/130|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing the application, the court may either dismiss the petition or make the order for winding-up. The court may dismiss the application if the petitioner unreasonably refrains from an alternative course of action.&lt;ref&gt;''Re A Company (No 001573 of 1983)'' [1983] Com LR 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The court may appoint an official receiver, and one or more [[liquidator (law)|liquidators]], and has general powers to enable rights and liabilities of claimants and contributories to be settled. Separate meetings of creditors and contributories may decide to nominate a person for the appointment of a liquidator and possibly of a supervisory liquidation committee.

==Voluntary liquidation==
Voluntary liquidation occurs when the members of a company resolve to voluntarily wind up its affairs and dissolve. Voluntary liquidation begins when the company passes the resolution, and the company will generally cease to carry on business at that time (if it has not done so already).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liquidate your limited company|url=https://www.gov.uk/liquidate-your-company/creditors-voluntary-liquidation|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A creditors’ voluntary liquidation (CVL) is a process designed to allow an [[insolvent]] company to close voluntarily. The decision to liquidate is made by a board resolution, but instigated by the director(s). 75 percent of the company's shareholders must agree to liquidate for liquidation proceedings to advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clay|first1=Andy|title=How to Liquidate in the UK|url=http://www.companyhelp.co.uk/how-to-liquidate-in-the-uk/|website=Company Help|accessdate=7 April 2017|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a limited company’s liabilities outweigh its assets, or the company cannot pay its bills when they fall due, the company becomes insolvent.

If the company is [[Solvency|solvent]], and the members have made a statutory declaration of solvency, the liquidation will proceed as a members' voluntary winding-up. In that case, the general meeting will appoint the liquidator(s). If not, the liquidation will proceed as a creditors' voluntary winding-up, and a meeting of creditors will be called, to which the directors must report on the company's affairs. Where a voluntary liquidation proceeds as a creditors' voluntary liquidation, a liquidation committee may be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liquidation|url=https://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/Creditors+-+Liquidation?openDocument|website=Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a voluntary winding-up of a company has begun, a compulsory liquidation order is still possible, but the petitioning contributory would need to satisfy the court that a voluntary liquidation would prejudice the contributors.

==Misconduct==
{{main|Fraudulent trading|Undervalue transaction|Unfair preference|Wrongful trading}}
{{unref|section|date=April 2017}}
The [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] will normally have a duty to ascertain whether any misconduct has been conducted by those in control of the company which has caused prejudice to the general body of creditors. In some legal systems, in appropriate cases, the liquidator may be able to bring an action against errant directors or shadow directors for either [[wrongful trading]] or [[fraudulent trading]].

The liquidator may also have to determine whether any payments made by the company or transactions entered into may be [[voidable]] as a [[undervalue transaction|transaction at an undervalue]] or an [[unfair preference]].

==Priority of claims==
{{see also|Secured creditor|Preferential creditor|Unsecured creditor}}
The main purpose of a liquidation where the company is insolvent is to collect its assets, determine the outstanding claims against the company, and satisfy those claims in the manner and order prescribed by law.

The liquidator must determine the company's title to property in its possession. Property which is in the possession of the company, but which was supplied under a valid [[retention of title clause]] will generally have to be returned to the supplier. Property which is held by the company on [[trust law|trust]] for third parties will not form part of the company's assets available to pay creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''[[Quistclose trust|Barclays Bank v Quistclose]]'' [1970] AC 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the claims are met, [[secured creditor]]s are entitled to enforce their claims against the assets of the company to the extent that they are subject to a valid [[security interest]]. In most legal systems, only fixed security takes precedence over all claims; security by way of [[floating charge]] may be postponed to the [[preferential creditor]]s.

Claimants with non-monetary claims against the company may be able to enforce their rights against the company. For example, a party who had a valid contract for the purchase of land against the company may be able to obtain an order for [[specific performance]], and compel the liquidator to transfer title to the land to them, upon tender of the purchase price.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Coregrange Ltd'' [1984] BCLC 453&lt;/ref&gt;

After the removal of all assets which are subject to retention of title arrangements, fixed security, or are otherwise subject to proprietary claims of others, the liquidator will pay the claims against the company's assets. Generally, the priority of claims on the company's assets will be determined in the following order:
# Liquidators costs
# Creditors with fixed charge over assets
# Costs incurred by an administrator
# Amounts owing to employees for wages/superannuation
# Payments owing in respect of workers's injuries
# Amounts owing to employees for leave
# Retrenchment payments owing to employees
# Creditors with floating charge over assets
# Creditors without security over assets
# Shareholders ([[Liquidating distribution]])

Unclaimed assets will usually vest in the state as ''[[bona vacantia]]''.

==Dissolution==
{{See also|Dissolution (law)}}
Having wound-up the company's affairs, the liquidator must call a final meeting of the members (if it is a members' voluntary winding-up), creditors (if it is a compulsory winding-up) or both (if it is a creditors' voluntary winding-up). The liquidator is then usually required to send final accounts to the Registrar and to notify the court. The company is then dissolved.

However, in common jurisdictions, the court has a discretion for a period of time after dissolution to declare the dissolution void to enable the completion of any unfinished business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies Act 1985: Section 651|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/6/section/651|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Striking off the register==
In some jurisdictions, the company may elect to simply be struck off the companies register as a cheaper alternative to a formal winding-up and dissolution. In such cases an application is made to the registrar of companies, who may strike off the company if there is reasonable cause to believe that the company is not carrying on business or has been wound-up and, after enquiry, no case is shown why the company should not be struck off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies Act 1985: Section 652|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/6/section/652|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies Act 1985: Section 653|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/6/section/653|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in such cases the company may be restored to the register if it is just and equitable so to do (for example, if the rights of any creditors or members have been prejudiced).&lt;ref&gt;''Re Priceland Limited'' [1997] 1 BCLC 467&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event the company does not file an annual return or annual accounts, and the company's file remains inactive, in due course, the registrar will strike the company off the register.

==Provisional liquidation==

{{Main|Provisional liquidation}}

Under the corporate insolvency laws of a number of common law jurisdictions, where a company has been engaged in misconduct or where the assets of the company are thought to be in jeopardy, it is sometimes possible to put a company into [[provisional liquidation]], whereby a liquidator is appointed on an interim basis to safeguard the position of the company pending the hearing of the full winding-up petition.&lt;ref name=Practical&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-384-0074?service=finance |title=Provisional liquidation: a quick guide |publisher=Practical Law |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The duty of the provisional liquidator is to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the status quo pending the hearing of the petition; the provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company's assets to creditors.&lt;ref name=Worrells&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worrells.net.au/InsolvencyResources/FactsheetArticle.aspx?ArticleId=14 |title=Provisional Liquidation |publisher=Worrells |author= |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phoenix companies==
In the UK, many companies in [[debt]] decide it is more beneficial to start again by creating a new company, often referred to as a ''[[phoenix company]]''. In business terms this will mean liquidating a company as the only option and then resuming under a different name with the same customers, clients and suppliers. In some circumstances it may appear ideal for the directors; however, if they trade under a name which is the same or substantially the same as the company in liquidation without approval from the Court, they will be committing an offence under §216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (and equivalent legislation in UK regions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986: Section 216|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/216|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons participating in the management of the 'phoenix' company may also be held personally liable for the debts of the company under §217 of the Insolvency Act unless the Court approval has been granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986: Section 217|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/217|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}
The '''memorandum of association''' of a [[company (law)|company]] is an important corporate document in certain jurisdictions. It is often simply referred to as the '''memorandum'''.  In the UK, it has to be filed with the [[Registrar of Companies]] during the process of incorporating a company. It is the document that regulates the company’s external affairs,&lt;ref&gt;http://thelawstudies.blogspot.com/2017/01/memorandum-of-association-of-company.html&lt;/ref&gt; and complements the [[articles of association]] which cover  the company's internal constitution. It contains the fundamental conditions under which the company is allowed to operate. Until recently{{Where|date=November 2018}} it had to include the "objects clause" which let the shareholders, creditors and those dealing with the company know what is its permitted range of operation, although this was usually drafted very broadly. It also shows the company's initial capital. It is one of the documents required to incorporate a [[company (law)|company]] in [[India]], the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |  url = http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/memorandum-of-association/ | title = Memorandum of Association Law &amp; Legal definition | format = w  | accessdate = 2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Nigeria]], Nepal, [[Bangladesh]], Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and [[Tanzania]] and is also used in many of the [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mca.gov.in/SearchableActs/Schedule1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements: United Kingdom==
It is still a requirement to file a memorandum of association to incorporate a new company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |  url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/memorandum%20of%20association | title = Memorandum of association  | format = w  | accessdate = 2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it contains less information than was required before 1 October 2010. The [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3014/pdfs/uksi_20083014_en.pdf Companies (Registration) Regulation 2008] included pro-forma Memoranda.

It is basically a statement that the subscribers wish to form a company under the Companies Act 2006, have agreed to become members and, in the case of a company that is to have a share capital, to take at least one share each. It is no longer required to state the name of the company, the type of company (such as public limited company or private company limited by shares), the location of its registered office, the objects of the company, and its authorised share capital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/companyRegistration.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Companies incorporated prior to 1 October 2009 are not required to amend their memorandum. Those details which are now required to appear in the Articles, such as the objects clause and details of the share capital, are deemed to form a part of the Articles.

==Capacities==
The memorandum no longer restricts the activities of a company.  Since 1 October 2009, if a company's constitution contains any restrictions on the objects at all, those restrictions will form part of the articles of association.

Historically, a company's memorandum of association contained an objects clause, which limited its capacity to act. When the first limited companies were incorporated, the objects clause had to be widely drafted so as not to restrict the board of directors in their day to day trading.  In the Companies Act 1989, the term "General Commercial Company" was introduced which meant that companies could undertake "any lawful or legal trade or business."

[[File:ביאור על התורה.pdf|thumb|right|Title page of the first edition of Rabbi Recanati's commentary on the Torah (Venice, 1523)|page=7]]
'''Menahem ben Benjamin Recanati''' (1223–1290)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=81pbBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=menahem+recanati+1223&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iRNPX_IUca&amp;sig=Dk8FmpTVPqorfsf9AtdkBQpc2NY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb2MCYq5zYAhWISd8KHZfwAbgQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=menahem%20recanati%201223&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-he|מנחם בן בנימין ריקנטי}}) was an [[Italy|Italian]] rabbi who flourished during the thirteenth century . He devoted the chief part of his writings to the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

== Description ==

Menahem Recanati was born in Recanati in 1223 and he died in Recanati in 1290 . In addition to the halachic rulings collected in Piskei Recanati (his only halachic work), Recanati wrote a kabbalistic commentary on the [[Torah]], a commentary on the [[siddur]], and discussions of the [[613 commandments|commandments]]. Piskei Recanati was first published in [[Bologna]], 1538, and was published several times thereafter.

== Works ==
Recanati wrote:
* ''Perush 'Al ha-Torah'' (Venice, 1523), a work full of mystical deductions and meanings based upon a textual interpretation of the [[Bible]]; it describes many visions and celestial revelations claimed to have been experienced by the author, who was influenced by cabalistic ideas, and expresses the highest respect for all cabalistical authors, even the most recent apocryphal ones. The work was republished with a commentary by [[Mordecai Jaffe]], at Lublin in 1595&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1595|script-title=he:לבֿושׁי אור יקרותֿ|trans-title=Mordecai Jaffe's commentary on Recanati|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/11562|language=he|location=Lublin|oclc=233048483|access-date=Jan 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also translated into [[Latin]] by [[Pico di Mirandola]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt;
* ''Perush ha-Tefillot'' and ''Ṭa'ame ha-Miẓwot,'' published together (Constantinople, 1543–1544; Basel, 1581). Like the preceding work, these are strongly tinctured with German mysticism. Recanati frequently quotes [[Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg|Judah he-Hasid]] of [[Regensburg]], [[Eleazar of Worms]], and their disciples, and alludes also to the Spanish cabalists, [[Nahmanides]] among them. He is rarely original, quoting almost always other authorities. Although Recanati had a high reputation for sanctity, he exercised less influence on his contemporaries than upon posterity. To assist him in his cabalistic researches, he studied logic and [[philosophy]]; and he endeavors to support the cabala by philosophical arguments.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

'''Merton Howard Miller''' (May 16, 1923 – June 3, 2000) was an American economist, and the co-author of the [[Modigliani–Miller theorem]] (1958), which proposed the irrelevance of debt-equity structure. He shared the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1990, along with [[Harry Markowitz]] and [[William F. Sharpe]]. Miller spent most of his academic career at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Booth School of Business]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Miller was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to Jewish parents Sylvia and Joel Miller,&lt;ref name=nndb&gt;{{cite web | title=Merton H. Miller | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/174/000159694/ | work=The Notable Names Database| year=2008 | accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174966865|title=Encyclopedia of American Jewish history|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|others=Norwood, Stephen H. (Stephen Harlan), 1951-, Pollack, Eunice G.|isbn=1851096388|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=174966865}}&lt;/ref&gt; a housewife and attorney. He worked during [[World War II]] as an economist in the division of tax research of the Treasury Department, and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Johns Hopkins University]], 1952. His first academic appointment after receiving his doctorate was Visiting Assistant Lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]].

===Career===
In 1958, at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]), he collaborated with his colleague [[Franco Modigliani]] on the paper ''The Cost of Capital, Corporate Finance and the Theory of Investment''. This paper urged a fundamental objection to the traditional view of [[corporate finance]], according to which a corporation can reduce its [[cost of capital]] by finding the right debt-to-equity ratio. According to the [[Modigliani–Miller theorem]], on the other hand, there is no right ratio, so corporate managers should seek to minimize tax liability and maximize corporate net wealth, letting the debt ratio chips fall where they will.

The way in which they arrived at this conclusion made use of the "no [[arbitrage]]" argument, i.e. the [[premise]] that any state of affairs that will allow traders of any market instrument to create a riskless money machine will almost immediately disappear. They set the pattern for many arguments based on that premise in subsequent years.

Miller wrote or co-authored eight books. He became a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1975 and was president of the American Finance Association in 1976. He was on the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Booth School of Business]] from 1961 until his retirement in 1993, although he continued teaching at the school for several more years.

His works formed the basis of the "Modigliani-Miller Financial Theory".

He served as a public director on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] 1983–85 and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] from 1990 until his death in [[Chicago]] on June 3, 2000. In 1993, Miller waded into the controversy surrounding $2 billion in trading losses by what was characterized as a rogue futures trader at a subsidiary of [[Metallgesellschaft]], arguing in the ''Wall Street Journal'' that management of the subsidiary was to blame for panicking and liquidating the position too early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Markham|first1=Jerry W.|title=A Financial History of Modern U.S. Corporate Scandals: From Enron to Reform|date=2006|publisher=M.E.

Activities identified as elements of the promotional mix vary, but typically include the following:

* [[Advertising]] is the paid presentation and promotion of ideas, goods, or services by an identified sponsor in a mass medium. Examples include print ads, radio, television, billboard, direct mail, brochures and catalogs, signs, in-store displays, posters, mobile apps, motion pictures, web pages, banner ads, emails.&lt;ref name=twsBoone/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLamb/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrell Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLongenecker/&gt;
* [[Personal selling]] is the process of helping and persuading one or more prospects to purchase a good or service or to act on any idea through the use of an oral presentation, often in a face-to-face manner or by telephone. Examples include sales presentations, sales meetings, sales training and incentive programs for intermediary salespeople, samples, and telemarketing.&lt;ref name=twsBoone/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLamb/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMullin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrell Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLongenecker/&gt; 
*[[Sales Promotion]] is media and non-media marketing communication used for a pre-determined limited time to increase consumer demand, stimulate market demand or improve product availability. Examples include coupons, sweepstakes, contests, product samples, rebates, tie-ins, self-liquidating premiums, trade shows, trade-ins, and exhibitions.&lt;ref name=twsBoone/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLamb/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrell Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLongenecker/&gt;
* [[Public relations]] or [[publicity]] is information about a firm's products and services carried by a third party in an indirect way. This includes free publicity as well as paid efforts to stimulate discussion and interest. It can be accomplished by planting a significant news story indirectly in the media, or presenting it favorably through [[press release]]s or [[corporate anniversary|corporate anniversary parties]]. Examples include newspaper and magazine articles, TVs and radio presentations, charitable contributions, speeches, issue advertising, seminars.&lt;ref name=twsBoone/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLamb/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrell Book"/&gt;
*[[Direct Marketing]] is a channel-agnostic form of advertising that allows businesses and nonprofits to communicate directly to the customer, with methods such as mobile messaging, email, interactive consumer websites, online display ads, fliers, catalog distribution, promotional letters, and outdoor advertising.&lt;ref name=twsBoone/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrell Book"/&gt;
*[[Corporate image]] campaigns have been considered as part of the promotional mix.&lt;ref name="Harrell Book"/&gt;
*[[sponsor (commercial)|Sponsorship]] of an event or contest or race is a way to generate further positive publicity.&lt;ref name="Harrell Book" /&gt;
*[[Guerrilla marketing]] tactics are unconventional ways to bring attention to an idea or product or service, such as by using graffiti, sticker bombing, posting flyers, using flash mobs, doing viral marketing campaigns, or other methods using the Internet in unexpected ways.&lt;ref name=twsBoone/&gt;
*[[Product placement]] is paying a movie studio or television show to include a product or service prominently in the show.&lt;ref name=twsBoone/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">[[File:Sir Robert Nivison.png|thumb|right]]
'''Robert Nivison, 1st Baron Glendyne''' (3 July 1849 &amp;ndash; 14 June 1930) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[stockbroker]].

Nivison was the son of John Nivison, a [[colliery]] manager of [[Sanquhar]] in [[Dumfriesshire]]. At the age of fifteen he joined the local branch of the [[British Linen Bank]] as a junior clerk. In 1869 he joined the [[London and Westminster Bank]], later moving to the head office in [[London]]. In 1881 he switched careers, becoming a junior partner of the stockbrokers T. P. Baptie, becoming a member of the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1883. In 1886, he established his own firm, R. Nivison &amp; Co. It became a very successful business, especially after 1891, when it began to act as stockbroker to the governments of the [[Dominion]]s.

For his services to the British and Dominion governments Nivison was created a [[Baronet]] in 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28854 |date=31 July 1914 |page=5963}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised to the peerage as [[Baron Glendyne]], of Sanquhar in the County of Dumfries,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32598 |date=3 February 1922 |page=954}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[1922 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32563 |date=30 December 1921 |page=10709 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Glendyne married Jane, daughter of John Wightman, of [[Sanquhar]], [[Dumfriesshire]], in 1877. He died in June 1930, aged 80, and was succeeded in his titles by his son [[John Nivison, 2nd Baron Glendyne|John]].

'''Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc.''' is a company that provides services such as collecting and recycling oil, providing industrial cleaning, and handling [[industrial waste]].  In addition, their products include cleaning equipment, [[antifreeze]] and [[coolant]], windshield cleaner, and re-refined oil products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safety-kleen.com/products/Pages/Products.aspx Safety-Kleen.com - Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Safety-Kleen was started in the late 1950s and early 1960s when Ben Palmer invented the [[parts washer]] which he decided to [[lease]] to customers and service by removing and replenishing the solvent in the machines. In 1968, the Safety-Kleen business was acquired by Chicago Rawhide, and under the leadership of Don Brinckman Safety-Kleen became a [[public company|publicly traded company]] and enjoyed tremendous growth and business success over 30 years, eventually joining the [[Fortune 500]].

In 1998, Safety-Kleen fell victim to a [[hostile takeover]] by Laidlaw Environmental. Afterwards, the financial situation of the company deteriorated and finally the company filed for and re-emerged from [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="story"&gt;[http://www.safety-kleen.com/AboutUs/Pages/OurStory.aspx Safety-Kleen.com - Our Story]&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, the company hid the failure of the merger&lt;ref&gt;Executives engaged in the illegal conduct to create the illusion that predicted cost savings and business synergies from two large acquisitions were being achieved [https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17891.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002, civil and criminal charges were filed by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the United States Attorney's Office against Safety-Kleen and four of its former senior executives for "perpetrating a massive accounting fraud from at least November 1998 through March 2000."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17891.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A $200 million judgement was subsequently enforced by a Canadian court.&lt;ref&gt;http://zvulony.ca/2011/articles/international-law/us-judgment-enforced-canada/&lt;/ref&gt;

The company successfully emerged from bankruptcy&lt;ref name="story" /&gt; and refinanced its senior debt in 2005.

In 2012, [[Clean Harbors]] acquired Safety-Kleen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/clean-harbors-to-buy-safety-kleen-for-1-25-billion/ Clean Harbors to Acquire Safety-Kleen for $1.25 Billion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety-kleen is also an official partner of [[NASCAR]] as part of the NASCAR green initiative. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/en_us/sponsors/safety-kleen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salvador María del Carril''' (August 5, 1798{{spaced ndash}}January 10, 1883) was a prominent Argentine jurist and policy-maker, as well as his country's first Vice President

==Life and times==

===Early life===
Born in the [[Andes]]-range city of [[San Juan, Argentina]], del Carril was a precocious student, and enrolled in the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|University of Córdoba]] Law School while still in his teens. Mentored by the school's prestigious ecclesiastical Dean, [[Gregorio Funes]], del Carril received a ''[[juris doctor]]'' in 1816, at age 18. He relocated to [[Buenos Aires]], the capital of the newly declared [[United Provinces of South America]], and following a stint as a journalist, he was appointed as an official in the Finance Ministry.

General [[José María Pérez de Urdininea]], Governor of his native [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan Province]] (which had recently seceded from [[Mendoza Province]]), called on del Carril to replace [[Francisco Narciso de Laprida]] as his Minister of Government in 1822, the highest-ranking advisory position. Amid the turmoil surrounding the [[Argentine War of Independence]], however, Pérez de Urdininea was returned to active duty in [[Bolivia]] by General [[José de San Martín]], leaving del Carril as Governor of San Juan.&lt;ref name=scarecrow&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina.'' London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of San Juan===
Taking office in January 1823, the 24-year-old Governor undertook an ambitious modernization program, commissioning the construction of roads, bridges, water works, public buildings and parks, purchasing the province's first [[printing press]], and establishing San Juan's first newspaper. Inheriting a province devastated by the wars, he ordered the first Agricultural Census and created a charitable association. The first lawyer to occupy the governor's post, he established San Juan's [[judicial system]] and in 1825, promulgated the "May Charter," the province's first [[constitution]].

The liberal May Charter, the first in Argentina to guarantee [[freedom of worship]] and mandate the [[separation of church and state]], also forced the closure of monasteries, and ran into arduous opposition from the [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Catholic Church]]. Facing a firestorm of protest, the governor was overthrown on July 26, and the May Charter was publicly burned.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

===National policy-maker===

Del Carril's efforts, however, had gained him the respect of the influential [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], a Buenos Aires lawmaker who, in 1826, was elected the first [[President of Argentina]], and who appointed del Carril Argentina's first Finance Minister. Saddled by the [[Cisplatine War]], the nation's finances became dependent on credit from [[Baring Brothers]] in [[London]], and del Carril offered the nation's exports as collateral. His introduction of the [[Argentine peso fuerte]] - the first local currency [[gold standard|convertible into gold]], and the first in Argentina with that name - concentrated wealth into exporters and others with access to [[hard currency]], making peso circulation scarce for the public in general and the war more difficult to finance. Rivadavia's [[Banco de la Nación Argentina|National Bank]] was mismanaged under del Carril, additionally, and unrest resulted in President Rivadavia's resignation in 1827.

The dissolution of national government ensued within months, in favor of an [[Argentine Confederation]]. The advent of the populist Governor of [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Manuel Dorrego]], was opposed by del Carril, who became an adviser to a conservative insurrection led by General [[Juan Lavalle]]. Lavalle's violent 1828 overthrow of Dorrego returned del Carril to the cabinet as Finance and [[Foreign relations of Argentina|Foreign Minister]]. A countercoup led by General [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], a supporter of Dorrego's, forced Lavalle to call elections, though del Carril's manipulation of the results triggered Rosas' overthrow and del Carril's subsequent exile in [[Montevideo]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;Levene, Ricardo. ''A History of Argentina''. University of North Carolina Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile and return===
Del Carril remained an active opponent of Rosas' while in exile, supporting a failed 1830 invasion of [[Entre Ríos Province]] and negotiating an entente with the Governor of [[Corrientes Province]]. He struggled financially, however, though these diffulties were mitigated by his meeting Tiburcia Domínguez y López Camelo, whom he married and had seven children with. Rosas' grasp on power began to slip after the 1838 [[blockade]] imposed by [[Louis-Philippe|France]] following the death of a French journalist in Buenos Aires, and del Carril was named Supply Commissioner to the [[French Navy]] fleet stationed in the [[Río de la Plata]]. His tenure in the post attracted controversy, however, when he became conspicuously wealthy in the process.

The 1843 overthrow of his ally, President [[Fructuoso Rivera]] of [[Uruguay]], forced del Carril yet again into exile, and he fled to [[Brazil]]. He cultivated a friendship via corrspondence with the powerful Governor of Entre Ríos, [[Justo José de Urquiza]], in subsequent years, and following the latter's defeat of Rosas' forces in the 1852 [[Battle of Caseros]], del Carril returned to Argentina.&lt;ref name=lopez&gt;López, Vicente Fidel. ''Historia de la República Argentina''. Buenos Aires: Sopena, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice Presidency===

Del Carril was elected to the assembly that approved the 1853 [[Argentine Constitution]]. Enmities remaining from the Rosas era thwarted an opportunity to return to the Governor's post in San Juan, however, and despite his personal efforts, Buenos Aires lawmakers rejected the new constitution. His belonging to the Buenos Aires-centric [[Unitarian Party]] and rapport with Urquiza (whom Buenos Aires distrusted) made del Carril an easy choice for the latter's running-mate in the elections that November, however, and their national unity ticket was elected handily in the [[electoral college]].

President Urquiza took care to preserve balance in his government between the two camps, placing the Vice President as a counterweight to the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalist]] Interior Minister ([[Home Secretary]]), [[Santiago Derqui]]. Del Carril became the most prominent voice for Buenos Aires interests in the administration, and compounded with a falling-out with erstwhile allies in his native San Juan Province, this ultimately frustrated his hopes that Urquiza might support his 1860 presidential candidacy (support which was tantamount to victory).&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Nominating Derqui instead, Urquiza's choice led to renewed conflict with Buenos Aires, and to Derqui's resignation and exile in 1861.  National unity on the brink, del Carril negotiated a settlement between Urquiza and the leader of the Buenos Aires insurrection, General [[Bartolomé Mitre]], and when the latter was elected President the following September, del Carril was appointed to the [[Argentine Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt; 
[[File:Recoleta 087.jpg|thumb|A memorial to del Carril sits atop his Recoleta crypt]]

Del Carril was a conservative justice, and reliably voted in favor of the executive's frequent use of [[state of siege]] declarations and [[capital punishment]]. This record helped him secure an appointment as Chief Justice in 1870 by Mitre's supporter and successor, President [[Domingo Sarmiento]], and an uneventful tenure ended with his retirement in 1877. He was again in the spotlight, however, after the 1881 publication by historian Ángel Carranza of correspondence between del Carril and Lavalle during the 1828 coup. The letters revealed that del Carril pressed for the duly-elected Governor Dorrego's execution, advising Lavalle that claims of a fair trial should be concocted, adding that ''"if we should need to lie to posterity, we lie."'' The former Vice President lived afterwards in seclusion, and died in his Buenos Aires home in 1883, at age 84.&lt;ref name=lopez/&gt;

===Epilogue===

Del Carril became a wealthy man, and in later life owned over 130,000 hectares (330,000 acres) of land in the agriculturally productive [[La Pampa Province]] (worth around a million dollars, at the time).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Debts incurred by his wife's spending habits strained the marriage, however, and the seasoned lawyer obtained a discharge of his responsibility for their repayment (leaving the debts in her name, solely). The couple subsequently separated, and after the judge's 1883 burial in an ornate [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] crypt, Mrs. del Carril commissioned the grave's sculptor, Camilo Romairone, to create a bust of her likeness - with its back turned towards that of her husband's; she died in 1898.

'''Walter Jodok Kohler Sr.''' (March 3, 1875{{spaced ndash}}April 21, 1940) was a member of the [[Kohler family of Wisconsin]] and was an [[United States|American]] businessman and politician. He was an innovative and highly successful Wisconsin industrialist. The [[Kohler Company]] was founded by his father, [[John Michael Kohler]]. Walter Kohler served as the company's president from 1905 to 1937. Walter Kohler was elected the [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|26th]] [[Governor of Wisconsin]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], serving one term from 1929 to 1931. A moderate, pro-business Republican who admired [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover]], Kohler sparred with the Left and Right in his party before and during the [[Great Depression]]. His son, [[Walter J. Kohler, Jr.]], also served as governor, from 1951 to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=2798&amp;keyword=kohler Kohler, Walter Jodok 1875–1940&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Walter Kohler was born on March 3, 1875 in [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]], the third of six children born to industrialist and civic leader John Michael Kohler II (1844–1900) and his wife, the former Lillie Vollrath (1848–1883). John Michael headed a prosperous company selling iron and plumbing products, as well as enamelware. Lillie's father was a wealthy local businessman in the same general field. The Kohlers and the Vollraths have enjoyed close family and business relations to this day.

Walter grew up in the family's home in Sheboygan.  His formal education stopped at the eighth grade when at age 15 he persuaded his father to hire him full-time in the company business.

Five years after his father's death in 1900, 30-year-old Walter took over what would soon be called the [[Kohler Company]].  A few days before his father died, Walter married Charlotte Henrietta "Lottie" Schroeder (1869–1947), a Kenosha school teacher. They had four sons: John Michael Kohler III (1902–68), [[Walter J. Kohler Jr.|Walter Jodok Jr.]] (1904–76), Carl James (1905–60), and Robert Eugene (1908–90).

In the early 1920s, Walter built a lavish estate named [[Riverbend (estate)|Riverbend]]. It was constructed near the family factory in what was now the [[Kohler, Wisconsin|Village of Kohler]], four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) west of Sheboygan. Riverbend's estimated cost was over $1 million; in 1928 it seems that Walter's total income was $3 million a year.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Kohler was highly active in civic affairs and Republican Party (GOP) politics, but devoted almost all of his time and considerable energy to his growing and successful company. The great depression, two reelection defeats, a violent company strike, and a federal lawsuit severely affected him. He died in 1940, and the corporate reins were given to Walter's half-brother Herbert Vollrath Kohler (1891–1968), who had spent much of his life laboring in the factory.

==Business career==
The Kohler Company grew rapidly in the early twentieth century, developing new products such as the industry's first one-piece built-in bathtub.  By 1914, the Company employed 950 people and had sales offices in four major American cities and in London. In the First World War, the Company shifted to production of war materials. But in the 1920s it expanded its products and sales, building, among other things, a motor powered dishwasher, an electric clothes washer, and a gasoline powered generator. Kohler created the world's largest pottery plant in order to mass-produce toilets and sinks.

Kohler reduced work hours for his employees, paid above-average salaries, provided group life and health insurance and workingmen's compensation, and presented holiday and retirement gifts.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Beginning in 1917, his plan for a nearby housing complex for Kohler workers began to become a reality. Kohler Village, a {{convert|4.5|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area, was designed to provide high quality and affordable home ownership in a beautiful and rationally designed community. The following year, the Company opened [[The American Club (Kohler, Wisconsin)|The American Club]] across the street from the main factory, a Tudor-style living and recreational facility for some 250 newly arrived immigrants.&lt;ref name="Destination Kohler"&gt;http://www.americanclubresort.com/hotel/tac/tac_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression]] forced the Kohler Company to slow production and limit hours. Kohler tried to keep his workers employed and well-paid, but the cutbacks were unpopular. In 1934, some long-time employees and several outside labor leaders joined hands to call a strike.

==The Kohler Strike of 1934==
{{main|Kohler Strikes}}
Kohler was a staunch believer in the "[[open shop]]" and, along with many other industrialists, did not want national unions to represent all employees and dictate company policy. He and a majority of his workers{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} created a [[company union]] in 1933, but this did not satisfy labor leaders. A year later, with strikes breaking out throughout the nation, the [[American Federation of Labor]] focused on the Kohler Company. It made 14 demands, including a 62.5 percent wage increase. Kohler rejected the demands and shut down the plant.

The first [[Kohler Strikes|Kohler strike]] began on July 16. Pickets blocked access to the plant and violence on both sides quickly broke out. Bullets and [[tear gas]] entered the scene on July 27, and two men were killed and 43 injured before the National Guard arrived and restored peace.

In 1935 his employees voted to form a company union; but that same year Congress passed the Wagner Act, encouraging major unions to organize under the authority of the federal government and prohibiting company unions.

In March 1940 a federal grand jury indicted 104 companies, unions, and individuals on charges of conspiracy to freeze high plumbing prices. Among the companies named were the nation's three largest plumbing companies, including Kohler. The following month, Kohler died of a sudden heart attack. Friends and relatives attributed the death to the strike and to the federal government's challenge to his personal integrity.

A second Kohler Strike broke out in 1954, becoming the longest labor-management dispute in national history.

== As governor ==
Walter J. Kohler was a gubernatorial candidate in 1928. The Republican Party had dominated Wisconsin since its founding in the mid-nineteenth century, and winning the Party's nomination was tantamount to election. Still, it was badly split between conservative [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]]s and [[La Follette Progressives]]. Kohler was a Stalwart who been active in the GOP since being named a presidential elector in 1916.

Kohler put on a vigorous campaign, noting his success in business, his lifelong commitment to hard work, and promising to ignore the [[spoils system]] when making appointments and promotions. He invited voters to come to Kohler and view working conditions and the industrial village. Many did.

Walter was the first political candidate to travel through the state by airplane, covering {{convert|7280|mi|km}} in one two-week stretch. He also traveled by automobile, trying to reach the l.5 million voters in a 3 million population. Progressives condemned him for his "anti-union shop" attitude, but he countered with the fact that Company wages were 28.9 percent higher than the average state factory level, that 92 percent of all married men in Kohler owned their own lots and homes, and that 75 percent of them owned their own cars.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Kohler won the nomination by a large margin and went to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], where he and the legislature eliminated a deficit estimated at $3.5 million, streamlined state bureaucracy, built roads and state parks, and kept taxes low.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} But the Great Depression ended his political career.  Kohler seemed too much like his friend President [[Herbert Hoover]], and most voters wanted change. Progressive [[Philip La Follette]] won the primary and election in 1930, joining the state's two Progressive Senators in a popular attempt to end the financial collapse that was wreaking havoc throughout the nation and much of the world.

Kohler ran again in 1932 and won the GOP nomination for governor.  He voiced strong support for President Hoover, a tactic that backfired. Walter's political career ended as both Progressives and Democrats enjoyed the national landslide that put [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the White House. FDR carried Wisconsin with 63.5 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;Thomas C. Reeves, Distinguished Service: The Life of Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler Jr. (Marquette University Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blodgett"&gt;Richard E. Blodgett, A Sense of Higher Design: The Kohlers of Kohler (Greenwich Publishing Group, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
Republicans reclaimed the governorship in 1939, remaining in control of the office for the next twenty years. One of those GOP governors was Walter Kohler's son, [[Walter J. Kohler Jr.]].
