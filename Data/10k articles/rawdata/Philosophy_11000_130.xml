'''''A Christian reflection on the New Age''''' refers to a six-year study by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref name=HBook &gt;''Handbook of vocational psychology'' by W. Bruce Walsh, Mark Savickas 2005 {{ISBN|0-8058-4517-8}} page 358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reflection &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_new-age_en.html Vatican website ''A Christian reflection on the New Age'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; The study, published in 2003, is highly critical of the New Age movement and follows the 1989 document ''[[Aspects of Christian meditation]]'', in which the [[Holy See|Vatican]] warned Catholics against mixing [[Christian meditation]] with Eastern approaches to spirituality.

The document's title is '''Jesus Christ, the bearer of the Water of Life'''.&lt;ref name=reflection /&gt;&lt;ref name=America /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tablet /&gt; The document discusses the encounter between Jesus and the [[Samaritan woman at the well]], which it characterizes as "a paradigm for our engagement with truth".&lt;ref name=reflection /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ardura, O. Praem, in ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' Weekly Edition in English, 5 March 2003, page 7 also at [[EWTN]] [http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/pccardur.htm ''PRESENTATION OF HOLY SEE’S DOCUMENT ON NEW AGE'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The document considers the New Age based on "weak thought" and emphasizes the differences between Catholic thought and the New Age.&lt;ref name=reflection /&gt;&lt;ref name=America /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zenit /&gt; According to the review of the document in ''[[The Tablet]]'', "there is never any doubt in the document that New Age is incompatible with and hostile to the core beliefs of Christianity."&lt;ref name=Tablet /&gt;

Expressing general agreement with the views expressed by the document, Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], said that there would be widespread agreement among Baptists that New Age ideas are contrary to Christian tradition and doctrine.&lt;ref name=LATimes &gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/08/local/me-relignewage8/2 Los Angeles Times, February 8, 2003 ''New Age Beliefs Aren't Christian, Vatican Finds'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and overview==
The document was prepared in response to the need expressed by [[Catholic bishop]]s to have a clear directive about where New Age practices stand with respect to [[Roman Catholic doctrine]].&lt;ref name=NYT &gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 4, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/04/world/vatican-book-is-offering-reflections-on-new-age.html |title=Vatican Book Is Offering Reflections On 'New Age'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic News'' February 4, 2003 [''Vatican's 'proceed with caution' on New Age Movement'']&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the requests, the document addresses and provides Christian guidance on New Age phenomena that involve [[yoga]], [[meditation]], [[feng shui]] and healing by crystals and was published in 2003 as a 90-page booklet titled ''A Christian reflection on the New Age''.&lt;ref name=HBook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

The document was presented at a February 2003 Vatican conference on ''A Christian Reflection on the New Age''.&lt;ref name=EWTN &gt;[[EWTN]] February 3, 2003 [http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=33474 DOCUMENT ON CHRISTIAN REFLECTION ON THE NEW AGE]&lt;/ref&gt; Monsignor [[Michael J. Fitzgerald (bishop)|Michael Fitzgerald]] stated at the conference that the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age".&lt;ref name= VaticanState &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html Vatican website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|The Herald]] June 25, 2011 [http://www.herald.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13509:meditation-for-god-or-the-devil&amp;catid=43:entertainment&amp;Itemid=135 ''Meditation: For God or the devil?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Paul Poupard]], head of the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]], said that the "New Age is a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man."&lt;ref name= VaticanState /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm BBC News Feb 4, 2003 ''Vatican sounds New Age alert'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''False dawn: the United Religions Initiative'' by Lee Penn 2005 {{ISBN|1-59731-000-X}} page 228&lt;/ref&gt; Poupard, the Vatican's minister of culture, also warned that the New Age was based on "weak thinking".&lt;ref name=Guardian &gt;[[The Guardian]] Jan 31, 2003 ''[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/31/religion.catholicism Beware New Age, Vatican tells flock]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Franceschini, Giacomo - Gesù e la Samaritana al pozzo.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Water of Life Discourse]]'' between Jesus and the ''[[Samaritan woman at the well]]'', by [[Giacomo Franceschini]], 17-18th century]]

The document presents a highly critical view of the New Age movement and considers it as incompatible with and hostile to the core beliefs of Christianity.&lt;ref name=Tablet &gt;[[The Tablet]] February 8, 2003 [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/3695 ''Vatican grapples with New Age beliefs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; The document states that upon close examination it becomes clear that there is little in the New Age that is new, and that for Christians, the "New Age began 2000 years ago, with Christ". The document also criticizes the New Age movement, stating it is attempting to blur the distinction between good and evil.

By posing the question: ''Christ or Aquarius?'' the document states that the New Age often suggests an alternative vision of reality or an alternative way of improving one's current situation by magic. The document criticizes the view that the [[Age of Aquarius]] will replace the Christian Age. Referring to the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#16:13|16:13]]) that "No servant can be the slave of two masters", it states that Christians have only to think of the difference between the [[Biblical Magi|wise men from the East]] and [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] to recognize the powerful effects of choice for or against Christ.

The Jesuit magazine ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' commented that the Vatican directive was relevant to Catholic women in [[religious institute]]s because there are clear differences between Catholic teachings and the New Age that can become blurred within spiritual practices.&lt;ref name=America &gt;''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'', July 21, 2003 '' [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3067 Catholic Identity, New Age and Women Religious'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was also discussed at June 2004 Vatican conference attended by representatives of the [[episcopal conference]]s of 22 countries, as well as members of the [[Roman Curia]].&lt;ref name=NCR &gt;[[National Catholic Reporter]] June 25, 2004 [http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word062504.htm NCR Vol. 3, No. 44]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic News Agency]] Jun 15, 2004 [http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican_holds_consultation_on_new_age/ ''Vatican holds consultation on “New Age”'']&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conference, Alessandro Pennesi, a professor at the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] reiterated the Vatican warnings and stated that he agreed with the sentiment that the New Age is based on "ethical relativism" and that it is not possible to "isolate some elements of New Age religiosity as acceptable to Christians, while rejecting others."&lt;ref name=Zenit&gt;[[Zenit News Agency|Zenit]], June 30, 2004 [http://www.zenit.org/article-10501?l=english Why New Age Is a Challenge for Christianity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219060805/http://www.zenit.org/article-10501?l=english |date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and content==

The document has 6 main sections, as well as an appendix, and glossary of New Age terms.&lt;ref name=reflection /&gt; The main sections are:

:1. ''What sort of reflection''. This section discusses the context and timing of the document. It states that the [[Third Millennium]], two thousand years after the birth of Christ, is a time when [[astrologer]]s believe that the Age of Pisces is drawing to a close. Hence a time when the public is bombarded with the New Age message may be the right moment to offer an assessment of why it is not consistent with the Christian message.

:2. ''New Age spirituality: an overview''. This section provides an overview of the New Age Movement and its history. Referring to ''Harmony and Good Vibrations'', it criticizes the approach of being in tune with nature or the cosmos, claiming that it blurs the distinction between good and evil and creates the mindset that "we cannot condemn anyone, and nobody needs forgiveness".

::''Golden living'': The document claims that New Age practices can be associated with other practices, listing acupuncture, biofeedback, kinesiology, homeopathy, iridology and various kinds of [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], polarity massage, meditation and visualisation, psychic healing, healing by crystals, metals, music or colors, and twelve-step programs.

::''Wholeness and dualism'': The document states that the New Age encourages that we should overcome ''dualisms'', such as Creator and creation, the distinction between man and nature, or spirit and matter.

::''Central themes of the New Age''. The document claims that the New Age is not a religion, but is interested in what is called “divine”. Some common points in the New Age movement are:
:::* The cosmos is seen as an organic whole, animated by an energy, soul or spirit
:::* Credence is given to the mediation of various spiritual entities
:::* Humans are assumed capable of ascending to invisible higher spheres
:::* A "perennial knowledge" pre-dates and is superior to all religions and cultures
:::* People are encouraged to follow enlightened masters.

:3. ''New Age and Christian faith''. The document states that for Christians, the spiritual life is a relationship with God. It criticizes Eastern [[meditation]] and states that all meditation techniques need to be purged of presumption and pretentiousness. It states that Christian prayer is not an exercise in self-contemplation, stillness and self-emptying, but a dialogue of love, one which "implies an attitude of conversion, a flight from 'self' to the 'you' of God".

:4. ''New Age and Christian faith in contrast''. This section criticizes several elements of the New Age practices. For instance, it claims that New Age practices are not really prayer.

:5. ''Jesus Christ offers us the water of life''. The document re-iterates that the Church's one foundation is Jesus Christ, who is at the heart of every Christian action, and every Christian message. It refers to the [[Gospel of John]]'s account of the [[Samaritan Woman at the Well]] as "a paradigm for our engagement with truth".

:6. ''Points to note''. This section mentions several items, also stressing the need for pastoral guidance against the new age movement.

==New Age places==
The document names three key New Age places that it finds objectionable, [[Esalen]] in California, [[Findhorn]] in Scotland and [[Monte Verità]] in Switzerland. It also mentions the Open Center and the [[Omega Institute]] in New York.&lt;ref name=reflection /&gt;

The document states that the yearbooks at Monte Verità make it clear that there is an intention to create an "integrated world religion", and that it is fascinating to see the list of people who have gathered over the years at Monte Verità.&lt;ref name=reflection /&gt;

'''Alan Wilson Watts''' (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a British-American [[philosopher]] who interpreted and popularised [[Eastern philosophy]] for a [[Western culture|Western]] audience. Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], where he received a master's degree in [[theology]]. Watts became an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest in 1945, then left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].

Watts gained a large following in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] while working as a volunteer programmer at [[KPFA]], a [[Pacifica Radio]] station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to [[Eastern religion|Eastern]] and [[Western religion]], introducing the then-burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|youth culture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on [[Buddhism]]. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), Watts proposed that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]] and not a religion. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, "from a literary point of view—the best book I have ever written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915–1965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored human consciousness, in the essay "The New Alchemy" (1958), and in the book ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).

Towards the end of his life, he divided his time between a houseboat in [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]] and a cabin on [[Mount Tamalpais]]. According to the critic [[Erik Davis]], his "writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Alan Watts, age 7]]
Watts was born to [[middle class]] parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), in 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was subsequently lived in by author John Hemming-Clark in the early 1900s. Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin|Michelin Tyre Company]]; his mother, Emily Mary Watts (née Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a [[missionary]]. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Alan, an only child, grew up playing at brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1&lt;/ref&gt; Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; the Buchans, an interest in "ultimate things" seeped in. But it mixed with Alan's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Watts also later wrote of a mystical dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote "I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...".&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; These works of art emphasized the participatory relationship of man in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life, and one that he often wrote about. See, for instance, the last chapter in ''The Way of Zen''.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
By his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the [[Muscular Christianity]] sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked "Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin…"&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Watts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.

===Education===
Watts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as "[[wiktionary:presumptuous|presumptuous]] and [[wiktionary:capricious|capricious]]."&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

When he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a "rascal guru" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinović]]. (Mitrinović was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom. By his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors (e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]]).

In 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D. T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78–82&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].

===Influences and first publication===
Watts's fascination with the Zen (or Ch'an) tradition—beginning during the 1930s—developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. "Work", "life", and "art" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as "the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after 700 CE in China."&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a "popularisation of [[D. T. Suzuki|Suzuki]]'s earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading."

Watts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or "roshi"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 Watts and his wife left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Wilson Watts|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian priest and after===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
Watts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''. He later published ''Myth &amp; Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing—no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].

As recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]]; as well as [[John Cage]], the notable composer.

In early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Saburō Hasegawa (1906–1957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada Tōkan (1890–1967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well :  Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home.|last=HUDSON|first=BERKLEY|date=1992-08-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan credited her as an "important influence" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book "Nature, Man and Woman", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&amp;nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.

Watts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], "[[quantum physics|the new physics]]", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.

==Middle years==
After heading up to Braum's for a few years, Watts left the faculty for an easier career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station KPFA in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a "legion of regular listeners".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9–22 April 1962, p. 14. Retrieved at archive.org on 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio141paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 14, no. 1], 8–21 April 1963, p. 19. Retrieved at archive.org on 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Watts continued to give numerous talks and seminars, recordings of which were broadcast on KPFA and other radio stations during his life. These recordings are broadcast to this day.  (For example, in 1970 Watts lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Krieger, ''Hip Capitalism'', 1979, Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, {{ISBN|0-8039-1263-3}} pbk., p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kkup.org/sched/weekly.html KKUP Program Schedule]. Retrieved on 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpfk.org/index.php/programs/programschedule KPFK Program Schedule]. Retrieved on 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kgnu.org/schedule.html KGNU Program Schedule]. Retrieved on 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) Original tapes of his broadcasts and talks are currently held by the Pacifica Radio Archives, based at [[KPFK]] in Los Angeles, and at the Electronic University archive founded by his son, Mark Watts.

In 1957 Watts, then 42, published one of his best known books, ''The Way of Zen'', which focused on philosophical explication and history. Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen, in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.

In 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf Dürckheim]].&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959–1960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, "Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watts, "Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Watts became increasingly interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, pp. 333-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at [[Harvard University]] (1962–64), and was a Scholar at [[San Jose State University]] (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Watts - Life and Works|url=http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also lectured to many college and university students as well as the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deoxy Org: Alan Watts|url=http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819233823/http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lectures and books gave him far-reaching influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s–1970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weidenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Complaining about Alan Watts|url=https://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned sharply by students during his talk at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather "a philosophical entertainer."

===Experimentation===
Some of Watts' writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book ''Nature, Man and Woman'' and his essay "The New Alchemy") mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook. He later said about psychedelic drug use, "If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen."&lt;ref&gt;''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (''Psychotherapy East and West'' is a good example),{{tone inline|date=November 2014}} finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Applied aesthetics===
Watts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called "shared bohemian poverty".&lt;ref&gt;^ Davis, Erik (May 2005). Druids and Ferries "Druids and Ferries". Arthur (Brooklyn: Arthur Publishing Corp.) (16). {{cite web|url=http://www.techgnosis.com/index_druid.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016071701/http://www.techgnosis.com/index_druid.html |archivedate=16 October 2012 }} Druids and Ferries.&lt;/ref&gt; Druid Heights was founded by the writer [[Elsa Gidlow]],&lt;ref name=Davis2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |title=Druids and Ferries |journal=[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur]] |issue=16 |publisher=Arthur Publishing Corp. |location=Brooklyn |date=May 2005 |url=http://www.techgnosis.com/index_druid.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016071701/http://www.techgnosis.com/index_druid.html |archivedate=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Watts dedicated his book ''The Joyous Cosmology'' to the people of this neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. v&lt;/ref&gt; He later dedicated his autobiography to Elsa Gidlow, for whom he held a great affection.

Regarding his intentions, Watts attempted to lessen the [[social alienation|alienation]] that accompanies the experience of being human that he felt plagued the modern Westerner, and (like his fellow British expatriate and friend, [[Aldous Huxley]]) to lessen the ill will that was an unintentional by-product of alienation from the natural world. He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, "… cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix".&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Aldous Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like what [[Roman Catholics]] call "''[[coitus reservatus]]''". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.

==Later years==
In his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Chán]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as "Zennist" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him. Though known for his Zen teachings, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta, and spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution; how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego; how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.

Watts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in "Divine Madness" and on perception of the organism-environment in "The Philosophy of Nature". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures. He also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament; writing, for example, in the early 1960s: "Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin—especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.

==Death==
In October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]]. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over what they considered his [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 1973, he died in his sleep. He was reported to have been under treatment for a heart condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alan Watts, Zen Philosopher, Writer and Teacher, 58, Dies|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/11/17/80816134.pdf|date=16 November 1973|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was cremated very shortly thereafter. His ashes were split, with half buried near his library at [[Druid Heights]] and half at the Green Gulch Monastery.

A personal account of Watts' last years and approach to death is given by [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]] in ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Alan|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Chungliang Al|editor1-link=Foreword|editor2-link=Once Again: A New Beginning|title=TAO: The Watercourse Way (Foreword)|date=1975|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-73311-8|pages=vii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Mark Watts has prepared a biographical documentary that details questions surrounding his father's unexpected death and hastily performed ritual cremation on a nearby beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alanwatts.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===On spiritual and social identity===
In regards to his ethical outlook, Watts felt that [[moral absolutism|absolute morality]] had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.

He often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.

Watts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].

===Worldview===
In several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is – the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an "[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin," or "skin-encapsulated ego" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate "things" are merely aspects or features of the whole.

Watts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales – including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporters and critics===
Watts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his "Light[s] along the Way" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, "He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted."&lt;ref&gt;William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man&lt;/ref&gt;

Watts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kapleau 1967, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, "I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-Dc6ox4hYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22original+dwelling+place%22#PPA29,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice by saying, "A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away", and referring&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watts: ''The truth of the birthless mind'', from ''Out of You Mind'', Session 8, Lecture 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to  Zen master [[Bankei]]: "Even when you're sitting in meditation, if there's something you've got to do, it's quite all right to get up and leave".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haskel (ed.): ''Bankei Zen: Translations from The Record of Bankei''. Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called "sister", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''.

However, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying "we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, "You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]]."&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Watts [[Marriage|married]] three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). Watts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]], brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Stirling 2006, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt and moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called "Jano" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; where they lived on a [[houseboat]]  called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300–304&lt;/ref&gt; and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.

Watts' eldest daughters, Joan Watts and Anne Watts, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books. His son, Mark Watts, serves as curator of his father's audio, video and film and has published content of some of his spoken lectures in print format.

[[Jean Burden]], his lover and the inspiration/editor, of ''Nature, Man and Woman'', remained in his thoughts to the end of his life.

'''''Caesar’s Messiah''''' is a 2005 book by Joseph Atwill, which argues that the New Testament [[Gospel]]s were written as wartime [[propaganda]] by scholars connected to the Roman imperial court of the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian emperors]]: [[Vespasian]], [[Titus]] and [[Domitian]]. According to Atwill, their primary purpose in creating the religion was to control the spread of [[Judaism]] and moderate its political virulence. The Jewish nationalist [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealots]] had been defeated in the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] of 70 AD, but Judaism remained an influential movement throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region. Atwill argues that the biblical character [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] is a [[Typology (theology)|typological]] representation of the Roman Emperor Titus.

Atwill's theory contradicts the [[historical Jesus|mainstream historical view]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/was-jesus-real-joseph-atwills-covert-messiah-symposium-aims-settle-non-debate-1429378|title=Was Jesus Real?

== 1st century Flavian Christians ==
Some sources hold that the Flavian family took a very early interest in [[Christianity]]. Several of them were said to have converted to the religion, including Vespasian's nephew [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] and his wife [[Flavia Domitilla (saint)|Flavia Domitilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06098b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Flavia Domitilla|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legendary sixth-century Acts of [[Saints Nereus and Achilleus]], [[Pope Clement I]] was the son of [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 82)|Titus Flavius Sabinus, consul 82]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=31,342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04012c.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Clement I|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10751a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Sts.

On the basis of the assumption that at least some if not all this information linking the Flavians to early Christianity is correct, Atwill points out that these early connections are very difficult to explain if Christianity was a struggling [[grassroots]] movement originating in Judea. He said that the [[sacrament]]s of the [[Early Christianity|early Christian church]], its [[College of Bishops]], and the title of its leader (the [[Pontiff]]) were all based on Roman, rather than Judaic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acharya S]], in a review of Atwill's work, said that these Flavians were Chrestians, not Christians; and that the Chrestians were only one of several sects that were incorporated into later Roman Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murdock|first1=Dorothy|title=A Conversation on the Caesar's Messiah Thesis|url=http://freethoughtnation.com/a-conversation-on-the-caesars-messiah-thesis/|website=Freethought Nation|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typological representation of the Emperor Titus in the Gospels ==
[[Old Testament]] stories are often found to be echoed in the [[New Testament]], in a relationship in which the Old Testament model is called the "type" and the New Testament reprise is called the "antitype". The study of these types and antitypes is called [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. Atwill claims that similar typological relationships knit together the Gospels and the works of [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Works of Josephus, Complete and Unabridged|last=Translator: Whiston|first=William|publisher=Hendrickson|year=1987|isbn=0-913573-86-8|location=Peabody, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Village Voice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newton|first1=Edmund|title=Caesar’s Messiah: Rome Invented Jesus, New Doc Claims|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/09/26/caesars-messiah-rome-invented-jesus-new-doc-claims/|work=Village Voice|date=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atwill notes that according to the [[Preterism|Preterist]] school of biblical interpretation, the prophecies of Jesus and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] were fulfilled by the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. He suggests that this is evidence that the Gospels (including the prophecies of the coming of the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of man]]) were actually written after the Jewish war, and that the Gospels can then be interpreted ironically as predicting that Titus is the anticipated 'Son of Man'. However, as Atwill admits, his analysis (as well as the Preterist analysis) disagrees with mainline Christian interpretations of the biblical prophecy of the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, he argues that Jesus' mission foreshadows the military campaign of Titus in Judea. According to Atwill, this indicates that the Gospel authors wanted to signal that the character Jesus Christ, as the fulfillment of the [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecies]] of the Hebrew scriptures, was a representation of Titus Flavius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=1–2, 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zealots and [[Sicarii]] were also expecting a [[messiah]], but they expected that their [[hero]] would defeat the Romans. Instead, as depicted in the Gospels, Jesus was highly critical of the [[Kohen|Jewish priesthood]], and the [[Jewish deicide|Jews were blamed for killing this Messiah]], according to the Gospel texts. Furthermore, Atwill says that Josephus' narrative in ''[[The Jewish War]]'', is built around the idea that Daniel’s prophecy was fulfilled by Titus' [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|conquest of Jerusalem]] and the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. Atwill sees this as an ironic juxtaposition of events, as Titus Flavius (as the prophesied Second Coming of the Gospels' [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] Jesus) destroyed the Temple and conquered Jerusalem, and turned it over to the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythicist Biblical scholar [[Robert M. Price]] said that Atwill's view that Titus's conquest was the fulfillment of Jesus' prediction of the fall of Jerusalem, was "one of Atwill's most attractive suggestions." He agreed that the Gospels were based on Josephus, but said that the 'Son of Man' referred to mankind in general.&lt;ref name="Price 2006"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/rev_atwill.htm|title=RMP Reviews|last=Price|first=Robert|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Josephus’ satirical view of Christianity ==
Scholarly debate over Josephus’ knowledge of Christianity has centered on two explicit passages in the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'': the “''[[Josephus on Jesus#Testimonium Flavianum|Testimonium Flavianum]]''” (''Ant. 18.3'') and a passage that mentions [[James, brother of Jesus|James]] as the brother of Jesus (''Ant. 20.9''). Atwill argues that in addition to those brief passages, Josephus wrote several vicious [[satire]]s of the Gospel narrative and Christian faith, indicating that he was highly familiar with its tenets, but also disdainful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurs at ''[[The Jewish War]]'' 3.10, where Josephus describes an attack by Titus against Jewish rebels (led by a man named Jesus) at the [[Kinneret (archaeological site)|lake of Gennesareth]], in which the rebels are drowned and speared like fish. The [[Sea of Galilee]] (another term for the lake of Gennesaret) is the lake where Jesus told his disciples that they would become "[[fishers of men]]" in Luke 3:21. Josephus enigmatically describes the lake of Gennesereth as ‘a vein of the Nile’ where 'Coracin fish' grow. "Chorazain" was a Galilean rebel town, cursed by Jesus at Matthew 11:21. Atwill argues that the two events, both built on the "fishers of men" trope, must be read together to understand the satirical meaning of the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=38–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Wars 4.7,'' the rebel leader John is described as suffering a sort of inflammation or distemper. His party meets [[Vespasian]] at Gadara, where the rebels are driven into the River Jordan. The passage contains dense verbal parallels to the Gospel description of [[Legion (demons)|Jesus meeting the demoniac]] at the land of Gadarenes, who contains a legion of unclean spirits that enter into herd of swine and then drown themselves in the sea. According to Josephus, the Romans captured a ‘mighty prey’ of livestock, but no swine. Atwill conjectures that there were no swine captured because they had all run into the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=58–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel narratives of Luke 10:38-42 and John 12:2-3 describe a dinner just after Lazarus has been raised from the dead. "They made him a supper", John says, and "Mary has chosen the good portion." Atwill sees this as a macabre cannibalistic double entendre, and a parallel to ''Wars 6.3'', in which Josephus describes a woman named Mary who is pierced by famine. She roasts her baby son as if he was a Passover lamb, eating half of him while saving "a very fine portion" to be eaten later. "Come, eat of this food", she says, in words which (Atwill argues) are reminiscent of the Catholic eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=93–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wars 6.5'' describes the fate of a certain [[Jesus ben Ananias|Jesus, the son of Ananus]]. This Jesus cries "A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice against this whole people!" No matter how severely whipped, this Jesus simply repeats again and again, "Woe, woe to Jerusalem." Finally he says, "woe to myself also", and he is killed by a stone from the Roman artillery. In these passages, Atwill sees a parody of Jesus' sayings in Matt. 23:13-33, 24:27-25:1 and Luke 11:43-52.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=174–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atwill claims to have discovered another sprawling satire in the Gospels and Josephus, which he calls the "New Root and Branch." Atwill wrote: "The purpose of this particular satire is to document that the 'root' and 'branch' of the Judaic messianic lineage has been destroyed and that a Roman lineage has been 'grafted on' in its place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythicist [[Richard Carrier]] analyzed all of these alleged parallels, and stated that they can be explained as either coincidences, mistranslations, or references to Old Testament sources or tropes.&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

== The Testimonium Flavianum and the Decius Mundus puzzle ==
Atwill argues (contrary to many scholars) that the ''[[Josephus on Jesus#Testimonium Flavianum|Testimonium Flavianum]]'' (''Ant. 18.3'') is genuine because he sees it as the introduction to a literary [[triptych]]. Immediately following the Testimonium Flavianum is the story of Decius Mundus, who pretends to be the god [[Anubis]], to trick a woman named Paulina into having sex. Atwill sees Decius' name as a pun on [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]], a sacrificial hero of the Roman Republic. As the story continues, Paulina's husband Saturninus agrees that it would be no sin for Paulina to have sex with God. So Paulina and Decius Mundus sleep together, but Mundus returns on the third day to boast that he is no God. Atwill argues that Mundus' return is a parody of Jesus' resurrection, and that his worshippers Paulina and Saturninus have obviously been swindled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=226–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Bell, in his paper "Josephus the Satirist?",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Albert A.|date=1976-01-01|title=Josephus the Satirist? A Clue to the Original Form of the "Testimonium Flavianum"|jstor=1454525|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=67|issue=1|pages=16–22|doi=10.2307/1454525}}&lt;/ref&gt; speculated that the satirical nature of the Decius Mundus story was understood in the 4th century. According to Bell, the author of [[pseudo-Hegesippus]] may have elaborated on the joke by making Paulina become possibly pregnant by Anubis, thus making her parody of the Virgin Mary.

== Author ==

As a youth, Joseph Atwill studied Greek, Latin and the Bible at St. Mary's Military Academy, a Jesuit-run school in Japan. In college he studied computer science, and was co-founder of a series of software companies including Ferguson Tool Company and ASNA. After 1995, he returned to Biblical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Atwill|first1=Joseph|title=About the Author|url=http://www.caesarsmessiah.com/about.html|website=caesarsmessiah.com|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working with [[Robert Eisenman]], he authored a paper on radiocarbon dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|last2=Braunheim|first2=Steve|last3=Eisenman|first3=Robert|date=2004-01-01|title=Redating the Radiocarbon Dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls|jstor=4193320|journal=Dead Sea Discoveries|volume=11|issue=2|pages=143–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Atwill self-published another book, ''Shakespeare's Secret Messiah.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atwill|first1=Joseph|title=Shakespeare's Secret Messiah|date=2014|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781497579613|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing and marketing==
In 2006, ''Caesar's Messiah'' was published by Ulysses Press. The book carried an endorsement from Robert Eisenman, who wrote: "Challenging and provocative... If what Joseph Atwill is saying is only partially true, we are looking into the abyss". The work was also endorsed by Rod Blackhirst and [[Jan Koster]].&lt;ref name=atwillCM&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Messiah|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ulysses|year=2005|isbn=978-1569754573|edition=1st|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Atwill's thesis at ''[[The Village Voice]],'' Eisenman explained to reporter Edmund Newton that he has long believed that the Gospel texts were "over-written" to give them a pro-Roman slant. With his discoveries, "Atwill may have carried it a step forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/caesars-messiah-rome-invented-jesus-new-doc-claims-6436318|title=Caesar's Messiah: Rome Invented Jesus, New Doc Claims|last=Newton|first=Edmund|date=2012-09-26|website=Village Voice|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the book was published in German as ''Das Messias Raetsel,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ullsteinbuchverlage.de/nc/buch/details/das-messias-raetsel-9783793420910.html|title=Das Messias Ratsel|last=Atwill|first=Joseph|publisher=Ullstein Buch Verlage|year=2008|isbn=9783793420910|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which received several reviews in mainstream German publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/wissen/mensch/geschichte/interview-jesus-war-den-kaisern-eine-hilfe_aid_356977.html|title=Jesus war den Kaisern eine Hilfe|last=Online|first=FOCUS|website=FOCUS Online|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/146983.das-kreuz-mit-dem-heiland.html|title=Das Kreuz mit dem Heiland (neues deutschland)|last=Bossenz|first=Ingolf|website=www.neues-deutschland.de|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.zeit.de/user/berndkoch/beitrag/2008/12/25/das-christentum-eine-propagandaluege-der-flavier|title=Aktuelle Leserartikel|last=Germany|first=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg,|website=ZEIT ONLINE|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the book was used as a basis for a film by director Fritz Heede and producer Nijole Sparkis, with interviews with Atwill, Eisenman, Kenneth Humphreys, Timothy Freke and Dorothy Murdock.&lt;ref name="Village Voice"/&gt;

In 2013, the conference "Covert Messiah" was organized in London to discuss the film and the book's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.covertmessiah.com|title=Covert Messiah - 19 October 2013|last=Gilmore|first=Ryan|website=www.covertmessiah.com|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference attracted significant interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/story-of-jesus-christ-was-fabricated-to-pacify-the-poor-claims-controversial-biblical-scholar-8870879.html|title=Story of Jesus Christ was 'fabricated to pacify the poor', claims|date=2013-10-10|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027183920/http://news.discovery.com/history/religion/scholar-claims-jesus-was-roman-hoax-131011.htm|title=Scholar claims Jesus was Roman Hoax|website=DNews (Discovery Channel)|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/was-jesus-real-joseph-atwills-covert-messiah-symposium-aims-settle-non-debate-1429378|title=Was Jesus Real?

Atwill's 2014 book ''Shakespeare's Secret Messiah''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; expanded the thesis of Roman authorship of the New Testament, to suggest that the [[Pauline epistles]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] were written during or after the reign of [[Domitian]].

== Reception ==
The mythicist Biblical scholar [[Robert M. Price]] said that Atwill "gives himself license to indulge in the most outrageous display of parallelomania ever seen." Price acknowledges that the New Testament has "persistent pro-Roman tendencies", but says this was done "for apologetical reasons, to avoid persecution."&lt;ref name="Price 2006"/&gt; The mythicist [[Richard Carrier]] similarly stated that all of Atwill's alleged parallels can be explained as either coincidences, mistranslations, or references to Old Testament sources or tropes. However, Carrier also agreed that the New Testament has pro-Roman aspects. According to Carrier, "Christianity&amp;nbsp;''was''&amp;nbsp;probably constructed to 'divert Jewish hostility and aggressiveness into a pacifist religion, supportive of–and subservient to–Roman rule,' but not by Romans, but exasperated Jews like Paul."&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

Biblical scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman|Bart Ehrman]] said "I know sophomores in college who could rip this ... to shreds" and pointed out that Atwill had "no training in any relevant field."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ehrmanblog.org/conspiracy-nonsense|title=More Conspiracy Nonsense|last=Ehrman|first=Bart|date=2013|website=The Bart Ehrman Blog|publisher=|access-date=May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research areas==
Fehr focuses her research in areas of the [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of biology]], and [[feminist epistemology]] that have the potential to be directly socially relevant.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt; Much of her research is focused around issues of diversity; specifically, she argues that diversity of social and material location as well as diversity in philosophical background allows for higher quality research to be conducted than would otherwise be possible.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt; Fehr's research focuses on attempting to explain how people acting in [[good faith]] tend to resist acknowledging the systemic biases inherent in academia and other institutions, and on how to help alleviate these issues.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

==Publications==
Fehr has published a variety of peer-reviewed articles, including pieces in ''[[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]]'', ''[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]'', and ''[[Molecular Ecology]]''.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt; She has also contributed chapters to a number of books, including chapters in ''Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science: Power in Knowledge'', ''Oxford Handbook on the Philosophy of Biology'', and ''Removing Barriers: Women in Academic Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics''.&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

'''Charles Balic''' ({{lang-hr|Karlo Balić}}; 9 December 1899 - 15 April 1977) was a [[Croatia]]n [[Franciscan]] [[Mariologist]]. Friar Charles Balić was a famous Theologian, specializing in the figure and works of [[John Duns Scotus]], and Rector of the [[Pontifical University Antonianum]] of Rome. He was the founder of the [[Pontifical Academy of Mary]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pami.info/pamiculturaleView.php?lg=it&amp;id=351&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the [[International Scotistic Commission]].

==Biography==

[[File:Balic.jpg|thumb|Carlo Balic]]

&lt;!-- [[File:Balic01.jpg|thumb|Scotistic Commission]] --&gt;
[[File:Congress01.jpg|thumb|Mariological Congress]]

Karlo Balić was born in the village of [[Katuni]] near [[Šestanovac]], Croatia.
Entering the Franciscan Order in 1917, through the Province of the Most Holy Redeemer of Dalmatia, he was ordained to the Priesthood in 1923. Successively, he was sent to Louvain from where he received a Doctorate for a thesis on [[Franciscan]] Mariology of the 13th and 14th centuries.

Returning to Croatia, he served as lecturer in his Province until 1933, when he was sent to Rome to begin teaching in the new Pontifical Athenaeum Antonianum, where he gave his Inaugural Class, which was to become the beginning of his career. He later became the Rector Magnificus and had the Our Lady of the Assumption hall built.

[[Antonio Piolanti]] recalls Balić as “a titan of a man, built almost on an abyss of contrasts - a great soul of unlimited horizons and immense desires. A type of coincidentia oppositorum was easily detected in the vigorous spiritual physiognomy of this worthy son of strong and gentle Croatia: the heart of a child and Hieronymic impetus, the tenderness of a mother and authoritativeness of a leader, acute and penetrating intelligence, resolute and fiery determination, warm generosity and Dantesque indignation”.&lt;ref&gt;A. PIOLANTI, Abisso di contrasti, Roma 1977, pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

==President of International Scotistic Commission==
He was entrusted with the [[International Scotistic Commission]] [http://www.scoto.net/] to which he gave such a new impulse that he was considered a re-founder. He drew up, in fact, a new "way" for the critical edition of Scotus'[https://web.archive.org/web/20131224085652/http://www.scoto.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=89&amp;limitstart=4] Opera Omnia.

==Founder of the International Marian Pontifical Academy==
Charged by the Order to preside over the Commissio Marialis Franciscana, he founded, in 1947, the [[Pontifical Academy of Mary]] [http://pami.info], an entity for the coordination of all the Mariology Scholars of the world.

==Assumptionist Congresses==
Through the Academy, Balić began a series of Congresses on the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] which prepared the dogma of the Assumption: Rome 1947, Lisbon 1947, Madrid 1947; Montréal 1948; Buenos Aires 1948; Puy-en-Velay 1949; USA 1950.&lt;ref&gt;B. de Armelada, ''Padre Balić e i Congressi Assunzionistici Francescani'', in G. Calvo – S. Cecchin (edd.), ''Memoria eius in benedictione''. Atti del Simposio internazionale per il 1° Centenario della nascita di P. Carlo Balić (1899-1999), Città del Vaticano 2001, pp. 91-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pontifical Commission for the dogma of Assumption==
Balić participated actively as a member of the Theological Commission appointed by Pope [[Pius XII]] for the proclamation of dogma and the redaction of [[Munificentissimus Deus]] document.

==International Mariological Marian Congresses==
Seeing the valuable contribution to theological research by the International Marian Mariology Congresses, presided over and organised by Balić, the Holy Office entrusted him with the preparation of the document De Beata, to be presented to the Fathers of the II Vatican Council. During the whole of the council period, Balić showed he was one of the most active and useful experts, cooperating in the redaction of chapter VIII of Lumen Gentium. In 1975, in the Aula Magna of the Antonianum on the occasion of the Mariological Congress, Pope Paul VI thanked and gave homage to Balić for all he had done in the name of the Order for the good of the whole Church.

== Scotistic Congresses ==
Balić has organized the Scotistic Congresses: Rome (1950), Oxford-Edinburgh (1966), Vienna (1970), Padua (1976)

==Influence in the Vatican II==
Balić has been as expert during the Council Vatican II. He has worked in the editing of the chapter VIII of the [[Lumen gentium]].
The editing of the mariological text prepared by the Saint Office that will influence the editing of the chapter VIII of the ''Lumen gentium'' has been compiled by Balic.&lt;ref&gt;Suprema Sacra Congregatio Sancti Officii, Archivium, prot.n. 63/59 (1960.02.21)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in the mariology==
With Father [[Gabriel Roschini]] he was a represented of the “maximalists”. Balić and Roschini’s dream of having the mediation of Mary proclaimed shattered the conciliar halls. Recalling the strenuous battle conducted during the Council in defense of the Marian privileges, Father Balić, eyes bright with pain, said to Piolanti one day: “It was there that all my work was wrecked”.&lt;ref&gt;A. PIOLANTI, P. Carlo Balić o.f.m., Profilo, Impressioni, ricordi, Roma 1977, pp. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;
The attack against the maximalists was the publication of the book ''La question mariale'',&lt;ref&gt;R. Laurentin, ''La question mariale'', Ed. du Seuil, Paris 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Laurentin]], in which the “Marian movement” was presented as “a problem”. Laurentin’s book was refuted by a great mariologist, the jesuit Father De Aldama,&lt;ref&gt;J.A. De Aldama, ''De questioni mariali in hodierna vita Ecclesiae'', Pontifical Marian International Academy, Rome 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; at the request of Father Balić and Father Roschini, who in turn intervened in the polemics with a booklet called “The so-called Marian question”.&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Roschini, ''La cosiddetta “questione mariana”'', Vicenza 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
An austere, simple, kind and straight person, and tireless worker and lover of the Rule and Franciscan life, Balić was a studious Friar, investigator, writer and developer of publications and of congresses, having as themes the medieval Franciscan authors. His remains lie buried inside the Mediatrix of All Graces Church in his native Katuni.

Pope [[Paul VI]] «in sign of benevolence and appreciation than he had developed in the Church» wrote from him an autographs Letter ''Laetifica prorsus''.

'''Cornelia Isabella''' "'''Cori'''" '''Bargmann''' (born 1961)&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt; is an American [[Neurobiology|neurobiologist]]. She is known for her work on the genetic and neural circuit mechanisms of behavior using [[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]], particularly the mechanisms of [[olfaction]] in the worm. She has been elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and had been a [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] investigator at [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] and then [[Rockefeller University]] from 1995 to 2016. It was announced on September 21, 2016 that she had been named the incoming president of science at the [[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative]], effective October 1, 2016.  In 2012 she was awarded the $1 million [[Kavli Prize]], and in 2013 the $3 million [[Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences]].

==Biography==
Bargmann was born in [[Virginia]] and grew up in [[Athens, Georgia]], one of four children, and the daughter of Rolf Bargmann, a statistician and computer scientist at the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Crevar"&gt;Crevar.&lt;/ref&gt;

She completed undergraduate studies at the [[University of Georgia]] in 1981, with a degree in [[biochemistry]]. She completed graduate school from M.I.T with a Ph.D in the department of Biology in 1987 in the lab of [[Robert Weinberg]]. She examined the molecular mechanisms of [[oncogenesis]], and helped identify the role of [[Ras (protein)|Ras]] in bladder cancer. She also did significant work on [[neu]], an [[oncogene]] that later led to significant treatments in [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name="Marino"&gt;Marino.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bargmann then completed a postdoc with [[H. Robert Horvitz]] at MIT, working on [[molecular biology]] mechanisms of [[neuroscience]]. She began working on chemosensory behavior in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', and achieved several breakthroughs, demonstrating, among other things, that [[nematode]]s have a sense of smell.&lt;ref name="Marino" /&gt;

Bargmann accepted a faculty position at [[UCSF]] in 1995. She continued her studies of worm behavior and neural control, focusing on [[olfaction]] at the molecular level. She looked for genes similar to those found by Richard Axel and Linda Buck to be the basis of smell and taste, and found those genes in the recently sequenced genome of C elegans. Her work led to discoveries of the mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, such as feeding behaviors.&lt;ref name="Marino" /&gt; The work has continued to lead to a deeper understanding of the brain, sensory abilities, and neuronal development. Bargmann also identified [[SYG-1]], a "matchmaker" molecule—a molecule that directs [[neuron]]s to form connections with each other during [[development (biology)|development]].&lt;ref name="Rockefeller"&gt;Rockefeller, Jan. 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friend-2003"&gt;Friend, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Bargmann moved to [[Rockefeller University]].&lt;ref name="Rockefeller" /&gt; She served as an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute until 2016 before she took the President of [[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative|CZI]]. Bargmann’s lab uses a relatively simple organism, the nematode C. elegans, and its extremely sensitive sense of smell to study how genes regulate neuronal development, function, and behavior. Her work has been recognized with numerous awards including election to the National Academy of Sciences.

Bargmann is married to fellow olfactory scientist [[Richard Axel]], a Nobel laureate. Previously, she had been married to Michael J. Finney, who also completed graduate studies at M.I.T. and is now a Director at Sage Science, Inc.

For a vivid portrait of Bargmann as a young scientist working in Weinberg's lab, see Natalie Angier's book ''[[Natural Obsessions|Natural Obsessions: The Search for the Oncogene]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11706">'''Cyber-utopianism''' – the belief that online communication is in itself emancipatory, and that the Internet favors the oppressed rather than the oppressor – has accompanied the Internet from its beginnings; and was the subject of critique by the [[Critical Art Ensemble]] as early as 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Stepehn Wilson, ''Information Arts'' (2002) p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; While the romantic view of [[cyberspace]] was partially dented by the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]], utopian views of the internet continued to re-invent themselves through the [[Noughties]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Buckley/D. Clark, ''The Rough Guide to the Internet'' (2009) p. 312-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Rushkoff]] sings the praises of Web 2.0 by stating, "The Internet's ability to network human beings is its very life's blood. It fosters communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community... The ideas, information, and applications now launching on Web sites around the world capitalize on the transparency, usability, and accessibility that the internet was born to deliver".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas |date=2002 |title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative |publisher=Hampton Press |pages=26–28 |accessdate=Nov 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Internet censorship and surveillance by country|Internet censorship and surveillance]] across the world has led to a growing number of "cyber skeptics" arguing that repressive governments are able to adapt their tactics to respond to threats, using technology against the interests of dissenting movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:UA005.016.098.00001|title=The Impact of Information and Communication Technology on State Sovereignty: An Analysis of the Cyber Utopian and Cyber Skeptic Perspectives - Tufts Digital Library|work=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, cyber-utopianism, particularly in global politics, was powerfully critiqued by [[Evgeny Morozov]] in his 2011 book ''The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Sassower]], ''Digital Exposure: Postmodern Capitalism'' (2013) p. ix and p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging his own past as a cyber-utopian, Morozov calls the belief naive and stubborn for its refusal to acknowledge the downside – the opportunities for authoritarian monitoring and control – of cyber-space.&lt;ref name="morozov"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|title=The Net Delusion|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-353-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He goes on to blame the "former hippies" in the 1990s, for causing this utopian belief.
:"Cyber-utopians ambitiously set out to build a new and improved United Nations, only to end up with a digital Cirque du Soleil"&lt;ref name="morozov" /&gt;

== Origins: Californian ideology ==
[[The Californian Ideology]] is a set of beliefs combining bohemian and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] attitudes from the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with [[techno-utopianism]] and support for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism|url = https://www.amazon.com/From-Counterculture-Cyberculture-Stewart-Utopianism/dp/0226817423|publisher = University Of Chicago Press|date = 2008-05-15|location = Chicago, Ill.|isbn = 9780226817422|last = Turner|first = Fred}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs are thought by some to have been characteristic of the culture of the IT industry in [[Silicon Valley]] and the West Coast of the United States during the dot-com boom of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2 |title=The Californian Ideology |last1=Barbrook |first1=Richard |last2=Cameron |first2=Andy |website=Imaginary Futures |publisher= |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Curtis]] connects it to [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosophy. Such an ideology of digital utopianism fuelled the first generation of Internet pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;J.M Reagle jr, ''Good Faith Collaboration'' (2010) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further criticisms ==
Critical reservations about popular positivist readings of the Internet have surfaced repeatedly over the decades: In 2006, [[Andrew Keen]] wrote that [[Web 2.0]] is a "grand utopian movement" similar to "communist society" as described by [[Karl Marx]]. According to Shirky, "By lowering transaction costs, social tools provide a platform for communities of practice...Communities of practice are inherently cooperative, and are beautifully supported by social tools, because that is exactly the kind of community whose members can recruit one another or allow themselves to be found by interested searchers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |date=February 2009 |title=Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Everybody |publisher=Penguin Books |page=190 |isbn=978-0143114949 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=Nov 15, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an article from [[The New Yorker]] from 2010, Malcolm Gladwell argues his doubts about the emancipatory and empowering qualities of social media in general. In the article he criticizes [[Clay Shirky]] for propagating and overestimating the revolutionary potential of social media. In the conclusion he says: "Shirky considers this model of activism an upgrade. But it is simply a form of organizing which favors the weak-tie connections that give us access to information over the strong-tie connections that help us persevere in the face of danger."&lt;ref name="gladwell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=Small Change|journal=The New Yorker|date=4 October 2010|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber-utopianism has been compared to a [[secular religion]] for the postmodern world.&lt;ref&gt;B. Neilson, ''Free Trade in the Bermuda Triangle'' (2004) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognate utopias==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Cyber-utopianism is somewhat derivative of the views espoused by the [[Extropianism|Extropians]], whose ultimate goal is to upload human consciousness to the Internet.

Additionally, [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s books, especially ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', espouses a kind of cyber-utopianism, in that he views an event, the Singularity, where advances in technology will be so rapid as to represent a barrier after which life will be experientially different, incomprehensible, and advanced.

==Cyber-dystopia==

In August 2007, David Nye presented the idea of cyber-dystopia, which envisions a world made worse by technological advancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nye |first=David E. |date=August 2007  |title=Technology Matters: Questions to Live With  |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/technology-matters |location= |publisher=The MIT Press |page= |isbn=9780262640671 |accessdate=April 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber-dystopias center around the principles of the individual losing control, becoming dependent and being unable to stop change. Nye describes a society where the elite use technology to oppress and control mass groups of people. He also presents technology as a form of false hope; promising success and change, but causing pain and inconvenience when that goal is not reached. In her book ''Personal Connections'', Nancy Baym talks about the way a cyber-dystopia would negatively affect social interactions. "The dystopian alternative is usually articulated as a fear that new media will take people away from their intimate relationships, as they ''substitute'' mediated relationships or even media use itself for face to face engagement".&lt;ref name=Baym/&gt;{{rp|36}} She compares this fear with the fear that many felt during the introduction of the television and the telephone, as people grew weary about the potential for substitution of meaningful relationships.&lt;ref name=Baym&gt;{{cite book |last=Baym |first=Nancy K. |date=Apr 2010 |title=Personal Connections in the Digital Age |url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745643328 |location= |publisher=Polity |isbn=9780745643311 |accessdate=April 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28–36}}

The dystopian voices of [[Andrew Keen]], [[Jaron Lanier]], and [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] have pointed out that what we as a society are sacrificing to the cult of cyber-utopians is our humanity. Lanier describes it as "an apocalypse of self-abdication".&lt;ref name="Lanier 15"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lanier |first=Jaron |date=February 2011 |title=You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto |publisher=Vintage |page=15 |isbn=978-0307389978 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 15, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Lanier states that "consciousness is attempting to will itself out of existence".&lt;ref name="Lanier 15"/&gt; He then asks us to consider, "What is a person?".&lt;ref name="Lanier 15"/&gt; Lanier warns that by emphasizing the crowd we are de-emphasizing individual humans and when you ask people to stop being people, they revert to mob-like behaviors. Keen and Carr also agree that there is a dangerous mob mentality that dominates the internet. Keen states that rather than creating more democracy, the internet is empowering the rule of the mob and that rather than fostering a renaissance of social equality it has created a "selfie-centered"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Andrew |date=January 2015 |title=The Internet Is Not the Answer |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |isbn=978-0802123138 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 15, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; culture of voyeurism and [[narcissism]].

As Nicholas Carr states in ''The Glass Cage'', "the prevailing methods of computerized communication and coordination pretty much ensure that the role of people will go on shrinking. We’ve designed a system that discards us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carr |first=Nicholas |date=September 2014 |title=The Glass Cage: Automation and Us |publisher=Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0393240764 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 15, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== In politics ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2015}}Cyber-utopian discourses have been used in the political context, notably by the [[Pirate Party|Pirate Parties]]. In Italy, the [[Five Star Movement]] extensively uses cyber-utopian rhetoric, promising [[direct democracy]] and better environmental regulations through the [[World Wide Web|Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The web will kill them all: new media, digital utopia, and political struggle in the Italian 5-Star Movement|url = http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/36/1/105|journal = Media, Culture &amp; Society|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 0163-4437|pages = 105–121|volume = 36|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0163443713511902|first = Simone|last = Natale|first2 = Andrea|last2 = Ballatore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70109">A hallmark of [[Albert Einstein]]'s career was his use of visualized [[thought experiment]]s ({{lang-de|Gedankenexperiment}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Gedankenexperiment |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Gedankenexperiment |first=Sidney |last=Perkowitz |authorlink=Sidney Perkowitz |encyclopedia=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online]]'' |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as a fundamental tool for understanding physical issues and for elucidating his concepts to others. '''Einstein's thought experiments''' took diverse forms. In his youth, he mentally chased beams of light. For [[special relativity]], he employed moving trains and flashes of lightning to explain his most penetrating insights. For [[general relativity]], he considered a person falling off a roof, accelerating elevators, blind beetles crawling on curved surfaces and the like. In his debates with [[Niels Bohr]] on the nature of reality, he proposed imaginary devices intended to show, at least in concept, how the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] might be evaded. In a profound contribution to the literature on [[quantum mechanics]], Einstein considered two particles briefly interacting and then flying apart so that their states are correlated, anticipating the phenomenon known as [[quantum entanglement]]. 

==Introduction==
{{see also|Thought experiment}}
A thought experiment is a logical argument or mental model cast within the context of an imaginary (hypothetical or even counterfactual) scenario. A scientific thought experiment, in particular, may examine the implications of a theory, law, or set of principles with the aid of fictive and/or natural particulars (demons sorting molecules, cats whose lives hinge upon a radioactive disintegration, men in enclosed elevators) in an idealized environment (massless trapdoors, absence of friction). They describe experiments that, except for some specific and necessary idealizations, could conceivably be performed in the real world.&lt;ref name="Rawad2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=El Skaf|first1=Rawad|title=What Notion of Possibility Should We Use in Assessing Scientific Thought Experiments?|journal=Revue de la Société de Philosophie des Sciences|date=2017|volume=4|issue=1|pages=18–30|accessdate=28 April 2018|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13202/1/543-4973-1-PB.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428133949/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13202/1/543-4973-1-PB.pdf|archivedate=29 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to ''physical'' experiments, thought experiments do not report new empirical data. They can only provide conclusions based on deductive or inductive reasoning from their starting assumptions. Thought experiments invoke particulars that are irrelevant to the generality of their conclusions. It is the invocation of these particulars that give thought experiments their experiment-like appearance. A thought experiment can always be reconstructed as a straightforward argument, without the irrelevant particulars. [[John D. Norton]], a well-known philosopher of science, has noted that "a good thought experiment is a good argument; a bad thought experiment is a bad argument."&lt;ref name="Norton1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norton, John|year=1991|chapter=Thought Experiments in Einstein's Work |editor1-last=Horowitz|editor1-first=Tamara|editor2-last=Massey|editor2-first=Gerald J.|title=Thought Experiments in Science and Philosophy |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847677061|pages=129–148|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3190/1/8_norton.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601110138/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3190/1/8_norton.pdf |archive-date=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When effectively used, the irrelevant particulars that convert a straightforward argument into a thought experiment can act as "intuition pumps" that stimulate readers' ability to apply their ''intuitions'' to their understanding of a scenario.&lt;ref name="Brendel2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brendel|first1=Elke|title=Intuition Pumps and the Proper Use of Thought Experiments |journal=Dialectica|date=2004|volume=58|issue=1|pages=89–108|accessdate=28 April 2018 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fbf3/641682da1249147aaabce84fd99392f0d701.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428150735/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fbf3/641682da1249147aaabce84fd99392f0d701.pdf|archivedate=28 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thought experiments have a long history. Perhaps the best known in the history of modern science is [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses. This has sometimes been taken to be an actual physical demonstration, involving his climbing up the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and dropping two heavy weights off it.  In fact, it was a logical demonstration  described by Galileo in ''[[Two New Sciences|Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche]]'' (1638).&lt;ref name="Cohen2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Martin|title=Wittgenstein's Beetle and Other Classic Thought Experiments|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-1405121927|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein had a highly visual understanding of physics. His work in the patent office "stimulated [him] to see the physical ramifications of theoretical concepts." These aspects of his thinking style inspired him to fill his papers with vivid practical detail making them quite different from, say, the papers of [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] or [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. This included his use of thought experiments.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|26–27;121–127}}

==Special relativity==
===Pursuing a beam of light===
{{see also|Einstein's views on the aether}}
Late in life, Einstein recalled

{{quote|...a paradox upon which I had already hit at the age of sixteen: If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as an electromagnetic field at rest though spatially oscillating. There seems to be no such thing, however, neither on the basis of experience nor according to Maxwell's equations. From the very beginning it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. For how should the first observer know or be able to determine, that he is in a state of fast uniform motion? One sees in this paradox the germ of the special relativity theory is already contained.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1951"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|editor1-last=Schilpp|editor1-first=P.

[[File:Young Einstein chasing a beam of light.png|thumb|Einstein's thought experiment as a 16-year-old student]]
Einstein's recollections of his youthful musings are widely cited because of the hints they provide of his later great discovery. However, Norton has noted that Einstein's reminiscences were probably colored by a half-century of hindsight. Norton lists several problems with Einstein's recounting, both historical and scientific:&lt;ref name="Norton2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norton|first1=John D.|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=James Robert|editor2-last=Frappier|editor2-first=Mélanie|editor3-last=Meynell|editor3-first=Letitia|title=Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Science and the Arts|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=123–140|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124072020/www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing.pdf|archivedate=November 24, 2017|chapter=Chasing the Light: Einsteinʼs Most Famous Thought Experiment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. At 16 years old and a student at the Gymnasium in Aarau, Einstein would have had the thought experiment in late 1895 to early 1896. But various sources note that Einstein did not learn Maxwell's theory until 1898, in university.&lt;ref name="Norton2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stachel1983"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stachel|first1=John|title=How Did Einstein Discover Relativity|url=https://history.aip.org/exhibits/einstein/essay-einstein-relativity.htm|website=AIP Center for History of Physics|publisher=American Institute of Physics|accessdate=15 April 2018|archiveurl=https://history.aip.org/exhibits/einstein/essay-einstein-relativity.htm|archivedate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2. The second issue is that a 19th century [[Aether theories|aether theorist]] would have had no difficulties with the thought experiment. Einstein's statement, "...there seems to be no such thing...on the basis of experience," would not have counted as an objection, but would have represented a mere statement of fact, since no one had ever traveled at such speeds. 
:3. An aether theorist would have regarded "...nor according to Maxwell's equations" as simply representing a misunderstanding on Einstein's part. Unfettered by any notion that the speed of light represents a cosmic limit, the aether theorist would simply have set velocity equal to ''c'', noted that yes indeed, the light would appear to be frozen, and then thought no more of it.&lt;ref name="Norton2013"/&gt;

Rather than the thought experiment being at all incompatible with aether theories (which it is not), the youthful Einstein appears to have reacted to the scenario out of an intuitive sense of wrongness. He felt that the laws of optics should obey the principle of relativity. As he grew older, his early thought experiment acquired deeper levels of significance: Einstein felt that Maxwell's equations should be the same for all observers in inertial motion. From Maxwell's equations, one can deduce a single speed of light, and there is nothing in this computation that depends on an observer's speed. Einstein sensed a conflict between Newtonian mechanics and the constant speed of light determined by Maxwell's equations.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|114–115}}

Regardless of the historical and scientific issues described above, Einstein's early thought experiment was part of the repertoire of test cases that he used to check on the viability of physical theories. Norton suggests that the real importance of the thought experiment was that it provided a powerful objection to [[Emission theory|emission theories]] of light, which Einstein had worked on for several years prior to 1905.&lt;ref name="Norton2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stachel1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=John D.|title=Einstein’s Investigations of Galilean Covariant Electrodynamics prior to 1905|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1743/|website=PhilSci Archive|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=15 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704061550/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1743/|archivedate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnet and conductor===
{{see also|Moving magnet and conductor problem}}
In the very first paragraph of Einstein's seminal 1905 work introducing special relativity, he writes: {{quote|It is well known that Maxwell's electrodynamics—as usually understood at present—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries that do not seem to attach to the phenomena. Let us recall, for example, the electrodynamic interaction between a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon depends here only on the relative motion of conductor and magnet, while according to the customary conception the two cases, in which, respectively, either the one or the other of the two bodies is the one in motion, are to be strictly differentiated from each other. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor is at rest, there arises in the surroundings of the magnet an electric field endowed with a certain energy value that produces a current in the places where parts of the conductor are located. But if the magnet is at rest and the conductor is in motion, no electric field arises in the surroundings of the magnet, while in the conductor an electromotive force will arise, to which in itself there does not correspond any energy, but which, provided that the relative motion in the two cases considered is the same, gives rise to electrical currents that have the same magnitude and the same course as those produced by the electric forces in the first-mentioned case.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1905"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies ( Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper)|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1905|volume=322|issue=10|pages=891–921|url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/154|accessdate=17 August 2018|bibcode=1905AnP...322..891E|doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Magnet and conductor.svg|thumb|Magnet and conductor thought experiment]]
This opening paragraph recounts well-known experimental results obtained by [[Faraday's law of induction#History|Michael Faraday]] in 1831. The experiments describe what appeared to be two different phenomena: the ''motional EMF'' generated when a wire moves through a magnetic field (see [[Lorentz force#Force on a current-carrying wire|Lorentz force]]), and the ''transformer EMF'' generated by a changing magnetic field (due to the [[#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday equation]]).&lt;ref name=Norton2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller1998/&gt;{{rp|135–157}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] himself drew attention to this fact in his 1861 paper ''[[On Physical Lines of Force]]''. In the latter half of Part II of that paper, Maxwell gave a separate physical explanation for each of the two phenomena.&lt;ref group=p name=Maxwell1861&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clerk Maxwell|first= James|journal = Philosophical Magazine|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Physical_Lines_of_Force |pages = 11–23|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|title = On physical lines of force|volume = 90|year = 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Einstein calls the asymmetry "well-known", there is no evidence that any of Einstein's contemporaries considered the distinction between motional EMF and transformer EMF to be in any way odd or pointing to a lack of understanding of the underlying physics. Maxwell, for instance, had repeatedly discussed Faraday's laws of induction, stressing that the magnitude and direction of the induced current was a function only of the relative motion of the magnet and the conductor, without being bothered by the clear distinction between conductor-in-motion and magnet-in-motion in the underlying theoretical treatment.&lt;ref name="Miller1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Arthur I.|title=Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity: Emergence (1905) and Early Interpretation (1905–1911)|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-94870-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135–138}}

Yet Einstein's reflection on this experiment represented the decisive moment in his long and tortuous path to special relativity. Although the equations describing the two scenarios are entirely different, there is no measurement that can distinguish whether the magnet is moving, the conductor is moving, or both.&lt;ref name="Norton2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norton|first1=John D.|editor1-last=Janssen|editor1-first=M.|editor2-last=Lehner|editor2-first=C.|title=Cambridge Companion to Einstein|date=2014|isbn=978-0521828345|pages=72–102|url=https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/companion_final.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124071615/https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/companion_final.pdf|archivedate=Nov 24, 2017|chapter=Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity and the Problems in the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies that Led him to it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1920 review on the ''Fundamental Ideas and Methods of the Theory of Relativity'' (unpublished), Einstein related how disturbing he found this asymmetry: 
{{quote|The idea that these two cases should essentially be different was unbearable to me. According to my conviction, the difference between the two could only lie in the choice of the point of view, but not in a real difference &lt;in the reality of nature&gt;.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1920"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|editor1-last=Janssen|editor1-first=Michel|editor2-last=Schulmann|editor2-first=Robert|editor3-last=Illy|editor3-first=József|editor4-last=Lehner|editor4-first=Christoph|editor5-last=Buchwald|editor5-first=Diana Kormos|title=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein.

II.  The  Theory  of  General  Relativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} }}

Einstein needed to extend the relativity of motion that he perceived between magnet and conductor in the above thought experiment to a full theory. For years, however, he did not know how this might be done. The exact path that Einstein took to resolve this issue is unknown. We do know, however, that Einstein spent several years pursuing an emission theory of light, encountering difficulties that eventually led him to give up the attempt.&lt;ref name="Norton2014"/&gt; 
{{quote|Gradually I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and more desperately I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1951"/&gt;{{rp|49}} }}

That decision ultimately led to his development of special relativity as a theory founded on two postulates of which he could be sure.&lt;ref name="Norton2014"/&gt; Expressed in contemporary physics vocabulary, his postulates were as follows:{{refn|group=note|Einstein's original expression of these postulates was as follows: "1.&amp;nbsp;The laws governing the changes of the state of any physical system do not depend on which one of two coordinate systems in uniform translational motion relative to each other these changes of the state are referred to. 2.&amp;nbsp;Each ray of light moves in the coordinate system "at rest" with the definite velocity ''V'' independent of whether this ray of light is emitted by a body at rest or a body in motion."&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1905"/&gt;}}
:1. The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames.
:2. In any given inertial frame, the velocity of light ''c'' is the same ''whether the light be emitted by a body at rest or by a body in uniform motion.''

Einstein's wording of the second postulate was one with which nearly all theorists of his day could agree. His wording is a far more intuitive form of the second postulate than the stronger version frequently encountered in popular writings and college textbooks.&lt;ref name="Baierlein"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marquit|first1=Miranda|title='Relativity' Speaking|url=https://phys.org/news/2006-03-relativity.html|publisher=PhysOrg.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306013946/https://phys.org/news/2006-03-relativity.html|archivedate=6 Mar 2016|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|One popular textbook expresses the second postulate as, "The speed of light in free space has the same value ''c'' in all directions and in all inertial reference frames."&lt;ref name="Halliday1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=David|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Physics|date=1988|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-81995-6|page=954|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Trains, embankments, and lightning flashes===
{{see also|Relativity of simultaneity}}
The topic of how Einstein arrived at special relativity has been a fascinating one to many scholars: A lowly, twenty-six year old patent officer (third class), largely self-taught in physics and completely divorced from mainstream research, nevertheless in the year 1905 produced four extraordinary works ([[Annus Mirabilis papers|''Annus Mirabilis'' papers]]), only one of which (his paper on [[Brownian motion]]) appeared related to anything that he had ever published before.&lt;ref name=Stachel1983/&gt;

Einstein's paper, ''[[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]'', is a polished work that bears few traces of its gestation. Documentary evidence concerning the development of the ideas that went into it consist of, quite literally, only two sentences in a handful of preserved early letters, and various later historical remarks by Einstein himself, some of them known only second-hand and at times contradictory.&lt;ref name=Stachel1983/&gt;

[[File:Einstein's train and embankment thought experiment.png|thumb|330px|Train and embankment thought experiment]]
In regards to the [[relativity of simultaneity]], Einstein's 1905 paper develops the concept vividly by carefully considering the basics of how time may be disseminated through the exchange of signals between clocks.&lt;ref name="Norton_TheStep"/&gt; In his popular work, ''Relativity: The Special and General Theory,'' Einstein translates the formal presentation of his paper into a thought experiment using a train, a railway embankment, and lightning flashes. The essence of the thought experiment is as follows: 
*Observer ''M'' stands on an embankment, while observer ''M{{'}}'' rides on a rapidly traveling train. At the precise moment that ''M'' and ''M{{'}}'' coincide in their positions, lightning strikes points ''A'' and ''B'' equidistant from ''M'' and ''M{{'}}''. 
*Light from these two flashes reach ''M'' at the same time, from which ''M'' concludes that the bolts were synchronous. 
*The combination of Einstein's first and second postulates implies that, despite the rapid motion of the train relative to the embankment, ''M{{'}}'' measures exactly the same speed of light as does ''M''. Since ''M{{'}}'' was equidistant from ''A'' and ''B'' when lightning struck, the fact that ''M{{'}}'' receives light from ''B'' before light from ''A'' means that to ''M{{'}}'', the bolts were ''not'' synchronous. Instead, the bolt at ''B'' struck first.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1916"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=Relativity: The Special and the General Theory|date=1961|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-517-88441-0|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–31}} {{refn|group=note|Other than that ''M{{'}}'' witnesses the bolt at ''B'' striking before the bolt at ''A'', details of what ''M{{'}}'' observes are not often considered. An animation of a [[:File:Train and Embankment Thought Experiment And Its Inverse.gif|modified train-and-embankment thought experiment and its inverse is available here.]]  }}

A routine supposition among historians of science is that, in accordance with the analysis given in his 1905 special relativity paper and in his popular writings, Einstein discovered the relativity of simultaneity by thinking about how clocks could be synchronized by light signals.&lt;ref name="Norton_TheStep"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=John D.|title=Discovering the Relativity of Simultaneity How did Einstein take "The Step"?|url=https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/AE_1905_Tsinghua.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124073235/https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/AE_1905_Tsinghua.pdf|archivedate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Einstein synchronization]] convention was originally developed by telegraphers in the middle 19th century. The dissemination of precise time was an increasingly important topic during this period. Trains needed accurate time to schedule use of track, cartographers needed accurate time to determine longitude, while astronomers and surveyors dared to consider the worldwide dissemination of time to accuracies of thousandths of a second.&lt;ref name="Galison2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galison|first1=Peter|title=Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps|date=2003|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02001-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132–144;183–187}} Following this line of argument, Einstein's position in the patent office, where he specialized in evaluating electromagnetic and electromechanical patents, would have exposed him to the latest developments in time technology, which would have guided him in his thoughts towards understanding the relativity of simultaneity.&lt;ref name="Galison2003"/&gt;{{rp|243–263}}

However, all of the above is supposition. In later recollections, when Einstein was asked about what inspired him to develop special relativity, he would mention his riding a light beam and his magnet and conductor thought experiments. He would also mention the importance of the [[Fizeau experiment]] and the observation of [[stellar aberration]]. "They were enough", he said.&lt;ref name="Shankland1963_1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shankland|first1=R. S.|title=Conversations with Albert Einstein|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=1963|volume=31|issue=1|pages=47–57|url=https://archive.org/stream/EinsteinConversations/Einstein#page/n0/mode/2up|accessdate=17 April 2018|bibcode=1963AmJPh..31...47S|doi=10.1119/1.1969236}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never mentioned thought experiments about clocks and their synchronization.&lt;ref name="Norton_TheStep"/&gt;

The routine analyses of the Fizeau experiment and of stellar aberration, that treat light as Newtonian corpuscles, do not require relativity. But problems arise if one considers light as waves traveling through an aether, which are resolved by applying the relativity of simultaneity. It is entirely possible, therefore, that Einstein arrived at special relativity through a different path than that commonly assumed, through  Einstein's examination of Fizeau's experiment and stellar aberration.&lt;ref name="Norton_TheStep"/&gt;

We therefore do not know just how important clock synchronization and the train and embankment thought experiment were to Einstein's development of the concept of the relativity of simultaneity. We do know, however, that the train and embankment thought experiment was the preferred means whereby he chose to teach this concept to the general public.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1916"/&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

==General relativity==
===Falling painters and accelerating elevators===
{{see also|Equivalence principle}}
In his unpublished 1920 review, Einstein related the genesis of his thoughts on the equivalence principle: {{quote|When I was busy (in 1907) writing a summary of my work on the theory of special relativity for the ''Jahrbuch für Radioaktivität und Elektronik'' [Yearbook for Radioactivity and Electronics], I also had to try to modify the Newtonian theory of gravitation such as to fit its laws into the theory. While attempts in this direction showed the practicability of this enterprise, they did not satisfy me because they would have had to be based upon unfounded physical hypotheses. At that moment I got the happiest thought of my life in the following form: In an example worth considering, the gravitational field has a relative existence only in a manner similar to the electric field generated by magneto-electric induction. ''Because for an observer in free-fall from the roof of a house there is during the fall''—at least in his immediate vicinity—''no gravitational field.'' Namely, if the observer lets go of any bodies, they remain relative to him, in a state of rest or uniform motion, independent of their special chemical or physical nature. The observer, therefore, is justified in interpreting his state as being "at rest."&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1920/&gt;{{rp|20–21}} }}

The realization "startled" Einstein, and inspired him to begin an eight-year quest that led to what is considered to be his greatest work, the [[theory of general relativity]]. Over the years, the story of the falling man has become an iconic one, much embellished by other writers. In most retellings of Einstein's story, the falling man is identified as a painter. In some accounts, Einstein was inspired after he witnessed a painter falling from the roof of a building adjacent to the patent office where he worked. This version of the story leaves unanswered the question of why Einstein might consider his observation of such an unfortunate accident to represent the happiest thought in his life.&lt;ref name="Isaacson2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isaacson |first1=Walter |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |date=2007 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}}

[[File:Equivalence principle thought experiment.png|thumb|300px|A thought experiment used by Einstein to illustrate the equivalence principle]]
Einstein later refined his thought experiment to consider a man inside a large enclosed chest or elevator falling freely in space. While in free fall, the man would consider himself weightless, and any loose objects that he emptied from his pockets would float alongside him. Then Einstein imagined a rope attached to the roof of the chamber. A powerful "being" of some sort begins pulling on the rope with constant force. The chamber begins to move "upwards" with a uniformly accelerated motion. Within the chamber, all of the man's perceptions are consistent with his being in a uniform gravitational field. Einstein asked, "Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion?" Einstein answered no. Rather, the thought experiment provided "good grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity."&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1916/&gt;{{rp|75–79}} &lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|145–147}}

Through this thought experiment, Einstein addressed an issue that was so well known, scientists rarely worried about it or considered it puzzling: Objects have "gravitational mass," which determines the force with which they are attracted to other objects. Objects also have "inertial mass," which determines the relationship between the force applied to an object and how much it accelerates. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] had pointed out that, even though they are defined differently, gravitational mass and inertial mass always seem to be equal. But until Einstein, no one had conceived a good explanation as to why this should be so. From the correspondence revealed by his thought experiment, Einstein concluded that "it is impossible to discover by experiment whether a given system of coordinates is accelerated, or whether...the observed effects are due to a gravitational field."

==Quantum mechanics==
===Background: Einstein and the quantum===
Many myths have grown up about Einstein's relationship with [[quantum mechanics]]. Freshman physics students are aware that Einstein explained the [[photoelectric effect]] and introduced the concept of the [[photon]]. But students who have grown up with the photon may not be aware of how revolutionary the concept was for his time. The best-known factoids about Einstein's relationship with quantum mechanics are his statement, "God does not play dice" and the indisputable fact that he just didn't like the theory in its final form. This has led to the general impression that, despite his initial contributions, Einstein was out of touch with quantum research and played at best a secondary role in its development.&lt;ref name="Stone2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=A. Douglas|title=Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=2013|isbn=978-0-691-13968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–4}} Concerning Einstein's estrangement from the general direction of physics research after 1925, his well-known scientific biographer, [[Abraham Pais]], wrote:
{{quote|Einstein is the only scientist to be justly held equal to Newton. That comparison is based exclusively on what he did before 1925. In the remaining 30 years of his life he remained active in research but his fame would be undiminished, if not enhanced, had he gone fishing instead.&lt;ref name="Pais1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Abraham|title=Einstein Lived Here|date=1994|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-198-53994-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} }}

In hindsight, we know that Pais was incorrect in his assessment.

Einstein was arguably the greatest single contributor to the [[Old quantum theory|"old" quantum theory]].&lt;ref name="Stone2013"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The ''old quantum theory'' refers to a mixed collection of [[heuristic]] corrections to [[classical mechanics]] which predate modern [[quantum mechanics]].

* In his 1906 [[Einstein solid#Einstein's theory of specific heats|theory of specific heats]], Einstein was the first to realize that quantized energy levels explained the specific heat of solids.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=Albert|journal=Annalen der Physik|series=4|volume=22|pages=180&amp;ndash;190, 800|title=Planck's theory of radiation and the theory of specific heat|year=1906|url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/228|access-date=21 April 2018|bibcode = 1906AnP...327..180E |doi = 10.1002/andp.19063270110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, he found a rational justification for the [[third law of thermodynamics]] (''i.e.'' the entropy of any system approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero{{refn|group=note|This statement is only ''exactly'' true for perfect crystals.

* Einstein proposed the wave-particle duality of light. In 1909, using a rigorous fluctuation argument based on a thought experiment and drawing on his previous work on [[Brownian motion]], he predicted the emergence of a "fusion theory" that would combine the two views.&lt;ref name=Stone2013/&gt;{{rp|136–140}} &lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1909a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=On the present status of the radiation problem|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|date=1909a|volume=10|pages=185–193 |url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/371|bibcode=1909PhyZ...10..185E}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1909b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |date=1909b|volume=10 |pages=817–826|url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/393|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, he demonstrated that the Brownian motion experienced by a mirror in thermal equilibrium with black body radiation would be the sum of two terms, one due to the wave properties of radiation, the other due to its particulate properties.&lt;ref name=Norton1991/&gt;
* Although Planck is justly hailed as the father of quantum mechanics, his derivation of the [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|law of black-body radiation]] rested on fragile ground, since it required ''ad hoc'' assumptions of an unreasonable character.{{refn|group=note|Planck's derivation required that hypothetical "resonators" in the walls of a cavity take on ''equally spaced'' states of definite energy, with intermediate energies being forbidden.

* In 1924, Einstein received a short manuscript by an unknown Indian professor, [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], outlining a new  method of deriving the law of blackbody radiation.{{refn|group=note|Bose claimed that both  Planck's and Einstein's methods of deriving the law relied on a previously derived classical result, [[Wien's distribution law]], for the factor 8π𝜈&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which was "a most unsatisfactory point in all derivations." Einstein privately corrected Bose on this point, showing that he was wrong in believing that Wien's distribution law presupposed classical wave theory.}} Einstein was intrigued by Bose's peculiar method of counting the number of distinct ways of putting photons into the available states, a method of counting that Bose apparently did not realize was unusual.{{refn|group=note|When asked about whether he understood the fundamental implications of his counting method, Bose replied with great candor: "I had no idea that what I had done was really novel.... I was not a statistician to the extent of really knowing that I was doing something which was really different from what Boltzmann would have done, from Boltzmann statistics."&lt;ref name=Stone2013/&gt;{{rp|223}} }} Einstein, however, understood that Bose's counting method implied that photons are, in a deep sense, indistinguishable. He translated the paper into German and had it published. Einstein then followed Bose's paper with an extension to Bose's work which predicted [[Bose-Einstein condensation]], one of the fundamental research topics of [[condensed matter physics]].&lt;ref name=Stone2013/&gt;{{rp|215–240}}
* While trying to develop a mathematical theory of light which would fully encompass its wavelike and particle-like aspects, Einstein developed the concept of "ghost fields". A guiding wave obeying Maxwell's classical laws would propagate following the normal laws of optics, but would not transmit any energy. This guiding wave, however, would govern the appearance of quanta of energy &lt;math&gt; h \nu &lt;/math&gt; on a statistical basis, so that the appearance of these quanta would be proportional to the intensity of the interference radiation. These ideas became widely known in the physics community, and through [[Max Born|Born]]'s work in 1926, later became a key concept in the modern quantum theory of radiation and matter.&lt;ref name=Stone2013/&gt;{{rp|193–203}} {{refn|group=note|In his Nobel lecture, Born gave Einstein full credit for having been the source of his idea: "...we missed the correct approach. This was left to Schrödinger, and I immediately took up his method since it held promise of leading to an interpretation of the ψ-function. Again an idea of Einstein’s gave me the lead. He had tried to make the duality of particles - light quanta or photons - and waves comprehensible by interpreting the square of the optical wave amplitudes as probability density for the occurrence of photons. This concept could at once be carried over to the ψ-function: ψ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ought to represent the probability density for electrons (or other particles)."&lt;ref group=p name=Nobel&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/born-lecture.pdf |title=The statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics |last1=Born |first1=Max |date=11 December 1954 |website=www.nobelprize.org |publisher=nobelprize.org |accessdate=30 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Therefore, Einstein before 1925 originated most of the key concepts of quantum theory: light quanta, wave-particle duality, the fundamental randomness of physical processes, the concept of indistinguishability, and the probability density interpretation of the wave equation. In addition, Einstein can arguably be considered the father of [[solid state physics]] and condensed matter physics.&lt;ref name="Cardona2005"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Cardona|first1=Manuel|title=Albert Einstein as the father of solid state physics|eprint=physics/0508237|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provided a correct derivation of the blackbody radiation law and sparked the notion of the laser.

What of ''after'' 1925? In 1935, working with two younger colleagues, Einstein issued a final challenge to quantum mechanics, attempting to show that it could not represent a final solution.&lt;ref group=p name="EPR"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? | date = 1935 | first = A | last = Einstein |author2=B Podolsky |author3=N Rosen  | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 47 | issue = 10 | pages = 777–780 | url=https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325070120/https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 | archivedate=25 Mar 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the questions raised by this paper, it made little or no difference to how physicists employed quantum mechanics in their work. Of this paper, Pais was to write:
{{quote|The only part of this article that will ultimately survive, I believe, is this last phrase [i.e. "''No reasonable definition of reality could be expect to permit this''" where "''this''" refers to the instantaneous transmission of information over a distance], which so poignantly summarizes Einstein's views on quantum mechanics in his later years....This conclusion has not affected subsequent developments in physics, and it is doubtful that it ever will.&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|454–457}} }}

===Einstein's light box===
{{see also|Bohr–Einstein debates}}
Einstein did not like the direction in which quantum mechanics had turned after 1925. Although excited by Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, Schroedinger's wave mechanics, and Born's clarification of the meaning of the Schroedinger wave equation (''i.e.'' that the absolute square of the wave function is to be interpreted as a probability density), his instincts told him that something was missing.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|326–335}} In a letter to Born, he wrote:
{{quote|Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the Old One.&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|440–443}} }}

The [[Bohr–Einstein debates|Solvay Debates]] between Bohr and Einstein began in dining-room discussions at the ''[[Solvay Conference#Fifth Conference|Fifth Solvay International Conference on Electrons and Photons]]''  in 1927. Einstein's issue with the new quantum mechanics was not just that, with the probability interpretation, it rendered invalid the notion of rigorous causality. After all, as noted above, Einstein himself had introduced random processes in his 1916 theory of radiation. Rather, by defining and delimiting the maximum amount of information obtainable in a given experimental arrangement, the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] denied the existence of any knowable reality in terms of a complete specification of the momenta and description of individual particles, an objective reality that would exist whether or not we could ever observe it.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|325–326}} &lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|443–446}}

Over dinner, during after-dinner discussions, and at breakfast, Einstein debated with Bohr and his followers on the question whether quantum mechanics in its present form could be called complete. Einstein illustrated his points with increasingly clever thought experiments intended to prove that position and momentum could in principle be simultaneously known to arbitrary precision. For example, one of his thought experiments involved sending a beam of electrons through a shuttered screen, recording the positions of the electrons as they struck a photographic screen. Bohr and his allies would always be able to counter Einstein's proposal, usually by the end of the same day.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|344–347}}

On the final day of the conference, Einstein revealed that the uncertainty principle was not the only aspect of the new quantum mechanics that bothered him. Quantum mechanics, at least in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], appeared to allow [[action at a distance]], the ability for two separated objects to communicate at speeds greater than light. By 1928, the consensus was that Einstein had lost the debate, and even his closest allies during the Fifth Solvay Conference, for example [[Louis de Broglie]], conceded that quantum mechanics appeared to be complete.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|346–347}}

[[File:Einstein's light box.svg|thumb|Einstein's light box]]
At the Sixth Solvay International Conference on Magnetism (1930), Einstein came armed with a new thought experiment. This involved a box with a shutter that operated so quickly, it would allow only one photon to escape at a time. The box would first be weighed exactly. Then, at a precise moment, the shutter would open, allowing a photon to escape. The box would then be re-weighed. The well-known relationship between mass and energy &lt;math&gt;E = m c^2&lt;/math&gt; would allow the energy of the particle to be precisely determined. With this gadget, Einstein believed that he had demonstrated a means to obtain, simultaneously, a precise determination of the energy of the photon as well as its exact time of departure from the system.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|346–347}} &lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|446–448}}

Bohr was shaken by this thought experiment. Unable to think of a refutation, he went from one conference participant to another, trying to convince them that Einstein's thought experiment couldn't be true, that if it were true, it would literally mean the end of physics. After a sleepless night, he finally worked out a response which, ironically, depended on Einstein's general relativity.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|348–349}} Consider the illustration of Einstein's light box:&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|446–448}}
:1. After emitting a photon, the loss of weight causes the box to rise in the gravitational field. 
:2. The observer returns the box to its original height by adding weights until the pointer points to its initial position. It takes a certain amount of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for the observer to perform this procedure. How long it takes depends on the strength of the spring and on how well-damped the system is. If undamped, the box will bounce up and down forever. If over-damped, the box will return to its original position sluggishly (See [[Damped spring-mass system]]).{{refn|group=note|Frictional damping adds heat (and therefore mass-energy) to the system, but it can be demonstrated that errors due to this effect, which was not considered by Bohr, are within an acceptable range.&lt;ref name="Hnizdo2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hnizdo|first1=V.|title=On Bohr's response to the clock-in-the-box thought experiment of Einstein|journal=Eur. J. Phys.|date=2002|volume=23|pages=L9–L13|arxiv=quant-ph/0107028|bibcode=2001quant.ph..7028H}}&lt;/ref&gt;  }}
:3. The longer that the observer allows the damped spring-mass system to settle, the closer the pointer will reach its equilibrium position. At some point, the observer will conclude that his setting of the pointer to its initial position is within an allowable tolerance. There will be some residual error &lt;math&gt;\Delta q&lt;/math&gt; in returning the pointer to its initial position. Correspondingly, there will be some residual error &lt;math&gt;\Delta m&lt;/math&gt; in the weight measurement.
:4. Adding the weights imparts a momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to the box which can be measured with an accuracy &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; delimited by &lt;math&gt;\Delta p \Delta q \approx h .&lt;/math&gt; It is clear that &lt;math&gt;\Delta p &lt; gt \Delta m ,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational constant. Plugging in yields &lt;math&gt;gt \Delta m \Delta q &gt; h .&lt;/math&gt;
:5. General relativity informs us that while the box has been at a height different than its original height, it has been ticking at a rate different than its original rate. The red shift formula informs us that there will be an uncertainty &lt;math&gt;\Delta t = c^{-2} g t \Delta q&lt;/math&gt; in the determination of &lt;math&gt;t_0 ,&lt;/math&gt; the emission time of the photon.
:6. Hence, &lt;math&gt;c^2 \Delta m \Delta t = \Delta E \Delta t &gt; h .&lt;/math&gt; The accuracy with which the energy of the photon is measured restricts the precision with which its moment of emission can be measured, following the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

After finding his last attempt at finding a loophole around the uncertainty principle refuted, Einstein quit trying to search for inconsistencies in quantum mechanics. Instead, he shifted his focus to the other aspects of quantum mechanics with which he was uncomfortable, focusing on his critique of action at a distance. His next paper on quantum mechanics foreshadowed his later paper on the EPR paradox.&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|448}}

Einstein was gracious in his defeat. The following September, Einstein nominated Heisenberg and Schroedinger for the Nobel Prize, stating, "I am convinced that this theory undoubtedly contains a part of the ultimate truth."&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|448}}

{{quote|Both Bohr and Einstein were subtle men. Einstein tried very hard to show that quantum mechanics was inconsistent; Bohr, however, was always able to counter his arguments.

Einstein's fundamental dispute with quantum mechanics wasn't about whether God rolled dice, whether the uncertainty principle allowed simultaneous measurement of position and momentum, or even whether quantum mechanics was complete. It was about reality. Does a physical reality exist independent of our ability to observe it? To Bohr and his followers, such questions were meaningless. All that we can know are the results of measurements and observations. It makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|460–461}}

Einstein's beliefs had evolved over the years from those that he had held when he was young, when, as a logical positivist heavily influenced by his reading of [[David Hume]] and [[Ernst Mach]], he had rejected such unobservable concepts as absolute time and space. Einstein believed:&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|460–461}} 
:1. A reality exists independent of our ability to observe it.
:2. Objects are located at distinct points in spacetime and have their own independent, real existence. In other words, he believed in ''separability and locality.'' 
:3. Although at a superficial level, quantum events may appear random, at some ultimate level, strict causality underlies all processes in nature.

[[File:EPR paradox thought experiment.svg|thumb|EPR paradox thought experiment. (top) The total wave function of a particle pair spreads from the collision point. (bottom) Observation of one particle collapses the wave function.]]
Einstein considered that realism and localism were fundamental underpinnings of physics. After leaving Nazi Germany and settling in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Studies]], Einstein began writing up a thought experiment that he had been mulling over since attending a lecture by [[Léon Rosenfeld]] in 1933. Since the paper was to be in English, Einstein enlisted the help of the 46-year-old [[Boris Podolsky]], a fellow who had moved to the Institute from Caltech; he also enlisted the help of the 26-year-old [[Nathan Rosen]], also at the Institute, who did much of the math.{{refn|group=note|Fölsing, in his otherwise reliable biography of Einstein, suggests that Rosen actually originated the ideas in the EPR paper.&lt;ref name="Folsing1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fölsing|first1=Albrecht|title=Albert Einstein: A Biography|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-140-23719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|696}} This claim is contradicted by statements made by Rosenfeld: "&amp;nbsp;“What would you say of the following
situation?” he asked me [following a seminar by Rosenfeld in Brussels in 1933 that
Einstein attended]. “Suppose two particles are set in motion towards each other with
the same, very large momentum, and that they interact with each other for a very short
time when they pass at known positions. Consider now an observer who gets hold of one
of the particles, far away from the region of interaction, and measures its momentum;
then, from the conditions of the experiment, he will obviously be able to deduce the
momentum of the other particle. If, however, he chooses to measure the position of
the first particle, he will be able to tell where the other particle is. This is a perfectly
correct and straightforward deduction from the principles of quantum mechanics; but is
it not very paradoxical? How can the final state of the second particle be influenced by
a measurement performed on the first, after all physical interaction has ceased between
them?”&amp;nbsp;"&lt;ref name="Landsman2005"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last1=Landsman|first1=N. P.|title=When champions meet: Rethinking the Bohr–Einstein debate|eprint=quant-ph/0507220|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The result of their collaboration was the four page [[EPR paradox|EPR paper]], which in its title asked the question ''Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?''&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|448–450}} &lt;ref group=p name="EPR"/&gt;

After seeing the paper in print, Einstein found himself unhappy with the result. His clear conceptual visualization had been buried under layers of mathematical formalism.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|448–450}}

Einstein's thought experiment involved two particles that have collided or which have been created in such a way that they have properties which are correlated. The total wave function for the pair links the positions of the particles as well as their linear momenta.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|450–453}} &lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt; The figure depicts the spreading of the wave function from the collision point. However, observation of the position of the first particle allows us to determine precisely the position of the second particle no matter how far the pair have separated. Likewise, measuring the momentum of the first particle allows us to determine precisely the momentum of the second particle. "In accordance with our criterion for reality, in the first case we must consider the quantity P as being an element of reality, in the second case the quantity Q is an element of reality."&lt;ref group=p name=EPR/&gt;

Einstein concluded that the second particle, which we have never directly observed, must have at any moment a position that is real and a momentum that is real. Quantum mechanics does not account for these features of reality. Therefore, quantum mechanics is not complete.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|451}} It is known, from the uncertainty principle, that position and momentum cannot be measured at the same time. But even though their values can only be determined in distinct contexts of measurement, can they both be definite at the same time? Einstein concluded that the answer must be yes.&lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt;

The only alternative, claimed Einstein, would be to assert that measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|451}} "No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this."&lt;ref group=p name=EPR/&gt;

Bohr was stunned when he read Einstein's paper and spent more than six weeks framing his response, which he gave exactly the same title as the EPR paper.&lt;ref group=p name="Bohr1935"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohr|first1=Niels|title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?|journal=Physical Review|date=1935|volume=48|issue=8|pages=696–702|url=https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|accessdate=27 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401145604/https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|archivedate=1 Apr 2017|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|bibcode=1935PhRv...48..696B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPR paper forced Bohr to make a major revision in his understanding of [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt;

Prior to EPR, Bohr had maintained that disturbance caused by the act of observation was the physical explanation for quantum uncertainty. In the EPR thought experiment, however, Bohr had to admit that "there is no question of a mechanical disturbance of the system under investigation." On the other hand, he noted that the two particles were one system described by one quantum function. Furthermore, the EPR paper did nothing to dispel the uncertainty principle.&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|454–457}} {{refn|group=note|Bohr claimed that a measurement on one particle does involve "an influence on the very conditions which define the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior of [the other particle]."&lt;ref group=p name="Bohr1935"/&gt; Arthur Fine noted that "The meaning of this claim is not at all clear," and indeed, "it is difficult to know whether a coherent response can be attributed to Bohr reliably that would derail EPR."&lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt; }}

Later commentators have questioned the strength and coherence of Bohr's response. As a practical matter, however, physicists for the most part did not pay much attention to the debate between Bohr and Einstein, since the opposing views did not affect one's ability to apply quantum mechanics to practical problems, but only affected one's interpretation of the quantum formalism. If they thought about the problem at all, most working physicists tended to follow Bohr's leadership.&lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacciagaluppi2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bacciagaluppi, G.|editor1-last=Aaserud|editor1-first=F.|editor2-last=Kragh|editor2-first=H.|title=One Hundred Years of the Bohr Atom|date=2015|publisher=Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters |location=Copenhagen|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/11023/1/Bacciagaluppi_Bohr_centenary_final.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809103054/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/11023/1/Bacciagaluppi_Bohr_centenary_final.pdf |archivedate=9 Aug 2017|chapter=Did Bohr understand EPR?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Ryan K.|title=Assessing Bohr's rhetorical success in the EPR debate|journal=Southern Communication Journal|date=2005|volume=70|issue=4|pages=301–315|doi=10.1080/10417940509373336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So stood the situation for nearly 30 years. Then, in 1964, [[John Stewart Bell]] made the groundbreaking discovery that Einstein's local realist world view made experimentally verifiable predictions that would be in conflict with those of quantum mechanics. Bell's discovery shifted the Einstein–Bohr debate from philosophy to the realm of experimental physics. [[Bell's theorem]] showed that, for any local realist formalism, there exist limits on the predicted correlations between pairs of particles in an experimental realization of the EPR thought experiment. In 1972, the first experimental tests were carried out. Successive experiments improved the accuracy of observation and closed loopholes. To date, it is virtually certain that local realist theories have been falsified.&lt;ref name="Aspect2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aspect|first1=Alain|title=Viewpoint: Closing the Door on Einstein and Bohr’s Quantum Debate|journal=Physics|date=2015|volume=8|page=123|url=https://physics.aps.org/articles/v8/123|accessdate=28 April 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6z0aBQ74y|archivedate=28 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So Einstein was wrong. But it has several times been the case that Einstein's "mistakes" have foreshadowed and provoked major shifts in scientific research. Such, for instance, has been the case with his proposal of the [[cosmological constant]], which Einstein considered his greatest blunder, but which currently is being actively investigated for its possible role in the [[accelerating expansion of the universe]]. In his Princeton years, Einstein was virtually shunned as he pursued the unified field theory. Nowadays, innumerable physicists pursue Einstein's dream for a "[[theory of everything]]."&lt;ref name="Smolin2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smolin|first1=Lee|title=Einstein's Legacy — Where are the "Einsteinians?"|journal=Logos|date=2005|volume=4|issue=3|url=http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.3/smolin.htm|accessdate=28 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927005620/http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.3/smolin.htm|archivedate=27 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPR paper did not prove quantum mechanics to be incorrect. What it did prove was that quantum mechanics, with its "spooky action at a distance," is completely incompatible with commonsense understanding.&lt;ref name="Maudlin2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maudlin|first1=Tim|title=What Bell Did|journal=J.

'''Ernesto Grassi''' (May 2, 1902 – December 22, 1991) was an [[Italian philosophy|Italian philosopher]].

==Life==
He maintained an intimate friendship with [[Donald Verene|Donald Phillip Verene]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Crusius. "New Preface" in Rhetoric as Philosophy: The Humanist Tradition. Trans. John Michael Krois and Azizeh Azodi. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
Grassi sought to take up the [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerean]] [[Heideggerian terminology#Destruktion|''Destruktion'']] of [[metaphysics]], grounding his philosophical enterprise instead in the tradition of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Grassi and John Michael Krois. "Italian Humanism and Heidegger's Thesis of the End of Philosophy." ''Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (Spring, 1980), pp. 79-98.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified the Italian humanist tradition as a potential site to begin this development of philosophy, and his works often contain copious references to the Italian humanists. In this tradition, "work and metaphor are the source of human history and society", an approach to thought which must reject the rational, proceeding as it does from "general and necessary premises."&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Grassi and John Michael Krois.  "Can Rhetoric Provide a New Basis for Philosophizing? The Humanist Tradition." ''Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'' Vol. 11, No. 2, Spring 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His work ''Rhetoric as Philosophy'' is considered as "the first protracted attempt to synthesize [[Renaissance Humanism|Italian humanism]] with rhetoric, as a source of philosophical [[invention]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Farell. ''Rhetoric Review'', Vol. 21, No. 1, (2002), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grassi's theory on Rhetoric and Humanism ==

Looking at the theory of Ernesto Grassi of rhetoric and humanism, he inherited ideas from the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero and Quintilian to help introduce and assure his theory. Grassi was quite specific when it came to understanding his ideas. He starts with making sure that the "description of nature of rhetoric is to summarize the distinction he draws between critical or rational discourse and topical discourse," (Golden. Berquist, Coleman, &amp; Sprouse. 2011, 307). When it comes to his theory he normally would side with Giambattista Vico (an Italian philosopher, 1668-1744). 

There are three primary faculties of true rhetoric:

Ingenium-Most important and essential to the understanding of humanistic tradition. Those who have an issue within this "trait" have issues with traditional humanistic advances within their lives. 

Work- This "trait", according to Grassi, helps develop the understanding of need and development of the history of mankind. It allows us to create our imprints of today for the history of tomorrow. 

Metaphor-With this, according to Grassi, a person must be able to bring together Ingenium and work making metaphor beneficial for the continuation of growth and development. 

Ingenium, Work, and Metaphor is intertwined with knowledge, rationality, language and plays a role in nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3651">'''Experiment with Light''' is a [[Quaker]] spiritual practice.  It refers back to seventeenth century Quakers' experience, rediscovered as a systematic discipline in 1996.

Experiment with Light is often practised in [[Meeting for worship|Quaker meeting]]s in Light groups, but it can also be undertaken as a solo discipline and it is not necessary to be a Quaker to practise it. Recordings of the different versions of the meditation are available on CD and as downloads from the Experiment with Light website.  The website Experiment with Light also provides details of resources and events as well as the guided meditations.  It also holds all the online editions of the Experiment with Light Journal.  

==Development==
''Light to Live by'' &lt;ref&gt;''Light to Live by'', Rex Ambler, 2002, Quaker Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; describes how British Quaker [[Rex Ambler]] first became aware of seventeenth century Quaker insight and how, as a result, he devised the Experiment.  ''Seeing Hearing Knowing: reflections on Experiment with Light'' &lt;ref&gt;''Seeing Hearing Knowing'', ed. John Lampen, 2008, William Sessions Limited, York, England.&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of articles describing different writers' experience of it.  It was also the subject of a PhD thesis: [http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/3076/1/Meads11PhD.pdf Experiment with Light in Britain: the Heterotopian Nature of a Contemporary Quaker Spiritual Practice].  In 2011 the Quaker weekly Journal [https://thefriend.org/ ''The Friend''] [[The Friend (Quaker magazine)|(Quaker Magazine)]] ran a series of [http://experiment-with-light.org.uk/friend11.pdf articles about it].  ''Mind the Light: the story of a Quaker discipline'' &lt;ref&gt;''Mind the Light: the story of a Quaker discipline'', Klaus Huber, 2018, The Experiment with Light Network.&lt;/ref&gt; details the origins and history of its development from 1996 to 2017.

In Britain there is an Experiment with Light Network, which is a Quaker Recognised Body of Britain Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. &lt;ref&gt;[http://qfp.quaker.org.uk/chapter/13/ ''Quaker faith and practice'', 13.19.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://quaker-prod.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/store/09abe4feaa450e519f060fd93be95788dc48a7172cb50d4ef6cb2dacbf26 Meeting for Sufferings Minutes, December 2017 (MfS/17/12/19)], p7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also practised in Quaker Meetings in USA, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.  It can be, and is, undertaken by people who are not Quakers as well.

==Process==
At the heart of the practice is a meditation which guides Experimenters through four core steps (although the words suggesting each step differ in the various versions):

* Mind the Light (pay attention to what your conscience shows in the meditation);
* Open your heart to the Truth (look at the reality shown by your conscience, in an attitude of receptivity);
* Wait in the Light (exercise patience, let the Light show you what is really going on, in a detached manner);
* Submit (welcome the insights and accept them).&lt;ref&gt;[http://experiment-with-light.org.uk/about.htm Experiment with Light website 'About' page.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Light to Live by'', pp16-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/3076/1/Meads11PhD.pdf Experiment with Light in Britain: the Heterotopian Nature of a Contemporary Quaker Spiritual Practice], p9.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sufism|Ideas}}

A '''fakir''', or '''faqir''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|k|ɪər}}; {{lang-ar|فقیر}} (noun of faqr)), derived from ''faqr'' ({{lang-ar|فقر}}, "poverty") is a [[Sufi]] [[Muslim]] [[asceticism|ascetic]] who has taken vows of poverty and worship, renouncing all relations and possessions. Fakirs are prevalent in the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. A fakir is thought to be self-sufficient and only possesses the spiritual need for God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/fakir|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faqirs are characterized by their attachment to ''[[dhikr]]'' (a practice of repeating [[Names of God in Islam|the names of God]], often performed after prayers).&lt;ref&gt;''A Prayer for Spiritual Elevation and Protection'' (2007) by Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi, Suha Taji-Farouki&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufism]] gained adherents among a number of Muslims as a reaction against the worldliness of the early [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661–750 CE&lt;ref name="FirstDynasty"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawting|first=Gerald R.|title=The first dynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2000|isbn=0-415-24073-5}} See Google [https://books.google.com/books?id=-wFp_Gv8GDYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Umayyad+Caliphate+661+750 book search].&lt;/ref&gt;). Though, Sufis have spanned several continents and cultures over a millennium, originally expressing their beliefs in Arabic, before spreading into [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] and a dozen other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sells, Early Islamic Mysticism, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also applied to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ascetics (e.g., [[sadhu]]s, [[guru]]s, [[swami]]s and [[yogi]]s).&lt;ref name="ColbyWilliams1918"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frank Moore|last2=Williams|first2=Talcott|title=The New International Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p20NAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA343|accessdate=9 December 2016|year=1918|publisher=Dodd, Mead|language=English|pages=343|quote=Fakir: In general a religious mendicant; more specifically a Hindu marvel worker or priestly juggler, usually peripatetic and indigent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These usages developed primarily in the [[Mughal era]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. 

There is also a distinct clan of [[Faqir (caste)|faqir]]s found in [[North India]], descended from communities of faqirs who took up residence at [[Sufi]] shrines.

== History ==
{{Sunni Islam|Movements}}
During the 17th century, another noble and spirited Muslim scholar and [[saint]], [[Sultan Bahoo]], revolutionized [[Sufism]] and reinstated (with fresh properties) the definition of ''faqr'' and ''faqir''.

Historically, the terms ''[[tasawwuf]]'',  ''faqr'', and ''faqer'' (noun of ''faqr'') were first used (with full definition) by [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was the grandson of [[Muhammad]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} He wrote a book, ''Mirat ul Arfeen'', on this topic, which is said to be the first book on [[Sufism]] and [[tasawwuf]]. However, under [[Ummayad]] rule, neither could this book be published nor was it allowed to discuss [[tasawwuf]], [[Sufism]] or faqr openly. For a long time, after [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the information and teachings of faqr, [[tasawwuf]] and [[Sufism]] kept on transferring from heart to heart.&lt;ref&gt;''A brief history of Islam'' by Tamara Sonn, 2004, p60&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, highly reputed Muslim [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], who is the founder of [[Qadri]] [[silsila]], which has the most followers in Muslim [[Sufism]], elaborated [[Sufism]], [[tasawwuf]] and [[faqr]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the 13th century, [[Ibn Arabi]] was the first vibrant Muslim scholar who not only started this discussion publicly but also wrote hundreds of books about [[Sufism]], [[tasawwuf]] and faqr.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In English, ''faqir'' or ''fakir'' originally meant a mendicant dervish. In mystical usage, the word ''fakir'' refers to man's spiritual need for God, who alone is self-sufficient. Although of Muslim origin, the term has come to be applied in India to Hindus as well, largely replacing gosvamin, sadhu, bhikku, and other designations. Fakirs are generally regarded as holy men who are possessed of miraculous powers. Among Muslims, the leading Sufi orders of fakirs are the Shadhiliyyah, Chishtiyah, Qadiriyah, Naqshbandiyah, and Suhrawardiyah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faqir|title=Online Dictionary / Reference|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambridge English Dictionary defines ''faqir'' as "a member of an Islamic religious group, or a holy man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/fakir#fakir__3|title=Dictionary of Cambridge|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Winston Churchill is known to have referred to the peaceful resistance (satyagraha) promoting independence leader of India, Mahatma Gandhi, as a "seditious fakir".

== Attributes ==
The attributes of a fakir have been defined by many Muslim saints and scholars.

The early Muslim saint, [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], defined [[Sufism]], [[tasawwuf]] and faqr in a conclusive manner. Explaining the attributes of a fakir, he says, "faqir is not who can not do anything and is nothing in his self-being. But faqir has all the commanding powers (gifted from Allah) and his orders can not be revoked."&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East'' by N. Hanif, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sultan of the saints: mystical life and teaching of Shaikh Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani, Muhammad Riyāz Qādrī, 2000, p24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Arabi]] explained [[Sufism]], including faqr, in more details. He wrote more than 500 books the topic. He was the first Muslim scholar to openly introduced (first time openly) the idea of [[Wahdat al-wujud]]. His writings are considered a solid source, that defied time&lt;ref&gt;''Fusus al-hikam (The Bezels of Wisdom), ed. A. Affifi, Cairo, 1946;trans. R.W.J. Austin, The Bezels of Wisdom, New York: Paulist Press,1980''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''al-Futuhat al-makkiyya (The Meccan Illuminations), Cairo, 1911;partial trans. M. Chodkiewicz et al., Les Illuminations de la Mecque: The Meccan Illuminations, Textes choisis/Selected Texts, Paris: Sindbad,1988.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sufi Path of Knowledge: Ibn al-'Arabi's Metaphysics of Imagination, Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.1981''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sufis of Andalusia,  London, George Allen &amp; Unwin.1971''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dignified Muslim saint, [[Sultan Bahoo]], describes a fakir as one "who has been entrusted with full authority from Allah (God)". In the same book, [[Sultan Bahoo]] says, "Faqir attains eternity by dissolving himself in oneness of Allah. He, when, eliminates himself from other than Allah, his soul reaches to divinity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazratsultanbahu.com/amk/htp/|title=Reference from Sultan Bahoo's book|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says in another book, "faqir has three steps (stages).  First step he takes from eternity (without beginning) to this mortal world, second step from this finite world to hereafter and last step he takes from hereafter to manifestation of Allah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazratsultanbahu.com/english/index.php/The_Noor_ul_Huda_Khurd_-_Complete_Book|title='''Noor ul Khuda''' book of Sultan Bahoo|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gurdjieff ==
In the [[Fourth Way]] teaching of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] the word ''fakir'' is used to denote the specifically [[Human body|physical]] path of development, as opposed to the words ''yogi'' (which Gurdjieff used for a path of [[Mind|mental]] development) and ''[[monk]]'' (which he used for the path of [[emotion]]al development).&lt;ref&gt;''The Fourth Way: Teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff,'' P.D. Ouspensky, Random House USA, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

They were known as performers 'mad' in a worshiping trance of joy - transcending above both good and bad. Though fond of both [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]], the Baul evolved into a religion focused on the individual and centered on a spiritual quest for God from within. They believe the soul that lives in all human bodies is God.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Fisherian runaway''' or '''runaway selection''' is a [[sexual selection]] mechanism proposed by the mathematical biologist [[Ronald Fisher]] in the early 20th century, to account for the [[evolution]] of exaggerated [[Biological ornament|male ornamentation]] by persistent, directional [[mate choice|female choice]].&lt;ref name="ander94"&gt;Andersson, M. (1994) Sexual selection. {{ISBN|0-691-00057-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ander06"&gt;{{citation |authors=Andersson, M. and Simmons, L.W. |year=2006 |title=Sexual selection and mate choice |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=296–302 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gayon10"&gt;{{citation |author=Gayon, J. |year=2010 |title=Sexual selection: Another Darwinian process |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |volume=333 |issue=2 |pages=134–144 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069109003059 |doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2009.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the colourful and elaborate [[peafowl|peacock]] [[plumage]] compared to the relatively subdued peahen plumage; the costly ornaments, notably the bird's extremely long tail, appear to be incompatible with [[natural selection]]. Fisherian runaway can be postulated to include [[sexually dimorphic]] [[phenotypic trait]]s such as behaviour expressed by either sex.

Extreme and apparently maladaptive sexual dimorphism represented a [[paradox]] for evolutionary biologists from [[Charles Darwin]]'s time  up to the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. Darwin attempted to resolve the paradox by assuming genetic bases for both the preference and the ornament, and supposed an "aesthetic sense" in higher animals, leading to powerful selection of both characteristics in subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="gayon10"/&gt; Fisher developed the theory further by assuming genetic correlation between the preference and the ornament, that initially the ornament signalled greater potential [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] (the likelihood of leaving more descendants), so preference for the ornament had a selective advantage. Subsequently, if strong enough, female preference for exaggerated ornamentation in mate selection could be enough to undermine natural selection even when the ornament has become non-adaptive.&lt;ref name="gayon10"/&gt; Over subsequent generations this could lead to runaway selection by [[positive feedback]], and the speed with which the trait and the preference increase could (until counter-selection interferes) increase [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] ("geometrically").&lt;ref name="gayon10"/&gt;

Fisherian runaway has been difficult to demonstrate empirically, because it has been difficult to detect both an underlying genetic mechanism and a process by which it is initiated.&lt;ref name="ander94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ander06" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Male and female pheasant.jpg|thumb|Female (left) and male (right) [[common pheasant|pheasant]], a [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species]]

[[Charles Darwin]] published a book on sexual selection in 1871 called ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1871) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. {{ISBN|978-1-57392-176-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which garnered interest upon its release but by the 1880s the ideas had been deemed too controversial and were largely neglected. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] disagreed with Darwin, particularly after Darwin's death, that sexual selection was a real phenomenon.&lt;ref name="gayon10"/&gt; [[R.A. Fisher]] was one of the few other biologists to engage with the question.&lt;ref name="gayon10"/&gt; When Wallace stated that animals show no sexual preference in his 1915 paper, ''The evolution of sexual preference,'' Fisher publicly disagreed:&lt;ref name="fisher15" /&gt;

{{Quotation|The objection raised by Wallace ... that animals do not show any preference for their mates on account of their beauty, and in particular that female birds do not choose the males with the finest plumage, always seemed to the writer a weak one; partly from our necessary ignorance of the motives from which wild animals choose between a number of suitors; partly because there remains no satisfactory explanation either of the remarkable [[secondary sexual character]]s themselves, or of their careful display in love-dances, or of the evident interest aroused by these antics in the female; and partly also because this objection is apparently associated with the doctrine put forward by Sir Alfred Wallace in the same book, that the artistic faculties in man belong to his "spiritual nature," and therefore have come to him independently of his "animal nature" produced by natural selection.&lt;ref name="fisher15" /&gt;}}

Fisher, in the foundational 1930 book, ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'',&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt; first outlined a model by which runaway inter-sexual selection could lead to sexually dimorphic male ornamentation based upon female choice and a preference for "attractive" but otherwise non-adaptive traits in male mates. He suggested that selection for traits that increase fitness may be quite common:

{{Quotation|[O]ccasions may not be infrequent when a sexual preference of a particular kind may confer a selective advantage, and therefore become established in the species. Whenever appreciable differences exist in a species, which are in fact correlated with selective advantage, there will be a tendency to select also those individuals of the opposite sex which most clearly discriminate the difference to be observed, and which most decidedly prefer the more advantageous type. Sexual preference originated in this way may or may not confer any direct advantage upon the individuals selected, and so hasten the effect of the Natural Selection in progress. It may therefore be far more widespread than the occurrence of striking secondary sexual characters.
Fisher, R.A. (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. {{ISBN|0-19-850440-3}}&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt;}}

A strong female choice for the expression alone, as opposed to the function, of a male ornament can oppose and undermine the forces of natural selection and result in the runaway sexual selection that leads to the further exaggeration of the ornament (as well as the preference) until the costs (incurred by natural selection) of the expression become greater than the benefit (bestowed by sexual selection).&lt;ref name ="fisher15"&gt;{{citation |author=Fisher, R.A. |year=1915 |title=The evolution of sexual preference |journal=Eugenics Review |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=184–192 |pmc=2987134 |pmid=21259607}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fisher30"&gt;{{citation |author=Fisher, R.A. |year=1930 |title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection |isbn= 0-19-850440-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/geneticaltheoryo031631mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peacocks and sexual dimorphism==
[[File:Peacock courting peahen.jpg|thumb|The peacock, on the right, is courting the peahen, on the left.]]

The plumage dimorphism of the peacock and peahen of the species within the genus [[Pavo (genus)|''Pavo'']] is a prime example of the ornamentation paradox that has long puzzled evolutionary biologists; [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] wrote in 1860:&lt;blockquote&gt;The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]].  [https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-2743.xml Letter] to [[Asa Gray]], 3 April 1860&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The peacock's colorful and elaborate tail requires a great deal of energy to grow and maintain. It also reduces the bird's agility, and may increase the animal's visibility to predators. The tail appears to lower the overall fitness of the individuals who possess it. Yet, it has evolved, indicating that peacocks with longer and more colorfully elaborate tails have some advantage over peacocks who don’t. Fisherian runaway posits that the evolution of the peacock tail is made possible if peahens have a preference to mate with peacocks that possess a longer and more colourful tail. Peahens that select males with these tails in turn have male offspring that are more likely to have long and colourful tails and thus are more likely to be sexually successful themselves. Equally importantly, the female offspring of these peahens are more likely to have a preference for peacocks with longer and more colourful tails. However, though the relative fitness of males with large tails is higher than those without, the absolute fitness levels of all the members of the population (both male and female) is less than it would be if none of the peahens (or only a small number) had a preference for a longer or more colorful tail.&lt;ref name="fisher15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt;

==Initiation==

Fisher outlined two fundamental conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the Fisherian runaway mechanism to lead to the evolution of extreme ornamentation: 
#Sexual preference in at least one of the sexes
#A corresponding reproductive advantage to the preference.&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt;

Fisher argued in his 1915 paper, "The evolution of sexual preference" that the type of female preference necessary for Fisherian runaway could be initiated without any understanding or appreciation for beauty.&lt;ref name="fisher15" /&gt; Fisher suggested that any visible features that indicate fitness, that are not themselves adaptive, that draw attention, and that vary in their appearance amongst the [[population]] of males so that the females can easily compare them, would be enough to initiate Fisherian runaway. This suggestion is compatible with his theory, and indicates that the choice of feature is essentially arbitrary, and could be different in different populations. Such arbitrariness is borne out by mathematical modelling, and by observation of isolated populations of [[sandgrouse]], where the males can differ markedly from those in other populations.&lt;ref name="fisher15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ander94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ander06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rodd02"&gt;{{citation |authors=Rodd, F.H., Hughs, K.A., Grether, G.F. and Baril, C.T. |year=2002 |title=A possible non-sexual origin of mate preference: are male guppies mimicking fruit? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=269 |issue=1490 |pages=571–577 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1891|pmc=1690917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pom98"&gt;{{citation |authors=Pomiankowski, A., and Iwasa, Y. |year=1998 |title=Runaway ornament diversity caused by Fisherian sexual selection |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=95 |issue=9 |pages=5106–5111 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/95/9/5106.abstract |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.9.5106|pmc=20221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mead04"&gt;{{citation |authors=Mead, L.S. and Arnold, S.J. |year=2004 |title=Quantitative genetic models of sexual selection |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=264–271 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic basis==
Fisherian runaway assumes that sexual preference in females and ornamentation in males are both genetically variable ([[Heritability|heritable]]).&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt;

{{Quotation|If instead of regarding the existence of sexual preference as a basic fact to be established only by direct observation, we consider that the tastes of organisms … be regarded as the products of evolutionary change, governed by the relative advantage which such tastes may confer. Whenever appreciable differences exist in a species … there will be a tendency to select also those individuals of the opposite sex which most clearly discriminate the difference to be observed, and which most decidedly prefer the more advantageous type.
Fisher, R.A. (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. {{ISBN|0-19-850440-3}}&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt;}}

==Female choice==
Fisher argued that the selection for exaggerated male ornamentation is driven by the coupled exaggeration of female sexual preference for the ornament.

{{Quotation|Certain remarkable consequences do, however, follow ... in a species in which the preferences of … the female, have a great influence on the number of offspring left by individual males. ... development will proceed, so long as the disadvantage is more than counterbalanced by the advantage in sexual selection … there will also be a net advantage in favour of giving to it a more decided preference.
Fisher, R.A. (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. {{ISBN|0-19-850440-3}}&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt;}}

==Positive feedback==
Over time a positive feedback mechanism will see more exaggerated sons and choosier daughters being produced with each successive generation; resulting in the runaway selection for the further exaggeration of both the ornament and the preference (until the costs for producing the ornament outweigh the reproductive benefit of possessing it).

{{Quotation|The two characteristics affected by such a process, namely [ornamental] development in the male, and sexual preference for such development in the female, must thus advance together, and … will advance with ever increasing speed. [I]t is easy to see that the speed of development will be proportional to the development already attained, which will therefore increase with time exponentially, or in a geometric progression.
Fisher, R.A. (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. {{ISBN|0-19-850440-3}}&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt;}}

{{Quotation|Such a process must soon run against some check. Two such are obvious. If carried far enough … counterselection in favour of less ornamented males will be encountered to balance the advantage of sexual preference; … elaboration and … female preference will be brought to a standstill, and a condition of relative stability will be attained. It will be more effective still if the disadvantage to the males of their sexual ornaments so diminishes their numbers surviving, relative to the females, as to cut at the root of the process, by demising the reproductive advantage to be conferred by female preference.
Fisher, R.A. (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. {{ISBN|0-19-850440-3}}&lt;ref name="fisher30" /&gt;}}

==Alternative hypotheses==
{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}

Several alternative hypotheses use the same genetic runaway (or positive feedback) mechanism but differ in the mechanisms of the initiation. The [[sexy son hypothesis]] (also proposed by Fisher) suggests that females that choose desirably ornamented males will have desirably ornamented (or sexy) sons, and that the effect of that behaviour on spreading the female's genes through subsequent generations may outweigh other factors such as the level of parental investment by the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gwinner |first=H. |author2=Schwabl |title=Evidence for sexy sons in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |year=2005 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=375–382 |doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0948-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicator hypotheses suggest that females choose desirably ornamented males because the cost of producing the desirable ornaments is indicative of [[good genes hypothesis|good genes]] by way of the individual's vigour.

Other hypotheses for the evolution of male ornamentation include the [[sensory bias hypothesis]], the [[compatibility hypothesis]] and the [[handicap principle]].

'''''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law''''' is a 2010 book about [[LGBT rights in the United States]] by the philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]].

==Summary==
Nussbaum analyzes the role that disgust plays in law and public debate in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha. Oxford University Press. "From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law" (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; She primarily analyzes constitutional legal issues facing gay and lesbian Americans but also analyzes issues such as anti-miscegenation statutes, segregation, antisemitism and the caste system in India as part of her broader thesis regarding the "politics of disgust".

She posits that the fundamental motivations of those advocating legal restrictions against gay and lesbian Americans is a "politics of disgust". These legal restrictions include blocking sexual orientation being protected under anti-discrimination laws, sodomy laws against consenting adults, constitutional bans against same-sex marriage, over-strict regulation of gay bathhouses, and bans on sex in public parks and public restrooms.&lt;ref&gt;For the last two, see Martha Nussbaum, ''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law''.  Oxford University Press, 2010, 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nussbaum also argues that legal bans on polygamy and certain forms of incestuous (e.g. brother-sister) marriage partake of the politics of disgust and should be overturned.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''From Disgust to Humanity'', 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum identifies the "politics of disgust" closely with [[Lord Devlin]] and his famous opposition to the [[Wolfenden report]] that recommended decriminalizing private consensual homosexual acts on the basis that those things would "disgust the average man." To Devlin, the mere fact some people or act may produce popular emotional reactions of disgust provides an appropriate guide for legislating. She also identifies the '[[wisdom of repugnance]]' as advocated by [[Leon Kass]] as another "politics of disgust" school of thought as it claims that disgust "in crucial cases...repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it."

Nussbaum goes on to explicitly oppose the concept of a disgust-based morality as an appropriate guide for legislating. Nussbaum notes that popular disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. Drawing upon her earlier work on the relationship between disgust and shame, Nussbaum notes that at various times, [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[sexism]], have all been driven by popular revulsion.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum 2004"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|url= http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i48/48b00601.htm |title=Danger to Human Dignity: The Revival of Disgust and Shame in the Law|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=2007-11-24|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In place of this "politics of disgust," Nussbaum argues for the [[harm principle]] from [[John Stuart Mill]] as the proper basis for limiting individual liberties. Nussbaum argues the harm principle, which supports the legal ideas of [[consent]], the [[age of majority]], and [[privacy]], protects citizens while the "politics of disgust" is merely an unreliable emotional reaction with no inherent wisdom. Furthermore, Nussbaum argues this "politics of disgust" has denied and continues to deny citizens humanity and equality before the law on no rational grounds and causes palpable social harms to the groups affected.

''From Disgust to Humanity'' earned acclaim in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanfranciscobookreview.com/current-events-politics/from-disgust-to-humanity-sexual-orientation-and-constitutional-law/ ''San Francisco Book Review''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716003823/http://www.sanfranciscobookreview.com/current-events-politics/from-disgust-to-humanity-sexual-orientation-and-constitutional-law/ |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2246892/ "Why Has Divided America Taken Gay Rights Seriously?: A Philosopher Credits the Power of the Imagination"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=lets_be_rational_about_sex "Let's Be Rational about Sex"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/03/19/RVK51CG7JK.DTL&amp;type=gaylesbian#ixzz0j13iukEO ''San Francisco Chronicle Book Review'']&lt;/ref&gt; and prompted interviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/magazine/13FOB-Q4-t.html "Gross National Politics"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/back-talk-martha-c-nussbaum Back Talk: Martha Nussbaum]&lt;/ref&gt;  One conservative magazine, ''[[The American Spectator]]'', offered a dissenting view, writing, "[H]er account of the 'politics of disgust' lacks coherence, and 'the politics of humanity' betrays itself by not treating more sympathetically those opposed to the gay rights movement." The article also argues that book is marred by factual errors and inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectator.org/archives/2010/12/02/the-politics-of-humanity/ "The Politics of Humanity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204234502/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/12/02/the-politics-of-humanity |date=2010-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ecclesia Gnostica]] celebrates a traditional Gnostic Mass called the [[Ecclesia Gnostica#The Gnostic Holy Eucharist|Gnostic Holy Eucharist]].
* [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]]'s [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass]] written by [[Aleister Crowley]].
** Also, the third degree initiation ceremony in [[Gardnerian Wicca]] (including the [[Great Rite]]) is derived almost completely from Crowley's Gnostic Mass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13332">'''Historical editions''' form part of a category of printed music, which generally consists of [[classical music]] and [[opera]] from a past repertory, where the term can apply to several different types of published music.  However, it is principally applied to one of three types of music of this sort:
* '''Scholarly or critical editions''' are music editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the music contained within is as close to the composer's original intentions as possible. Such editions are sometimes called [[urtext edition]]s.
* '''Collected Works or Complete Works''', generally in multi-volume sets, are devoted to a particular composer or to a particular musical repertory.  This is sometimes referred to in German as  ''Gesamtausgabe''&lt;ref&gt;Literally: "whole edition"&lt;/ref&gt; when containing the works of one particular composer.
* '''Monuments or Monumental Editions''' (or the German ''Denkmäler'')&lt;ref&gt;Literally: "memorials"&lt;/ref&gt; when containing a repertory defined by geography, time period, or musical genre.

== The origins of historical editions ==
Up until the 18th century, music performance and distribution centered around current compositions.  Even professional musicians rarely were familiar with music written more than a half century before their own time.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second half of the 18th century, an awakening of interest in the history of music prompted the publication of numerous collections of older music (for example, [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]]'s ''Cathedral Music'', published around 1760-63, and [[Giovanni Battista Martini]]'s ''Esemplare, ossia Saggio... di contrappunto'', published around 1774-5).&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Robinson Charles, [http://www.grovemusic.com "Editions, Historical", ''Grove Music Online''] ed. L. Macy. Accessed 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the same time, the proliferation of pirated editions of music by popular composers (such as [[Haydn]] and [[Mozart]]) prompted respected music publishers to embark on "oeuvres complettes," intended as uniform editions of the entire musical output of these composers.  Unfortunately, many of these early complete works projects were never finished.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the emergence of [[romantic hero]] worship of composers, sometimes described as the "cult of genius," fired the enthusiasm for Complete Works series for important composers.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of the academic field of musicology also contributed to an interest in more accurate and well-researched editions of musical works.  Finally, the rise of [[Nationalism]] within music circles influenced the creation of Monumental Editions devoted to geographical regions, such as ''Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst'' begun in 1892 and ''Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich'' begun in 1894.

== Editing historical editions ==
In creating a scholarly or critical edition, an editor examines all available versions of the given piece (early musical sketches, manuscript versions, publisher’s proof copies, early printed editions, and so on) and attempts to create an edition that is as close to the composer’s original intentions as possible. Editors use their historical knowledge, detective skills, and musical understanding to choose what one hopes is the most accurate version of the piece.  More recent scholarly editions often include footnotes or critical reports describing discrepancies between differing versions, or explaining appropriate performance practice for the time period.  In general, editing music is a much more challenging endeavor than editing text-based works of literature, as [[musical notation]] can be imprecise, musical handwriting can be difficult to decipher, and first or early printed editions of pieces often contained mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;James Grier, "Editing" in [http://www.grovemusic.com ''Grove Music Online''] Accessed 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, what are known as performers’ editions do not rely on a thorough examination of all known sources, and often purposely include extraneous markings not written by the composer ([[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], articulation marks, bowing indications, fingerings, and so on) to aid a musician playing from that score.

==Scholarly or critical editions==

===Opera===
''For information on critical editions of operatic works, see '''[[critical edition (opera)]]'''''

==Collected Works or Complete Works ==
The German music publisher [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] initiated many of the earliest complete works series of major composers.  A few of these include:
* [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]: [[Bach Gesellschaft|''Werke'']] (1851-1900; supplemental volume [revised edition of ''[[The Art of Fugue]]''] 1926)
* [[George Frideric Handel]]: [[Händel-Gesellschaft|''Werke'']] (1858-1902)
* [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]: ''Werke'' (1862-1907)
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]: [[Beethoven Gesamtausgabe|''Werke'']] (1862–65, supplemental volume 1888)
* [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]]: ''Werke'' (1874-1877)
* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]: [[Alte Mozart-Ausgabe|''Werke'']] (1877-1883, supplements until 1910)
Many of these early complete works series were edited by music scholars or composers famous in their own right, such as [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Guido Adler]], [[Julius Rietz]], [[Friedrich Chrysander]], and others.

After the upheavals of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], which slowed the output of musical scholarship and publishing, renewed activity led to many new series as well as to a reassessment of the older complete works series.  New techniques in photographic and other types of reproduction allowed scholars to consult many more early sources, either in microfilm or facsimile copies.  Entirely new series were published for several major composers for whom complete works sets already existed.  These updated editions incorporated new scholarship in their editing and allowed for a broader definition of complete works, often including early versions of pieces, sketches, and so on.&lt;ref name=CHAS&gt;Charles, ''Grove Music Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these new series have been published by the German music publisher Bärenreiter, and include:
* Bach: ''[[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]]'' (1954-)
* Handel: ''Hallische Händel-Ausgabe'' (1955-)
* Mozart: ''[[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe]]'' (1955-)
In addition to the reworking of older Complete Works series, many new series have been initiated for composers not previously featured in this way.  Some examples include:
* [[Leoš Janáček]]: ''Complete Critical Edition'' (1978-)
* [[Edward Elgar]]: ''Elgar Complete Edition'' (1981-)
* [[Alban Berg]]: ''Sämtliche Werke'' (1984-)
* [[Claude Debussy]]: ''Oeuvres complètes'' (1985-)
* [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]]: [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: The Complete Works|''The Complete Works'']] (2005-)
* [[Johann Christian Bach]]: [[Collected Works of Johann Christian Bach|''Collected Works'']] (1984–99)
It would be impossible to list here all of the new Complete Works series that have been initiated in the last century.  Some of the major publishers of these series include [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], Bärenreiter, Stainer &amp; Bell, [[G. Henle Verlag]], and others.

==Monuments or Monumental Editions==
Many of the early Monumental Editions were devoted to geographic regions, and often had the support of their respective governments.  For example, the series ''[[Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Literally: Memorials of German Musical Art&lt;/ref&gt; begun in 1892 by a group of German musicians that included [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Joseph Joachim]], and [[Philipp Spitta]], was supported by the German government.&lt;ref name=CHAS/&gt; Examples of other monumental editions (still ongoing) include:
* ''Samfundet til udgivelse af dansk musik'' (1872-)
* ''[[Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich]]'' (1894-)
* ''Monumenta Musicae Belgicae'' (1932-)
* ''[[Music of the United States of America (publications)|Music of the United States of America]]'' (1988-) 
Some recent projects include not only those focusing on geographic regions, but also many devoted to particular time periods or repertory, such as:
* ''Monumenta Musicae Byzantinae'' (1935-)
* ''Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century'' (1956–58)
* ''Recent Researches in Music'' (1962-)
* ''Italian Opera, 1640-1770'' (1977-)
It would be impossible to list all of the Monumental Editions currently ongoing.  Several of the major publishers of these series include the [http://www.corpusmusicae.com American Institute of Musicology], [http://www.areditions.com A-R Editions], Bärenreiter, Istituto Italiano per la Storia della Musica, Instituto Español de musicologia, [[Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre]], and others.

===Characteristics of complete works and monumental editions===
Publication of these multi-volume series is usually spread over many years, sometimes decades.  Depending on the financial state of the publisher, some projected sets are never finished, and some sets are taken over by other publishers.  There are often different editors for individual volumes, with a general editor or committee of editors to oversee the entire series.  Complete Works series are often organized by genre, for example grouping all symphonies together, or all piano sonatas.  Several of the complete works sets have complicated, multi-tiered systems for numbering the volumes.  Monumental Editions have varying organizational schemes, but several of them include numerous sub-series, some of which are devoted to the music of single composers.

These publications are often sponsored by musicological research bodies or by civic organizations.  Many of these endeavors also value international cooperation, creating editorial boards that include scholars from various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finding pieces within historical edition sets ==
Finding a particular piece of music within one of these multi-volume sets can often be difficult, as many of the series do not have general indices.  For pieces within a composer's complete works set, researchers often consult the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (Second Edition, 2001), either online or in its printed version.  Articles on composers will list the title and publisher of any complete works sets that exist, and within the list of compositions by that composer, will include volume numbers of the complete works set in which each piece is found.

To find pieces within older Monumental Editions, the best resource is still the 3rd edition of [[Anna Harriet Heyer]]'s ''Historical Sets, Collected Editions, and Monuments of Music: A Guide to their Content'', published in 1980.  A more up to date description of newer complete works and monumental edition sets can be found in the work of George Hill and Norris Stephens, but there is no index to find individual pieces.  An online database, called the "Index to Printed Music: Collections &amp; Series," is currently underway, but it is accessible by subscription only, and is not yet complete.

{{Gnosticism}}{{For|the video game|Hylics (video game)}}
'''Hylic''' (from Greek {{lang|grc|ύλη}}  (''hylē'') "matter") is the opposite of psychic (from Greek {{lang|grc|ψυχή}} (''psychē'') "soul").

In the [[gnostic]] belief system, '''hylics''', also called '''somatics''' (from Gk {{lang|grc|σώμα}} (''sōma'') "body"), were the lowest order of the three types of [[human]]. The other two were the psychics and the [[pneumatic (Gnosticism)|pneumatics]] (from Gk {{lang|grc|πνεύμα}} (''pneuma'') "spirit, breath"). So humanity comprised matter-bound beings, matter-dwelling spirits and the matter-free or immaterial souls.

Somatics were deemed completely bound to matter. Matter, the material world, was considered evil by the gnostics. The material world was created by a [[demiurge]], in some instances a blind, mad God, in others an army of rebellious [[angel]]s as a trap for the spiritual [[Simon Magus#Myth of Simon and Helen|Ennoia]]. The duty of (spiritual) man was to escape the material world by the aid of the hidden knowledge (gnosis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freke|first=Timothy|title=Jesus and the Lost Goddess: The Secret Teachings of the Original Christians|year=2001|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=978-1-4000-4594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somatics were human in form, but since their entire focus was on the material world, such as eating, sleeping, mating or creature comforts, they were seen as doomed. The pneumatic saw himself as escaping the doom of the material world via the secret knowledge. Somatics were thought to be incapable of understanding.

For consideration of these dynamics, see for example the [[Gospel of Judas]], believed to be a gnostic text, where Jesus is posited as a pneumatic and the other disciples, non-gnostics, as somatics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2088">In [[Inuit mythology]], an '''inua''' (ᐃᓄᐊ; plural '''inuat''' ᐃᓄᐊᑦ, literally "possessor" or "master") is a [[Soul (spirit)|spirit or soul]] that exists in all people, animals, lakes, mountains, and plants.  They were sometimes personified in mythology.  The concept is similar to [[mana]]. For arctic people, human and animals are equal - All life has the same kind of soul or "life essence" (inua). This creates a predicament that, in order to survive people must kill other creatures that are like them. Recognition of this dilemma lies at the centre of hunting practice, which is based upon respect and reciprocity. The hunter will only succeed if the animal chooses to give its life as a gift in return for moral and respectful behaviour on the part of the whole community. For example, after a seal has been killed fresh water is poured into its mouth so that its soul will not be thirsty and it will tell the other seals of the respect shown to it.

Among the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Yu'pik]] near Kuskokwim Bay of Coastal Alaska, the word '''yua''' (absolutive case form of the word ''yuk'' "human; human-like spirit") has similar connotations as that of the Iñupiaq of Northern Alaska, who similar to the Inuit call it ''iñua'' or ''inua''. For both the Yu'piak and Iñupiaq, the meaning is closest to an understanding of a world in which "Most Arctic peoples believe all the world is animate, and that animals have souls or spirits", (Berlo and Phillips 161) a foundational belief of the continuum and inter-connectivity of all life and spirit of all that which is, that which has been, and that which is yet to be.

'''Isabelle de Charrière''' (20 October 1740{{snd}}27 December 1805), known as '''Belle van Zuylen''' in the [[Netherlands]], née '''Isabella Agneta Elisabeth van Tuyll van Serooskerken''', and '''[Madame] Isabelle de Charrière''' elsewhere, was a Dutch writer of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who lived the latter half of her life in [[Colombier, Neuchâtel]]. She is now best known for her letters and novels, although she also wrote pamphlets, music and plays. She took a keen interest in the society and politics of her age, and her work around the time of the French Revolution is regarded as being of particular interest.

== Early life ==
Isabelle [[van Tuyll van Serooskerken]] was born in [[Zuylen Castle]] in [[Zuilen]] near [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in the Netherlands, to Diederik Jacob van [[Tuyll]] van Serooskerken (1707–1776), and Helena Jacoba de Vicq (1724–1768). She was the eldest of seven children. Her parents were described by the [[Scottish people|Scots]] author [[James Boswell]], then a student in law in Utrecht and one of her suitors,  as "one of the most ancient noblemen in the Seven Provinces" and "an Amsterdam lady, with a great deal of money." In winter they lived in their house in the city of Utrecht.

In 1750, Isabelle was sent to [[Geneva]] and travelled through [[Switzerland]] and [[France]] with her French-speaking [[governess]] Jeanne-Louise Prevost, who was her teacher from 1746-1753. Having spoken only French for a year, she had to relearn Dutch on returning home to the Netherlands. However, French would remain her preferred language for the rest of her life, which helps to explain why, for a long time, her work was not as well known in her country of birth as it otherwise might have been.

Isabelle enjoyed a much broader education than was usual for girls at that time. Thanks to the liberal views of her parents who also let her study subjects like mathematics, physics and lanuages as Latin, Italian, German and English. By all accounts, she was a gifted student. Always interested in music, in 1790 she began studying with composer [[Niccolò Zingarelli]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Belle van Zuylen|author=Marius Flothius|access-date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 14 years she fell in love with the Roman Catholic [[Poles|Polish]] count Peter Dönhoff. He was not interested in her. Disappointed, she left Utrecht for 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/collectie/handschriften/belle-van-zuylen/001 First letter to Count Dönhoff]&lt;/ref&gt; As she grew older, various suitors appeared on the scene only to be rejected because they promised to visit her, but did not, or to withdraw themselves because she was superior. She saw marriage as a way to gain freedom but she also wanted to marry for love.

Invited specially by Anne Pollexfen Drake and also her husband [[lieutenant general]] [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Eliott]] to come to their [[London]] home in [[Curzon Street]], [[Mayfair]], Isabelle did come by boat from [[Hellevoetsluis]] to [[Harwich]] 7 November 1766 accompanied by her brother Ditie, her maid Doortje and her [[valet]] Vitel.

== Later life ==
Eventually, in 1771, she married Charles-Emmanuel de Charrière de Penthaz (1735–1808), the former [[private tutor]] of her brother Willem René abroad from 1763 to 1766. Subsequently she was known as Isabelle de Charrière. They settled at Le Pontet in Colombier (near [[Neuchâtel]]), bought by his grandfather [[Béat Louis de Muralt]], with her father-in-law François (1697–1780) and her two unmarried sisters-in-law Louise (1731–1810) and Henriette (1740–1814). The couple also spent significant amounts of time in Geneva and Paris.

== Correspondence ==
Isabelle de Charrière kept up an extensive correspondence with numerous people, including intellectuals like [[David-Louis Constant de Rebecque|David-Louis Constant d'Hermenches]], James Boswell, [[Benjamin Constant]] and her [[German language|German]] translator [[Ludwig Ferdinand Huber]].

In 1760, Isabelle met David-Louis Constant d'Hermenches (1722–1785), a married Swiss officer regarded in society as a [[Don Juan]]. After much hesitation, Isabelle's need for self-expression overcame her scruples and, after a second meeting two years later, she began an intimate and secret correspondence with him for about 15 years. Constant d'Hermenches was to be one of her most important correspondents.

The Scottish writer James Boswell met her frequently in Utrecht and in Castle Zuylen in 1763-1764, when he studied law at the [[Utrecht University]]. He called her '''Zélide'''. He became a regular correspondent for several years after leaving the Netherlands, going on [[Grand Tour]]. He wrote her that he was not in love with her. She replied: "We agree, because I have no talent for subordination". In 1766 he did send a conditional proposal to her father after meeting her brother in Paris, but the fathers did not agree to a marriage.

In 1786, Mme de Charrière met Constant d'Hermenches' nephew, the writer [[Benjamin Constant]], in Paris. He visited her in Colombier several times. There they wrote an [[epistolary novel]] together, and an exchange of letters began that would last until the end of her life.
She also had an interesting correspondence with her German translator [[Ludwig Ferdinand Huber]].

== Works ==
Isabelle de Charrière wrote novels, pamphlets and plays, and composed music. Her most productive period came only after she had been living in Colombier for a number of years. Themes included her religious doubts, the nobility and the upbringing of women.

Her first novel, ''Le Noble'', was published in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;[http://literatuurmuseum.nl/media/uploads/image/zuylen05-1980x_.jpg Title page Le Noble, Conte moral 1763 in Royal Library The Hague]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a satire against the nobility and although it was published anonymously, her identity was soon discovered and her parents withdrew the work from sale. Then she wrote a portrait of herself for her friends: ''Portrait de Mll de Z., sous le nom de Zélide, fait par elle-même. 1762''. In 1784 she published two novels, ''[[Lettres neuchâteloises]]'' and ''[[Lettres de Mistress Henley publiée par son amie]]''. Both were epistolaries, a form she continued to favour. In 1788, she published her first pamphlets about the political situation in the Netherlands, in France and Switzerland.

As an admirer of the philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], she assisted in the posthumous publication of his work, [[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|''Confessions'']], in 1789. She also wrote her own pamphlets on Rousseau around this time.

The [[French Revolution]] caused a number of nobles to flee to [[Neuchâtel]] and Mme de Charrière befriended some of them. But she also published works criticising the attitudes of the aristocratic refugees, most of whom she felt had learned nothing from the Revolution.

She wrote or at least planned words and music for several musical works, but none survive beyond fragments. She sent a libretto of ''Les Phéniciennes'' to [[Mozart]], hoping that he would set it, but no reply is known. All of her musical works are included in volume 10 of her ''Œuvres complètes''; these include six minuets for [[string quartet]], nine [[piano sonata]]s, and ten airs and romances.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Auteur:Isabelle_de_Charri%C3%A8re See her music at Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jamgön Ju Mipham''', or '''Mipham Jamyang Namgyal Gyamtso'''  (1846–1912) (also known as "Mipham the Great") was a very influential philosopher and polymath of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. He wrote over 32 volumes on topics such as painting, poetics, sculpture, alchemy, medicine, logic, philosophy and tantra.&lt;ref&gt;Chogyam Trungpa; The Tantric Path of Indestructible Wakefulness (volume 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Mipham's works are still central to the scholastic curriculum in Nyingma monasteries today.&lt;ref name="Duckworth 2011, page 46"&gt;Duckworth (2011), page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Mipham is also considered one of the leading figures in the [[Rime (Buddhism)|Ri-me]] (non-sectarian) movement in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Reginald A. Ray; Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism, 2002, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation of name==
"Ju" ("holding") was Mipham's family name as his paternal clan is said to have originated as clear light deities who came to the human world holding a rope.
"Jamgön" (Skt. Mañjuśrī) indicate that he was considered to be an emanation of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. His maternal uncle, Minister-Lama Drupchok Pema Tarjay,  named him Mipham Gyamtso ("Invincible Ocean" or "Unconquerable Ocean").&lt;ref&gt;Pettit 1999 p.24&lt;/ref&gt;
In Tibetan literature, the word "mi-pham" is the standard translation of the Sanskrit "ajita", meaning "unconquered",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is a common epithet of the celestial bodhisattva [[Maitreya-natha|Maitreya]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thlib.org/reference/dictionaries/tibetan-dictionary/translate.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

===Early life===
Mipham the Great was born to an aristocratic family in 1846 in the [[Derge]] Principality of [[Kham]] or Eastern [[Tibet]]. He was recognized as an exceptional child from a young age, memorizing texts as early as age six. By the age of ten he had already composed many texts. At twelve, he entered the [[monastery]] as an ordinary [[monk]] of the Ogmin Urgyen [[Mindrolling Monastery|Mindrolling]] lineage at a branch monastery of the great [[Nyingma]] seat [[Shechen]].

When he was fifteen or sixteen, after studying the very difficult [[Mindrolling]] system of chanting for only a few days and praying to [[Manjushri]], he is said to have completely mastered it. In an 18-month retreat he accomplished the form of Manjushri known as 'Lion of Philosophers' (Tibetan: smra ba'i seng ge), using a liturgy composed by the fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje. He made many medicinal pills blessed with Manjushri's [[mantra]], and many miraculous signs were said to have been manifest. After this, it was said that he could accomplish any [[sutra]] or [[tantra]] without any effort, and no text was unknown to him. He went to many lamas to obtain the necessary [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lungs]] (oral transmissions), but he needed no study or teachings for any texts.

===Teachers===
Mipham was "a luminary of the nineteenth century [[Nyingma]] renaissance and [[Rime movement]] ecumenical movement, which started in the Kham region of eastern [[Tibet]]".&lt;ref&gt;Phuntsho (2005) p.13&lt;/ref&gt; As such he received teachings from masters of all lineages [[Nyingma]] and [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] alike. His root gurus were [[Patrul Rinpoche|Dza Patrul Rinpoche]], from whom  he received instruction on [[Shantideva]]'s ''[[Bodhicharyavatara]]'' and [[Dzogchen]]  and the renowned master [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]], from whom he received transmission of the orally transmitted or Kama and revealed or [[Terma (Buddhism)|Terma]] lineages, and many other teachings. His other teachers included [[Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye]]; Dzogchen Khenpo Padma Vajra; Lab Kyabgon Wangchen Gyerab Dorje; Jubon Jigme Dorje; Bumsar Geshe Ngawang Jungne and Ngor Ponlop Jamyang Loter Wangpo.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

A key theme in Mipham's philosophical work is the unity of seemingly disparate ideas such as duality and [[nonduality]], conceptual and nonconceptual ([[nirvikalpa]]) wisdom, rational analysis and uncontrived meditation,&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 76&lt;/ref&gt; presence and absence, immanence and transcendence, [[Shunyata|emptiness]] and [[Buddha nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Mipham on Buddha Nature, xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Mimicking the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] schools, Mipham attempted to reconcile the view of tantra, especially [[Dzogchen]], with sutric [[Madhyamaka]].&lt;ref name="Koppl, Heidi 2008"&gt;Koppl, Heidi. ''Establishing Appearances as Divine.'' Snow Lion Publications 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in departure with the Nyingma school which generally positioned the view of tantra as superior to the view of Madhyamaka.&lt;ref name="Koppl, Heidi 2008"/&gt;

For Mipam, the unity of philosophical views is ultimately resolved in the principle of coalescence (Sanskrit: ''yuganaddha'', Tib: ''zung 'jug''), which is the nonduality of conventional and ultimate realities, of samsara and nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection. Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism (Volume II), 2002, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Tsongkhapa]] who held that emptiness, as an absolute negation, was the definitive reality and view, Mipham sees coalescence of gnosis and emptiness, form and emptiness, etc. as "the ultimate hermeneutical cornerstone of his interpretations".&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection. Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism (Volume II), 2002, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his many texts Mipham explores the tension and dialectic that arises between philosophical reasoning of the ordinary mind (''rnam shes'') which is represented by the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy and  luminous nonconceptual wisdom (''ye shes''), which is the focus of the teachings of [[Dzogchen]]. He attempts a synthesis of them to show that they are not incompatible perspectives and that the teachings of Dzogchen are in line with reason.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two models of the Two Truths===

Mipham developed a twofold model of the Buddhist [[two truths doctrine]]. The first model is the traditional Madhyamaka perspective which presents the two truths of [[emptiness]] and appearance, with emptiness representing the level of ultimate truth and appearance representing relative truth. In this model the two truths are really the same reality and are only conceptually distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second model of the two truths, Mipham presents an authentic truth and an inauthentic truth. Authentic experience is any perception that is in accord with reality (''gnas snang mthun'') and perceptions which do not are said to be inauthentic. This differs from the first model because in the first model only emptiness is ultimate while in the second model the ultimate truth is the meditative experience of unitary wisdom. Instead of just being a negation, it includes the subjective content of the cognition of wisdom as well as the objective nature of reality. In this model the ultimate truth is also reality experienced nonconceptually, without duality and reification, which in Dzogchen is termed [[rigpa]], while the relative truth is the conceptual mind (''sems'').&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mipham these two models do not conflict. They are merely different contextually; the first relates to the analysis of experience post meditatively and the second corresponds to the experience of unity in meditative equipose.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This synthesis by Mipam is ultimately a bringing together of two different perspectives in Tibetan philosophy, [[rangtong]] and [[shentong]], which Mipam associated with the teachings of the second turning ([[Prajnaparamita]] sutras) and third turning ([[Yogacara]] and [[Buddha nature]] sutras) respectively:&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emptiness taught in the middle wheel and the exalted body and wisdom taught in the last wheel should be integrated as a unity of emptiness and appearance. Without dividing or excluding the definitive meaning subject matters of the middle and last wheels, both should be held to be the definitive meaning in the way of just this assertion by the omniscient [[Longchenpa|Longchen Rapjam]]. - ''Lion's Roar, exposition of Buddha nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Mipham, both of these teachings are definitive and a middle way between both of them is the best way to avoid the extremes of nihilism and essentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourfold Valid Cognition===
Another original contribution of Mipham is his system of fourfold valid cognition ([[pramana]]) which has two conventional and two ultimate valid cognitions:&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional valid cognitions
*Confined perception, ordinary valid experience
*Pure vision free of distortion

Ultimate valid cognitions
*Categorized Ultimate, emptiness as a negation known by mind
*Uncategorized Ultimate, nonconceptual wisdom

==Work and legacy==
As scholar Robet Mayer remarks, Mipham "completely revolutionised rNying ma pa scholasticism in the late 19th century, raising its status after many centuries as a comparative intellectual backwater, to arguably the most dynamic and expansive of philosophical traditions in all of Tibetan Buddhism, with an influence and impact far beyond the rNying ma pa themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Review by Robert Mayer of ''Mipham’s Dialectics and the Debates on Emptiness: To Be, Not to Be or Neither''. ''Buddhist Studies Review'' 23(2) 2006, 268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope===
In the Introduction to his critical study of the ontological debates between Mipham and his [[Gelugpa]] opponents (''Mipham's Dialectics and the Debates on Emptiness'') Lopon Karma Phuntsho defines Mipham as a [[polymath]] and gives this assessment of the scope of Mipham's work:

{{quote|Mipham is perhaps the greatest polymath Tibet ever produced. His writings comprise works on a wide range of subjects, covering almost every science known to his milieu. In traditional terms he is a Mahāpaṇḍita who has mastered the ten sciences of arts and crafts ''(bzo)'', health science ''(gso ba)'', language ''(sgra)'', logico-epistemology ''(tshad-ma)'', soteriology ''(nang don)'', poetry (''snyan ngag)'', lexicology ''(mngon brjod)'', prosody ''(sdeb sbyor)'', dramaturgy ''(zlos gar)'', and astrology ''(dkar rtsis)''. It is due to the polymathic nature of his learning and his exceptional ingenuity that Mipham today ranks amongst the leading religious and spiritual celebrities of Tibet&lt;ref&gt;Phuntsho 2005 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Mipham's works on both the exoteric or [[Sutrayana]] teachings and the esoteric or [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] teachings have become core texts within the Nyingma tradition. These works now hold a central position in the curriculum of all Nyingma monasteries and monastic colleges — occupying a place of esteem similar to the works of [[Sakya Pandita]] and [[Gorampa]] in the [[Sakya|Sakya tradition]]; those of [[Tsongkhapa]] in the [[Gelug| Gelug tradition]] and of [[Pema Karpo|Kunkhyen Padma Karpo]] in the [[Drukpa Kagyu]]. Together with [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo|Rongzompa]] and [[Longchenpa]], Mipham is considered to be one of the three "omnscient" writers of the Nyingma tradition.

===Commentaries on Buddhist Śāstra===
Although Mipham wrote on a wide range of subjects, Prof. David Germano identifies the most influential aspect of Mipham's career in that he "was the single most important author in the efflorescence of Nyingma exoteric literature in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Grounding himself theoretically in the writings of [[Longchenpa]] and other great Nyingma authors, Mipham produced brilliant exegetical commentaries on the great Indian philosophical systems and texts with a [[Nyingma]] orientation.".&lt;ref&gt;Germano (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. Gene Smith]] also judged that Mipham's greatest contribution was "in his brilliant and strikingly original commentaries on the Indian treatises."&lt;ref name="Smith 2001 p. 231"&gt;Smith (2001) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Mipham, Nyingmapa scholars "had seldom written detailed pedagogical commentaries on the ''śāstras'' of exoteric Buddhism."&lt;ref name="Smith 2001 p. 231"/&gt; Until his time the colleges or shedra associated with the great Nyingma monasteries of Kham, such as [[Dzogchen]], [[Shechen]], [[Kathog]], [[Palyul]] and [[Tarthang]] lacked their own [[exegetical]] commentaries on these exoteric Mahayana ''śāstras'', and students commonly studied [[Gelug]] commentaries on these fundamental texts. Grounding himself  in the writings of [[Śāntarakṣita]], [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo]], and [[Longchenpa]], Mipham produced a whole array of brilliant exegetical commentaries on the great Indian philosophical systems and texts that clearly articulated a  Nyingma orientation or view.

The texts include his commentaries on the ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika]]'' or ''Fundamental Stanzas on Wisdom'' by [[Nagarjuna]]; the ''Introduction to the Middle Way'' (Sanskrit: [[Madhyamakāvatāra]]) of [[Chandrakirti]]; the ''Quintessence of all Courses of Ultimate Wisdom'' (Jnanasarasamuccaya) of [[Aryadeva]]; commentaries on the major works of the Indian Buddhist logicians [[Dharmakirti]] and [[Dignaga]]; commentaries on the ''Five Treatises of Maitreya'' most notably, the ''[[Abhisamayalamkara]]''; commentaries on several works of [[Vasubandhu]] including the ''[[Abhidharmakosha]]''.  Miphams commentary on the ninth chapter of [[Shantideva]]'s ''[[Bodhicaryavatara]], '' the ''Shertik Norbu Ketaka'' ({{bo|t=ཤེར་ཊཱིཀ་ནོར་བུ་ཀེ་ཏ་ཀ་|w=sher ṭīk nor bu ke ta ka}}),&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. (2000). 'We Are All Gzhan stong pas: Reflections on ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence''. By Paul Williams.' ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics.'' Volume 7. {{ISSN|1076-9005}}. Source: [http://www.buddhistethics.org/7/kapstein001.pdf] (accessed: Sunday November 8, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  "threw Tibetan scholarly circles into several decades of heated controversy," but "it was not the only tempest Mipham's new expositions raised." His commentary on the ''[[Madhyamakalamkara]]'' of [[Śāntarakṣita]] was also considered highly controversial.

===Commentaries on Tantras===
Mipham's commentary on the [[Guhyagarbha Tantra]] is entitled ''The Essence of Clear Light''  or ''Nucleus of Inner Radiance'' ({{bo|t=|w=od gsal snying po}})— it is based on Longchenpa's commentary,'' Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions'' {{bo|t=|w=gsang snying 'grel pa phyogs bcu mun sel}} which explains the Guhyagarbha from the Dzogchen point of view.

Mipham showed particular interest in the [[Kalachakra]] and the kingdom of [[Shambhala]], and one of his last and most extensive of his esoteric works are his two volumes of commentary, [[Empowerment (Tibetan Buddhism)|initiation]] and [[sadhana]] related to the  [[Kalachakra Tantra]], the esoteric teaching from [[Shambhala]]. Before he died in 1912, he said to his students that now he was going to [[Shambhala]].

===Mipham and Gesar===
Throughout his life, Mipham showed a particular interest in the legend of the warrior king [[Gesar of Ling]], a 12th-century figure whose epic is well-known and widely celebrated in eastern Tibet, and about whom Mipham wrote extensively.

The Gesar practice, known as "The Swift Accomplishment of Enlightened Activity Through Invocation and Offering" ({{bo|w=gsol mchod phrin las myur 'grub}}) arose in the mind of Mipham as a gong-ter and was written down over the course of 3 years from the age of 31 to 34.  This practice invokes Gesar and his retinue and requests him to assist practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=S%C3%B6llo_Chenmo Söllo Chenmo]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
Mipham's medical works continue to be highly regarded to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) p.231.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}

===Astrology and divination===
Mipham also wrote extensively about astrology which was, in his words, a "delightful game" that he mastered in his teens but later applied to more serious topics such as medicine; these two topics, with various texts on more or less related topics of divination, occupy perhaps 2,000 pages of his writing. An entire volume of Mipham's is devoted to Ju-thig or divination using knots, a method that might be termed "[[Bon]]" in origin, for want of a more accurate term; this may have been the legacy of his family, who were doctors for several generations. Throughout his writings there are many resources for divination, in addition to astrology, including several rituals for looking in mirrors (pra-mo), one using dice (mo), pulling different-length 'arrows' (Wylie: da dar) out of a quiver and so on, compelling a non-human "bird" to whisper future news in one's ear, and so on. In one short text he prescribes various methods of divination (all drawn, Mipham emphasizes, from Tantric scriptures and commentaries) that make use of unusual sources of augury such as: the vicariously overheard chatter of women; sudden appearance of various animals, especially birds; weather phenomena; the shape, size and color of flames in the agnihotra or fire puja; the quality of burning butter lamps, especially the size of the flame, the amount and shape of smoke that arises; and the size and shape of the carbon deposit on the wick.

When some of his scholarly rivals thought it inappropriate for a monk to devote so much time to matters of future events, Mipham wrote a short essay explaining the purpose of divination, citing sources in the [[Sūtra|Sutras]] and [[Tantras]] where the utility and value of divination are explained.

==Students==
Mipham’s most important students were Dodrub Rinpoche, Terton Sogyal, the Fifth Dzogchen Rinpoche, Gemang Kyab Gon, Khenpo Padmavajra, Katog Situ Rinpoche, Sechen Rabjam, Gyaltsab Tulku, Palyul Gyaltrul, Karma Yangtrul, Palpung Situ Rinpoche, Ling Jetrung, [[Adzom Drukpa (1842-1924)]], Togdan Shakya Shri, Ngor Ponlob, and others. The great tulkus of Sechen, Dzogchen, Katog, Palyul, Palpung, Dege Gonchen, Repkong and others of all lineages, Sakya, Gelug, Kagyu, and Nyingma, all became his disciples.

==Emanations of Ju Mipham==

According to one account shortly before he died, Mipham told his attendant:

{{quote|Nowadays, if you speak the truth, there is nobody to listen; if you speak lies everyone thinks it is true. I have never said this before: I am not an ordinary person; I am a bodhisattva who has taken rebirth through aspiration. The suffering experienced in this body is just the residue of karma; but from now on I will never again have to experience karmic obscuration. … Now, in this final age, the barbarians beyond the frontier are close to undermining the teaching. [So] there is no point whatsoever in my taking rebirth here…I have no reason to take birth in impure realms ever again.&lt;ref&gt;Petit, 1999 p.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This may be interpreted as a statement that his mindstream would have no further 'emanations' (Wylie: ''sprul pa'' ([[tulpa]]); ''sprul sku'' ([[tulku]])). Conversely, according to another account in which he mentions the [[mindstream]] in passing and prophesies the shortly before his death to his student [[Khenpo Kunphel]]:

{{quote|Now I shall not remain long in this body. After my death, in a couple of years hence, war and darkness shall cover the earth, which will have its effect even on this isolated snow land of [[Tibet]]. In thirty years time, a mad (smyo) storm of hatred will grow like a fierce black thundercloud in the land of China, and in a further decade this evil shall spill over into Tibet itself, so that Lamas, scholars, disciples and yogis will come under terrible persecution. Due to the demon-king Pehar taking power in [[China]], darkness and terror ('bog) will come to our sacred land, with the result that violent death shall spread like a plague through every village. Then the three lords of materialism (gsum-gyi-kla-klos) and their cousins will seize power in Tibet, spreading war, famine and oppression. No one will be safe. Now, very soon, my mind-stream will be gathered up in the pure-land of [[Tushita|Tusita]], from whence many emanations [of myself] shall then come forth in future years. I shall not take [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] in Tibet. In twenty years, seek me in the northern lands of distant [[Uttarakuru]], and elsewhere, east, west, north and south. Fear not, we shall be re-united again, as father and son. Now go!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/mipham-namgyal.htm Dharma Fellowship: The Life of Mipham Jamyang Namgyal (1846–1912)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the above account, shortly after the departure of Khenpo Kunphel he stated publicly, "Now, soon I shall depart. I shall not be reborn again in Tibet, therefore do not search for me. I have reason to go to [[Shambhala]] in the north."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/mipham-namgyal.htm Dharma Fellowship: The Life of Mipham Jamyang Namgyal (1846–1912)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, a number of emanations have been recognized.

According to E. Gene Smith  "At least three rebirths were recognized in the decade following his death: 1) Zhe chen  Mi pham (a grandnephew of Mi pham rgya mtsho); 2) Tshe dbang bdud 'dul (1915/16-42) the last prince of Sde dge; 3. Khyung po Mi pham, an incarnation recognized by Rdzong gsar Mkhyen brtse  'Jam dbyangs chos kyi blo gros."&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2001 p.272&lt;/ref&gt;

The next (third) Mipham in the line of the Dege Prince who died in 1942 was apparently born in Tibet in 1949 and recognised by Tengye Rinpoche of Lab i 1959 {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} At that time he was enthroned and given responsibility for all monasteries previously held by the first and second incarnations. This third incarnation was also confirmed by [[Patrul Rinpoche]] who gave him relics of the previous incarnations and by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who he had recognized in a previous incarnation. This Mipham incarnate is the father of [[Thaye Dorje]], one of two candidates to be recognized as the 17th [[Karmapa]], and of 14th Sonam Tsemo Rinpoche, an important Gelug/Sakya tulku.&lt;ref&gt;Curren 2006: "Buddha's not smiling", Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Christoph Gottsched''' (2 February 1700 – 12 December 1766) was a German philosopher, author, and critic. For about thirty years, he exercised an almost undisputed literary dictatorship in Germany. But by his later years, his name had become a by-word for foolish pedantry.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{NIE|wstitle=Gottsched, Johann Christoph|year=1905|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born at [[Mendeleyevo, Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Oblast|Juditten]] (Mendeleyevo) near [[Königsberg]] (Kaliningrad), [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the son of a [[Lutheran]] clergyman, and was baptised in [[Juditten Church|St. Mary's Church]]. He studied philosophy and history at the [[University of Königsberg]], but immediately on taking the degree of ''Magister'' in 1723, he fled to [[Leipzig]] in order to avoid being drafted into the [[Prussian army]]. In Leipzig, he enjoyed the protection of J. B. Mencke, who, under the name of "Philander von der Linde," was a well-known poet and president of the ''Deutschübende poetische Gesellschaft'' in Leipzig. Of this society, Gottsched was elected "Senior" in 1726, and in the next year reorganized it under the title of the ''Deutsche Gesellschaft''.

As editor of the weeklies ''Die vernünftigen Tadlerinnen'' (1725–26) and ''Der Biedermann'' (1727), Gottsched started on his career of untiring critical activity, continued later in other literary journals. Directing his criticism at first chiefly against the bombast and absurd affectations of the Second Silesian School, he proceeded to lay down strict laws for the composition of poetry.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; He insisted on [[German literature]] being subordinated to the laws of [[French classicism]]. He enunciated rules by which the playwright must be bound (such as the [[Ständeklausel]]), and abolished bombast and buffoonery from the serious stage. He insisted on the observance of the [[dramatic unities]].

In his efforts toward the reformation of the German drama, Gottsched was aided by his wife, [[Luise Gottsched|Luise]], a prolific writer and translator, and had the cooperation of the theatrical manager Johann Neuber and his wife, [[Friederike Caroline Neuber|Caroline]]. They succeeded indeed in bringing about a considerable change in the condition of the German stage by substituting for the prevailing operatic performances translations of French dramas and original plays, and by banishing from it forever the coarse buffooneries of [[Hanswurst]] (Jack Pudding).&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

In 1730, Gottsched was appointed an extraordinary professor of poetry, and, in 1734, ordinary professor of [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]] at the [[University of Leipzig]]. He was also a corresponding member of the first [[learned society]] of the [[Habsburg monarchy]], the [[Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis|Societas eruditorum incognitorum]] in [[Olomouc|Olmütz]] (Olomouc), and was published in the Society's journal, which was the first scientific journal in the Habsburg monarchy.

Eventually, Gottsched went too far in his criticism. He refused to recognize the work of [[Klopstock]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]].&lt;ref name=eb9&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Gottsched, Johann Christoph|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740, he came into conflict with the Swiss writers [[Johann Jakob Bodmer]] and [[Johann Jakob Breitinger]]. Under the influence of Addison and contemporary Italian critics, they demanded that the poetic imagination should not be hampered by artificial rules. As examples, they pointed to English poets, especially [[John Milton|Milton]]. Gottsched, although not blind to the beauties of the English writers, clung the more tenaciously to his principle that poetry must be the product of rules, and, in the fierce controversy which for a time raged between Leipzig and [[Zürich]], he was ultimately defeated.

In 1741, he fell out with Caroline Neuber regarding practical stage matters, and even placed himself in opposition to his wife.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; His influence speedily declined, and before his death his name became proverbial for pedantic folly. He died in Leipzig at the age of 66.

==Works==
[[File:Gottsched, Johann Christoph – Gedichte – BEIC 4186339.jpg|thumb|''Gedichte'']]

Gottsched's chief work was his ''Versuch einer kritischen Dichtkunst für die Deutschen'' (1730), the first systematic treatise in German on the art of poetry from the standpoint of [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]. His ''Ausführliche Redekunst'' (1728) and his ''Grundlegung einer deutschen Sprachkunst'' (1748) were of importance for the development of German style and the purification of the language. He wrote several plays, of which ''Der sterbende Cato'' (1732), an adaptation of [[Joseph Addison]]'s [[tragedy]] and a French play on the same theme, was long popular on the stage. His ''Deutsche Schaubühne'' (6 volumes, 1740–1745) contained mainly translations from the French, but also some works written by himself, his wife, and others.&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; With this, he provided the German stage with a classical repertory. His bibliography of the German drama, ''Nötiger Vorrat zur Geschichte der deutschen dramatischen Dichtkunst'' (1757–1765), intended to contain an account of all previous German plays, though not complete is still valuable.&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; He was also the editor of several journals devoted to literary criticism.

Gottsched wrote the texts of two [[List of secular cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach|secular cantatas]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]: ''[[Laß, Fürstin, laß noch einen Strahl]]'' ([[BWV]]&amp;nbsp;198) and ''[[Willkommen! Ihr herrschenden Götter der Erden]]'' (BWV&amp;nbsp;Anh.&amp;nbsp;13, music lost).

==Family==

His first wife, [[Luise Gottsched|Luise Kulmus]] was also a prominent author. She died in 1762. After a three-year mourning period, in 1765 in [[Camburg]] [[Saale]], Gottsched married his 19-year-old second wife, Ernestine Susanne Katharina Neunes (1746–1811).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3337">'''Johannes Sløk''' (27 April 1916 in [[Frederiksberg]] &amp;ndash; 30 June 2001) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[professor]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] and founder of "Idéhistorie" (''[[History of ideas]]''), an interdisciplinary discipline mainly about writings pertaining to the ideas of [[Western culture]] since Antiquity. The concept is now the "Institute of Philosophy and History of Ideas" a department under the faculty of humanities of Aarhus university. During the student rising of 1968, Sløk was forced to leave his position as professor at Idéhistorie, and the institute became oriented around Marxist theory. Sløk instead was granted a special position at the Department of Theology, as professor of analytic theology. Sløk was one of the four [[Aarhus theologians]] and wrote a series of books on religion and its meaning to the modern man.

'''Kendra Coulter''' (born 1979) is a Canadian [[labour studies]] scholar with a background in [[anthropology]] who is currently an [[associate professor]] at the Centre for Labour Studies at [[Brock University]]. She is the author of ''Revolutionizing Retail: Workers, Political Action, and Social Change'' (2014) and ''Animals, Work, &amp; the Promise of Interspecies Solidarity'' (2016). In the latter book, Coulter develops the concepts of interspecies solidarity and humane jobs.

==Career==
Coulter was trained as an [[anthropologist]], studying at the [[University of Western Ontario]], from which she graduated with a [[bachelor of arts|BA]] in 2002, and the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Brock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt; Her [[doctoral thesis]], ''Chameleons, Chimeras and Shape-Shifters: The Production of Neoliberal Government in Ontario'', was successfully defended at Toronto in May 2007.&lt;ref name="Toronto"&gt;"[http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/research/graduate-student-research/phd-degrees-conferred/ PhD degrees conferred]". [[University of Toronto]]. Accessed 20 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, she worked for a time in Sociology &amp; Anthropology at the [[University of Windsor]].&lt;ref name="Windsor"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515194550/http://web4.uwindsor.ca/kcoulter|url=http://web4.uwindsor.ca/kcoulter|archivedate=15 May 2010|publisher=University of Windsor|title= Dr. Kendra Coulter}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then went on to Centre for Labour Studies, [[Brock University]], where she is currently an [[associate professor]].&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121043643/https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/departments-and-centres/labour-studies/faculty-members/kendra-coulter|archivedate=21 November 2016|url=https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/departments-and-centres/labour-studies/faculty-members/kendra-coulter|title=Kendra Coulter|publisher=Brock University}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Brock, Coulter published her first book, the [[edited collection|collection]] ''Governing Cultures: Anthropological Perspectives on Political Labor, Power, and Government'', which she co-edited with William R. Schumann. ''Governing Cultures'' was published in 2012 by [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Kendra, and William R. Schumann, eds. ''Governing Cultures''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter's first monograph, ''Revolutionizing Retail: Workers, Political Action, and Social Change'' was published in 2014 by Palgrave Macmillan. The book explores the [[retail]] sector, examining how the lives of workers in the industry can be transformed. She first examines the nature of retail work, and then looks to the successes and promise of retail [[Trade union|unions]] in changing workers' lives and situations. Coulter then considers retail more broadly, examining a range of possible avenues for political change. Amanda Pyman, who reviewed the book for ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', said that it was "Essential reading for all employment relations scholars ... Coulter should be commended for this valuable contribution to what is still, despite the prominence of retail in global economies, an understudied sector. In the process, she offers a valuable reminder of the importance of workers' struggles in organising for social change."&lt;ref&gt;Pyman, Amanda (June 12, 2014).

Canadian Association for Work and Labour Studies. Accessed 20 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her second monograph, 2016's ''Animals, Work, &amp; the Promise of Interspecies Solidarity'', Coulter examines the work people do with animals as well as the [[working animal|work done by animals]], drawing upon a range of theoretical perspectives including [[Feminist economics|feminist political economy]]. In both labour studies and [[human-animal studies]], Coulter argues, the work done by and for animals has been underexplored. Coulter not only explores these topics, arguing that animals' work should be recognised as such, but critically engages with them, offering alternative ways to conceptualise the place of animals in the workplace and society, with a focus on improving lives and alleviating suffering. She calls for an interspecies [[solidarity]], and the development of humane jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2017).

{{Philosophy sidebar}}

This is a list of some of the major '''[[List of unsolved problems|unsolved problems]] in [[philosophy]]'''. Clearly, unsolved philosophical problems exist in the lay sense (e.g. "[[Meaning of life|What is the meaning of life?]]", "[[Origin of life|Where did we come from?]]", "[[Reality|What is reality?]]", etc.). However, professional philosophers generally accord serious philosophical problems specific names or questions, which indicate a particular method of attack or line of reasoning. As a result, broad and untenable topics become manageable. It would therefore be beyond the scope of this article to categorize "life" (and similar vague categories) as an unsolved philosophical problem.

==Aesthetics==

===Essentialism===
{{Main|Essentialism}}{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
In art, essentialism is the idea that each [[List of artistic mediums|medium]] has its own particular strengths and weaknesses, contingent on its mode of communication. A [[chase scene]], for example, may be appropriate for [[film|motion pictures]], but poorly realized in [[poetry]], because the essential components of the poetic medium are ill suited to convey the information of a chase scene. This idea may be further refined, and it may be said that the [[haiku]] is a poor vehicle for describing a lover's affection, as opposed to the [[sonnet]]. Essentialism is attractive to artists, because it not only delineates the role of art and media, but also prescribes a method for evaluating art (quality correlates to the degree of [[organic form]]). However, considerable criticism has been leveled at essentialism, which has been unable to formally define organic form or for that matter, medium. What, after all, is the medium of poetry? If it is language, how is this distinct from the medium of prose fiction? Is the distinction really a distinction in medium or [[genre]]? Questions about organic form, its definition, and its role in art remain controversial. Generally, working artists accept some form of the concept of organic form, whereas philosophers have tended to regard it as vague and irrelevant.

===Art objects===
 {{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
This problem originally arose from the practice rather than theory of art. [[Marcel Duchamp]], in the 20th century, challenged conventional notions of what "art" is, placing ordinary objects in galleries to prove that the context rather than content of an art piece determines what art is. In music, [[John Cage]] followed up on Duchamp's ideas, asserting that the term "music" applied simply to the sounds heard within a fixed interval of time.

While it is easy to dismiss these assertions, further investigation {{who|date=March 2011}} shows that Duchamp and Cage are not so easily disproved. For example, if a pianist plays a [[Chopin]] [[etude]], but his finger slips missing one note, is it still the Chopin etude or a new piece of music entirely? Most people would agree that it is still a Chopin etude (albeit with a missing note), which brings into play the [[Sorites paradox]], mentioned below. If one accepts that this is not a fundamentally changed work of music, however, is one implicitly agreeing with Cage that it is merely the duration and context of musical performance, rather than the precise content, which determines what music is? Hence, the question is what the criteria for art objects are and whether these criteria are entirely context-dependent.

==Philosophy of language==

===Counterfactuals===
{{Main|Counterfactual conditional}}
A counterfactual statement is a conditional statement with a false antecedent. For example, the statement "If [[Joseph Swan]] had not invented the modern [[incandescent light bulb]], then someone else would have invented it anyway" is a counterfactual, because in fact, Joseph Swan invented the modern incandescent light bulb. The most immediate task concerning counterfactuals is that of explaining their truth-conditions. As a start, one might assert that background information is assumed when stating and interpreting counterfactual conditionals and that this background information is just every true statement about the world as it is (pre-counterfactual). In the case of the Swan statement, we have certain trends in the history of technology, the utility of artificial light, the discovery of electricity, and so on. We quickly encounter an error with this initial account: among the true statements will be "Joseph Swan did invent the modern incandescent light bulb." From the conjunction of this statement (call it "S") and the antecedent of the counterfactual ("¬S"), we can derive any conclusion, and we have the unwelcome result that any statement follows from any counterfactual (see the [[principle of explosion]]). [[Nelson Goodman]] takes up this and related issues in his seminal [[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]; and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s influential articulation of [[possible world]] theory is popularly applied in efforts to solve it.

==Epistemology==
Epistemological problems are concerned with the nature, scope and limitations of knowledge.
[[Epistemology]] may also be described as the study of knowledge.

===Gettier problem===
{{Main|Gettier problem}}
[[Plato]] suggests, in his ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (210a) and ''[[Meno]]'' (97a–98b), that "knowledge" may be defined as justified true belief. For over two millennia, this definition of knowledge has been reinforced and accepted by subsequent philosophers. An item of information's justifiability, truth, and belief  have been seen as the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge..

In 1963, [[Edmund Gettier]] published an article in the journal "[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]", a peer reviewed academic journal of philosophy, entitled "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" which offered instances of justified true belief that do not conform to the generally understood meaning of "knowledge." Gettier's examples hinged on instances of [[Epistemology|epistemic]] luck: cases where a person appears to have sound evidence for a proposition, and that proposition is in fact true, but the apparent evidence is not causally related to the proposition's truth.

In response to Gettier's article, numerous philosophers{{who|date=July 2015}} have offered modified criteria for "knowledge." There is no general consensus to adopt any of the modified definitions yet proposed. Finally, if [[infallibilism]] is true, that would seem to definitively solve the Gettier problem for good--the idea is that knowledge requires certainty, such that, certainty is what serves to bridge the gap so that we arrive at knowledge, which means we would have an adequate definition of knowledge. However, infallibilism is rejected by the overwhelming majority of philosophers/epistemologists, even though it would solve the Gettier problem (if true).

===Problem of the criterion===
{{Main|Problem of the criterion}}

Overlooking for a moment the complications posed by Gettier problems, philosophy has essentially continued to operate on the principle that knowledge is justified true belief. The obvious question that this definition entails is how one can know whether one's justification is sound. One must therefore provide a justification for the justification. That justification itself requires justification, and the questioning continues interminably.

The conclusion is that no one can truly have knowledge of anything, since it is, due to this infinite regression, impossible to satisfy the justification element. In practice, this has caused little concern to philosophers, since the demarcation between a reasonably exhaustive investigation and superfluous investigation is usually clear.

Others argue for forms of [[coherentist]] systems, e.g. [[Foundherentism|Susan Haack]]. Recent work by [[Peter D. Klein]]&lt;ref&gt;Klein, P. D., “Human Knowledge and the Infinite Progress of Reasoning,” Philosophical Studies, 134. 1, 2007, 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; views knowledge as essentially defeasible. Therefore, an [[infinite regress]] is unproblematic, since any known fact may be overthrown on sufficiently in-depth investigation.

===Molyneux problem===
{{Main|Molyneux's problem}}

The Molyneux problem dates back to the following question posed by [[William Molyneux]] to [[John Locke]] in the 17th century: if a man born blind, and able to distinguish by touch between a [[cube]] and a [[globe]], were made to see, could he now tell by sight which was the cube and which the globe, before he touched them? The problem raises fundamental issues in [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], and was widely discussed after Locke included it in the second edition of his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke|Locke, John]]. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Book 2, Chapter 9.
{{quote|"I shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molyneux, which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since; and it is this:—"Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: quaere, whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?" To which the acute and judicious proposer answers, "Not. For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube."—I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt. This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he thinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather, because this observing gentleman further adds, that "having, upon the occasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar problem was also addressed earlier in the 12th century by [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer), in his [[philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus''). His version of the problem, however, dealt mainly with colors rather than shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik [[Ibn Tufayl]] and Léon Gauthier (1981), ''Risalat Hayy ibn Yaqzan'', p. 5, Editions de la Méditerranée.
{{quote|"If you want a comparison that will make you clearly grasp the difference between the [[perception]], such as it is understood by that sect [the Sufis] and the perception as others understand it, imagine a person born [[Blindness|blind]], endowed however with a happy natural [[temperament]], with a lively and firm [[intelligence]], a sure [[memory]], a straight sprite, who grew up from the time he was an infant in a city where he never stopped learning, by means of the [[sense]]s he did dispose of, to know the inhabitants individually, the numerous species of beings, living as well as non-living, there, the streets and sidestreets, the houses, the steps, in such a manner as to be able to cross the city without a guide, and to recognize immediately those he met; the [[color]]s alone would not be known to him except by the names they bore, and by certain definitions that designated them. Suppose that he had arrived at this point and suddenly, his eyes were opened, he recovered his view, and he crosses the entire city, making a tour of it. He would find no object different from the idea he had made of it; he would encounter nothing he didn’t recognize, he would find the colors conformable to the descriptions of them that had been given to him; and in this there would only be two new important things for him, one the consequence of the other: a clarity, a greater [[brightness]], and a great voluptuousness."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lobel, Diana. ''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Baḥya Ibn Paqūda's Duties of the Heart'', [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 2006, p.24. {{ISBN|0-8122-3953-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern science may now have the tools necessary to test this problem in controlled environments. The resolution of this problem is in some sense provided by the study of human subjects who gain vision after extended congenital blindness. In one such study, subjects were unable to immediately link objects known by touch to their visual appearance, and only gradually developed the ability to do so over a period of days or months. &lt;ref name=Held2011&gt;

===Münchhausen trilemma===
The [[Münchhausen trilemma]], also called [[Agrippa the Skeptic|Agrippa]]'s trilemma, purports that it is impossible to prove any certain [[truth]] even in fields such as logic and mathematics. According to this argument, the proof of any theory rests either on [[circular reasoning]], infinite regress, or unproven [[axiom]]s.

===Qualia===
{{See also|Distinguishing blue from green in language}}{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
The question hinges on whether [[color]] is a product of the mind or an inherent property of objects. While most philosophers will agree that color assignment corresponds to spectra of light [[frequencies]], it is not at all clear whether the particular psychological phenomena of color are imposed on these visual signals by the mind, or whether such [[qualia]] are somehow naturally associated with their [[noumenon|noumena]]. Another way to look at this question is to assume two people ("Fred" and "George" for the sake of convenience) see colors differently. That is, when Fred sees the sky, his mind interprets this light signal as blue. He calls the sky "blue." However, when George sees the sky, his mind assigns green to that light frequency. If Fred were able to step into George's mind, he would be amazed that George saw green skies. However, George has learned to associate the word "blue" with what his mind sees as green, and so he calls the sky "blue", because for him the color green has the name "blue." The question is whether blue must be blue for all people, or whether the [[perception]] of that particular color is assigned by the mind.

This extends to all areas of the physical reality, where the outside world we perceive is merely a representation of what is impressed upon the senses. The objects we see are in truth wave-emitting (or reflecting) objects which the brain shows to the conscious self in various forms and colors. Whether the colors and forms experienced perfectly match between person to person, may never be known. That people can communicate accurately shows that the order and proportionality in which experience is interpreted is generally reliable. Thus one's reality is, at least, compatible to another person's in terms of structure and ratio.

==Ethics==

===Moral luck===
{{Main|Moral luck}}
The problem of moral luck is that some people are born into, live within, and experience circumstances that seem to change their moral culpability when all other factors remain the same.

For instance, a case of ''circumstantial moral luck:'' a poor person is born into a poor family, and has no other way to feed himself so he steals his food. Another person, born into a very wealthy family, does very little but has ample food and does not need to steal to get it. Should the poor person be more morally blameworthy than the rich person? After all, it is not this person's fault that they were born into such circumstances, but a matter of "luck".

A related case is ''resultant moral luck.'' For instance, two persons behave in a morally culpable way, such as driving carelessly, but end up producing unequal amounts of harm: one strikes a pedestrian and kills him, while the other does not. That one driver caused a death and the other did not is no part of the drivers' intentional actions; yet most observers would likely ascribe greater blame to the driver who killed (compare [[consequentialism]] and
[[choice]]).

The fundamental question of moral luck is how our moral responsibility is changed by factors over which we have no control.

===Moral knowledge===
Are moral facts possible, what do they consist in, and how do we come to know them? Rightness and wrongness seem strange kinds of entities, and different from the usual properties of things in the world, such as wetness, being red, or solidity. Richmond Campbell&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/moral-epistemology/ Campbell, Richmond, "Moral Epistemology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; has outlined these kinds of issues in his encyclopedia article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology/#TheFac Moral Epistemology].

In particular, he considers three alternative explanations of moral facts as: theological, (supernatural, the commands of God); non-natural (based on intuitions); or simply natural properties (such as leading to pleasure or to happiness). There are cogent arguments against each of these alternative accounts, he claims, and there has not been any fourth alternative proposed. So the existence of moral knowledge and moral facts remains dubious and in need of further investigation. But moral knowledge supposedly already plays an important part in our everyday thinking, in our legal systems  and criminal investigations.

==Philosophy of mathematics==

===Mathematical objects===
{{Main|Mathematical structure}}
What are [[number]]s, [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Fixed point (mathematics)|points]], etc.? Are they real objects or are they simply relationships that necessarily exist in all structures? Although many disparate views exist regarding what a mathematical object is, the discussion may be roughly partitioned into two opposing schools of thought: [[platonism]], which asserts that mathematical objects are real, and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], which asserts that mathematical objects are merely [[Formal system|formal constructions]]. This dispute may be better understood when considering specific examples, such as the "[[continuum hypothesis]]". The continuum hypothesis has been proven independent of the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF axioms]] of [[set theory]], so within that system, the proposition can neither be proven true nor proven false. A formalist would therefore say that the continuum hypothesis is neither true nor false, unless you further refine the context of the question. A platonist, however, would assert that there either does or does not exist a transfinite set with a [[cardinality]] less than the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] but greater than any [[countable set]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} So, regardless of whether it has been [[Mathematical proof|proven]] unprovable, the platonist would argue that an answer nonetheless does exist.

==Metaphysics==

===Why there is something rather than nothing===
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
The question about why is there anything at all instead of nothing has been raised or commented on by philosophers including [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;"''why is there something rather than nothing?''", section 7, [https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwor00leibuoft "Principles of Nature and Grace"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] − who called it the fundamental question of [[metaphysics]]&lt;!--"Warum ist überhaupt Seiendes und nicht vielmehr Nichts?"--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fundamental Question|url=https://www.hedweb.com/witherall/existence.htm|website=www.hedweb.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Manfred|title=Wittgenstein und Heidegger: Die letzten Philosophen|publisher=Rowohlt Verlag|isbn=9783644045118|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JUiFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP166|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; − and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is." [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] 6.44 https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5740/5740-pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The question is general, rather than concerning the existence of anything specific such as the [[universe]]/[[multiverse|s]], the [[Big Bang]], [[mathematics|mathematical laws]], [[physical law]]s, [[time]], [[consciousness]] or [[God]].

===Problem of universals===
{{Main|Problem of universals}}

===Principle of individuation===
{{Main|Principle of individuation}}
Related to the quarrel of universals, the principle of individuation is what individuates universals.

===Sorites paradox===
{{Main|Sorites paradox}}
Otherwise known as the "[[paradox]] of the heap", the question regards how one defines a "thing." Is a bale of hay still a bale of hay if you remove one straw? If so, is it still a bale of hay if you remove another straw? If you continue this way, you will eventually deplete the entire bale of hay, and the question is: at what point is it no longer a bale of hay? While this may initially seem like a superficial problem, it penetrates to fundamental issues regarding how we define objects. This is similar to [[Ship of Theseus|Theseus' paradox]] and the [[Continuum fallacy]].

=== Theseus' Paradox ===
Also known as the Ship of Theseus, this is a classical paradox on the first branch of metaphysics, Ontology (philosophy of existence &amp; identity). The paradox runs thus:              There used to be the great ship of Theseus which was made out of, say, 100 parts. Each part has a single corresponding replacement part in the ship's storeroom. The ship then sets out on a voyage. The ship sails through monster-infested waters, and every day, a single piece is damaged and has to be replaced. On the hundredth day, the ship sails back to port, the voyage completed. Through the course of this journey, everything on the ship has been replaced. So, is the ship sailing back home the ship of Theseus or no?

If yes, consider this: the broken original parts are repaired and re-assembled. Is this the ship of Theseus or no?                                                                                                               If no, let us name the ship that sails into port "The Argo". At what point (during the journey) did the crew of the Theseus become the crew of the Argo? And what ship is sailing on the fiftieth day? If both the ships trade a single piece, are they still the same ships?

This paradox is a minor variation of the Sorites Paradox above, and has many variations itself. Both sides of the paradox have convincing arguments and counter-arguments, though no one is close to proving it completely.

===Material implication===
{{Main|Material conditional}}
People have a pretty clear idea what if-then means. In [[formal logic]] however, material implication defines if-then, which is not consistent with the common understanding of conditionals. In formal logic, the statement "If today is Saturday, then 1+1=2" is true. However, '1+1=2' is true regardless of the content of the antecedent; a causal or meaningful relation is not required. The statement as a whole must be true, because 1+1=2 cannot be false. (If it could, then on a given Saturday, so could the statement). Formal logic has shown itself extremely useful in formalizing argumentation, philosophical reasoning, and mathematics. The discrepancy between material implication and the general conception of conditionals however is a topic of intense investigation: whether it is an inadequacy in formal logic, an ambiguity of ordinary [[language]], or as championed by [[Paul Grice|H.P. Grice]], that no discrepancy exists.

==Philosophy of mind==

===Mind–body problem===
The [[mind–body problem]] is the problem of determining the relationship between the human body and the human mind. Philosophical positions on this question are generally predicated on either a reduction of one to the other, or a belief in the discrete coexistence of both. This problem is usually exemplified by Descartes, who championed a dualistic picture. The problem therein is to establish how the mind and body communicate in a [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] framework. [[Neurobiology]] and [[emergence]] have further complicated the problem by allowing the material functions of the mind to be a representation of some further aspect emerging from the mechanistic properties of the brain. The brain essentially stops generating conscious thought during deep sleep; the ability to restore such a pattern remains a mystery to science and is a subject of current research (see also [[neurophilosophy]]).

===Cognition and AI===
This problem actually defines a field, however its pursuits are specific and easily stated. Firstly, what are the criteria for [[intelligence]]? What are the necessary components for defining [[consciousness]]? Secondly, how can an outside observer test for these criteria? The "[[Turing Test]]" is often cited as a prototypical test of intelligence, although it is almost universally regarded as insufficient. It involves a conversation between a sentient being and a machine, and if the being can't tell he is talking to a machine, it is considered intelligent. A well trained machine, however, could theoretically "parrot" its way through the test. This raises the corollary question of whether it is possible to [[artificial intelligence|artificially create consciousness]] (usually in the context of [[computer]]s or [[machine]]s), and of how to tell a well-trained mimic from a sentient entity.

Important thought in this area includes most notably: [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room|Chinese Room]], [[Hubert Dreyfus]]' non-cognitivist critique, as well as [[Hilary Putnam]]'s work on [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]].

A related field is the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]], which addresses such problems as the existence of moral personhood of AIs, the possibility of moral obligations ''to'' AIs (for instance, the right of a possibly sentient computer system to not be turned off), and the question of making AIs that behave ethically towards humans and others.

===Hard problem of consciousness===
The [[hard problem of consciousness]] is the question of what consciousness is and why we have consciousness as opposed to being [[philosophical zombies]]. The adjective "hard" is to contrast with the "easy" consciousness problems, which seek to explain the mechanisms of consciousness ("why" versus "how", or [[final cause]] versus [[efficient cause]]). The hard problem of consciousness is questioning whether all beings undergo an experience of consciousness rather than questioning the neurological makeup of beings.

==Philosophy of science==

===Problem of induction===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
Intuitively, it seems to be the case that we know certain things with absolute, complete, utter, unshakable certainty. For example, if you travel to the Arctic and touch an iceberg, you know that it would feel cold. These things that we know from experience are known through induction. The problem of induction in short; (1) any inductive statement (like the sun will rise tomorrow) can only be deductively shown if one assumes that nature is uniform. (2) the only way to show that nature is uniform is by using induction. Thus induction cannot be justified deductively.

===Demarcation problem===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
‘The problem of demarcation’ is an expression introduced by [[Karl Popper]] to refer to ‘the problem of finding a criterion which would enable us to distinguish between the empirical sciences on the one hand, and mathematics and logic as well as "metaphysical" systems on the other’. Popper attributes this problem to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Although Popper mentions mathematics and logic, other writers focus on distinguishing [[science]] from [[metaphysics]].

===Realism===
{{Main|Scientific realism}}
Does a world independent of human beliefs and representations exist? Is such a world empirically accessible, or would such a world be forever beyond the bounds of human sense and hence unknowable? Can human activity and agency change the objective structure of the world? These questions continue to receive much attention in the philosophy of science. A clear "yes" to the first question is a hallmark of the scientific realism perspective. Philosophers such as [[Bas van Fraassen]] have important and interesting answers to the second question. In addition to the realism vs. [[empiricism]] axis of debate, there is a realism vs. [[social constructivism]] axis which heats many academic passions. With respect to the third question, [[Paul Boghossian]]'s {{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Epistemology/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5OTI4NzE4NQ== |title=Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Constructivism |author= |year=2006 |work= |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate= }} is a powerful critique of social constructivism, for instance. Ian Hacking's ''The Social Construction of What?'' (Harvard UP, 2000) constitutes a more moderate critique of constructivism, which usefully disambiguates confusing polysemy of the term "constructivism."

'''Michael Andrew Smith''' (born 23 July 1954) is an Australian [[philosopher]] who teaches at [[Princeton University]] (since September 2004).&lt;ref name="Smith's web page"&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~msmith/ Smith's web page].&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught previously at the [[University of Oxford]], [[Monash University]], and was a member of the Philosophy Program at the Research School of Social Sciences, [[Australian National University]]. He is the author of a number of important books and articles in [[moral philosophy]].  In 2013, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S36/69/07E29/index.xml?section=people&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Smith earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Master of Arts |M.A.]] in philosophy at [[Monash University]], while his [[BPhil]] and [[DPhil]] were acquired at [[Oxford University]] under the direction of [[Simon Blackburn]].&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to Smith's ''The Moral Problem'' (1994, p. xi).&lt;/ref&gt; He has held teaching appointments at various universities, including Wadham College, Oxford (1984), Monash (1984-5; 1989–94), Princeton (1985-9; 2004-present), and the Research School of Social Sciences at the [[Australian National University]] (1995-2004).&lt;ref name="Smith's web page"/&gt;

In 2000, Smith's book ''The Moral Problem'' (1994) received The [[American Philosophical Association]]'s first APA Book Prize for excellence in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/opportunities/prizes/book.html&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is considered to be one of the most important philosophers working in meta-ethics, and is one of the main proponents of a Neo-[[David Hume|Humean]] approach to practical reason.

==Work==

===The moral problem===

In ''The Moral Problem'' Smith diagnoses a longstanding tension between the apparent objectivity and practicality of moral judgments. The idea of moral objectivity is that "it is a distinctive feature of engaging in moral practice that the participants are concerned to get the answers to moral questions ''right''." (1994 p.&amp;nbsp;5) Moral judgments are thought to be practical because they are thought to motivate those who accept them. But according to the Humean theory of motivation, a theory that Smith defends in chapter 4, it is not possible for a belief (a judgement about a matter of fact) to motivate someone without the presence of some antecedently held desire. Thus, if moral judgments are beliefs that motivate, they can only be beliefs about how to get something that we already want. But moral judgments, such as the judgment that murder is wrong, are not judgments about how to get something that we already want. Therefore, either they are not beliefs at all (and therefore not objective) or they cannot motivate us (and therefore not practical).

===Neo-Humeanism===

Hume famously claimed that reason is, and ought to be, only the slave of the passions. Humeans or Neo-Humeans do not typically hold strictly to Hume's views because, for one thing, they do not think of the passions in the same way that Hume did. Nonetheless, Humeans take their inspiration from Hume in claiming that reason alone is insufficient to motivate us to act. Often this claim is expressed in terms of beliefs and desires, and it is claimed that beliefs are mental states that are insufficient for motivation. Smith gives an analysis of action whereby in order for anything to count as an action at all, it must be explicable in terms of a belief-desire pair. He defends this account against objections by appeal to a dispositional conception of desire.

===Moral realism===

Smith later goes on to give an anti-Humean account of normative reasons. He thus claims to solve the moral problem by giving an account of moral judgments in terms of what one would desire if one were fully rational. As such, he attempts to maintain a form of moral realism while still accounting for the motivational force of moral judgments.

A book named after him, the [[Mozi (book)|''Mozi'']], contains material ascribed to him and his followers.

Born in what is now [[Tengzhou]], [[Shandong]] Province, he founded the school of [[Mohism]] that argued strongly against [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]. His philosophy emphasized self-restraint, self-reflection and authenticity rather than obedience to ritual. During the [[Warring States period]], Mohism was actively developed and practiced in many states but fell out of favour when the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalist]] [[Qin dynasty]] came to power.  During that period, many Mohist classics are by many believed to have been ruined when the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] supposedly carried out the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]]. The importance of Mohism further declined when Confucianism became the dominant school of thought during the [[Han Dynasty]], until mostly disappearing by the middle of the [[Western Han dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Fraser | first = Chris | title = Mohism | encyclopedia = "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy" | year = 2002 | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2002/entries/mohism/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozi is known by children throughout [[Chinese culture]] by way of the ''[[Thousand Character Classic]]'', which records that he was saddened when he saw dyeing of pure white silk, which embodied his conception of austerity (simplicity, chastity). For the modern juvenile audience of Chinese speakers, the image of his school and its founder were popularized by the animated TV series ''[[The Legend of Qin (animated TV series)|The Legend of Qin]]''.

The concept of Ai (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of "universal love" (jiān'ài, 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term Ai (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, Ai was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

==Life==
[[File:Chinese plain 5c. BC-en.svg|alt=|thumb|Mozi was born in Lu (seen toward the north, with a small coastline along the Yellow Sea) and spent some time as a government minister in Song (a landlocked state to the south of Lu)]]
Most historians believe that Mozi was a member of the lower artisan class who managed to climb his way to an official post. It is known, however, that his parents were not affectionate towards him and showed him very little love. Mozi was a native of the [[Lu (state)|State of Lu]] (today's Tengzhou, Shandong Province), although for a time he served as a minister in the [[Song (state)|State of Song]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1956}} 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Confucius]], Mozi was known to have maintained a school for those who desired to become officials serving in the different ruling courts of the Warring States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1956}} 165–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozi was a carpenter and was extremely skilled in creating devices (see [[Lu Ban]]). Though he did not hold a high official position, Mozi was sought out by various rulers as an expert on [[fortification]]. He was schooled in Confucianism in his early years, but he viewed Confucianism as being too fatalistic and emphasizing too much on elaborate celebrations and funerals which he felt were detrimental to the livelihood and productivity of common people. He managed to attract a large following during his lifetime which rivaled that of Confucius. His followers—mostly technicians and craftspeople—were organized in a disciplined order that studied both Mozi's philosophical and technical writings.

According to some accounts of the popular understanding of Mozi at the time, he had been hailed by many as the greatest hero to come from [[Henan]]. His passion was said to be for the good of the people, without concern for personal gain or even for his own life or death. His tireless contribution to society was praised by many, including Confucius' disciple [[Mencius]]. Mencius wrote in ''Jinxin'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|孟|子|盡|心}}|p=Mengzi Jinxin}}) that Mozi believed in love for all mankind. As long as something benefits mankind, Mozi will pursue it even if it means hurting his head or his feet. [[Zhang Tai Yan]] said that in terms of moral virtue, even Confucius and Laozi cannot compare to Mozi.

Mozi travelled from one crisis zone to another throughout the ravaged landscape of the Warring States, trying to dissuade rulers from their plans of conquest. According to the chapter "Gongshu" in ''Mozi'', he once walked for ten days to the [[State of Chu]] in order to forestall an attack on the State of Song. At the Chu court, Mozi engaged in nine simulated war games with [[Lu Ban|Gongshu Ban]], the chief military strategist of Chu, and overturned each one of his stratagems. When Gongshu Ban threatened him with death, Mozi informed the king that his disciples had already trained the soldiers of Song in his fortification methods, so it would be useless to kill him. The Chu king was forced to call off the war. On the way back, however, the soldiers of Song, not recognizing him, would not allow Mozi to enter their city, and he had to spend a night freezing in the rain. After this episode, he also stopped the [[State of Qi]] from attacking the State of Lu. He taught that defense of a city does not depend only on fortification, weaponry and food supply; it is also important to keep talented people close by and to put trust in them.

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Mozi (book)}}
[[File:Chongwu city wall.JPG|alt=|thumb|The Mohists were experts at building fortifications and [[siege]] defenses]]
Mozi's moral teachings emphasized self-reflection and authenticity rather than obedience to ritual. He observed that we often learn about the world through adversity ("Embracing Scholars" in ''Mozi''). By reflecting on one's own successes and failures, one attains true self-knowledge rather than mere conformity to ritual ("Refining Self" in ''Mozi''). Mozi exhorted people to lead a life of asceticism and self-restraint, renouncing both material and spiritual extravagance.

Like Confucius, Mozi idealized the [[Xia Dynasty]] and the ancients of [[Chinese mythology]], but he criticized the Confucian belief that modern life should be patterned on the ways of the ancients. After all, he pointed out, what we think of as "ancient" was actually innovative in its time, and thus should not be used to hinder present-day innovation ("Against Confucianism, Part 3" in the ''Mozi''). Though Mozi did not believe that history necessarily progresses, as did [[Han Fei Zi]], he shared the latter's critique of [[destiny|fate]] ({{linktext|命}}, ''mìng''). Mozi believed that people were capable of changing their circumstances and directing their own lives. They could do this by applying their senses to observing the world, judging objects and events by their causes, their functions, and their historical bases. ("Against Fate, Part 3") This was the "three-prong method" Mozi recommended for testing the truth or falsehood of statements. His students later expanded on this to form the [[School of Names]].

Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese ideal of strong attachments to family and [[Chinese clan|clan]] structures with the concept of "impartial caring" or "universal love" ({{linktext|兼|愛}}, ''jiān ài''). He argued directly against Confucians, who had philosophized that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, in contrast, argued that people in principle should care for all people equally, a notion that philosophers in other schools found absurd, as they interpreted this notion as implying no special amount of care or duty towards one's parents and family.

Overlooked by those critics, however, is a passage in the chapter on "Self-Cultivation" which states, "When people near-by are not befriended, there is no use endeavoring to attract those at a distance." This point is also precisely articulated by a Mohist in a debate with Mencius (in the Mencius), where the Mohist argues in relation to carrying out universal love, that "We begin with what is near." Also, in the first chapter of the writings of Mozi on universal love, Mozi argues that the best way of being filial to one's parents is to be filial to the parents of others. The foundational principle is that benevolence, as well as malevolence, is requited, and that one will be treated by others as one treats others. Mozi quotes a popular passage from the ''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Odes]]'' to bring home this point: "When one throws to me a peach, I return to him a plum." One’s parents will be treated by others as one treats the parents of others. In pursuing this line of argument, Mozi was directly appealing to the idea of [[enlightened self-interest]] in social relations. Also of note is the fact that Mozi differentiated between "intention" and "actuality", thereby placing a central importance on the will to love, even though in practice it may very well be impossible to bring benefit to everyone.

In addition, Mozi argued that benevolence comes to human beings "as naturally as fire turns upward or water turns downward", provided that persons in positions of authority illustrate benevolence in their own lives. In differentiating between the ideas of "universal" (''jian'') and "differential" (''bie''), Mozi said that "universal" comes from righteousness while "differential" entails human effort. Furthermore, Mozi's basic argument concerning universal love asserts that universal love is supremely practical, and this argument was directed against those who objected that such love could not be put into practice.&lt;!--what does this sentence mean?--&gt;

Mozi also held a belief in the power of ghosts and spirits, although he is often thought to have only worshipped them pragmatically. In fact, in his discussion on ghosts and spirits, he remarks that even if they did not exist, communal gatherings for the sake of making sacrificial offering would play a role in strengthening social bonds. Furthermore, for Mozi the will of [[Tian|Heaven]] ({{linktext|天}}, [[Tian|tiān]]) was that people should love one another, and that mutual love by all would bring benefit to all. Therefore, it was in everyone's interest that they love others "as they love themselves". Heaven should be respected because failing to do so would subject one to punishment. For Mozi, Heaven was not the "amoral", mystical nature of the [[Taoists]]. Rather, it was a benevolent, moral force that rewarded good and punished evil. Similar in some ways to the [[Abrahamic religions]], Mozi believed that all living things live in a realm ruled by Heaven, and Heaven has a will which is independent from and higher than the will of man. Thus he writes that "Universal love is the Way of Heaven", since "Heaven nourishes and sustains all life without regard to status." ("Laws and Customs" in ''Mozi'') Mozi's ideal of government, which advocated a meritocracy based on talent rather than background, also followed his idea of Heaven.

Anti-fatalism(非命)- Mozi opposed to Confucian "Destiny"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=Dahua|date=2009-09-01|title=Rational awareness of the ultimate in human life – The Confucian concept of 'destiny'|journal=Frontiers of Philosophy in China|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=309–321|doi=10.1007/s11466-009-0020-7|issn=1673-3436}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought, class differences and other ideas. Mozi put forward to promote people's victory, things in the subjective attitude to life, encourage people to work hard to change their fate and inequality in the world. In Confucius's opinion, a person's life and death, wealth and poverty are completely related to destiny and personal power can not be changed.

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, is the "world's earliest form of consequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Chris, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N.

Nivison|David Shepherd Nivison]], in ''[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]'', writes that the moral goods of Mohism "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth ... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; In contrast to [[Jeremy Bentham]], Mozi did not believe that individual happiness was important; the consequences of the [[State (polity)|state]] outweigh the consequences of individual actions.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;&lt;!--"consequences for the state"?--&gt;

Mozi tended to evaluate actions based on whether they provide benefit to the people, which he measured in terms of an enlarged population (states were sparsely populated in his day), a prosperous economy, and social order. Like other consequentialist theories, Mozi thought that actions should be measured by the way they contribute to the "greatest societal good for what we have agreed to in a social contract". With this criterion Mozi denounced things as diverse as offensive warfare, expensive funerals, and even music and dance, which he saw as serving no useful purpose. Mozi did not object to music in principle—"It's not that I don't like the sound of the drum" ("Against Music")—but only because of the heavy tax burden such activities placed on commoners and also due to the fact that officials tended to indulge in them at the expense of their duties.&lt;!--sounds like he's only talking about public official music--&gt;

''"Mozi"'' is also the name of the philosophical text compiled by Mohists from Mozi's thought. This text originally consisted of 71 chapters. During the Han dynasty Confucianism dominated China. As Mohism is against Confucianism, the text ''"Mozi"'' was neglected. During the Song dynasty, only 61 chapters were left. Today, we have only 53 chapters through which we attempt to understand this school of thought, as compiled by [[Sun Yirang]]. Because Mohism disappeared as a living tradition from China, its texts were not well maintained, and many chapters are missing or in a corrupted state. For example, of the three chapters "Against Confucianism", only one remains.

The collection of texts from "Mozi" is a rich source of insight into early Chinese dynastic history and culture. Much of Mozi's arguments are supported by the historical claims of even earlier records. His conversations with other renowned philosophers of that era are also recorded. From them, we can distinguish [[Mohism]] from other schools of thought more clearly.

Mohism was suppressed under the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and died out completely under the [[Han Dynasty|Han]], which made Confucianism the official doctrine. However, many of its ideas were dissolved into the mainstream of Chinese thought, since both Confucians such as [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] and Taoists such as [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] expressed sympathy with Mozi's concerns. The influence of Mozi is still visible in many Han works written hundreds of years later. In modern times, Mohism was given a fresh analysis. [[Sun Yat-Sen]] used "universal love" as one of the foundations for his idea of Chinese democracy. More recently, Chinese scholars under Communism have tried to rehabilitate Mozi as a "philosopher of the people", highlighting his rational-empirical approach to the world as well as his "proletarian" background.

Some views claim that Mozi's philosophy was at once more advanced and less so than that of Confucius. His concept of "universal love" embraced a broader idea of human community than that of the Confucians, but he was less tolerant than Confucius in his condemnation of all that is not directly "useful", neglecting the humanizing functions of art and music. Zhuangzi, who criticized both the Confucians and the Mohists, had this in mind in his parables on the "usefulness of the useless". Of course, this insistence on usefulness comes from a time when war and famine were widespread and could well have made all the royal pageantry look frivolous.

However, others would say the above view is not entirely accurate, and that in fact "universal love" (博愛), as well as "the world as a commonwealth shared by all" (天下為公) advocated by Sun Yat-Sen are Confucian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Han Yu]]: "Universal love" (博愛, Boai) means [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] (Humanity) (韓愈: 博愛之謂仁).&lt;/ref&gt; "Universal love" (博愛, Boai) in Confucianism is a little different from Mozi's "universal love" (兼愛, Jian'ai): in Confucianism it tends to emphasize it as naturally befitting human relations, while in Mozi's ideas it tends to be community oriented and non-differentiated according to individual. Some modern-day supporters for Mozi (as well as Communism) make the claim that Mohism and modern Communism share a lot in terms of ideals for community life.  Others would claim that Mohism shares more with the central ideas of [[Christianity]], especially in terms of the idea of "universal love" (in Greek, "[[agape]]"), the "[[Golden Rule]]", and the relation of humanity to the supernatural realm.

== Mohism and science ==
According to [[Joseph Needham]], ''Mozi'' (collected writings of those in the tradition of Mozi, some of which might have been by Mozi himself) contains the following sentence: 'The cessation of motion is due to the opposing force... If there is no opposing force... the motion will never stop. This is as true as that an ox is not a horse.' which, he claims, is a precursor to Newton's first law of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2080.htm|title=No. 2080 The Survival of Invention|website=www.uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mozi'' also contains speculations in optics and mechanics that are similarly strikingly original, although their ideas were not taken up by later Chinese philosophers. The Mohist tradition is also highly unusual in Chinese thought in that it devoted time to developing principles of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1299964|title=NEW PERSPECTIVES ON MOHIST LOGIC|first1=LIU|last1=FENRONG|first2=ZHANG|last2=JIALONG|journal=Journal of Chinese Philosophy|volume=37|issue=4|pages=605–621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Serracino Inglott''' (April 26, 1936 – March 16, 2012) was [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[University of Malta]] (1987–1988, 1991–1996) and [[Emeritus Professor]] of [[philosophy]] at the same University.

A [[Catholic priest]], Peter Serracino Inglott was ordained in [[Milan]] by Cardinal Montini, later [[Pope Paul VI]].

==Studies==
Serracino-Inglott studied at the then [[Royal University of Malta]] (BA 1951-1955), [[Campion Hall, Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] (MA 1955-1958), the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] (BD ''cum laude'' 1958-1960) and the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] (Ph.D. 1960-1963) with a thesis on [[Wittgenstein]]’s ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.

==Academic career and honours==
He was head of the [[philosophy]] department at the University of Malta between 1971 and 1996, when he was succeeded by [[Joe Friggieri]]. He was also professor in the faculty of [[theology]] at the University.

Serracino Inglott was professor of [[aesthetics]] at the [[Instituto Internazionale di Arte e Liturgia]] at [[Milan]], visiting professor at [[Panthéon-Assas University]] (1989–1990), [[UNESCO]] Fellow at the [[Open University]], UK (1978) and guest lecturer at the universities of [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]], [[University of Milan|Milan]] (Cattolica), [[University of Venice|Venice]] (Ca Foscari), [[University of Palermo|Palermo]] and the [[College of Europe]] at [[Bruges]] (1989, 1990).

He was conferred honorary doctorates by [[Brunel University]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]], [[Iowa]] and the [[International Maritime Organization]]'s [[International Maritime Law Institute]]. He was also honoured by the French, Italian, Portuguese and Maltese governments respectively with the Chevalier of the [[Légion d'honneur]] (1990), [[Italian_orders_of_merit#Order_of_Merit_of_the_Republic_.28Ordine_al_Merito_della_Repubblica_Italiana.29|Cavaliere di Gran Croce of the Ordine al Merito]] (1995), [[Gra-Cruz da Ordam]]&lt;!-- Portugal? --&gt; (1995) and Companion of the Order of Merit (Malta) (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opm.gov.mt/om_appointments.htm|title=Maltese Government|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
Serracino Inglott was an advisor to the former [[Prime Minister of Malta]], [[Eddie Fenech Adami]] (1987–1996, 1998–2004). He was one of three Maltese representatives at the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]] presided by [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], contributing to various aspects of the debate at the Convention ranging from proposed amendments to include a reference to Europe's Christian traditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-convention.europa.eu/docs/treaty/pdf/1000/1000_Pre%20Serracino%20Inglott%20EN.pdf|title=European Convention|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to procedural proposals to streamline the EU's decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/02/cv00/00263en2.pdf|title=Error|website=register.consilium.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of the founder members of the [[Today Public Policy Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Peter Serracino Inglott Award|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150603/opinion/the-peter-serracino-inglott-award.570823|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Times of Malta|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Language is at the centre of Serracino Inglott's philosophical work with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as the two critical signposts on his conceptual terrain. From this point of view, one may link him to his friend [[Herbert McCabe]]. MacCabe, who was also an acknowledged influence on the thought of [[Terry Eagleton]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Anthony Kenny]] and [[Seamus Heaney]], was for several years external examiner in philosophy at the University of Malta. A former student of his, [[Mario Vella]], has written one of the few critical assessments of Serracino Inglott as philosopher, ''Reflections in a Canvas Bag: Beginning Philosophy Between Politics and History'' [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]], Malta: PEG, 1989 {{ISBN|99909-0-234-8}}.&lt;ref&gt;See also Mark F. Montebello, ''Stedina għall-Filosofija Maltija'', Marsa, Malta : PEG, 1995 {{ISBN|99909-0-060-4}}, for a general introduction to philosophy in Malta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his two principal philosophical texts (''[[Beginning Philosophy]]'' 1987 and ''[[Peopled Silence]]'' 1995), Serracino Inglott has written and expressed himself on the media on a variety of subjects (notably on [[biotechnology]] and [[human rights]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122704/http://www.parliament.gov.mt/information/Papers/Biotechnolog.htm]) but the [[Mediterranean]] region stands out as a [[leitmotiv]] in his thought and his core interest.

==Death==
Serracino Inglott died on 16 March 2012. He had been suffering from [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]]  and was being treated at [[Mater Dei Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120317/local/Malta-loses-its-most-brilliant-mind-.411431 ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120316/local/fr-peter-serracino-inglott.405908|title=Update 3: Fr Peter Serracino Inglott passes away|first=Allied Newspapers|last=Ltd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Politics: A Work in Constructive Social Theory''''' is a 1987 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger sets out a theory of society as artifact, attempting to complete what he describes as an unfinished revolution, begun by classic social theories such as Marxism, against the naturalistic premise in the understanding of human life and society. ''Politics'' was published in three volumes: ''False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy'', the longest volume, is an explanatory and programmatic argument of how society might be transformed to be more in keeping with the context-smashing potential of the human imagination; ''Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task'', is a "critical introduction" that delves into issues of social science underpinning Unger's project; and ''Plasticity Into Power: Comparative-Historical Studies on the Institutional Conditions of Economic and Military Success'', is a collection of three historical essays illuminating the theoretical points Unger advanced in the first two volumes. In 1997, an abridged, one-volume edition of ''Politics'' was issued as ''Politics, The Central Texts'', edited by [[Cui Zhiyuan|Zhiyuan Cui]].{{sfn|Unger|1997}}

==Volume 1: ''False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy''==

In ''False Necessity'', Unger presents both an explanatory theory of society and a program for the reform of society as a radical democracy that respects the ability of human beings continually to outreach, subvert, and remake their contexts. Unger proposes an "empowered democracy" that is structured so that it is maximally open to revision, a form of organization Unger calls "structure-revising structure." As Unger explains, "[a]s an explanatory theory of society, ''False Necessity'' seeks to free social explanation from dependence upon the denial of our freedom to resist and to remake  our forms of social life. It carries to extremes the thesis that everything in society is politics, mere politics...."{{sfn|Unger|1987a|p=1}} Unger argues that "the best hope for the advancement of the radical cause—the cause that leftists share with liberals—lies in a series of revolutionary reforms in the organization of governments and economies and in the character of our personal relations."{{sfn|Unger|1987a|p=1}}

The explanatory theory in ''False Necessity'' focuses on cycles of reform and retrenchment in the West after World War II—particularly the repetitive nature of ordinary social conflict—in which there seem to be few options for major social change.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=44-82}} Radical reform movements seem inevitably to fail even when they manage to achieve control of the government, due to a combination of business disinvestment and the bickering and jockeying for advantage among different groups of workers.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=46-49}} Unger advances a hypothesis and analysis of a [[formative context]]s that explains these stubborn cycles of reform and retrenchment.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=51-79}} Formative contexts include the institutional arrangements and imaginative presuppositions that shape people’s routines, and give certain groups mastery over the wealth, power, and knowledge in society. Unger lays a groundwork for the programmatic argument by analyzing certain possibilities in the state and in the microstructure of society—the extension of rights to guarantee the inviolability of the individual against government oppression and to meet basic material needs;{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=128-134}} the patron-client relationship as an example of a replacement of the impersonal by the personal;{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=135-144}} and a flexible variant of rationalized collective labor as a mode of work organization that breaks down the barrier between task-definers and task-executors in the workplace.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=144-163}} Unger employs the concept of [[negative capability]] to describe the quality of freedom that emerges from liberating ourselves from rigid roles and hierarchies that compose part of society's formative contexts, and notes that one limitation on remaking contexts is the difficulty of combining institutions embodying different levels of negative cability into a single context.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=164-171}} Unger concludes the explanatory section by setting forth an institutional genealogy of contemporary formative contexts{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=172-246}} and a theory of context making, both of which offer insight that can be used in remaking society.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=246-340}}

In the programmatic section of ''False Necessity'', Unger seeks to merge the modernist visionary's criticism of personal relations with the leftist's critique of collective institutions, in a program for empowered democracy. Despite the natural affinity between modernism and leftism, according to Unger, these two movements have been separated for too long, to the detriment of transformative politics.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|p=11|ps=: "The modernist criticism of personal relations and the leftist criticism of collective institutions have remained only fitfully and obscurely connected. This parting of the ways in the cultures of leftism and modernism has been amplified in political experience. The attack on stereotyped roles in personal relations has often proved strongest where the politics of institutional reinvention are weakest. The separation between these two cultures and these two transformative movements—the most powerful of all found in the modern world—has been destructive to both. It has helped deprive leftist practice of its ability to reach direct social relations and to change their fine texture. It has also threatened to degrade the politics of personal relations into a desperate search for gratification."}} Unger justifies empowered democracy as the system that will embody the "superliberalism" that Unger sees as the surest way to bring about human empowerment, in a state that is not hostage to faction and where society is an artifact of will, not a product of institutional fetishism adhering to past compromises and outmoded institutions.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=368-377}} Unger describes the "transformative movement" in its quest for empowered democracy,{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=395-432}} and sketches the principles that would inform the empowered democracy as he envisions it: institutions that are less plagued by deadlock, that decentralize the exercise of power, that represent overlapping functions, and are designed to lead to swift resolution of impasse.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=441-476}} The institutions that embody these principles include a rotating capital fund giving broad access to society's investment capital to teams of workers, a series of innovative rights (such as market rights, immunity rights, destabilization rights, and solidarity rights) that guarantee the individual's dignity, security, and right to participate fully in the economy and government of society and would be enforced by government departments charged with intervening to destabilize unjust accumulations of wealth and power.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=491-539}}

Unger completes the programmatic argument by describing a "cultural-revolutionary counterpart to the institutional program," arguing that such a cultural revolution is necessary since politics always comes down to the relations of individuals to each other.{{sfn|Unger|1987a|pp=556-570}} Finally, Unger describes the "spirit" of the constitution of empowered democracy as embodied in three principles: as a superstructure that has a structure-destroying effect; as a form of empowerment that allows us to loosen the bonds of our contexts over our activities and undermines any belief in a canonical list of forms of association between people; and as a kind of society that fulfills "the desire to do justice to the human heart, to free it from indignity and satisfy its hidden and insulted longing for greatness in a fashion it need not be fearful or ashamed of."{{sfn|Unger|1987a|p=584}}

==Volume 2: ''Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task''==

In ''Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task'', subtitled "A Critical Introduction to ''Politics''," Unger lays out the theoretical background of ''Politics'' with a critical assessment of the situation of social thought, specifically by examining and describing the history and failures of classical social theory which Unger seeks to remedy in ''Politics''. Unger describes the trajectory of social theory in the twentieth century as one in which the projects of liberalism and socialism went part of the way toward liberating people from false necessity, but he contends that "no one has ever taken the idea of society as artifact to the hilt."{{sfn|Unger|1987b|p=1}} Unger describes the situation in the late twentieth century, the time during which he was writing ''Politics'', as "a circumstance of theoretical exhaustion and political retrenchment," which he seeks to redefine as "a gathering of forces for a new and more powerful assault upon superstition and despotism."{{sfn|Unger|1987b|pp=2-3}}

The theoretical framework that Unger offers, as a substitute for classical social theory, is one that rejects naturalistic and historicist assumptions that view us as "helpless puppets of the social worlds we build and inhabit or of the lawlike forces that have supposedly brought these worlds into being."{{sfn|Unger|1987b|p=5}} Unger maintains that his programmatic arguments

&lt;blockquote&gt;reinterpret and generalize the liberal and leftist endeavor by freeing it from unjustifiably restrictive assumptions about the practical institutional forms that representative democracies, market economies, and the social control of economic accumulation can and should assume.{{sfn|Unger|1987b|p=6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unger notes that "''Politics'' sets out to execute a program for which no ready-made mode of discourse exists," and that thus it "raids many disciplines" and develops a "language for a vision" as it moves forward.{{sfn|Unger|1987b|p=9}}

In discussing the predicament of social theory and offering his corrections to its failings, Unger suggests that the difficulties of social theory can be traced to the difficulty of accounting for the context-breaking nature of human life.{{sfn|Unger|1987b|p=22|ps=: "All our major problems in the understanding of society arise from the same source. They have to do with the difficulty of accounting for the actions of a being who, individually and collectively, in thought and relationship, might break through the contexts within which he ordinarily moves."}} Unger contends that it is necessary to disengage social theory from a style of explanation that treats human thought and action as though they are bound by a describable structure or society as though it is governed by a set of lawlike evolution.{{sfn|Unger|1987b|pp=23-23}} Unger does not claim that his proposals constitute the only way to end the tyranny of false necessity. Rather, Unger says, he is offering one possible way, and that the project of reforming society is one that we must undertake step-by-step:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task'' merely suggests a route that ''Politics'' actually clears and follows. The modest beginning serves as a reminder that we do not need a developed social theory to begin criticizing and correcting liberal, leftist, and modernist ideas. Instead, our attempts to combine, step by step, revised ideals and changed understandings can themselves help build such a theory.{{sfn|Unger|1987b|p=13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

Unger offers several "points of departure" that, he contends, lead to the same point: the point at which we recognize the necessity of creating a social theory that accounts for human context-transcending ability and thus seeks a way to create social structures that enable their own revision.{{sfn|Unger|1987b|pp=9-10}} Of these available points of departure, Unger devotes the most attention to the situation of contemporary social thought: namely, the shortcomings of positivist social science (represented by mainstream economics) and the deep-structure social theory (represented by Marxism), each of which fail, in different ways, to account properly for the true nature of formative contexts and thus offer unsatisfactory solutions to the dilemmas of human life and social organization.{{sfn|Unger|1987b|pp=80-169}}

Reminding the reader that "[t]his book works toward a social theory that pushes to extremes the idea that everything in society is frozen or fluid politics,"{{sfn|Unger|1987b|p=172}} Unger explains the philosophical and scientific setting for his antinaturalistic, politicized social theory. He marshals examples from philosophy to support his argument, looking closely at the concepts of necessity and contingency to show that there is no aspect of our knowledge that is immune to empirical revision, and that we can always find "more to be true than we can yet prove, verify, or even make sense of."{{sfn|Unger|1987b|pp=172-185}} Unger also points to an embarrassment of historical explanation, namely the constraint that historical particularity imposes upon general explanations.{{sfn|Unger|1987b|pp=185-199}} This philosophical discussion supports Unger's argument against social theories that would hold that we are puppets of our circumstances or that our thoughts or actions are ever finally constrained by our contexts.

==Volume 3: ''Plasticity Into Power: Comparative-Historical Studies on the Institutional Conditions of Economic and Military Success''==

''Plasticity Into Power'' consists of three convergent essays that help to illustrate, through the marshaling of historical examples, the anti-necessitarian social theory that Unger advanced in ''False Necessity'' and ''Social Theory''. Unger explains that his approach in ''Plasticity Into Power'' "shows that we do not need to predefine possible trajectories of large-scale, discontinuous structural change in order to understand what happens in history ... It enlarges our sense of the real and the possible. It places explanatory ambition on the side of an acceptance of contingency and an openness to novelty."{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=1}}

In the first essay, "The Periodic Breakdown of Governments and Economies in Agrarian-Bureaucratic Societies: Its Causes, Antidotes, and Lessons," Unger examines the reversion crises experienced by agrarian-bureaucratic empires, in which periods of commercial vitality were followed by decommercialization, breakdown of government, and reversion to a non-monetary economy.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=3-8}} Unger contends that these reversion cycles resulted from a situation in which governments were unwilling to side decisively with the peasantry against the oligarchy. Unger discusses the solutions to reversion crises in Western Europe,{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=25-42}} Japan,{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=42-50}} China,{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=50-61}} and Russia,{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=61-67}} concluding that the Western European and Japanese paths out of the reversion cycle were highly successful, though achieved through a period of unchecked conflict in which the peasantry never met the combined force of the government and the oligarchy. Unlike the accidental trajectory of Europe and Japan's escape from reversion, China achieved escape from reversion through statecraft, by the adaptation of institutions, practices and attitudes of China's nomadic conquerors to meet the challenge of freeing central government from control or immobilization by landowning elites. Russia's path out of reversion was a deeply flawed one, achieved only in a way that robbed it of potential for economic revolution. From his analyses of these varied paths out of the reversion cycle, Unger concludes that societywide social hierarchies create steep hurdles to dealing with society's practical problems, and also create obstacles to social experiments that would lead to breakthroughs in a society's productive powers.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=94-96}}

In the second essay, "Wealth and Force: An Antinecessitarian Analysis of the Protection Problem," Unger looks at the problem nations face in turning their wealth into a military force:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There has never been a single, riskless method for turning the wealth of a country, a faction, or a family into military force. On the contrary, the efforts to secure wealth against violence (or the threat of violence), and to get violence for wealth and wealth for violence, present hard problems.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=113}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Unger looks at two prevailing approaches to the protection problem throughout history: the quasi-autarkic empire, in which most trade takes place within the boundaries of a territory ruled by a single government,{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=113}} and the overlord-peddler partnership, in which trade and production are carried out in territories that a number of authorities rule and tax.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=113-114}} Unger points to the flaws of each of these approaches to the protection problem, and contends that neither approach was successful in Europe, where a third approach was developed, one that capitalized on the mutual reinforcement of force and wealth.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=120-124, 139-141}} Increases in the productivity of labor and in the deadliness of weaponry gave European countries a decisive edge over others,{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=141}} and circumstances aligned so that society's elites were able to unify against the working classes below them.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=143-147}} Furthermore, the intense geopolitical rivalry among European states created an urgency for reforms that would help the state enlist force in support of wealth without crushing the productive sector of society under the costs of such defense.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=147}} Unger emphasizes that the successful European solutions were "inseparable from the accumulations of these circumstances—technological, social, and geopolitical. To aim beyond the imperial-autarkic or the overlord-enterprise schemes ... other societies would have had to formulate different responses, suited to their own conditions."{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=148}}

In the final essay, "Plasticity Into Power: Social Conditions of Military Success," Unger focuses on the social conditions that give rise to breakthroughs in military capacity.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=153}} Viewing "destruction as a mirror of production," Unger maintains that there is less theoretical prejudice in the field of military history than in the field of economics. He contends that the study of military history provides an illuminating perspective on themes of plasticity and institutional indeterminacy that he has explored throughout ''Politics''. His focus in this essay is on the institutions and conditions that have favored or disfavored advances in military capability. Unger looks at the examples of Mamluk armies in their 16th century war against the Ottomans, and the Norman crusaders who were defeated at the hands of the Seljuqs in the last years of the eleventh century A.D. For the Mamluks (who rejected the adoption of firearms) and the Normans (who were unwilling to change their operational style of warfare in the face of the superior mobility of the Seljuqs), failure to transform led to their doom.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=162-170}} Unger then considers examples from preindustrial European history{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=170-186}} and later Asian history{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=192-206}} to emphasize the importance of mastering "an art of institutional dismemberment and recombination," an art that helps societies negotiate the linkage, on the one hand, of practical capabilities with immediate organizational setting of those capabilities, and on the other hand, the link between a way of organizing work to a more comprehensive set of arrangements in government and the economy.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=206}} Unger concludes by suggesting that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The military examples suggest that the repeated practice of institutional dissociation and recombination is not a random walk. It has—or at least, it has often had—a direction. Practiced long and often enough, it moves societies toward greater plasticity.... [M]ovement toward this ideal has generally brought success to the individuals, groups, and countries that have achieved it.{{sfn|Unger|1987c|pp=206-207}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Unger concludes by acknowledging that there is a final ambiguity to be discerned in the relationship between the imperatives of plasticity and institutional sequence. Does plasticity converge toward particular ways of organizing work and the activities of production and destruction, or is there an indefinitely large ways of organizing them? "We do not know the answers to these questions," Unger writes, and goes on to say that "[w]e can turn [plasticity] into a foothold for our attempts to make our social contexts nourish our context-revising powers and respect our context-transcending vocation."{{sfn|Unger|1987c|p=212}}

===''Northwestern University Law Review Symposium on Unger's &lt;u&gt;Politics&lt;/u&gt;''===

''Politics'' was the subject of a 1987 symposium in the ''[[Northwestern University Law Review]]'',{{sfn|Perry|1987}} which was later published in book form as ''Critique and Construction: A Symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics''.{{sfn|Lovin|Perry|1990}}

[[Richard Rorty]] praised ''Politics'' highly, writing that Unger "does not give the last word to the time he lives in. He also lives in an imaginary, lightly sketched, future. This is the sort of world romantics ''should'' live in; their living there is the reason why they and their confused, utopian, unscientific, petty bourgeois followers can, occasionally, make the actual future better for the rest of us." {{sfn|Rorty|1988|p=35}} Rorty went on to say, "Unger's book offers a wild surmise, a set of concrete suggestions for risky social experiments, and a polemic against those who think the world has grown too old to be saved by such risk-taking." {{sfn|Rorty|1988|p=40}}

[[Jonathan Turley]], writing in the Northwestern ''Symposium'', praised ''Politics'', observing that "like the great majority of Unger's work, [it] penetrates its subject matter at the deepest level, analyzing the very language and foundation of social theory.... Unger's comprehensive theories and writings have implications for virtually all disciplines and professions."{{sfn|Turley|1987|p=593}}

Legal scholar Milner Ball described ''Politics'' as "a Theory of Everything. There is sweep and brilliance to ''Politics''. It is illuminating as well as affecting."{{sfn|Ball|1987|p=625}} However, Ball went on to express reservations about ''Politics'', contending that it &lt;blockquote&gt;undercuts the very response it seeks to elicit.... The writing grows remote and abstract, with everything done by the author in cold terms. Nothing is left for the reader but to observe and try to take it in.... Unger recruits us for a grand journey of the mind into hope and action, but as the theory lifts and spirals toward heaven, we are left behind to marvel and applaud at a distance, for this can only be a solo voyage.{{sfn|Ball|1987|p=625}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Galston|William A. Galston]] wrote of ''Politics'': "I have never before encountered prose crafted so relentlessly in the prophetic mode, so incessantly proferring universal truths." But Galston argued that a flaw in ''Politics'' is that "Unger implicitly claims for himself an exemption from contextuality: whatever may be true for others, his own prophetic powers have achieved the status of absolute understanding."{{sfn|Galston|1987|p=765}}

[[Cass Sunstein|Cass R. Sunstein]] conceded that Unger's proposals in ''Politics''

&lt;blockquote&gt;are designed to generate a more vigorous public life and overcome the entrenched quality of the existing distribution of power and the existing set of preferences. The basic approach, however, lacks clear foundations. "Context smashing" and "self-assertion" are not intrinsic goods; their desirability depends on a substantive conception distinguishing between contexts that promote autonomy, welfare, or virtue and those that do not. Moreover, Unger's system underestimates the dangers of putting everything "up for grabs," the risks of factionalism, the possibilities of deliberative democracy, and the facilitative functions of constitutionalism. A system in which fundamental issues are constantly open to "fighting" and "conflict" is likely to be undermined by powerful, well-organized private groups and by self-interested representatives.{{sfn|Sunstein|1987|p=882}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other reviews and considerations===

[[William E. Connolly]] offered a highly laudatory review in the ''[[New York Times]]'', writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Politics'' soars into the rarefied stratosphere of social theory, striving to realize the highest aspirations of modernity itself. Mr. Unger is thus best understood in relation to contemporaries who reach for similar heights, such as the European thinkers Hans Blumenberg, Jurgen Habermas and Michel Foucault.... [T]he unusual combination of theoretical acuity and detail in these volumes is a brilliant contribution to social thought. Each time Mr. Unger offers a new proposal, settled assumptions and priorities are questioned with new intensity. The rapid accumulation of such proposals exposes the finely spun threads binding the prosaic world of political reform to the rarefied heights of theoretical imagination. Finally, the relentless specification of a vision that most moderns share inchoately exposes precisely what people must do (and believe) to pursue freedom through mastery. This freedom may not be able to bear its own reflection after looking into the mirror Mr. Unger holds up to it.{{sfn|Connolly|1988|p=26}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A chapter of [[Perry Anderson]]'s book ''A Zone of Engagement'' was devoted to Unger's ''Politics''. The chapter was called "Roberto Unger and the Politics of Empowerment." Anderson wrote, "For sheer imaginative attack, Unger's program for social reconstruction has no contemporary counterpart. It certainly honors its promise to advance beyond—far beyond—the ambitions of social democracy."{{sfn|Anderson|1992|p=143}}

'''Roberto Mangabeira Unger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ŋ|g|ər}}; born 24 March 1947) is a philosopher and politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/73226246-48a7-11e4-9d04-00144feab7de.html#axzz3FNipfHzi|title=Lunch with the FT: Roberto Mangabeira Unger|last=Rathbone|first=John Paul|date=3 October 2014|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written notable works including [[Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory|''Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory'']] and [[The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time|''The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time'']]. He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, and political, and economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What next for the left?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2013/12/roberto-unger-social-democracy|newspaper=The Economist|date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s-1990s while at Harvard Law School as part of the [[Critical Legal Studies]] movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools and led to the writing of [[What Should Legal Analysis Become%3F]]&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Jeremy. "Dirty Little Secret", ''Columbia Law Review 98'', 1 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; His political activity helped the transition to [[History of Brazil|democracy in Brazil]] in the aftermath of the [[Brazilian military government|military regime]], and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015.&lt;ref name=Keliher&gt;{{cite news|last=Keliher|first=Macabe|title=A Vision and a Program for the American Left|url=http://www.possible-futures.org/2012/07/02/vision-program-american-left-conversation-roberto-mangabeira-unger-situation-task-remaking-democratic-party|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Perry, "Roberto Unger and the Politics of Empowerment", ''New Left Review'' 173 (February 1989).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2015/02/1584788-dilma-faz-primeira-troca-de-comando-ministerial-em-seu-segundo-governo.shtml|title=Dilma faz primeira troca de comando ministerial em seu segundo governo|last=Haubert|first=Mariana|date=3 February 2015|work=Folha de São Paulo|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His late work in economics culminates in his characterization and program toward The Knowledge Economy. His work is seen to offer a vision of humanity and a program to empower individuals and change institutions.&lt;ref name="Lee Smolin 2007"&gt;Smolin, Lee. "No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements", ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neu, Jerome.

At the core of his philosophy is a view of humanity as greater than the contexts in which it is placed. He sees each individual possessed with the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is the conviction that the world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural or necessary social, political, or economic arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, [[wage labor]]—for Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to what works for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation.&lt;ref name="Keliher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critique and construction: a symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics|last=Lovin|first=Robin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-35208-8|location=Cambridge|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Making the friendly world behave|last=Connolly|first=William|date=February 7, 1988|work=New York Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger has long been active in Brazilian opposition politics. He was one of the founding members of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] and drafted its manifesto.&lt;ref name=journalism&gt;Simon, William H. "Social Theory and Political Practice: Unger's Brazilian Journalism", ''Northwestern University Law Review 81'' (1986-87): p. 312.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the presidential campaigns of [[Leonel Brizola]] and [[Ciro Gomes]], ran for the Chamber of Deputies, and twice launched exploratory bids for the Brazilian presidency. He served as the Minister of Strategic Affairs in the second [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] administration and the beginning of the second Dilma administration. Unger is also the subject of the feature documentary Visions for the Future directed by [[Robert Rippberger]] chronicling his work in Brazil in the Amazonian state of [[Rondônia]] putting theory into practice.&lt;ref name="Visions for the Future"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rippberger|first=Robert|title=Visions for the Future|url=https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Visions_for_the_Future_Roberto_Mangabeira_Unger?id=La0B0YmULiI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family===
Unger's maternal grandfather was [[Otávio Mangabeira|Octávio Mangabeira]], who served as Brazil's minister of foreign affairs in the late 1920s before the dictatorship of [[Getúlio Vargas]] subjected him to a series of imprisonments and exiles in Europe and the United States. After returning to Brazil in 1945, he co-founded a center-left party. He was elected as a representative in the Câmara Federal in 1946, governor of Bahia in 1947, and Senator in 1958.&lt;ref name=bal&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Octavio Mangabeira|url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.academia.org.br/abl/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm%3Finfoid%3D343%26sid%3D243&amp;usg=ALkJrhjx0OP3AoQJXNm_3PqTMhHxqzJJYg|publisher=Brazilian Academy of Letters|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of Unger's parents were intellectuals. His [[Germans|German]]-born father, Artur Unger, from [[Dresden]], arrived in the United States as a child and later became a U.S. citizen. His mother, Edyla Mangabeira, was a Brazilian poet and journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edyla Mangabeira Unger profile|url=http://www.allaboutarts.com.br/default.aspx?PageCode=12&amp;PageGrid=Bio&amp;item=0804L4|work=AllAboutArts|publisher=allaboutarts.com.br|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artur and Edyla met in the US during the exile of Octávio Mangabeira.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romano|first=Carlin|title=Harvard Law's Roberto Unger takes on the future of Brazil|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=6 June 2008|volume=54|issue=39|page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
Roberto Mangabeira Unger was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1947, and spent his childhood on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]]. He attended the private [[Allen-Stevenson School]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; When he was eleven, his father died and his mother moved the family back to Brazil. He attended a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school and went on to law school at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt;

Unger was admitted to [[Harvard Law School]] in September 1969. After receiving his LLM, Unger stayed at Harvard another year on a fellowship, and then entered the doctoral program. At 23 years old, Unger began teaching jurisprudence, among other things, to first year students.&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt; In 1976, aged 29, he got SJD and became one of the youngest faculty members to receive [[tenure]] from the [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guggenheim Gives Fellowships for '76 Unger Gets Tenure, Too|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/4/5/guggenheim-gives-fellowships-for-76-pa|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=The Harvard Crimson|date=5 April 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career===
The beginning of Unger's academic career began with the books ''[[Knowledge and Politics]]'' and  ''[[Law In Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory|Law in Modern Society]]'', published in 1975 and 1976 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1975). ''Knowledge and Politics''. New York: Free Press.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1976). ''[[Law In Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory]].'' New York: Free Press.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These works led to the co-founding of [[Critical Legal Studies]] (CLS) with [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]] and [[Morton Horwitz]]. The movement stirred up controversy in legal schools across America as it challenged standard legal scholarship and made radical proposals for legal education. By the early 1980s, the CLS movement touched off a heated internal debate at Harvard, pitting the CLS scholars against the older, more traditional scholars.&lt;ref name="franca"&gt;{{cite web|last=Press|first=Eyal|title=The Passion of Roberto Unger|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9903/unger.html|publisher=Lingua Franca|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt;

Throughout much of the 1980s, Unger worked on his magnum opus, ''[[Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory]]'', a three volume work that assessed classical [[social theory]] and developed a political, social, and economic alternative. The series is based on the premise of society as an artifact, and rejects the necessity of certain institutional arrangements. Published in 1987, ''Politics'' was foremost a critique of contemporary social theory and politics; it developed a theory of structural and ideological change, and gave an alternative account of world history. By first attacking the idea that there is a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another, e.g. [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]], it then built an [[false necessity|anti-necessitarian theory of social change]], theorizing the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another.

Unger devoted much of the following decades to further elaborating on the insights developed in ''Politics'' by working out the political and social alternatives. ''[[What Should Legal Analysis Become?]]'' (Verso, 1996) developed tools to reimagine the organization of social life. ''[[Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative]]'' (Verso, 1998) and ''[[The Left Alternative|What Should the Left Propose?]]'' (Verso, 2005) put forth alternative institutional proposals.

Unger's model of philosophical practice is closest to those philosophers who sought to form a view of the whole of reality, and to do so by using and resisting the specialized knowledge of their time.&lt;ref name="Robin/Perry 1990"&gt;Robin W. Lovin and Michael J. Perry (eds.), ''Critique and Construction: A Symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been read as a form of pragmatism, but also as an attempt to disengage ideas and experiences that developed in the West under the influence of Christianity from the categories of [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements", ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His thought has been called the inverse of [[Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy, affirming the supreme value of life and the reality and depth of the self and eschewing fecklessness.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. "Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion", ''Harvard Law Review 98'', no. 5 (1 March 1985): pp. 1066–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social theory===
Unger's social theory is premised on the idea of classical social theory that society is an artifact and can be created and recreated.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Yack, "Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation," Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas previous thinkers such as Hegel or Marx backslid at some point and held onto the notion that there was a necessary institutional or historical social development, Unger, in the words of one critic, seeks to "take the idea to the hilt and produce a theory of emancipation that will escape the limitations of liberal and Marxist theories." That limitation is the search for an ideal structure of society that can be foreseen and centrally planned; whereas the emancipation leads to societies with greater institutional flexibility and variation.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Yack, "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation," Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Unger, society emerges not through compromise or the winnowing down of best options, but rather though conflict and struggle for control of political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the terms of social interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order Unger calls [[formative context]]. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come to believe and act as if their social words were coherent wholes that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They come to see the existing arrangements as necessary. Unger calls this [[false necessity]]. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition Unger calls [[negative capability]].&lt;ref name="Frank Blackler 1992"&gt;Frank Blackler, "Formative Contexts and Activity System: Postmodern Approaches to the Management of China," in Rethinking Organization: New Directions in Organization Theory and Analysis, ed. M. I. Reed and Michael Hughes (London ; Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1992), 273–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads Unger to the conclusion that change happens piecemeal through struggle and vision, rather than suddenly in revolutionary upheaval with the replacement of one set of institutional arrangements with another. Unger theorizes that cumulative change can alter formative contexts, and he goes on to propose a number of such changes as institutional alternatives to be implemented, which he calls [[Empowered democracy]].&lt;ref name="Frank Blackler 1992"/&gt;

Empowered democracy is Unger's vision of a more open and more plastic set of social institutions through which individuals and groups can interact, propose change, and effectively empower themselves to transform social, economic, and political structures. Unger's strategy in its realization is to combine freedom of commerce and governance at the local level with the ability of political parties at the central government level to promote radical social experiments that would bring about decisive change in social and political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Anderson, "Roberto Unger and the Politics of Empowerment," New Left Review 173 (February 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the theory would involve radical developments in politics at the center, as well as social innovation in localities. At the center, by bestowing wide ranging revising powers to those in office, it would give political parties the ability to try out concrete yet profound solutions and proposals. It would turn partisan conflicts over control and uses of governmental power into an opportunity to question and revise the basic arrangements of social life through a rapid resolution of political impasse. In local communities, empowered democracy would make capital and technology available through rotating capital funds, which would encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Citizens' rights include individual entitlements to economic and civic security, conditional and temporary group claims to portions of social capital, and destabilization rights, which would empower individuals or groups to disrupt organizations and practices marred by routines of subjugation that normal politics have failed to disrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Robin W. Lovin and Michael J. Perry, eds., Critique and Construction : A Symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger's ideas developed in a context where young intellectuals and radicals attempted to reconcile the conventional theories of society and law being taught in university classrooms with the reality of social protest and revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Disillusioned with Marxism, they turned to thinkers like Levi-Strauss, Gramsci, Habermas, and Foucault in attempt to situate understandings of law and society as a benign science of technocratic policy within a broader system of beliefs that legitimized the prevailing social order.&lt;ref name="Frank Blackler 1992"/&gt; Unlike Habermas, however, who formulates procedures for attaining rational consensus, Unger locates resolution in institutions and their arrangements that remain perpetually open to revision and reconstruction. And, unlike Foucault, who also emphasizes the constructed character of social life, Unger takes this as an opportunity to reimagine institutions and social conditions that will unleash human creativity and enable liberation.&lt;ref&gt;William Connolly, "Making the Friendly World Behave," The New York Times, February 7, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal thought===
Unger's work on law has sought to denaturalize the concept of law and how it is represented through particular institutions.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; He begins by inquiring into why modern societies have legal systems with distinctions between institutions, such as legislature and court, as well as a special caste of lawyers possessing a method of reasoning about social problems. Whereas thinkers such as [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Max Weber|Weber]] had argued that such legal arrangements were a product of economic necessity to secure [[property rights (economics)|property rights]] and the autonomy of the individual, Unger shows that this liberal legal order emerged in Europe as a result of the indeterminate relations between monarchy, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie. It took the particular form that it did by emerging out of the long tradition of [[natural law]] and universality, rather than of necessity.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Hugh|title=Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement|journal=Journal of Law and Society|year=1987|page=388|doi=10.2307/1410255|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This early work in historical analysis of law and legal thought laid the basis for Unger's contribution to the [[Critical Legal Studies|Critical Legal Studies movement]].&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; The movement itself was born in the late 1970s among young legal scholars at [[Harvard Law School]] who denounced the theoretical underpinnings of American jurisprudence, [[legal realism]]. The participants were committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality without the hidden interests and class domination of legal institutions. Two tendencies of the movement developed, one, a radical indeterminacy that criticized law as meaning anything we want it to mean, and the other, a neo-Marxist critique that attacked legal thought as an institutional form of capitalism. Unger offered a third tendency, a constructive vision of rethinking rights based on individual emancipation and empowerment, and structural arrangements that would lend themselves to constant revision with the goal of creating more educational and economic opportunities for more people. He laid this out in ''[[The Critical Legal Studies Movement (book)|The Critical Legal Studies Movement]]'', which quickly earned him a following as the philosophical mentor and prophet of the movement.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Allan C., and Patrick J.

===Economic thought===
At the center of Unger's thought about the economy is the commitment to reimagining and remaking the institutional arrangements of how humans produce and exchange. For Unger, economic institutions have no inherent or natural forms, and he rejects the necessitarian tendencies of classical and neo-classical economists, seeking instead alternatives to the arrangements of contemporary societies. In his writings, he has aimed to revise ideas on the importance of market economies and the division of labor in the workplace and national and global economies.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Moyn, "The Politics of Economy," Ethics &amp; International Affairs 16, no. 2 (2002): 135-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critique of economics====
Unger's critique of economics begins with the identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger's analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and as a means to escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, [[marginalism|marginalist economics]] arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.&lt;ref name="Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1987), ''Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task'', New York: Verso, pp. 120–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger's critique of Marginalism begins with [[Léon Walras|Walras']] equilibrium theory, which attempted to achieve a certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.&lt;ref name="Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task"/&gt;
 
The consequences of the marginalist movement were profound for the study of economics, Unger says. The most immediate problem is that under this generalizing tendency of economics, there is no means by which to incorporate [[empirical evidence]] and thus to re-imagine the world and develop new theories and new directions. In this way, the discipline is always self-referential and theoretical. Furthermore, the lack of a normative view of the world curtails the ability to propose anything more than a policy prescription, which by definition always assumes a given context. The discipline can only rationalize the world and support a status quo. Lastly, Unger finds that this turn in economics ended up universalizing debates in macroeconomics and leaving the discipline without any historical perspective. A consequence, for example, was that Keynes' solution to a particular historical crisis was turned into a general theory when it should only be understood as a response to a particular situation.&lt;ref name="Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task"/&gt;

====Reorientating economics====
Unger's vision of economics is that it cannot be unhinged from ideas about the individual and social life. Human activity and political organization must be incorporated into any analysis of trade and economies. In remaking the discipline, he calls for a return to the normative practice of classical economics but stripped of its necessitarian assumptions and typological references. The development of explanatory claims and prescriptive ideas are necessary. The discipline must connect the transformation of nature with that of society—the making of things with the reorganization of people.&lt;ref name="freetradereimagined"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), ''Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 2-8, 214-22.&lt;!-- ISSN or ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics]]'', he sets forth six ideas to begin thinking about economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), ''Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 77-94.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
#The problem of specialization and discovery. Competition comes to inhibit self transformation when trading partners are unequal but not radically unequal, for both are forced into cost cutting rather than innovating and increasing efficiency.
#The problem of politics over economics. The making and implementation of policy is not one of discovery, but rather of top down implementation. Rigid state control will limit how a society can respond to tensions and crisis, and thus politics creates its own presuppositions and limits creativity and alternative solutions.
#Free trade should strengthen the capacity for self transformation by organizing the trading regime in a way that strengthens the capacity of trading partners to experiment and innovate. It becomes question not of how much free trade, but what kind. The best arrangements are those that impose the least amount of restraint.
#Alternative free trade. The market has no necessary and natural form. If the market economy can be organized in a different way then so can a universal order of free trade among market economies.
#The division of labor remade. The [[Pin Factory#Adam Smith|pin factory organization of labor]] describes the organization of work as if labor were a machine. But we can make machines to do this work. We should then innovate in those areas where we don't yet know how to make the machine to do the work. Production should be one of collective learning and permanent innovation.
#Mind against context. The mind is both a machine and an anti-machine; it is both formulaic and totalizing. Thus we never rest in any context, and we need to have arrangements that constantly lend themselves to reinvention.

====Reconstructing economic institutions====
For Unger, the economy is not only a device for wealth but also permanent innovation and discovery. It should allow the greatest freedom of the recombination of people and resources, and allow people to innovate in institutional settings. The market economy should not be single dogmatic version of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. [http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/lectures.php#pe12 "Political economy after the crisis": lecture 3], harvard.edu, 8 February 2012.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger has presented a number of general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where the idea is to support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when it may be necessary to restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), ''Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, Chapter 5.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====On the twenty-first-century economic stimulus====
Most recently, in a YouTube video titled {{YouTube|QZPJ8hltDYA|"Beyond Stimulus"}} he laid out three key policies to address the current economy:
#Change the arrangements of finance in relation to production so that finance is in the service of production. Tax and regulate to discourage finance that does not contribute to production. Use public capital for venture capital funds.
#Broaden economic opportunity by supporting small and medium enterprise. Reject government regulation and state controlled models. Support cooperation between government and firms, and cooperation and competition among firms.
#Education. A system of schools to meet needs of a vibrant and flexible economy. Vocational schools that teach general concepts and flexibility, not job-specific skills.

===="Illusions of necessity in the economic order"====
Unger's first writing on economic theory was the article "Illusions of necessity in the economic order" in the May 1978 issue of ''[[American Economic Review]]''. In the article he makes a case for the need of contemporary economic thought to imitate classical political economy in which theories of exchange should be incorporated into theories of power and perception.&lt;ref name="Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. "Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order", ''American Economic Review'' (May 1978): pp. 369-73.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The article articulates the problem of the American economy as one of the inability to realize democracy of production and community in the workplace. This failure, according to Unger, is the result of the lack of a comprehensive program that encompasses production, society, and state, so that immediate attempts to address inequality get swallowed up and appropriated by the status quo in the course of winning immediate gains for the organization or constituency, e.g. unions.&lt;ref name="Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order"/&gt;

To realize a democracy in the workplace and the abolition of wealth and poverty, Unger argues for the need to relate the program of worker community and democracy with an enlargement of democracy at the national level—the goal cannot be only one of economic production and worker's rights, but must be accompanied by a national project at the structural level. He pushes this idea further by calling not just for a restructuring of the relationship between the firm and state based on private property, but that it also has to be replaced with a new set of rights encompassing access to jobs, markets, and capital. Only as private rights are phased out can rights of decentralized decision making and market exchange be extended to workers. This needs to be accompanied by limits on the size of enterprise and how profits are used to control others' labor.&lt;ref name="Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order"/&gt;

[[Neoclassical economics]] is not up to this task because it begins with preconceived standards that it applies to explain empirical data, while leaving out that which is a theoretical anomaly; there is no causal basis of analysis, Unger says, rather everything is embedded in a timeless universal without any account for context. Furthermore, the ambiguity of concepts of maximization, efficiency, and rationalization pin the analysis to a certain notion of the behavior of the rationalizing individual, making the analysis either tautological or reduced to a set of power relations translated into the language of material exchange.&lt;ref name="Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order"/&gt;

===Programmatic thought===
Key in Unger's thinking is the need to re-imagine social institutions before attempting to revise them. This calls for a program, or programmatic thought. In building this program, however, we must not entertain complete revolutionary overhaul, lest we be plagued by three false assumptions:
*''Typological fallacy'': the fallacy that there is closed list of institutional alternatives in history, such as "[[feudalism]]" or "[[capitalism]]". There is not a natural form of society, only the specific result of the piecemeal institutional changes, political movements, and cultural reforms (as well as the accidents and coincidences of history) that came before it.
*''Indivisibility fallacy'': most subscribers to revolutionary Leftism wrongly believe that institutional structures must stand and fall together. However, structures can be reformed piecemeal.
*''Determinism fallacy'': the fallacy that uncontrollable and little understood law-like forces drive the historical succession of institutional systems. However, there is no natural flow of history. We make ourselves and our world, and can do so in any way we choose.&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

To think about social transformation programmatically, one must first mark the direction one wants society to move in, and then identify the first steps with which we can move in that direction. In this way we can formulate proposals at points along the trajectory, be they relatively close to how things are now or relatively far away. This provides a third way between revolution and reform. It is revolutionary reform, where one has a revolutionary vision, but acts on that vision in a sequence of piecemeal reforms. As Unger puts it, transformative politics is "not about blueprints; it is about pathways. It is not architecture; it is music".&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

====The two Lefts====
Unger sees two main [[Leftist|Lefts]] in the world today, a recalcitrant Left and a humanizing Left. The recalcitrant Left seeks to slow down the march of markets and [[globalization]], and to return to a time of greater government involvement and stronger social programs. The humanizing Left (or '[[reformist Left]]') accepts the world in its present form, taking the market economy and globalization as unavoidable, and attempts to humanize their effects through [[Transfer payment|tax-and-transfer policies]].&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

Unger finds the two major orientations of contemporary [[Leftism]] inadequate and calls for a 'Reconstructive Left' – one which would insist on redirecting the course of globalization by reorganizing the market economy.&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto|title=The Left Alternative|year=2005|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-84467-370-4|pages=vii, ix, xi, xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his two books ''[[The Left Alternative]]'' and ''[[The Future of American Progressivism: An Initiative for Political and Economic Reform|The Future of American Progressivism]]'', Unger lays out a program to democratize the market economy and deepen democracy. This Reconstructive Left would look beyond debates on the appropriate size of government, and instead re-envision the relationship between government and firms in the market economy by experimenting with the coexistence of different regimes of private and social property.&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

It would be committed to social solidarity, but "would refuse to allow our moral interests in social cohesion [to] rest solely upon money transfers commanded by the state in the form of compensatory and retrospective redistribution", as is the case with federal entitlement programs. Instead, Unger's Reconstructive Left affirms "the principle that everyone should share, in some way and at some time, responsibility for taking care of other people."&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

====The ''Left Alternative'' program====
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2015}}
Unger has laid out concrete policy proposals in areas of economic development, education, civil society, and political democracy.&lt;ref&gt;These policy points are taken from Unger, ''[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]'' (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2007), and Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, {{YouTube|id=uN7PLK6H-KU&amp;list=UUbaZ_Vc_T7tm7iZSV-mMKMg&amp;index=3|title=What Progressives Should Propose}}. September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On ''economic development'', Unger has noted that there are only two models for a national economy available to us today: the US model of business control of government, and the northeast Asian model of top down bureaucratic control of the economy. Citing the need for greater imagination on the issue, he has offered a third model that is decentralized, pluralistic, participatory, and experimental. This would take the form of an economy encouraging small business development and innovation that would create large scale self-employment and cooperation. The emphasis is not on the protection of big business as the main sectors of the economy, but the highly mobile and innovative small firm.
* Unger links the development of such an economy to an ''education system'' that encourages creativity and empowers the mind, not one that he now sees geared for a reproduction of the family and to put the individual in service of the state. He proposes that such a system should be run locally but have standards enforced through national oversight, as well as a procedure in place to intervene in the case of the failing of local systems.
* Unger's critique of and alternative to social programs goes to the heart of ''civil society''. The problem we are faced with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.
* Unger's proposal for ''political democracy'' calls for a high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of the party in power to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.

===Theoretical philosophy===
At the core of Unger's [[theoretical philosophy]] are two key conceptions: first the infinity of the individual, and secondly the singularity of the world and the reality of time. The premise behind the infinity of the individual is that we exist within social contexts but we are more than the roles that these contexts may define for us—we can overcome them. In Unger's terms, we are both "context-bound and context-transcending; "we appear as "the embodied spirit;" as "the infinite imprisoned within the finite."&lt;ref name="David M. Trubek 1989"&gt;David M. Trubek, "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought," American Journal of Sociology 95, no. 2 (1989): 448.&lt;/ref&gt; For Unger, there is no natural state of the individual and his social being. Rather, we are infinite in spirit and unbound in what we can become. As such, no social institution or convention can contain us. While institutions do exist and shape our beings and our interactions, we can change both their structure and the extent to which they imprison us.&lt;ref name="David M. Trubek 1989"/&gt;

The philosophy of the singularity of the world and the reality of time establishes history as the site of decisive action through the propositions that there is only one real world, not multiple or simultaneous universes, and that time really exists in the world, not as a simulacrum through which we must experience the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lee Smolin, "No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements," Times Higher Education Supplement, August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two concepts of infinity and reality lie at the heart of Unger's program calling for metaphysical and institutional revolutions. From the concept of the self as infinite but constrained, Unger argues that we must continually transform our environment to better express ourselves. This can only be done in a singular world within which time is real.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====The self and human nature====
{{Main|Passion: An Essay on Personality}}
In ''Passion: An Essay on Personality'', Unger explores the individual and his relation to society from the perspective of the root human predicament of the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context. Unger's aim is to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking about the human and society.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Neu, "Looking All around for Our Real Selves," New York Times Book Review, July 8, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religion and the human condition====
Unger has written and spoken extensively on [[religion]] and the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="tanner 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The future of religion|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/philosophy.php#7|newspaper=Tanner Lectures|year=2009|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tanner 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The religion of the future|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/philosophy.php#7|newspaper=Tanner Lectures|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unger 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Beyond Nihilism |date=6 June 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDl4_fK3G58&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLNdEBvVYMvsDw5FdQ6N9GGEvIwjnNZuiC |website=YouTube |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion, Unger argues, is a vision of the world within which we anchor our orientation to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence.&lt;ref name="tanner 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nihilism 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDl4_fK3G58&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLNdEBvVYMvsDw5FdQ6N9GGEvIwjnNZuiC |title=Beyond Nihilism |date=6 June 2011 |at=part 1|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira |website=YouTube |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.&lt;ref name="tanner 2"/&gt;

Unger sees four flaws in the human condition. They are, our ''mortality'' and the facing of imminent death; our ''groundlessness'' in that we are unable to grasp the solution to the enigma of existence, see the beginning or end of time, nor put off the discovery of the meaning of life; our ''insatiability'' in that we always want more, and demand the infinite from the finite; and our ''susceptibility to belittlement'' which places us in a position to constantly confront petty routine forcing us to die many little deaths.&lt;ref name="tanner 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Beyond Nihilism |date=6 June 2011 |at=part 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA9SwXdj3fA&amp;list=PLNdEBvVYMvsDw5FdQ6N9GGEvIwjnNZuiC&amp;index=2 |website=YouTube |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major responses in the history of human thought to these flaws: escape, humanization, and confrontation.&lt;ref name="tanner 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Beyond Nihilism |date=6 June 2011 |at=parts 3-6 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUEiyHORu1s&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLNdEBvVYMvsDw5FdQ6N9GGEvIwjnNZuiC |website=YouTube |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The ''overcoming of the world'' denies the phenomenal world and its distinctions, including the individual. It proclaims a benevolence towards others and an indifference to suffering and change. One achieves serenity by becoming invulnerable to suffering and change. The religion of [[Buddhism]] and philosophical thought of [[Plato]] and [[Schopenhauer]] best represent this orientation.
* The ''humanization of the world'' creates meaning out of social interactions in a meaningless world by placing all emphasis on our reciprocal responsibility to one another. [[Confucianism]] and contemporary liberalism represent this strand of thought, both of which aim to soften the cruelties of the world.
* The ''struggle with the world'' is framed by the idea that series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine and give us a larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the moral of the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.

====The religion of the future====
The spiritual orientation of the struggle with the world has given rise to the secular movements of emancipation in the modern world, and it is here that Unger sees the religion of the future. The problem Unger sees, however, is that as an established religion, this orientation has betrayed its ideological underpinnings and has made peace with existing order. It has accepted the hierarchies of class structure in society, accepted the transfer of money as serving as the basis of solidarity, and reaffirmed the basis of existing political, economic, and social institutions by investing in a conservative position of their preservation. Thus, "to be faithful to what made this orientation persuasive and powerful in the first place, we must radicalize it against both established institutions and dominant beliefs."&lt;ref name="tanner 1"/&gt;

Unger's call is for a revolution in our religious beliefs that encompasses both individual transformation and institutional reorganization; to create change in the life of the individual as well as in the organization of society. The first part of the program of individual transformation means waking from the dazed state in which we live our lives, and recognizing our mortality and groundlessness without turning to the feel good theologies and philosophies. The second part of the program of social transformation means supplementing the metaphysical revolution with institutional practices by creating social institutions that allow us to constantly overthrow our constraints and our context, and to make this overthrow not a one time event but a continuing process. This is the program of [[empowered democracy]] that calls for reforms in the market economy, education, politics, and civil society. "The goal is not to humanize society but to divinize humanity." It is "to raise ordinary life to a higher level of intensity and capability."&lt;ref name="tanner 2"/&gt;

===Natural philosophy===
Unger's philosophy of [[space and time]] argues for the singularity of the world and the reality of time. His arguments are grounded in the tradition of [[natural philosophy]]. He takes on the Newtonian idea of the independent observer standing outside of time and space, addresses the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume]], rejects the position of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and attacks speculations about [[many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]] of contemporary [[cosmology]].&lt;ref name="cosmology"&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangbareira|title=Laws and Time in Cosmology|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/video.php#3|accessdate=30 November 2011|newspaper=Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The singularity of the world and the reality of time: an essay in natural philosophy|year=2012|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=Adam|title=Is the search for immutable laws of nature a wild-goose chase?|journal=Discover Magazine|date=10 April 2010|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2010/apr/10-is-search-for-immutable-laws-of-nature-wild-goose-chase/article_view?b_start:int=2&amp;-C=|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At stake is the laying of the foundations for a view of the world and causality that is open to all possibilities; that is not a closed system of options in which our future is governed by deterministic laws and typologies. It is an understanding of society that rejects the naturalness and necessity of current social arrangements; "a form of understanding of society and history that refuses to explain the present arrangements in a manner that vindicates their naturalness and necessity."&lt;ref name="cosmology"/&gt;

The thesis of the singularity of the world states that there is one real world. Such a thesis stands in stark contrast to contemporary [[theoretical physics]] and cosmology, which speculate about multiple universes out of the dilemma of how to have law like explanations if the universe is unique—laws will be universal because they don't just apply to this unique universe but to all universes. However, there is no empirical evidence for multiple worlds. Unger's singularity thesis can better address our empirical observations and set the conceptual platform to address the four main puzzles in cosmology today: [[big bang]], [[initial conditions]], [[horizon problem]], and the precise value of constants, such as [[gravity]], [[speed of light]], and [[Planck's constant]].&lt;ref name="cosmology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The singularity of the world"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The singularity of the world and the reality of time: an essay in natural philosophy|year=2012|pages=Chapters 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis that time is real states that time "really is real" and everything is subject to history. This move is to historicize everything, even the laws of nature, and to challenge our acting as if time were real but not too real—we act as if it is somewhat real otherwise there would be no causal relations, but not so real that laws change. Unger holds that time is so real that laws of nature are also subject to its force and they too must change. There are no eternal laws upon which change occurs, rather time precedes structure. This position gives the universe a history and makes time non-emergent, global, irreversible, and continuous.&lt;ref name="cosmology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The singularity of the world"/&gt;

Bringing these two thesis together, Unger theorizes that laws of nature develop together with the phenomenon they explain. Laws and initial conditions co-evolve, in the same that they do in how cells reproduce and mutate in different levels of complexity of organisms. In cosmological terms Unger explains the passing from one structure to another at the origins of the universe when the state of energy was high but not infinite, and the freedom of movement was greater than when operating under a known set of laws. The conditions of the early universe is compatible with the universe that preceded it. The new universe may be different in structure, but has been made with what existed in the old one, e.g. masses of elementary particles, strength of different forces, and cosmological constants. As the universe cools the phenomena and laws work together with materials produced by sequence; they are path dependent materials. They are also constrained by the family of resemblances of the effective laws against the background of the conceptions of alternative states the universe and succession of universes.&lt;ref name="The singularity of the world"/&gt;

====Mathematics and the one real, time-drenched world====
One consequence of these positions that Unger points to is the revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If there is only one world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, but it is not a part of the world.&lt;ref name="cosmology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The singularity of the world"/&gt;

==Political engagement==
[[File:Mangabeiraunger19062007.jpg|thumb|300px|Roberto Mangabeira Unger speaking in Brazil in 2007 as the Minister of Strategic Affairs]]
Unger has a long history of political activity in Brazil. He worked in early opposition parties in the 1970s/80s against the Brazilian military dictatorship, and drafted the founding manifesto for the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB) in 1980.&lt;ref name=journalism/&gt; He served as an intimate adviser to two presidential candidates, and launched exploratory bids himself in 2000 and 2006. He was the Secretary for Strategic Affairs in the Lula administration from 2007–09, and is currently working on a number of social and developmental projects in the state of [[Rondônia]].&lt;ref name=agora&gt;{{cite news|title=Mangabeira Unger lança Rondônia como modelo de desenvolvimento|url=http://www.rondoniagora.com/noticias/mangabeira-unger-lanca-rondonia-como-modelo-de-desenvolvimento-2011-06-14.htm|accessdate=27 April 2012|newspaper=Rondonia Agora|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driving Unger's political engagement is the idea that society can be made and remade. Unlike Mill or Marx, who posited a particular class as the agent of history, Unger does not see a single vehicle for transformative politics. He advocates world-wide revolution, but does not see this happening as a single cataclysmic event or undertaken by a class agent, like the Communist movement. Rather, he sees the possibility of piecemeal change, where institutions can be replaced one at a time, and permanent plasticity can be built into the institutional infrastructure.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"/&gt;

===Early political activity, 1970s and 1980s===
Unger's engagement in Brazilian politics began in the late 1970s as Brazil started to democratize. In 1979, he presented himself to the main opposition party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), and was appointed chief of staff by party leader Ulysses Guimaraes. His initial work was to develop the positions of the party and draft policy proposals for their party's congressional representatives.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;  When the military regime dissolved the two-party system and established a multi-party system later that year, Unger worked to unite progressive liberals and the independent, non-communist left into the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB). As a co-founder of the party, he authored its first manifesto.&lt;ref name="franca"/&gt; Unger left the party after the rise of a conservative faction, which was a part of the MDB but had been excluded from the initial formation of the PMDB.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"/&gt;

After departing the PMDB in the early 1980s, Unger began looking for political agents who would serve as vehicles for his national alternative. In 1981, he jointed the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party of Brazil]] (PDT) led by [[Leonel Brizola]], a former governor of Rio de Janeiro and a figure of the left prior to the dictatorship. Brizola had founded the PDT and Unger saw it as the authentic opposition to the military regime. Throughout the 1980s he worked with Brizola to travel the country recruiting members, and developing policy positions and a political language.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=A Alternativa Transformadora – Como Democratizar o Brasil|year=1990|publisher=Editora Guanabara|location=Rio de Janeiro|accessdate=13 December 2015|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Brizola, then serving his second of three terms as governor of Rio de Janeiro, appointed Unger to head the State Foundation for the Education of Minors (FEEM), a state-run foundation for homeless children. During his year-long tenure, he began a process of radical reforms of the institutions, such as opening the door to international adoption and reintegrating children with their families. He also set up community organizations in the slums to help support families in order to prevent the abandonment of children.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"/&gt;

===Political campaigns, 1990s and 2000s===
In 1990, Unger ran a symbolic campaign for a seat in the national chamber of deputies. He had no money, no structure, and only campaigned for eight weeks. He ran on a platform of reforming the slums, and went around the slum neighborhoods giving lectures. He received 9,000 votes, just 1,000 votes short of winning the seat. None of the votes came from the slums, however. All his votes had come from the middle class, although he had never campaigned in those neighborhoods or to that constituency. Recalling the experience, Unger says "it was kind of absurd... I had no money, no staff, and I would go into these slums, alone, to hand out pamphlets, often to the local drug pushers."&lt;ref name="franca"/&gt; It is an experience that Unger cites as leading to his belief that the system and possibilities were much more open than he had previously imagined.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"/&gt;

Unger served as Brizola's campaign organizer and primary political adviser in his bids for the Brazilian Presidency in 1989 and 1994. In 1989, Brizola finished in third place, losing the second position, which would have qualified him for a runoff against [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], by a very narrow margin to [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. Brizola and Unger both supported Lula in the second round of the election, but Collor would go on to beat Lula and win the Presidency.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Unger also helped organize the presidential bids of former finance minister and governor of [[Ceará]], [[Ciro Gomes]], in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, Gomes came in third place with 11% of the vote, and in 2002 he came in fourth place with 12% of the vote. Unger had written ''The Next Step: An Alternative to Neoliberalism'' with Gomes in 1996. At the national level in 2002, again in the second round of the election, Unger supported Lula who went on to defeat José Serra to win the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Carta Capital|pages=26–33|date=14 August 2002|title=Unger supports Lula|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the experience of supporting others who imploded politically, Unger discovered that, as he put it, he was committing "the classic mistake of the philosophers in politics, which is to try to find someone else to do the work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Revista Playboy|date=June 2008|title=Interview with Roberto Mangabeira Unger}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he ran in the primaries for the mayor of [[Sao Paulo]], but the PPS party leader suspended the primaries when it became clear that Unger would win the nomination and challenge party control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Por que sou candidato a Prefeito de São Paulo?|newspaper=Diário Popular|date=April 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched an exploratory bid for the 2006 presidential election on the PRB ticket, but the party decided not to put forth its own candidate for the presidency and to support Lula of the PT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Folha de S.Paulo|date=10 January 2005|page=A3|title=PRB supports Lula|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Minister of Strategic Affairs in the Lula administration===
[[File:Unger Lula.jpg|thumb|left|Minister Unger speaking to President Lula in 2007.]]
Unger found President Lula's first term to be conservative and riddled with scandal. He wrote articles calling Lula's administration "the most corrupt of Brazil's history" and called for his impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Ana Paula. [http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/noticias/2007/06/19/materia.2007-06-19.0528040429/view Mangabeira Unger assume secretaria e diz que Lula foi magnânimo ao convidá-lo para o cargo], ''[[Agência Brasil]]'', 19 June 2007; retrieved 8 September 2007. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the criticism, many advisers to Lula insisted that he should invite Unger to join his administration. In June 2007, after winning his second term, Lula appointed Unger as head of the newly established Long-term Planning Secretariat (a post which would eventually be called The Minister of Strategic Affairs).&lt;ref name="boss nova"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romana|first=Carlin|title=Boss Nova|journal=Chronicle of High Education: Chronicle Review|date=6 June 2008|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Boss-Nova/13595|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger's work in office was an attempt to enact his program. Seeing the future in small enterprises and advocating a rotating capital fund that would function like a government run venture capital fund, he pushed for a rapid expansion of credit to smaller producers and a decentralized network of technical support centers that would help broaden the middle class from below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrionuevo|first=Alexei|title='Minister of Ideas' Tries to Put Brazil's Future in Focus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/world/americas/02unger.html?_r=2&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 February 2008|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further called for political solutions that would broaden access to production forces such as information technology, and for states to focus on equipping and monitoring civil society rather than trying to provide social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Szabla|first=Chris|title=After rocky but influential tenure, Brazil's "Minister of Ideas" returns to HLS|url=http://www.hlrecord.org/news/after-rocky-but-influential-tenure-brazil-s-minister-of-ideas-returns-to-hls-1.626458|newspaper=Harvard Law Record|date=4 October 2009|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger's specific projects while in office were focused on giving "ordinary men and women the instruments with which to render this vitality fertile and productive." He aimed to use state powers and resources to allow the majority of poor workers to "follow the path of the emergent vanguard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Souza|first=Jesse|title=Os Batalhadores Brasileiros|year=2010|publisher=Editora da UFMG|location=Belo Horizonte|page=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a series of sectoral and regional initiatives that would prefigure the model of development based on the broadening of economic and educational opportunity by democratizing the market economy and restructuring civil society.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Unger medal.jpeg|thumb|right|Unger receiving a medal of honor on Army Day 2008 from President Lula for his work in formulating Brazil's National Defense Strategy.]]
Sectorally, Unger revamped the educational structure and rewrote labor laws. In education, he implemented a model of secondary education, where analytical problem-solving education was paired with technical education that focused on conceptual capabilities rather than job-specific skills. There are several hundred of these institutions today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haddad|first=Fernando|newspaper=Folha de S.Paulo|date=18 February 2008|author2=Roberto Mangabeira Unger|title=Unger implements model of secondary education|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further drafted legislation to associate national, state and local jurisdictions into common bodies that could intervene when a local school system fell below the minimum acceptable threshold of quality and "fix it the way an independent administrator would fix a failing business under Chapter 11 bankruptcy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Camarena|first=Rodrigo|title=The Rousseff Presidency and Beyond: Interview with Roberto Mangabeira Unger|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2011/01/18/the-rousseff-presidency-and-brazil%E2%80%99s-future-interview-with-roberto-mangabeira-unger|publisher=Foreign Policy Association|date=18 January 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In labor, Unger worked with unions to write new labor laws designed to protect and organize temporary workers, subcontractors, and those working in the informal economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Valor Econômico|date=29 April 2008|title=Unger helps write new labor laws|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regionally, some of Unger's most influential work was the implementation of a developmental strategy for [[Amazon River|the Amazon]] that would be sustainable environmentally by making it socially inclusive. He drafted and passed legislation to regularize small-scale squatters on untitled land by giving them clear legal titles, which would create self-interest in preservation while granting them economic opportunity. Included in this law were protections against large scale land grabbers. Such legislation aimed to empower locals living on Amazonian land by giving them ownership rights and linking their interest in preserving it, rather than pillaging it as quickly as possible in the face of ambiguous ownership rights. This legislation passed and was put into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leal|first=Claudio|title=Roberto Mangabeira Unger: "Amazônia é um caos fundiário"|url=http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI3143316-EI6578,00.html|accessdate=5 June 2012|date=29 August 2008|newspaper=Terra Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901224310/http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI3143316-EI6578,00.html|archivedate=1 September 2008|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Unger plane.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Unger touring the Amazon via small aircraft]]
Unger served in the administration for two years. On 26 June 2009, President Lula announced Unger would be leaving the government and returning to Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nery|first=Natusa|title=Mangabeira Unger deixa governo Lila e retoma Harvard|newspaper=Estado de São Paulo|date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later cited personal and political reasons for his early departure.&lt;ref&gt;Szabla, Chris.

===Engagement outside Brazil===
Unger's attempts to develop global social, political, and economic alternatives have led him in episodic engagements in national debates around the world.&lt;ref&gt;For example: see Unger and Zhiyuan Cui. 1994. "China in the Russian Mirror", ''New Left Review'' 208 (December 1994); Unger, 2009. ''The Left Alternative''. London: Verso, pp. 171-88; Unger, 2009. 	
"España y su futuro ¿un país en transformación?", ''Ediciones Sequitur''; accessed 13 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach in these engagements recognizes that the problems facing contemporary societies are not distinct from nation to nation, and that general structural arrangements can first be implemented, which will allow for local innovation, flexibility, and development in social, economic, and political arenas. There is no institutional blueprint for Unger, however, only a direction that can be pointed to and general proposals that can be implemented to allow further institutional innovation and experimentation. Unger's guiding principle is that institutional flexibility needs to be built into the implemented system, and in this way a diversity of local experiments would take hold the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The Left Alternatives in Particular Contexts|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/progressive.php#4|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Unger's more promising engagements was the ''Latin American Alternative'' in the late 1990s. Unger and Mexican politician and political scientist [[Jorge Castañeda Gutman]] assembled an informal network of politicians and business leaders dedicated to redrawing the political map. The aim of the group was to provide a critique of [[neoliberalism]] coupled with a way forward in a distinct strategy and institutional model of development. They floated proposals such as guaranteeing every citizen "social rights" (e.g. education and a job), breaking up media oligopolies, and holding town meetings to help citizens supervise municipal spending. The group held a number of meetings over the years, which included Brazilian finance minister [[Ciro Gomes]], Chilean senator [[Carlos Ominami]], Argentinian politicians [[Dante Caputo]] and [[Rodolfo Terragno]], and Mexican politician and future president [[Vicente Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Castaneda, Jorge. "Mexico: Permuting Power", ''New Left Review'' 7 (January–February 2001); accessed 13 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The meetings resulted in a document entitled the "Buenos Aires Consensus" in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061229130401/http://www.robertounger.com/alternative.htm "A Latin American Alternative" document signed at Buenos Aires in November 1997]; accessed 11 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; which Castaneda called "the end of neoliberalism; of the Washington Consensus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herrera|first=Ernesto|title=Consensus de Buenos Aires: Alternatives au néolibéralisme ou simple toilettage?|url=http://www.lagauche.com/gauche/lghebdo/1998/1998-05-05.html|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=La gauche|date=5 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Valente|first=Marcela|title=Centre-Left Seals Buenos Aires Consensus|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=66789|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=Inter Press Service|date=2 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This consensus was formally signed in 2003 by Argentinian President [[Néstor Kirchner]] and Brazilian President [[Lula da Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;Massaldi, Julian, [http://www.zcommunications.org/buenos-aires-consensus-by-julian-massaldi "Buenos Aires Consensus: Lula and Kirchner's agreement 'Against Neoliberalism'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927070907/http://www.zcommunications.org/buenos-aires-consensus-by-julian-massaldi |date=2012-09-27 }}, zcommunications.org, 20 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Latin American leaders who signed it included Fox, future president of Chile [[Ricardo Lagos]], Mexican politician [[Cuauhtemoc Cardenas]], former vice president of Nicaragua [[Sergio Ramirez]], future president of Argentina [[Fernando de la Rua]], and former Brazilian president [[Itamar Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sader|first=Emir|title=Latin America: critical year for the left|url=http://mondediplo.com/2003/02/12latinleft|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=Le Monde diplomatique|date=12 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2008 US presidential campaign, Unger was in frequent contact with candidate [[Barack Obama]] via email and Blackberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Remnick|first=David|title=The Bridge|year=2010|publisher=Picador|page=185|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since become critical of the Obama administration, and called for the defeat of Obama in the 2012 election as a first step to remaking the Democratic party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Beyond Obama|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnf4k8EaL7M&amp;feature=share|work=Beyond Series|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current engagement===
Unger's recent political work has focused on the north-western Brazilian state of [[Rondônia]]. He sees the human and natural resources of the state meeting all the conditions to serve as the vanguard of a new model of development for Brazil. Speaking to ''News Rondônia'' he said, "Rondônia is a state formed by a multitude of small and medium entrepreneurs together with the Brazilian government, and that is something truly unique in our country."&lt;ref name="newsrondonia1"&gt;{{cite news|title=DESENVOLVIMENTO: GOVERNO OUVE PROPOSTAS DO SETOR PRODUTIVO|url=http://newsrondonia.com/lerNoticias.php?news=15132|accessdate=27 April 2012|newspaper=News Rondonia|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been traveling the state giving public lectures and encouraging political discourse and engagement in localities.&lt;ref name="newsrondonia1"/&gt; Working with governor João Aparecido Cahulla on development projects,&lt;ref name=agora/&gt; Unger has outlined a series of important areas of focus. The first is to change the agricultural model from one of intensive farming to an industrialization of produces through the recuperation of degraded pastures, supply fertilizers and lime, and diversifying crops and livestock farming. The second key project is transforming education from rote learning to creative thinking and engagement. He helped open the School Teixeira in Porto Velho.&lt;ref name="newsrondonia1"/&gt; Another ongoing project is the construction of a new educational center in accordance with his theory of pedagogical reform, where delinquents would be reintegrated into municipal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mangabeira Unger visita complexo prisional de Porto Velho|url=http://www.olhovivorondonia.com.br/noticias.php?news=19776|accessdate=27 April 2012|newspaper=Olho Vivo Rondonia|date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RobertoUngerPortrait.jpg|thumb|150px|Image of Unger]] --&gt;
Unger's philosophical work grapples with some of the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=768–771|doi=10.2307/1288775}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law,&lt;ref name="Weirib 1985 1825–1841"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weirib|first=Ernest J.|title=Enduring Passion|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=June 1985|volume=94|issue=7|pages=1825–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said to have provided one answer to [[Hume's Guillotine]].&lt;ref name="Boyle 1985 1066-`083"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1066–83|doi=10.2307/1340886|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5799&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unger's analysis of liberalism and the philosophical program he builds around rethinking the individual has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism: A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791–816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the ''[[Northwestern University Law Review]]'' devoted an issue to Unger's work, analysing his three volume publication ''[[Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory]]''. Michael J. Perry, a professor of law at [[Northwestern University]], praises Unger for producing a vast work of social theory that combines law, history, politics, and philosophy within a single narrative.&lt;ref name="franca"/&gt;

Early reviewers of ''Politics'' questioned Unger's seeming predicament of criticizing a system of thought and its historical tradition without subjecting himself to the same critical gaze. "There is little acknowledgement that he himself is writing in a particular socio-historical context", wrote one reviewer,&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Allan C. "Review: A Poetic Champion Composes: Unger (Not) on Ecology and Women", ''The University of Toronto Law Journal'' 40, no. 2 (1 April 1990): p. 279.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and another asked, "in what context Unger himself is situated and why that context itself is not offered up to the sledgehammer."&lt;ref&gt;Wilder, Joseph C. "Review", ''The American Political Science Review'' 83, no. 2 (1 June 1989): p. 623.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Yack, Bernard. "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation", ''Harvard Law Review'' 101, no. 8 (1 June 1988)&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also balked at the lack of example or concrete vision of his social and political proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Yack, Bernard. "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation", ''Harvard Law Review'' 101, no. 8 (1 June 1988): 1969.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As one critic wrote, "it is difficult to imagine what Unger's argument would mean in practice", and that "he does not tell us what to make."&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ian. "Review: Constructing Politics", ''Political Theory'' 17, no. 3 (1989): pp. 481-82.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Others have suggested that the lack of imagination of such readers is precisely what is at stake.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Richard.

'''Scholarly approaches to mysticism''' include typologies of mysticism and the explanation of mystical states. Since the 19th century, mystical experience has evolved as a distinctive concept. It is closely related to "[[mysticism]]" but lays sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior, whereas mysticism encompasses a broad range of practices aiming at a transformation of the person, not just inducing mystical experiences.

There is a longstanding discussion on the nature of socalled "introvertive mysticism." [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialists]] regard this kind of mysticism to be universal. A popular variant of perennialism sees various mystical traditions as pointing to one universal transcendental reality, for which those experiences offer the proof. The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars"{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity".{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}} Instead, a constructionist approach became dominant during the 1970s, which states that mystical experiences are mediated by pre-existing frames of reference, while the attribution approach focuses on the (religious) meaning that is attributed to specific events.

Some [[Neuroscience of religion|neurological research]] has attempted to identify which areas in the brain are involved in so-called "mystical experience" and the [[temporal lobe]] is often claimed to play a significant role,&lt;ref name=Alper&gt;{{cite book | author=Matthew Alper |url=http://www.godpart.com/ | title=The "God" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zen1&gt;{{cite book | author=James H.

Ramachandran|Vilayanur Ramachandran]]'s 1998 book, ''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'',&lt;ref name=Phantoms&gt;{{Cite book | author=Ramachandran, V. | author2=Blakeslee | last-author-amp=yes | year=1998 | title=[[Phantoms in the Brain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these claims have not stood up to scrutiny.&lt;ref name=AaenStockdale&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aaen-Stockdale | first1 = Craig | year = 2012 | title = Neuroscience for the Soul | url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-7/neuroscience-soul | journal = The Psychologist | volume = 25 | issue = 7| pages = 520–523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mystical and contemplative traditions, mystical experiences are not a goal in themselves, but part of a larger path of self-transformation.

==Typologies of mysticism==
===R. C. Zaehner – natural and religious mysticism===
[[R. C. Zaehner]] distinguishes three fundamental types of mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The monistic type, which according to Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul,{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the work of [[C.G. Jung]].}} includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as [[Samhya]] and [[Advaita vedanta]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit into one of these two categories.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}

Zaehner considers theistic mysticism to be superior to the other two categories, because of its appreciation of God, but also because of its strong moral imperative.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Zaehner is directly opposing the views of [[Aldous Huxley]]. Natural mystical experiences are in Zaehner's view of less value because they do not lead as directly to the virtues of charity and compassion. Zaehner is generally critical of what he sees as narcissistic tendencies in nature mysticism.{{refn|group=note|See especially Zaehner, R. C., ''Mysticism Sacred and Profane'', Oxford University Press, Chapters 3,4, and 6.}}

Zaehner has been criticised by a number of scholars for the "theological violence"{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} which his approach does to non-theistic traditions, "forcing them into a framework which privileges Zaehner's own liberal Catholicism."{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}

=== Walter T. Stace – extrovertive and introvertive mysticism===
Zaehner has also been criticised by [[Walter Terence Stace]] in his book ''Mysticism and philosophy'' (1960) on similar grounds.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Stace argues that doctrinal differences between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Stace argues that mysticism is part of the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver’s background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.&lt;ref name="Mysticism and Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=Mysticism and Philosophy|date=1960|publisher=MacMillan|pages=44–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In “Mysticism and Philosophy”, one of Stace’s key questions is whether there are a set of common characteristics to all mystical experiences.&lt;ref name="Mysticism and Philosophy"/&gt;

Based on the study of religious texts, which he took as phenomenological descriptions of personal experiences, and excluding occult phenomena, visions, and voices, Stace distinguished two types of mystical experience, namely extrovertive and introvertive mysticism.{{sfn|Stace|1960|p=chap. 1}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} He describes extrovertive mysticism as an experience of unity within the world, whereas introvertive mysticism is "an experience of unity devoid of perceptual objects; it is literally an experience of 'no-thing-ness'".{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} The unity in extrovertive mysticism is with the totality of objects of perception. While perception stays continuous, “unity shines through the same world”; the unity in introvertive mysticism is with a pure consciousness, devoid of objects of perception,{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=292}} “pure unitary consciousness, wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn=0-451-60306-0|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Stace such experiences are nonsensical and nonintellectual, under a total “suppression of the whole empirical content.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn= 0-451-60306-0|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace finally argues that there is a set of seven common characteristics for each type of mystical experience, with many of them overlapping between the two types. Stace furthermore argues that extrovertive mystical experiences are on a lower level than introvertive mystical experiences.

Stace's categories of "introvertive mysticism" and "extrovertive mysticism" are derived from [[Rudolf Otto]]'s "mysticism of introspection" and "unifying vision".{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=292}}

William Wainwright distinguishes four different kinds of extrovert mystical experience, and two kinds of introvert mystical experience:&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"/&gt;
* Extrovert: experiencing the unity of nature; experiencing nature as a living presence; experiencing all nature-phenomena as part of an eternal now; the "unconstructed experience" of Buddhism. 
* Introvert: pure empty consciousness; the "mutual love" of theistic experiences.

Richard Jones, following William Wainwright, elaborated on the distinction, showing different types of experiences in each category:
# ''Extrovertive experiences'': the sense of connectedness (“unity”) of oneself with nature, with a loss of a sense of boundaries within nature; the luminous glow to nature of “nature mysticism”; the presence of God immanent in nature outside of time shining through nature of “cosmic consciousness”; the lack of separate, self-existing entities of mindfulness states.
# ''Introvertive experiences'': theistic experiences of connectedness or identity with God in mutual love; nonpersonal differentiated experiences; the depth-mystical experience empty of all differentiable content.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=26-27}}

Following Stace's lead, [[Ralph W. Hood|Ralp Hood]] developed the "Mysticism scale."{{sfn|Hood|1974}} According to Hood, the introvertive mystical experience may be a common core to mysticism independent of both culture and person, forming the basis of a "perennial psychology".{{sfn|Hood|2003|pp=321–323}} According to Hood, "the perennialist view has strong empirical support," since his scale yielded positive results across various cultures,{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=324, 325}}{{refn|group=note|Hood: "...it seems fair to conclude that the perennialist view has strong empirical support, insofar as regardless of the language used in the M Scale, the basic structure of the experience remains constant across diverse samples and cultures. This is a way of stating the perennialist thesis in measurable terms.{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=325}}}} stating that mystical experience as operationalized from Stace's criteria is identical across various samples.{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=324}}{{refn|group=note|Hood: "[E]mpirically, there is strong support to claim that as operationalized from Stace's criteria, mystical experience is identical as measured across diverse samples, whether expressed in "neutral language" or with either "God" or "Christ" references.{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=324}}}}

Although Stace's work on mysticism received a positive response, it has also been strongly criticised in the 1970s and 1980s, for its lack of methodological rigueur and its perennialist pre-assumptions.{{sfn|Moore|1973|p=148-150}}{{sfn|Masson|Masson|1976}}{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=22-32}}{{sfn|Belzen|2010|p=97}}&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/ Jerome Gellman, ''Mysticism'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Major criticisms came from [[Steven T. Katz]] in his influential series of publications on mysticism and philosophy,{{refn|group=note|* Mysticism and Philosophical Analysis (Oxford University Press, 1978)&lt;br&gt;* Mysticism and Religious Traditions (Oxford University Press, 1983)&lt;br&gt;* Mysticism and Language (Oxford University Press, 1992)&lt;br&gt;* Mysticism and Sacred Scripture (Oxford University Press, 2000)}} and from [[Wayne Proudfoot]] in his ''Religious experience'' (1985).{{sfn|Hood|2001|p=32}}

Masson and Masson criticised Stace for using a "buried premise," namely that mysticism can provide valid knowledge of the world, equal to science and logic.{{sfn|Masson|Masson|1976|p=109}} A similar criticism has been voiced by Jacob van Belzen toward Hood, noting that Hood validated the existence of a common core in mystical experiences, but based on a test which presupposes the existence of such a common core, noting that "the instrument used to verify Stace's conceptualization of Stace is  not independent of Stace, but based on him."{{sfn|Belzen|2010|p=97}} Belzen also notes that religion does not stand on its own, but is embedded in a cultural context, which should be taken into account.{{sfn|Belzen|2010|p=50}} To this criticism Hood et al. answer that universalistic tendencies in religious research "are rooted first in inductive generalizations from cross-cultural consideration of either faith or mysticism,"{{sfn|Hood|Streib|Keller|Klein|2015|p=467}} stating that Stace sought out texts which he recognized as an expression of mystical expression, from which he created his universal core. Hood therefor concludes that Belzen "is incorrect when he claims that items were presupposed."{{sfn|Hood|Streib|Keller|Klein|2015|p=467}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf has criticised the idea that religious texts describe individual religious experience. According to Sharf, their authors go to great lengths to ''avoid'' personal experience, which would be seen as invalidating the presumed authority of the historical tradition.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}}}

==Mystical experience==
{{See also|Religious experience|Western esotericism|Spirituality|New Age|Nondualism}}

The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A "religious experience" is a [[subjective experience]] which is interpreted within a religious framework.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} The concept originated in the 19th century, as a defense against the growing rationalism of western society.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}} A broad range of western and eastern movements have incorporated and influenced the emergence of the modern notion of "mystical experience", such as the [[Perennial philosophy]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Universalism]], the [[Theosophical Society]], [[New Thought]], [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Buddhist modernism]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{sfn|King|2001}}

===William James===
[[William James]] popularized the use of the term "religious experience" in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} James wrote:
{{quote|In mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness. This is the everlasting and triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by differences of clime or creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism, in Christian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so that there is about mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think, and which bring it about that the mystical classics have, as been said, neither birthday nor native land.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}}}}

This book is the classic study on religious or mystical experience, which influenced deeply both the academic and popular understanding of "religious experience".{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford" /&gt; James popularized the use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his ''Varieties'',{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford" /&gt; and influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge of the transcendental:{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford" /&gt;
{{quote|Under the influence of William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience, heavily centered on people's conversion experiences, most philosophers' interest in mysticism has been in distinctive, allegedly knowledge-granting "mystical experiences.""&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford" /&gt;}}

James emphasized the personal experience of individuals, and describes a broad variety of such experiences in ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} He considered the "personal religion"{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism",{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}}{{refn|group=note|James: "Churches, when once established, live at secondhand upon tradition; but the ''founders'' of every church owed their power originally to the fact of their direct personal communion with the divine. not only the superhuman founders, the Christ, the Buddha, Mahomet, but all the originators of Christian sects have been in this case; – so personal religion should still seem the primordial thing, even to those who continue to esteem it incomplete."{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}}}} and defines religion as
{{quote|...the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine.{{sfn|James|1982|p=31}}}}

According to James, mystical experiences have four defining qualities:{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=13}}
# [[Ineffability]]. According to James the mystical experience "defies expression, that no adequate report of its content can be given in words".{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=13}}
# Noetic quality. Mystics stress that their experiences give them "insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=13}} James referred to this as the "noetic" (or intellectual) "quality" of the mystical.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=13}}
# Transiency. James notes that most mystical experiences have a short occurrence, but their effect persists.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=13}}
# Passivity. According to James, mystics come to their [[peak experience]] not as active seekers, but as passive recipients.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=13}}

James recognised the broad variety of mystical schools and conflicting doctrines both within and between religions.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} Nevertheless, 
{{quote|...he shared with thinkers of his era the conviction that beneath the variety could be carved out a certain mystical unanimity, that mystics shared certain common perceptions of the divine, however different their religion or historical epoch,{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}}}}

According to Harmless, "for James there was nothing inherently theological in or about mystical experience",{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=15}} and felt it legitimate to separate the mystic's experience from theological claims.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=15}} Harmless notes that James "denies the most central fact of religion",{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=16}} namely that religion is practiced by people in groups, and often in public.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=16}} He also ignores ritual, the historicity of religious traditions,{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=16}} and theology, instead emphasizing "feeling" as central to religion.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=16}}

===Inducement of mystical experience===
Dan Merkur makes a distinction between [[Trance|trance states]] and [[Daydream|reverie states]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/400861/mysticism Dan Merkur, ''Mysticism'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Merkur, in trance states the normal functions of consciousness are temporarily inhibited, and trance experiences are not filtered by ordinary judgements, and seem to be real and true.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; In reverie states, [[numinous|numinous experiences]] are also not inhibited by the normal functions of consciousness, but visions and insights are still perceived as being in need of interpretation, while trance states may lead to a denial of physical reality.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;

Most mystical traditions warn against an attachment to mystical experiences, and offer a "protective and hermeneutic framework" to accommodate these experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} These same traditions offer the means to induce mystical experiences,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} which may have several origins:
* Spontaneous; either apparently without any cause, or by persistent existential concerns, or by neurophysiological origins;
* Religious practices, such as [[contemplation]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]]-repetition;
* [[Entheogen]]s (drugs)
* Neurophysiological origins, such as temporal lobe epilepsy.

===Influence===
The concept of "mystical experience" has influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge of a transcendental reality, cosmic unity, or ultimate truths.&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford /&gt;{{refn|group=note|McClenon: "The doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths. Although it is difficult to differentiate which forms of experience allow such understandings, mental episodes supporting belief in "other kinds of reality" are often labeled mystical [...] Mysticism tends to refer to experiences supporting belief in a cosmic unity rather than the advocation of a particular religious ideology."&lt;ref group=web name="Hartford"&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Mysticism.htm James McClenon, ''Mysticism'', Encyclopedia of Religion and Society]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Scholars, like Stace and Forman, have tended to exclude visions, near death experiences and parapsychological phenomena from such "special mental states," and focus on sudden experiences of oneness, though neurologically they all seem to be related.

===Criticism of the concept of "mystical experience"===
The notion of "experience", however, has been criticized in religious studies today.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}} {{sfn|Mohr|2000|pp=282–286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{refn|group=note|Roberarf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west ii[...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=1}}}} The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "non-duality" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|pp=80–82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception",{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}} would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}

Constructivists such as Steven Katz reject any typology of experiences since each mystical experience is deemed unique.{{sfn|JKatz|1978|p=56}}

Other critics point out that the stress on "experience" is accompanied with favoring the atomic individual, instead of the shared life of the community. It also fails to distinguish between episodic experience, and mysticism as a process, that is embedded in a total religious matrix of liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals and practices.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}

Richard King also points to disjunction between "mystical experience" and social justice:{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}
{{quote|The privatisation of mysticism – that is, the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences – serves to exclude it from political issues as social justice. Mysticism thus becomes seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than seeking to transform the world, serve to accommodate the individual to the status quo through the alleviation of anxiety and stress.{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}}}

==Perennialism, constructionism and contextualism==
{{Main|Perennial philosophy}}

Scholarly research on mystical experiences in the 19th and 20th century was dominated by a discourse on "mystical experience," laying sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior. Perennialists regard those various experiences traditions as pointing to one universal transcendental reality, for which those experiences offer the prove.{{sfn|King|2002}} In this approach, mystical experiences are privatised, separated from the context in which they emerge.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} William James, in his ''The Varieties of Religious Experience'', was highly influential in further popularising this perennial approach and the notion of personal experience as a validation of religious truths.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}

The essentialist model argues that mystical experience is independent of the sociocultural, historical and religious context in which it occurs, and regards all mystical experience in its essence to be the same.{{sfn|Katz|2000|p=3}} According to this "common core-thesis",{{sfn|Hood|2003|pp=321–325}} different descriptions can mask quite similar if not identical experiences:{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=321}}
{{quote|[P]eople can differentiate experience from interpretation, such that different interpretations may be applied to otherwise identical experiences".{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}}}}

Principal representants of the perennialist position were William James, [[Walter Terence Stace]],{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=29, note 1}} who distinguishes extroverted and introverted mysticism, in response to [[R.

Since the 1960s, [[social constructionism]]{{sfn|Katz|2000|p=3}} argued that mystical experiences are "a family of similar experiences that includes many different kinds, as represented by the many kinds of religious and secular mystical reports".{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}} The constructionist states that mystical experiences are fully constructed by the ideas, symbols and practices that mystics are familiair with.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356-6357}} shaped by the concepts "which the mystic brings to, and which shape, his experience".{{sfn|Katz|2000|p=3}} What is being experienced is being determined by the expectations and the conceptual background of the mystic.{{sfn|Katz|2000|pp=3–4}} Critics of the "common-core thesis" argue that 
{{quote|[N]o unmediated experience is possible, and that in the extreme, language is not simply used to interpret experience but in fact constitutes experience.{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}}}} The principal representant of the constructionist position is [[Steven T. Katz]], who, in a series of publications,{{refn|group=note|

* ''Mysticism and Sacred Scripture'' (Oxford University Press, 2000)}} has made a highly influential and compelling case for the constructionist approach.{{sfn|Forman|1997|pp=9–13}}

The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity".{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}} The contextual approach has become the common approach,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} and takes into account the historical and cultural context of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}}

===Steven Katz – constructionism===
After Walter Stace's seminal book in 1960, the general philosophy of mysticism received little attention.{{refn|group=note|Two notable exceptions are collections of essays by Wainwright 1981 and Jones 1983.}} But in the 1970s the issue of a universal "perennialism" versus each mystical experience being was reignited by Steven Katz. In an often-cited quote he states:
{{quote|''There are NO pure (i.e. unmediated) experiences''. Neither mystical experience nor more ordinary forms of experience give any indication, or any ground for believing, that they are unmediated [...] The notion of unmediated experience seems, if not self-contradictory, at best empty. This epistemological fact seems to me to be true, because of the sort of beings we are, even with regard to the experiences of those ultimate objects of concern with which mystics have had intercourse, e.g., God, Being, Nirvana, etc.{{sfn|Forman|1997|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Original in Katz (1978), ''Mysticism and Philosophical Analysis'', Oxford University Press}}}}

According to [[Steven T. Katz|Katz]] (1978), Stace typology is "too reductive and inflexible," reducing the complexities and varieties of mystical experience into "improper categories."{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=25}} According to Katz, Stace does  not notice the difference between experience and interpretation, but fails to notice the epistemological issues involved in recognizing such experiences as "mystical,"{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=28}} and the even more fundamental issue of which conceptual framework precedes and shapes these experiences.{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=30}} Katz further notes that Stace supposes that similarities in descriptive language also implies a similarity in experience, an assumption which Katz rejects.{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=46-47}} According to Katz, close examination of the descriptions and their contexts reveals that those experiences are not identical.{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=53-54}} Katz further notes that Stace held one specific mystical tradition to be superior and normative,{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=65}} whereas Katz rejects reductionist notions and leaves God as God, and Nirvana as Nirvana.{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=66}}

According to Paden, Katz rejects the discrimination between experiences and their interpretations.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Katz argues that it is not the description, but the experience itself which is conditioned by the cultural and religious background of the mystic.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} According to Katz, it is not possible to have pure or unmediated experience.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=29}}

Yet, according to Laibelman, Katz did not say that the experience can't be unmediated; he said that the conceptual understanding of the experience can't be unmediated, and is based on culturally mediated preconceptions.{{sfn|Laibelman|2007|p=207}} According to Laibelman, misunderstanding Katz's argument has led some to defend the authenticity of "pure consciousness events," while this is not the issue.{{sfn|Laibelman|2007|p=209}} Laibelman further notes that a mystic's interpretation is not necessarily more true or correct than the interpretation of an uninvolved observer.{{sfn|Laibelman|2007|p=211}}

===Robert Forman – pure consciousness event===
[[Robert K. C. Forman|Robert Forman]] has criticised Katz' approach, arguing that lay-people who describe mystical experiences often notice that this experience involves a totally new form of awareness, which can't be described in their existing frame of reference.{{sfn|Forman|1991}}{{sfn|Forman|1999}} Newberg argued that there is neurological evidence for the existence of a "pure consciousness event" empty of any constructionist structuring.{{sfn|Newberg|2008}}

===Richard Jones – constructivism, anticonstructivism, and perennialism===
Richard H. Jones believes that the dispute between "constructionism" and "perennialism" is ill-formed. He draws a distinction between "anticonstructivism" and "perennialism": constructivism can rejected with respect to a certain class of mystical experiences without ascribing to a perennialist philosophy on the relation of mystical doctrines.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 2}} Constructivism versus anticonstructivism is a matter of the nature of ''mystical experiences'' themselves while perennialism is a matter of ''mystical traditions and the doctrines they espouse''. One can reject constructivism about the nature of mystical experiences without claiming that all mystical experiences reveal a cross-cultural "perennial truth". Anticonstructivists can advocate contextualism as much as constructivists do, while perennialists reject the need to study mystical experiences in the context of a mystic's culture since all mystics state the same universal truth.

===Contextualism and attribution theory===
{{Main article|Attribution (psychology)}}

The theoretical study of mystical experience has shifted from an experiential, privatised and perennialist approach to a contextual and empirical approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, takes into account the historical and cultural context.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}}&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford" /&gt; Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.

Wayne Proudfoot proposes an approach that also negates any alleged cognitive content of mystical experiences: mystics unconsciously merely attribute a doctrinal content to ordinary experiences. That is, mystics project cognitive content onto otherwise ordinary experiences having a strong emotional impact.{{sfn|Proudfoot|1985}} Objections have been raised concerning Proudfoot’s use of the psychological data.{{sfn|Barnard|1992}}{{sfn|Spilka|McIntosh |1995}} This approach, however, has been further elaborated by [[Ann Taves]].{{sfn|Taves|2009}} She incorporates both neurological and cultural approaches in the study of mystical experience.

Many religious and mystical traditions see religious experiences (particularly that knowledge that comes with them) as [[revelation]]s caused by divine agency rather than ordinary natural processes. They are considered real encounters with [[God]] or gods, or real contact with higher-order realities of which humans are not ordinarily aware.&lt;ref group=web&gt;''The Argument from Religious Experience]] [http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/?page_id=41]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological research==
{{Cerebrum labelled map|caption=Lobes of the human brain (temporal lobe is shown in green)|1=Brain lobes}}

{{See also|Neuroscience of religion}}

The scientific study of mysticism today focuses on two topics: identifying the neurological bases and triggers of mystical experiences, and demonstrating the purported benefits of meditation.{{sfn|Beauregard|2007}} Correlates between mystical experiences and neurological activity have been established, pointing to the temporal lobe as the main locus for these experiences, while Andrew B. Newberg and Eugene G. d'Aquili have also pointed to the parietal lobe.

===Temporal lobe===
{{Main article|Temporal lobe}}
{{See also|Temporal lobe epilepsy}}
{{See also|List of people with epilepsy#Religious figures|l1=People with epilepsy}}

The temporal lobe generates the feeling of "I", and gives a feeling of familiarity or strangeness to the perceptions of the senses.&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; It seems to be involved in mystical experiences,&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 14 November 2015 | url = http://www.slideshare.net/dominic54/artikel-5593315 | title = The Neurophysiology of the Brain: Its Relationship to Altered States of Consciousness (With emphasis on the Mystical Experience) | author = Peter Fenwick | year = 1980 | publisher = Wrekin Trust | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160214151842/http://www.slideshare.net/dominic54/artikel-5593315 | archivedate = 14 February 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Picard|2013}} and in the change in personality that may result from such experiences.&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; There is a long-standing notion that epilepsy and religion are linked,{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}} and some religious figures may have had [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE). Raymond Bucke's [[Cosmic Consciousness]] (1901) contains several case-studies of persons who have realized "cosmic consciousness";&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; several of these cases are also being mentioned in J.E. Bryant's 1953 book, ''Genius and Epilepsy'', which has a list of more than 20 people that combines the great and the mystical.{{sfn|Bryant|1953}} [[James H. Leuba|James Leuba]]'s ''The psychology of religious mysticism'' noted that "among the dread diseases that afflict humanity there is only one that interests us quite particularly; that disease is epilepsy."{{sfn|Leuba|1925}}{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}}

Slater and Beard renewed the interest in TLE and religious experience in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=AaenStockdale/&gt; Dewhurst and Beard (1970) described six cases of TLE-patients who underwent sudden religious conversions. They placed these cases in the context of several western saints with a sudden conversion, who were or may have been epileptic. Dewhurst and Beard described several aspects of conversion experiences, and did not favor one specific mechanism.{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}}

[[Norman Geschwind]] described behavioral changes related to temporal lobe epilepsy in the 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Drvinsky|Schachter|2009}} Geschwind described cases which included extreme religiosity, now called ''[[Geschwind syndrome]]'',{{sfn|Drvinsky|Schachter|2009}} and aspects of the syndrome have been identified in some religious figures, in particular extreme religiosity and [[hypergraphia]] (excessive writing).{{sfn|Drvinsky|Schachter|2009}} Geschwind introduced this "interictal personality disorder" to neurology, describing a cluster of specific personality characteristics which he found characteristic of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Critics note that these characteristics can be the result of any illness, and are not sufficiently descriptive for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref group=web name="Barr2003"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate =23 August 2009 | url =http://www.epilepsy.com/articles/ar_1064250059 | title =Is there an epileptic personality? | author =William Barr | date =22 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuropsychiatrist [[Peter Fenwick (neuropsychologist)|Peter Fenwick]], in the 1980s and 1990s, also found a relationship between the right temporal lobe and mystical experience, but also found that pathology or brain damage is only one of many possible causal mechanisms for these experiences. He questioned the earlier accounts of religious figures with temporal lobe epilepsy, noticing that "very few true examples of the ecstatic aura and the temporal lobe seizure had been reported in the world scientific literature prior to 1980". According to Fenwick, "It is likely that the earlier accounts of temporal lobe epilepsy and temporal lobe pathology and the relation to mystic and religious states owes more to the enthusiasm of their authors than to a true scientific understanding of the nature of temporal lobe functioning."&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick2006"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate =15 August 2006 | url =http://www.start.gr/user/symposia/fen4.htm | title =Untitled | author =Peter Fenwick | date =7 January 1994 | publisher =4th International Science Symposium on Science and Consciousness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of intense religious feelings in epileptic patients in general is rare,&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; with an incident rate of ca. 2-3%. Sudden religious conversion, together with visions, has been documented in only a small number of individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy.{{sfn|Dewhurst|Beard|1970}} The occurrence of religious experiences in TLE-patients may as well be explained by [[Attribution (psychology)|religious attribution]], due to the background of these patients.&lt;ref name=AaenStockdale/&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Neuroscience of religion]] is a growing field of research, searching for specific neurological explanations of mystical experiences. Those rare epileptic patients with ecstatic seizures may provide clues for the neurological mechanisms involved in mystical experiences, such as the [[Insular cortex|anterior insular cortex]], which is involved in self-awareness and subjective certainty.{{sfn|Picard|2013}}{{sfn|Picard|Kurth|2014}}{{sfn|Gschwind|Picard|2014}}{{sfn|Gschwind|Picard|2016}}

===Anterior insula===
[[File:Sobo 1909 633.png|thumb|The insula of the right side, exposed by&lt;br/&gt;removing the [[Operculum (brain)|opercula]].]]

A common quality in mystical experiences is [[ineffability]], a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words. This ineffability has been threatened with scepticism. According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] the inner experience of mysticism is philosophically unconvincing.{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1844|p=Vol. II, Ch. XLVIII}}{{refn|group=note|Schopenhauer: "In the widest sense, mysticism is every guidance to the immediate awareness of what is not reached by either perception or conception, or generally by any knowledge. The mystic is opposed to the philosopher by the fact that he begins from within, whereas the philosopher begins from without. The mystic starts from his inner, positive, individual experience, in which he finds himself as the eternal and only being, and so on. But nothing of this is communicable except the assertions that we have to accept on his word; consequently he is unable to convince.{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1844|p=Vol. II, Ch. XLVIII}}}} In ''[[The Emotion Machine]]'', [[Marvin Minsky]] argues that mystical experiences only ''seem'' profound and persuasive because the mind's critical faculties are relatively inactive during them.{{sfn|Minsky|2006|p=ch.3}}{{refn|group=note|Meditator: It suddenly seemed as if I was surrounded by an immensely powerful Presence. I felt that a Truth had been "revealed" to me that was far more important than anything else, and for which I needed no further evidence. But when later I tried to describe this to my friends, I found that I had nothing to say except how wonderful that experience was.

This peculiar type of mental state is sometimes called a "Mystical Experience" or "Rapture," "Ecstasy," or "Bliss." Some who undergo it call it "wonderful," but a better word might be "wonderless," because I suspect that such a state of mind may result from turning so many Critics off that one cannot find any flaws in it.

What might that "powerful Presence" represent? It is sometimes seen as a deity, but I suspect that it is likely to be a version of some early Imprimer that for years has been hiding inside your mind.{{refn|group=note|Minsky's idea of 'some early Imprimer hiding in the mind' was an echo of [[Freud]]'s belief that mystical experience was essentially infantile and regressive, i.e., a memory of 'Oneness' with the mother.}} In any case, such experiences can be dangerous—for some victims find them so compelling that they devote the rest of their lives to trying to get themselves back to that state again.{{sfn|Minsky|2006}}}}

Gscwind and Picard propose a neurological explanation for this subjective certainty, based on clinical research of epilepsy.{{sfn|Picard|2013}}{{sfn|Gschwind|Picard|2014}}{{sfn|Gschwind|Picard|2016}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/can-epilepsy-unlock-the-secret-to-happiness-/epilepsy-happiness-brain-fabienne-picard/c4s13429/ Francesca Sacco (2013-09-19), ''Can Epilepsy Unlock The Secret To Happiness?'', Le Temps]}} According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the [[anterior insula]], a part of the brain which is involved in [[interoception]], self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk". This avoidance of uncertainty functions through the comparison between predicted states and actual states, that is, "signaling that we do not understand, i.e., that there is ambiguity."{{sfn|Picard|2013|p=2496-2498}} Picard notes that  "the concept of insight is very close to that of certainty," and refers to Archimedes "Eureka!"{{sfn|Picard|2013|p=2497-2498}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[satori]] in Japanese Zen}} Picard hypothesizes that in ecstatic seizures the comparison between predicted states and actual states no longer functions, and that mismatches between predicted state and actual state are no longer processed, blocking "negative emotions and negative arousal arising from predictive unceertainty," which will be experienced as emotional confidence.{{sfn|Picard|2013|p=2498}}{{sfn|Gschwind|Picard|2016}} Picard concludes that "[t]his could lead to a spiritual interpretation in some individuals."{{sfn|Picard|2013|p=2498}}

===Parietal lobe===
[[Andrew B. Newberg]] and [[Eugene G. d'Aquili]], in their book ''Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief'', take a perennial stance, describing their insights into the relationship between religious experience and brain function.{{sfn|Newberg|2008|p=2}} d'Aquili describes his own meditative experiences as "allowing a deeper, simpler part of him to emerge", which he believes to be "the truest part of who he is, the part that never changes."{{sfn|Newberg|2008|p=2}} Not content with personal and subjective descriptions like these, Newberg and d'Aquili have studied the brain-correlates to such experiences. They scanned the brain blood flow patterns during such moments of mystical transcendence, using SPECT-scans, to detect which brain areas show heightened activity.{{sfn|Newberg|2008|pp=2–3}} Their scans showed unusual activity in the top rear section of the brain, the "posterior superior [[parietal lobe]]", or the "orientation association area (OAA)" in their own words.{{sfn|Newberg|2008|p=4}} This area creates a consistent cognition of the physical limits of the self.{{sfn|Newberg|2008|p=5}} This OAA shows a sharply reduced activity during meditative states, reflecting a block in the incoming flow of sensory information, resulting in a perceived lack of physical boundaries.{{sfn|Newberg|2008|p=6}} According to Newberg and d'Aquili, 
{{quote|This is exactly how Robert{{who|date=August 2016}} and generations of Eastern mystics before him have described their peak meditative, spiritual and mystical moments.{{sfn|Newberg|2008|p=6}}}}

Newberg and d'Aquili conclude that mystical experience correlates to observable neurological events, which are not outside the range of normal brain function.{{sfn|Newberg|2008|p=7}} They also believe that 
{{quote|...our research has left us no choice but to conclude that the mystics may be on to something, that the mind’s machinery of transcendence may in fact be a window through which we can glimpse the ultimate realness of something that is truly divine.{{sfn|Newberg|2008|p=140}}{{refn|group=note|See [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan#Classification of religions|Radhakrishnan]] for a similar stance on the value of religious experience. Radhakrishnan saw Hinduism as a scientific religion based on facts, apprehended via intuition or religious experience.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/ Michael Hawley, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888—1975)'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Radhakrishnan, "[i]f philosophy of religion is to become scientific, it must become empirical and found itself on religious experience".&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; He saw this empiricism exemplified in the Vedas:

"The truths of the ṛṣis are not evolved as the result of logical reasoning or systematic philosophy but are the products of spiritual intuition, dṛṣti or vision. The ṛṣis are not so much the authors of the truths recorded in the Vedas as the seers who were able to discern the eternal truths by raising their life-spirit to the plane of universal spirit. They are the pioneer researchers in the realm of the spirit who saw more in the world than their followers. Their utterances are not based on transitory vision but on a continuous experience of resident life and power. When the Vedas are regarded as the highest authority, all that is meant is that the most exacting of all authorities is the authority of facts."&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;

This stance is echoed by [[Ken Wilber]]: "The point is that we might have an excellent population of extremely evolved and developed personalities in the form of the world's great mystic-sages (a point which is supported by Maslow's studies). Let us, then, simply assume that the authentic mystic-sage represents the very highest stages of human development—as far beyond normal and average humanity as humanity itself is beyond apes. This, in effect, would give us a sample which approximates "the highest state of consciousness"—a type of "superconscious state." Furthermore, most of the mystic-sages have left rather detailed records of the stages and steps of their own transformations into the superconscious realms. That is, they tell us not only of the highest level of consciousness and superconsciousness, but also of all the intermediate levels leading up to it. If we take all these higher stages and add them to the lower and middle stages/levels which have been so carefully described and studied by Western psychology, we would then arrive at a fairly well-balanced and comprehensive model of the spectrum of consciousness."{{sfn|Wilber|1996|p=14}}}}}}

''Why God Won't Go Away'' "received very little attention from professional scholars of religion".{{sfn|Day|2009|p=122}}{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.michaelshermer.com/2001/07/is-god-all-in-the-mind/ Michael Shermer (2001), ''Is God All in the Mind?''] for a review in ''Science''.}}{{refn|group=note|According to Matthew Day, the book "is fatally compromised by conceptual confusions, obsolete scholarship, clumsy sleights of hand and untethered speculation".{{sfn|Day|2009|p=122}} According to Matthew Day, Newberg and d'Aquili "consistently discount the messy reality of empirical religious heterogenity".{{sfn|Day|2009|p=123}}}} According to Bulkeley, "Newberg and D'Aquili seem blissfully unaware of the past half century of critical scholarship questioning universalistic claims about human nature and experience".{{refn|group=note|Bulkely (2003), ''The Gospel According to Darwin: the relevance of cognitive neuroscience to religious studies''. Religious Studies Review 29 (2), 123–129. Cited in {{sfn|Day|2009|p=123}}}} Matthew Day also notes that the discovery of a neurological substrate of a "religious experience" is an isolated finding which "doesn't even come close to a robust theory of religion".{{sfn|Day|2009|p=118}}

==Spiritual development and self-transformation==
{{Main|Spiritual development}}

In mystical and contemplative traditions, mystical experiences are not a goal in themselves, but part of a larger path of self-transformation.{{sfn|Waaijman|2002}} For example, the Zen Buddhist training does not end with [[kenshō]], but practice is [[Kenshō#Training after kenshō|to be continued]] to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|Glassman|2007|p=54, 140}}{{refn|group=note|See, for example:&lt;br&gt;* Contemporary Chan Master [[Sheng Yen]]: "Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as "seeing your self-nature". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]]."{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}&lt;br&gt;* Contemporary western Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett: "One can easily get the impression that realization, kenshō, an experience of enlightenment, or however you wish to phrase it, is the end of Zen training. It is not. It is, rather, a new beginning, an entrance into a more mature phase of Buddhist training. To take it as an ending, and to "dine out" on such an experience without doing the training that will deepen and extend it, is one of the greatest tragedies of which I know. There must be continuous development, otherwise you will be as a wooden statue sitting upon a plinth to be dusted, and the life of Buddha will not increase."{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005|p=225}}}} To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by [[Linji Yixuan]] in his [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three mysterious Gates]], the [[Five Ranks]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]]{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} which detail the steps on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Path]].

The phrase "'''semiotic anthropology'''" was first used by Milton Singer (1978). Singer's work brought together the [[semiotics]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] with theoretical streams that had long been flowing in and around the [[University of Chicago]], where Singer taught.{{elucidate|date=July 2012}} In the late 1970s, [[Michael Silverstein]], a young student of Jakobson's at [[Harvard University]], joined Singer in Chicago's Department of Anthropology. Since that time, anthropological work inspired by Peirce's semiotic have proliferated, in part as students of Singer and Silverstein have spread out across the country, developing semiotic-anthropological agendas of their own.

Semiotic [[anthropology]] has its precursor in [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]]'s [[contextualism]] (which may be called [[anthropological semantics]]), which was later resumed by [[John Rupert Firth]].&lt;ref name="Nöth1995p103"&gt;[[Winfried Nöth]] (1995) ''Handbook of semiotics'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=rHA4KQcPeNgC&amp;pg=PA103 p.103]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropological approaches to semantics are alternative to the three major types of semantics approaches: [[linguistic semantics]], [[logical semantics]], and [[general semantics]].&lt;ref name="Nöth1995p103"/&gt; Other independent approaches to semantics are [[philosophical semantics]] and [[psychological semantics]].&lt;ref name="Nöth1995p103"/&gt;

[[Elizabeth Mertz]] has recently reviewed the burgeoning literature in semiotic anthropology (2007).

"'''The Will to Believe'''" is a lecture  by [[William James]], first published in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;First published in ''The New World'', Volume 5 (1896): [https://books.google.com/books?id=6OAWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 327-347.]&lt;/ref&gt; which defends, in certain cases, the adoption of a belief without prior evidence of its truth. In particular, James is concerned in this lecture about defending the rationality of religious [[faith]] even lacking sufficient evidence of religious truth. James states in his introduction: "I have brought with me tonight [...] an essay in justification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact that our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced. 'The Will to Believe,' accordingly, is the title of my paper."

James' central argument in "The Will to Believe" hinges on the idea that access to the evidence for whether or not certain beliefs are true depends crucially upon first adopting those beliefs without evidence. As an example, James argues that it can be rational to have unsupported faith in one's own ability to accomplish tasks that require [[confidence]]. Importantly, James points out that this is the case even for pursuing scientific inquiry. James then argues that like belief in one's own ability to accomplish a difficult task, religious faith can also be rational even if one at the time lacks evidence for the truth of one's religious belief.

==The lecture==

James' "The Will to Believe" and [[William Kingdon Clifford|William K. Clifford]]'s essay "The Ethics of Belief" are touchstones for many contemporary debates over [[evidentialism]], [[faith]], and [[overbelief]]. James' "The Will to Believe" consists of introductory remarks followed by ten numbered but not titled sections. In his introductory remarks, James characterizes his lecture by stating that he had "brought with me tonight [...] an essay in justification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, despite our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced." "The Will to Believe", accordingly, is the title of my paper." At the end of his introductory remarks, James leads into his first section by stating that he "must begin by setting up some technical distinctions".

===Sections I–III: Preliminaries===

In section I, James embarks upon the task of defining a number of important terms he will be relying upon throughout the lecture:
* Live and dead hypotheses&amp;nbsp;– "deadness and liveness [...] are measured by [a thinker's] willingness to act. The maximum of liveness in a hypothesis means willingness to act irrevocably"
* Option&amp;nbsp;– "the decision between two hypotheses"
* Living and dead option&amp;nbsp;– "a living option is one in which both hypotheses are live ones"
* Forced and avoidable option&amp;nbsp;– an option for which there is "no possibility of not choosing"
* Momentous and trivial option&amp;nbsp;– an "option is trivial when the opportunity is not unique, when the stake is insignificant, or when the decision is reversible if it later proves unwise"
* Genuine option&amp;nbsp;– "we may call an option a genuine option when it is of the forced, living, and momentous kind"
* Belief&amp;nbsp;– "A chemist finds a hypothesis live enough to spend a year in its verification: he believes in it to that extent."

In section II, James begins by saying he will then consider "the actual psychology of human opinion". Here James considers and largely agrees with the [[Pascal's Wager#Argument from inauthentic belief|criticism of Pascal's Wager]] that we either should not or are unable to believe or disbelieve at will. That is, James here seems to reject [[doxastic voluntarism]], "the philosophical doctrine according to which people have voluntary control over their beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;Rico Vitz, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/doxa-vol/ "Doxastic Voluntarism"], Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In section III, however, James qualifies his endorsement of this criticism of Pascal's Wager by arguing that "it is only our already dead hypotheses that our willing nature is unable to bring to life again". By which James means that it is only things we already disbelieve that we are unable to believe at will.

===Section IV: Thesis===

In his very brief section IV, James introduces the main thesis of the work:
:"Our passional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option between propositions, whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds; for to say under such circumstances, "Do not decide, but leave the question open," is itself a passional decision—just like deciding yes or not—and is attended with the same risk of losing truth."
However, instead of providing an argument for this thesis, James quickly ends this section by stating that he must still "indulge in a bit more of preliminary work".

===Sections V–VII: More preliminaries===

In section V, James makes a distinction between a [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] about truth and its attainment and what he calls "[[dogmatism#Other usage|dogmatism]]": "that truth exists, and that our minds can find it". Concerning dogmatism, James states that it has two forms; that there is an "[[Absolute idealism|absolutist way]]" and an "[[empiricism|empiricist way]]" of believing in truth. James states: "The absolutists in this matter say that we not only can attain to knowing truth, but we can know when we have attained to knowing it, while the empiricists think that although we may attain it, we cannot infallibly know when." James then goes on to state that "the empiricist tendency has largely prevailed in science, while in philosophy the absolutist tendency has had everything its own way".

James ends section V by arguing that empiricists are really no more tentative about their beliefs and conclusions than the absolutists: "The greatest empiricists among us are only empiricists on reflection: when left to their instincts, they dogmatize like infallible popes. When the Cliffords tell us how sinful it is to be [[Christians]] on such "insufficient evidence", insufficiency is really the last thing they have in mind. For them the evidence is absolutely sufficient, only it makes the other way. They believe so completely in an anti-Christian order of the universe that there is no living option: Christianity is a dead hypothesis from the start."

James begins section VI with the following question: "But now, since we are all such absolutists by instinct, what in our quality of students of philosophy ought we to do about the fact? Shall we espouse and endorse it?" He then answers: "I sincerely believe that the latter course is the only one we can follow as reflective men. [...] I am, therefore, myself a complete empiricist so far as my theory of human knowledge goes."

James ends section VI by stressing what he finds to be the "great difference" merit of the empiricist way over the absolutist way: "The strength of his system lies in the principles, the origin, the ''[[terminus a quo]]'' [the beginning point] of his thought; for us the strength is in the outcome, the upshot, the ''[[terminus ad quem]]'' [the end result]. Not where it comes from but what it leads to is to decide. It matters not to an empiricist from what quarter a hypothesis may come to him: he may have acquired it by fair means or by foul; passion may have whispered or accident suggested it; but if the total drift of thinking continues to confirm it, that is what he means by its being true."

James begins section VII by stating that there is "one more point, small but important, and our preliminaries are done". However, James in fact gives in this section a crucial bit of argumentation:
:"There are two ways of looking at our duty in the matter of opinion—ways entirely different, and yet ways about whose difference the [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] seems hitherto to have shown very little concern. We must know the truth; and we must avoid error—these are our first and great commandments as would-be knowers; but they are not two ways of stating an identical commandment, they are two separable laws. Although it may indeed happen that when we believe the truth A, we escape as an incidental consequence from believing the falsehood B, it hardly ever happens that by merely disbelieving B we necessarily believe A. We may in escaping B fall into believing other falsehoods, C or D, just as bad as B; or we may escape B by not believing anything at all, not even A.
:Believe truth! Shun error!—these, we see, are two materially different laws; and by choosing between them we may end by coloring differently our whole intellectual life. We may regard the chase for truth as paramount, and the avoidance of error as secondary; or we may, on the other hand, treat the avoidance of error as more imperative, and let truth take its chance. Clifford, in the instructive passage which I have quoted, exhorts us to the latter course. Believe nothing, he tells us, keep your mind in suspense forever, rather than by closing it on insufficient evidence incur the awful risk of believing lies. You, on the other hand, may think that the risk of being in error is a very small matter when compared with the blessings of real knowledge, and be ready to be duped many times in your investigation rather than postpone indefinitely the chance of guessing true. I myself find it impossible to go with Clifford. We must remember that these feelings of our duty about either truth or error are in any case only expressions of our passional life. Biologically considered, our minds are as ready to grind out falsehood as veracity, and he who says, "Better go without belief forever than believe a lie!" merely shows his own preponderant private horror of becoming a dupe. He may be critical of many of his desires and fears, but this fear he slavishly obeys. He cannot imagine any one questioning its binding force. For my own part, I have also a horror of being duped; but I can believe that worse things than being duped may happen to a man in this world: so Clifford's exhortation has to my ears a thoroughly fantastic sound. It is like a general informing his soldiers that it is better to keep out of battle forever than to risk a single wound. Not so are victories either over enemies or over nature gained. Our errors are surely not such awfully solemn things. In a world where we are so certain to incur them in spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness on their behalf. At any rate, it seems the fittest thing for the empiricist philosopher."

One possible way of interpreting James' words here is to take him to be arguing that while we should avoid falsehood, it is no vice to err if we do so while pursuing truth. That is, James is steadfastly agreeing that we must withhold belief until we possess sufficient evidence ''when that evidence is forthcoming''. Not to do so would be to wholly disregard the duty to avoid falsehood. However, as James is about to argue, where the truth of a belief only comes about after something is believed or where evidence regarding a belief's truth or falsity is only accessible to believers, the pursuit of truth seems to require us to believe upon insufficient evidence.

===Sections VIII–X: Main argument===

In section VIII, James finally moves beyond what he considers mere preliminaries. Here James first identifies areas of belief where he holds that to believe without evidence would be unjustified: "Wherever the option between losing truth and gaining it is not momentous, we can throw the chance of gaining truth away, and at any rate save ourselves from any chance of believing falsehood, by not making up our minds at all till objective evidence has come. In scientific questions, this is almost always the case [...] The questions here are always trivial options, the hypotheses are hardly living (at any rate not living for us spectators), the choice between believing truth or falsehood is seldom forced." James concludes this section by asking us to agree "that wherever there is no forced option, the dispassionately judicial intellect with no pet hypothesis, saving us, as it does from dupery at any rate, ought to be our ideal".

In section IX, James moves to investigate whether there are areas of belief where belief without evidence would be justified. James gives self-fulfilling beliefs as one example of such beliefs:
:"Do you like me or not?—for example. Whether you do or not depends, in countless instances, on whether I meet you half-way, am willing to assume that you must like me, and show you trust and expectation. The previous faith on my part in your liking's existence is in such cases what makes your liking come. But if I stand aloof, and refuse to budge an inch until I have objective evidence, until you shall have done something apt [...] ten to one your liking never comes. [...] The desire for a certain kind of truth here brings about that special truth's existence; and so it is in innumerable cases of other sorts."

From examples like these, James concludes: "There are, then, cases where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming. And where faith in a fact can help create the fact, that would be an insane logic which should say that faith running ahead of scientific evidence is the "lowest kind of immorality" into which a thinking being can fall."

James begins section X with the thesis that he takes himself to have already proven: "In truths dependent on our personal action, then, faith based on desire is certainly a lawful and possibly an indispensable thing." James then goes on to argue that, like the examples he gave in section IX, religious belief is also the sort of belief that depends on our personal action and therefore can also justifiably be believed through a faith based on desire:

:"We feel, too, as if the appeal of religion to us were made to our own active good-will, as if evidence might be forever withheld from us unless we met the hypothesis half-way. To take a trivial illustration: just as a man who in a company of gentlemen made no advances, asked a warrant for every concession, and believed no one's word without proof, would cut himself off by such churlishness from all the social rewards that a more trusting spirit would earn—so here, one who should shut himself up in snarling logicality and try to make the gods extort his recognition willy-nilly, or not get it at all, might cut himself off forever from his only opportunity of making the gods' acquaintance. This feeling, forced on us we know not whence, that by obstinately believing that there are gods (although not to do so would be so easy both for our logic and our life) we are doing the universe the deepest service we can, seems part of the living essence of the religious hypothesis. If the hypothesis were true in all its parts, including this one, then pure intellectualism, with its veto on our making willing advances, would be an absurdity; and some participation of our sympathetic nature would be logically required. I, therefore, for one, cannot see my way to accepting the agnostic rules for truth-seeking, or wilfully agree to keep my willing nature out of the game. I cannot do so for this plain reason, that a rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from acknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth were really there, would be an irrational rule. That for me is the long and short of the formal logic of the situation, no matter what the kinds of truth might materially be."

Although James does not here explain the way in which the truth or evidence regarding religious belief depends upon our first having religious belief, he does argue that it is a part of the religious belief itself that its own truth or the evidence of its own truth depends upon our first believing it. In the preface to the published version of "The Will to Believe" James offers a different argument for the way in which the evidence for religion depends upon our belief. There he contends that it is through the failure or thriving of communities of religious believers that we come to have evidence of the truth of their religious beliefs. In this way, to acquire evidence for religious belief, we must first have believers who adopt such belief without sufficient evidence. Much later in life, in his "Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking" lectures, James also mentions the possibility that God's existence may actually depend upon our belief in his existence.

==The doctrine==
The doctrine James argues for in "The Will to Believe" appears often in both his earlier and later work. James himself changed the name of the doctrine several times. First appearing as "the duty to believe", then "the subjective method", then "the will to believe", it was finally recast by James as "the right to believe". Whatever the name, the doctrine always concerned the rationality of believing without evidence in certain instances. Specifically, James is defending the violation of [[evidentialism]] in two instances:
* Hypothesis venturing (see [[Hypothetico-deductive model|hypothetico-deductivism]])&amp;nbsp;– beliefs whose evidence becomes available only after they are believed
* [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|Self-fulfilling beliefs]]&amp;nbsp;– beliefs that by existing make themselves true.

After arguing that for hypothesis venturing and with self-fulfilling beliefs a person is rational to believe without evidence, James argues that a belief in a number of philosophical topics qualifies as one or other of his two allowed violations of evidentialism (e.g. [[free will]], [[God]], and [[immortality]]). The reason James takes himself as able to rationally justify positions often not believed to be [[Verification theory|verifiable]] under any method, is how important he thinks believing something can be for the verifying of that belief. That is to say, in these cases James is arguing that the reason evidence for a belief seems to be unavailable to us is because the evidence for its truth or falsity comes only after it is believed rather than before. For example, in the following passage James utilizes his doctrine to justify a belief that "this is a moral world":

&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot then be said that the question, "Is this a moral world?" is a meaningless and unverifiable question because it deals with something non-[[phenomenal]]. Any question is full of meaning to which, as here, contrary answers lead to contrary [[behavior]]. And it seems as if in answering such a question as this we might proceed exactly as does the physical philosopher in testing an hypothesis. [...] So here: the verification of the theory which you may hold as to the objectively moral character of the world can consist only in this—that if you proceed to act upon your theory it will be reversed by nothing that later turns up as your action's fruits; it will [[wiktionary:harmonize|harmonize]] so well with the entire drift of experience that the latter will, as it were, adopt it. [...] If this be an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] moral universe, all acts that I make on that assumption, all expectations that I ground on it, will tend more and more completely to interdigitate with the phenomena already existing. [...] While if it be not such a moral universe, and I mistakenly assume that it is, the course of experience will throw ever new impediments in the way of my belief, and become more and more difficult to express in its language. [[Epicycle]] upon epicycle of subsidiary hypothesis will have to be invoked to give to the discrepant terms a temporary appearance of squaring with each other; but at last even this resource will fail. (—William James, "The Sentiment of Rationality")&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The doctrine James developed in his "The Will to Believe" lecture was later extended by his protégé [[F.C.S. Schiller]] in his lengthy essay "Axioms as Postulates". In this work, Schiller downplays the connection between James' doctrine and religious positions like God and immortality. Instead, Schiller stresses the doctrine's ability to justify our beliefs in the [[uniformity of nature]], [[causality]], [[space]], [[time]], and other philosophic doctrines that have generally been considered to be empirically unverifiable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Criticism==
James' doctrine has taken a lot of criticism. In 1907 University of Michigan Professor [[Alfred Henry Lloyd]] published "[[The Will to Doubt]]" in response, claiming that doubt was essential to true belief.

C.S. Peirce ends his 1908 paper "[[A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]" complaining generally about what other philosophers had done with pragmatism, and ends with a criticism specifically of James' will to believe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to me a pity they [pragmatists like James, Schiller] should allow a philosophy so instinct with life to become infected with seeds of death in such notions as that of the unreality of all ideas of infinity and that of the mutability of truth, and in such confusions of thought as that of active willing (willing to control thought, to doubt, and to weigh reasons) with willing not to exert the will (willing to believe).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]] argued that one must always adhere to [[fallibilism]], recognizing of all human knowledge that "None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error", and that the only means of progressing ever-closer to the truth is to never assume certainty, but always examine all sides and try to reach a conclusion objectively.

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of admitting that some traditional beliefs are comforting, James argued that "the risk of being in error is a very small matter when compared with the blessing of real knowledge", and implied that those who did not accept religious beliefs were cowards, afraid of risking anything: "It is like a general informing soldiers that it is better to keep out of battle forever than to risk a single wound" (Section VII).

James' appeal depends entirely on blurring the distinction between those who hold out for 100 percent proof in a matter in which any reasonable person rests content with, let us say, 90 percent, and those who refuse to indulge in a belief which is supported only by the argument that after all it could conceivably be true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Critique of Religion and Philosophy'', 1958, p83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some specific objections to James' doctrine include:

# the necessity of positing a hypothesis without personally adopting it as a belief{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}
# the epistemological problems of belief voluntarism{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}
# success in the world verifies a belief, rather than restricting verification to predictive success{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}
# the separation of belief adoption from truth and epistemic justification{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

James addresses objection (1) in a footnote of his "The Will to Believe" essay where he argues that for a chemist to devote years of his life to verifying a hypothesis, the chemist must also believe his hypothesis. However, the chemist adopting a hypothesis to guide years of study is certainly only a special case of hypothesis adoption. A more general defense of (1) could also be constructed from James' behaviorist theory of belief. James takes believing a proposition to consist in acting as if it were true, so if James considers testing a proposition as acting as if it were true to see if it leads to successful action, then James would be committed to seeing an act of hypothesis adoption as necessarily an act of belief adoption as well.

Objection (2) seems to presuppose the ability to will a belief. James believed that when evidence was insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a proposition, this uncertainty allowed a person to be able to will a belief by acting as if that belief were true. Objection (2) warrants further discussion over "voluntarism".

Objection (3) strikes at James' pragmatic theory of truth, which his will to believe doctrine seems to presume. James' main defense of his theory of truth is his claim that no other account of "truth" or "correspondence" or "agreement with reality" can be given except for the pragmatist account. James sees traditional accounts of truth as explaining one mysterious term ("truth") with nothing more than equally mysterious terms (e.g. "correspondence"). The only sense James believes we can make of the concept of "truth" is if we count as true the beliefs that lead us to perform actions that "agree" with the world. Those that fit with the world will lead to successful action, those that do not agree with the world will entail actions that lead to failure (e.g. if one believes he can fly, he'll jump off a building). With truth analyzed in this way, James sees no reason to restrict success to predictive success (objection (3)) and is fully comfortable with the fact that certain beliefs will lead one person to success in the world while failing someone else (objection (4)). However, this reply to both objections is not open to James since he explicitly claims that his will to believe doctrine does not depend on his pragmatist theory of truth.

== Process ==
ThetaHealing is usually administered in the form of individual sessions in which the practitioner trained in the techniques of Theta Healing sits directly opposite the person and initially attends to the person by listening, using empathy and  probing questions. They may conduct a session long-distance through alternative means of direct communication, such as telephone or over the internet via webcam and voice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/reise/Fern/article114820999/Tanz-Yoga-und-Soja-Keks-macht-das-gluecklich.html ''Tanz-Yoga und Soja-Keks – macht das glücklich?''],  German, Carola Ferstl, [[Die Welt]], 27 March 2013, accessed on 5 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gulfnews.com/leisure/health/does-it-work-energy-healing-1.1056753 ''Does it work: Energy healing''],  Louisa Wilkins, [[Gulf News]], August 2, 2012, accessed 3 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Theta Healing technique is based on the theory that a persons conscious and unconscious beliefs directly impact their emotional well-being, which may impact their physical health. The practitioner uses a method of meditation which tunes into a persons energy with the aim to improve their general well-being and health by freeing, as Vianna Stibal states, negative experiences, blocking thought patterns or genetically inherited patterns to create positive emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bworldonline.com/art-healing-thinking-gongs/ ''The art of healing through thinking and gongs''], BusinessWorld Online,  1 September 2017, accessed on 5 June.2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Theta-healing-Latest-in-alternative-therapy-clan/articleshow/4845923.cms ''Theta healing: Latest in alternative therapy clan''], [[Times of India]], 1 August 2009, viewed on 3 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UAeG8OvOu_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thetahealing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixrsWStuLbAhWDnpQKHcJ5At8Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=thetahealing&amp;f=false|title=Weight Reduction &amp; Much More!: With Theta Healing|last=Knight|first=Lorraine|date=2011-09-28|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781465359452|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.news.at/a/gummibaerchen-fuer-die-seele-pamela-obermaier-interview ''Mystik zwischen Humbug und Lebenshilfe''], German, Susanne Jelinek, [[News]], 12 December 2014, viewed on 3 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The ThetaHealing technique is always taught to be used in conjunction with conventional medicine.

'''Training'''

A distinction is made between different consecutive ThetaHealing training levels eg, from the basic practitioner to the advanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/business/entrepreneur-restarts-her-healing-business-20171002 'Ground Floor: Cedar Rapids entrepreneur restarts her healing business'], Deborah Neyens, ''[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]'', 28 August 2017, accessed on June 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://thetahealing.de/thetahealing-worldwide-classes.html ''ThetaHealing Seminarkatalog''], German, accessed on June 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
ThetaHealing's philosophy is what Vianna Stibal calls "the seven planes of existence". According to her, these levels of existence build a framework to show the importance of the "Creator of all that is” (whose upper level is also described as the "Place of perfect love"). In addition, its adherents are open to everyone, regardless of the person's origin or religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/One-with-the-above/article15717124.ece ''One with the above''],  Anuj Kumar, [[The Hindu]], 26 November 2010, accessed on 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The philosophy of ThetaHealing is primarily criticized by analytical thinkers due to its esoteric-minded attitude.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/09/mind-body-soul-experience-alternative-healers ''The Mind Body Soul Experience: a celebration of good posture, human credulousness and the placebo effect''], Tim Dowling, [[The Guardian]], accessed on 5 June.2018&lt;/ref&gt; The ThetaHealing method has been questioned by some practitioners of Alternative Healthcare medicine, as it is not one of their health care practices or related to any of the clinical methods of health treatment. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/9519657.stm ''The faith healers who claim they can cure''] , [[BBC News]], 22 June 2011, accessed on 5 June.2018&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Tongan Daopi''' ({{zh|t=同安道丕}}; {{CJKV|j=Doan Dōhi}}) was a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] monk during the end of the [[Tang Dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. Very little is known about him. Traditional biographies record that he was the abbot of Tongan Monastery on Mount Fengchi near modern [[Nanchang]].&lt;ref name=Fer&gt;{{citation|last=Ferguson|first=Andrew E.|title=Zen's Chinese heritage: the masters and their teachings|year=2000|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-163-5|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest source of information on monks of this era is the ''Zutang ji'' (Patriarch's Hall Record), which was completed in 952, but it fails to mention Tongan Daopi as a disciple of his supposed teacher [[Yunju Daoying]]. The ''Zutang ji'' does, however, record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying. The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi. He is first explicitly mentioned in the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'', which was compiled around 1004. However, in that work, it does not mention Tongan Daopi as having any disciples. The commonly accepted version of his lineage holds that [[Tongan Guanzhi]] is Tongan Daopi's successor. However, this comes from Huihong's ''Sengbao zhuan'', which was completed in 1119, much longer after Tongan's death than the other works. The ''Transmission of the Lamp'' instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of a [[Tongan Wei]], in turn a student of [[Jufeng Puman]], with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous [[Dongshan Liangjie]]. Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the ''Transmission of the Lamp'', and neither with much information. However, [[Dayang Jingxuan]], who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi, is recorded in the ''Transmission of the Lamp'' as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of ''Transmission of the Lamp'', suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage. This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is much more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi as commonly accepted.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{citation|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=How Zen Became Zen: The Dispute Over Enlightenment and the Formation of Chan Buddhism in Song-Dynasty China|year=2010|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3508-8|pages=93–94,210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=October 2018}}
An '''urtext edition''' of a work of [[classical music]] is a printed version intended to reproduce the original intention of the composer as exactly as possible, without any added or changed material. Other kinds of editions distinct from urtext are '''facsimile''' and '''interpretive''' editions, discussed below.

== Preparing urtext editions ==

The sources for an urtext edition include the autograph (that is, the manuscript produced in the composer's hand), hand copies made by the composer's students and assistants, the first published edition, and other early editions.  Since first editions often include misprints, a particularly valuable source for urtext editions is a copy of the first edition that was hand-corrected by the composer.

Typically, an urtext edition will include a preface indicating what sources were consulted by the editor.  In the case of manuscripts, or first editions that have become rare, the editor will indicate the scholarly library or other repository in which they are kept.

Where the sources are few, or misprint-ridden, or conflicting, the task of the urtext editor becomes difficult. Cases where the composer had bad penmanship (for example, [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Irvine |first=Demar B. |year=1956 |title=Review of [[Emanuel Winternitz]], ''Musical Autographs from Monteverdi to Hindemith'' |journal=Journal of Music Education |volume=4 |issue= |pages=60 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), or revised the work after publication, likewise create difficulties.

A fundamental problem in urtext editing is how to present variant readings. If the editor includes too few variants, this restricts the freedom of the performer to choose. Yet including unlikely variants from patently unreliable sources likewise serves the performer badly. Where the editor must go farthest out on a limb is in identifying misprints or scribal errors. The great danger—not at all hypothetical—is that an eccentric or even inspired choice on the composer's part will be obliterated by an overzealous editor.

One other source of difficulty arises from the fact that works of music usually involve passages that are repeated (either identically or similarly) in more than one location; this occurs, for instance, in the recapitulation section of a work in [[sonata form]] or in the main theme of a [[rondo]].  Often the dynamic markings or other marks of expression found in one location in the source material are missing in analogous locations.  The strictest possible practice is to render all markings literally, but an urtext editor may also want to point out the markings found in parallel passages.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion see Webster (1997, 54-58)&lt;/ref&gt;

One common response of editors for all of these difficulties is to provide written documentation of the decisions that were made, either in footnotes or in a separate section of commentary.

== Types of editions ==
===Facsimile editions===

Urtext editions differ from '''facsimile''' editions, which simply present a photographic reproduction of one of the original sources for a work of music.  The urtext edition adds value to what the performer could get from a facsimile by integrating evidence from multiple sources and exercising informed scholarly judgment.  Urtext editions are also easier to read than facsimiles.  Thus, facsimile editions are intended mostly for use by scholars, along with performers who pursue scholarship as part of their preparation.

The musicologist [[James Webster (musicologist)|James Webster]], basing his remarks on his study of two leading urtext editions of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s E flat Piano Sonata, H. XVI:49, suggests that players interested in [[historically informed performance]] ought to play from a facsimile. The reason is that some markings made by the composer simply cannot be rendered faithfully in a printed edition.  For Haydn, these include marks that are intermediate in length between a dot and a stroke (which evidently have different meanings for this composer), or phrase arcs that end high above the notes, leaving it ambiguous where a phrase begins or ends.  In such cases, printed editions are forced to make a choice; only a facsimile can provide an unaltered expression of the composer's intent.&lt;ref&gt;Webster (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretive editions===

Urtext editions also differ from '''interpretive editions''', which offer the editor's personal opinion on how to perform the work.  This is indicated by providing markings for dynamics and other forms of musical expression, which supplement or replace those of the composer.  In extreme cases, interpretive editions have deliberately altered the composer's notes or even deleted entire passages.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Harold Bauer]] deleted many passages from his edition of [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Schubert's last sonatas|B flat major piano sonata]]; for an appreciative 1919 review by [[Richard Aldrich (music critic)|Richard Aldrich]] see [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/09/archives/the-heavenly-lengths-in-schubert-mikado-at-the-park.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many famous performing musicians provided interpretive editions, including [[Harold Bauer]], [[Artur Schnabel]], and [[Ignacy Paderewski]].  In the days before recorded music, such editions were often the only way that students could obtain inspiration from the performing practice of leading artists, and even today they retain value for this purpose.

A compromise between urtext and interpretive editing is an edition in which the editor's additions are typographically distinguished (usually with parentheses, size, [[greyscale]] or detailed in accompanying prose) from the composer's own markings.  Such compromise editions are particularly useful for [[early music]], where the interpretation of the musical notation of long ago often poses difficulties.

==Authenticity==

Webster has suggested that many editions that are labeled "Urtext" do not really qualify:

{{quote|The great majority of editions labelled 'Urtext' make many more changes than their editors admit.  Publishers are partly to blame; they are afraid of doing anything that might seem unfamiliar or off-putting to any potential market.  Indeed they want to have the best of both worlds; for example, the ''[[Neue Mozart Ausgabe]]'' claims to offer 'an unexceptionable text from the scholarly viewpoint, which at the same time takes the needs of musical practice into account.'  Whether this is a pious hope or frankly based on self-interest, the fact remains that one can't serve two masters.''&lt;ref&gt;Webster (1997, 63)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Editions currently used==

William S. Newman suggests that in contemporary music teaching, urtext editions have become increasingly favored, though he expresses some ambivalence about this development:

{{quote|The pronounced swing towards ''Urtext'' editions ... is a healthy sign.  However, that swing may have gone too far from the student's standpoint.  For example, I would almost rather entrust my students to the old [[Hans von Bülow|Bülow]]-Lebert edition of Beethoven's [piano] sonatas than to the ''Urtext'', in which Beethoven's inconsistencies, especially in the matter of staccatos, slurs, and dynamic signs, can produce no end of confusion--almost, rather, that is, because the Bülow-Lebert edition ... went too far the other way, not only inserting numerous unidentified changes but also making various details consistent that were never meant to be.&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1986:29)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Bülow-Lebert edition to which Newman refers is a well-known interpretive edition of the sonatas.

Prince '''Vladimir Fyodorovich Odoyevsky''' ({{lang-rus|Владимир Фёдорович Одоевский|p=ɐˈdojɪfskʲɪj}}; {{OldStyleDate|11 August|1803|30 July}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Владимир Федорович Одоевский. Библиографический указатель. Энциклопедия Хоронос//http://hrono.ru/biograf/bio_o/odoevski_vf.php&lt;/ref&gt; – {{OldStyleDate|11 March|1869|27 February}}) was a prominent [[Russia]]n [[philosopher]], writer, [[music critic]], [[philanthropist]] and [[pedagogy|pedagogue]]. He became known as the "Russian [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]]" on account of his keen interest in [[phantasmagoria|phantasmagoric]] tales and [[musical criticism]].

==Biography==
The last member of the princely [[House of Odoyev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rurik.genealogia.ru/Rospisi/Odoev.htm|title=Родословная роспись князей Одоевских |work=genealogia.ru|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was genealogically the most senior member of the [[House of Rurik]]. He was born to Prince Fyodor Sergeevich Odoyevsky (1771—1808), a  state councillor (''statsky sovietnik''). His father started out as an adjutant of Prince [[Grigory Potemkin|Grigory Potyomkin]], then, in 1798 he entered civil service as the director of the Moscow Assignant bank.&lt;ref&gt;http://baza.vgdru.com/1/23548/10.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to one version, his mother, Ekaterina Alekseevna Filippova, was a serf,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however, this version has been proven wrong, and it was found out that his mother was a daughter of a [[Praporshchik|praporschik]].&lt;ref&gt;Владимир Одоевский. Сказки дедушки Иринея. Пёстрые сказки. Эл. книга. Aegitas, 24 июл. 2016 г.&lt;/ref&gt; His widow, Avdotya Petrovna, had a house on the Prechistenka street in [[Moscow]], several servants and a small fortune from her husband.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Лукьянова Ирина. Блаженны чистые сердцем./Журнал “Русский мир.ru” / 2014 / Август//https://russkiymir.ru/media/magazines/article/146967/&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a well-educated young lady; she could speak French and play the piano.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the Odoyevsky family regarded this marriage as [[misalliance]]. And after his father's death in 1808, his mother was married twice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Part of his childhood was spent with his grandfather, colonel Prince Sergey Ivanovich Odoyevsky,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but when he died, his estate in [[Kostroma Governorate]] ended up in the hands of an acquaintance of Vladimir's maternal grandmother, the widow of a general, Agrafena Glazova, who took over the properties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1812 his mother's house in Moscow was burned down in fire, and he and his mother lived at the estate of Drokovo in [[Ryazan Governorate]], which she took over. While her son was away studying at a boarding school, in 1818—1819 she married sub-porutchik Pavel Sechenov, and having given custody of her son to Agrafena Glazova, settled at Drokovo with her new husband.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; P. Sechenov turned out to be an abusive husband.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vladimir ended up owing much debt to Glazova, and having settled liabilities, he moved to his grandfather's estate being almost completely broke.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Considered by his contemporaries as a typical Muscovite, he was educated at the Nobility School of the [[Moscow University]] in 1816-22. In the mid-1820s, Odoyevsky presided over the [[Lyubomudry]] Society, where he and his fellow students met to discuss the ideas of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and other German philosophers. At that period, he came to know many future [[Slavophile]]s and [[Westernizer]]s, but refused to identify himself with any of these movements.

Since 1824, Odoyevsky was active as a literary critic and journalist. In 1824 he and [[Wilhelm Küchelbecker]] founded the short-lived Moscow literary magazine ''[[Mnemozina]]''. Perhaps most famously, he co-edited the ''[[Sovremennik]]'' with [[Alexander Pushkin]] in the mid-1830s. In 1826, he moved to [[St Petersburg]], where he joined the staff of the [[Imperial Public Library]]. Two decades later, he was put in charge of the [[Russian State Library|Rumyantsev Museum]]. Odoyevsky finally returned to Moscow in 1861 but continued to serve as a [[Governing Senate|senator]] until his death. He is buried in the [[Donskoy monastery]] necropolis.

==Short stories==
[[File:Odoevsky vladimir.jpg|thumb|Odoevsky in the 1840s; lithograph by [[Kirill Gorbunov]]]]

Aspiring to imitate [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Novalis]], Odoyevsky published a number of tales for children (e.g., "The Snuff-Box Town") and fantastical stories for adults (e.g., "Cosmorama" and "Salamandra") imbued with the vague [[mysticism]] in the vein of [[Jakob Boehme]] and [[Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin]].

Following the success of Pushkin's ''[[The Queen of Spades (story)|The Queen of Spades]]'', Odoyevsky wrote a number of similar stories on the dissipated life of the Russian aristocracy (e.g., ''Princess Mimi'' and ''Princess Zizi''). On account of his many short stories from the 1820s and 1830s, Odoyevsky should be listed among the pioneers of the impressionistic short story in Europe.

His most mature book was the collection of essays and novellas entitled ''[[Russian Nights]]'' (1844). Loosely patterned after the ''[[Aulus Gellius|Noctes Atticae]]'', the book took two decades to complete. It contains some of Odoyevsky's best known fiction, including the [[dystopia]]n novellas ''The Last Suicide'' and ''The Town with No Name''. The stories are interlaced with philosophic conversations redolent of the [[Encyclopédie|French Encyclopedists]].

==Musical criticism==
As a music critic, Odoyevsky set out to propagate the national style of [[Mikhail Glinka]] and his followers, denigrating their forebears such as [[Dmitri Bortniansky]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritzarev (2006): p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a romanticised biography of the Russian violinist [[Ivan Khandoshkin]], whose career he presented as thwarted by the malign influence of such Italian musicians as [[Giuseppe Sarti]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritzarev (2006): p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many articles on musical subjects, a treatise about old Russian church singing deserves particular attention, though he expressed strong distaste for ''strochnoy'' (early Russian polyphonic) chant: "No human ear could possibly bear the succession of seconds that are constantly to be encountered."&lt;ref&gt;V. Martynov: "Divine Liturgy for the Feast of St Peter and St Paul" CD note, Opus 111 OPS 30-161.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] appear as characters in some of his novellas. Odoyevsky was active in the foundation of the [[Russian Musical Society]], [[Moscow Conservatory]], and [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St. Petersburg Conservatory]].

==Technology==
Odoyevsky took part in development of [[electroplating]] technology, invented by [[Moritz von Jacobi]] in Russia. In 1844 Odoyevsky wrote a book, ''Galvanism applied in technology'' (''Гальванизм в техническом применении''). He made a number of experiments and developed [[cobalt]] [[electroplating]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galteh.ru/article_galvanotehnika.html History of electroplating in the 19th century Russia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183445/http://www.galteh.ru/article_galvanotehnika.html |date=2012-03-05 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yuquan Shenxiu''' ({{zh|c=玉泉神秀|p=Yùquán Shénxiù|w=Yü-ch'üan Shen-hsiu|r=Jinshū}}, 606?–706) was one of the most influential [[Zen master|Chan masters]] of his day, a [[lineage (Buddhism)|Patriarch]]&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin:1994, 1998:109)&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[East Mountain Teaching]] of [[Chan Buddhism]]. Shenxiu was [[dharma transmission|Dharma heir]] of [[Daman Hongren]] (601&amp;ndash;674), honoured by [[Wu Zetian]] (r. 690–705) of the [[Tang dynasty]], and the putative author of the ''Guan Xin Lun'' (Treatise on the Contemplation of the Mind, written between 675–700&lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1986:119&lt;/ref&gt;), a text once attributed to [[Bodhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1986:148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Shenxiu was born in Weishi County, suburb of [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]], then secondary capital of China. His family name was Li. His family was aristocratic and may have been related to the Tang Dynasty imperial family &lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1986:46&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in the Chinese classics and [[Taoism]] and became a Buddhist at the age of thirteen when he went to the government granaries at [[Kaifeng]] during a famine to plead the release of grain to the starving population. There he met an unnamed Buddhist and was inspired to take up Buddhism. After some seven years of a homeless life visiting the famous mountain centres of China, Shenxiu took the [[Patimokkha|full precepts of Buddhist monk]] in 625 at Tankong monastery in [[Luoyang]](洛阳), the Buddhist centre at the end of [[Silk Road]] since the second century.

Traces of his activities for the next twenty-five years were lost, the ''Chuan Fabao Ji'' (傳法寶紀) (''Annals of the Transmission of the Dharma-treasure'') claim that Shenxiu studied the Buddhist regulations ([[vinaya]]) and ceremonies and devoted himself to the practice of [[meditation]] ([[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]) and the development of wisdom ([[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]). In 651 he began to study under Hongren. The aforementioned ''Chuan Fabao Ji'' states that he studied with [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] for six years, thereby leaving in 657, before the arrival of the Sixth Patriarch, [[Huineng]], with whom Shenxiu supposedly had the famous verse-writing contest.  (see below) &lt;ref&gt;Historical writings date Huineng’s arrival at Hongren’s monastery sometime between 659 and 674 (the sources disagree on the date). Fa-hai’s (n.d.) preface to the Platform Sutra gives the year as 661. see McRae, 1986:285 n.77&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear why, but sometime around 665–668, Shenxiu was banished by the emperor and remained in hiding for ten years, returning to public notice between 676–679.&lt;ref&gt;see McRae, 1986:48–50 for speculation as to Shenxiu’s banishment&lt;/ref&gt; He initially took up residence at the Jade Spring Monastery (''Yuquan Si'' 玉泉寺) but soon one was built for him, the Monastery of the Six Perfections (''Dumen Si''　度門寺廟) where he spent the next quarter century.

In late 700 the Empress Wu invited Shenxiu to the capital at [[Luoyang]] to teach Chan Buddhism. His welcome in 701 was by all accounts quite spectacular. The ''Annals of the Transmission of the Dharma-treasure'' describe Shenxiu’s path being bedecked with flowers and the master riding on a litter of the type reserved for the imperial family. In an unprecedented gesture, the Empress knelt before the Chan master, touching her forehead to the ground in reverence. The ''Annals'' go on to say that “From princes and nobles down, everyone [in the capital] took refuge in him.”&lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1986:51&lt;/ref&gt;

For the last five years of his life, Shenxiu traveled between the two capitals of Luoyang and [[Chang'an]], preaching the Buddhist Dharma before passing away at his monastery, ''Tumen Si'', reportedly sitting in meditation, on February 28, 706.&lt;ref&gt;the date is McRae’s (1986:54). Yampolsky gives the date as April 15, 706 (Yampolsky, 1967:16)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lengqie Shi Zi Ji'' (楞伽師資記)(''Records of the Lankavatara Masters'') state that his last words were ''ch’u-ch’u chiao'', which Professor Seizan Yanagida translates as “the teachings of the expedient means have been made direct” &lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1986:55&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning Emperor [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Zhongzong]] (705-710) granted the posthumous title ''Datong Chanshi''(大通禪師) (Greatly Penetrating Dhyāna Master), only the second time in Chinese Buddhism and the first for three hundred years that this imperial honour had been bestowed.&lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1986:55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verse contest==
One of the most well-known and cherished legends in Chan is the verse writing contest involving Shenxiu and Huineng at Hongren's monastery. The story can be found in the [[Platform Sutra]] of Huineng, but it was almost certainly not an historical event.&lt;ref&gt;McRae is adamant it never happened, saying,"Here we can be definitive: there is no such possibility whatsoever, and the account must be accepted as a brilliant and religiously meaningful bit of fiction. (McRae, 2003:67)&lt;/ref&gt; The account given in the Platform Sutra is as follows:
Hongren, realizing he was coming to the end of his years, instructed his monks to compose a "mind-verse" to demonstrate their level of attainment. The winner of the contest would be named Sixth Patriarch and receive the robe of [[Bodhidharma]]. None of the monks dared to write anything, deferring to Shenxiu who they believed would be the rightful Dharma heir. 
Shenxiu, full of doubts about his own motivations and with the weight of expectation upon him, chose to write a verse anonymously on a corridor wall in the night. Shenxiu's verse read:
::The body is the [[bodhi tree]]
::The mind is like a bright mirror's stand.
::At all times we must strive to polish it
::and must not let dust collect.
Publicly, Hongren praised this verse and instructed all his monks to recite it. Privately, Hongren asked Shenxiu to compose another verse as Hongren believed that Shenxiu's verse did not display true understanding of the Dharma. Shenxiu was unable to compose another verse.
Meanwhile, the illiterate Huineng heard the monks chanting this verse and asked about it. When told the story of Hongren's contest, Huineng asked a monk to take him to the wall where Shenxiu's verse was written. There he asked someone to write his own verse. According to a later version of the Platform Sutra (two significant variants exist in older versions), Huineng's verse read
::[[Bodhi]] originally has no tree.
::The bright mirror also has no stand.
::Fundamentally there is not a single thing.
::Where could dust arise?&lt;ref&gt;the verses are taken from McRae, 2003:61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McRae points out that the earliest version of the Platform Sutra has two versions of Huineng's verse:
::Bodhi originally has no tree.
::The mirror also has no stand.
::The Buddha-nature is always clear and pure.
::Where is there room for dust?
and
::The mind is the bodhi tree
::The body is the bright mirror's stand.
::The bright mirror is originally clear and pure.
::Where could there be any dust?
It is only in the later version that the third line, "Fundamentally there is not a single thing", can be found. (see McRae, 2003:61-61)&lt;/ref&gt;
The account says that publicly Hongren denigrated this verse but that later, in private, he taught Huineng the true meaning of the Diamond Sutra, thereby awakening Huineng to the sutra's profound teaching. Hongren gave Huineng the robe of transmission and told him to flee the monastery in secret at night. According to the legend, Huineng thereby became the Sixth and last Patriarch of Chan.

[[Shenhui]], a successor of Huineng, publicly criticized Shenxiu and associated him with the "Northern School", a term which Shenhui is thought to have invented. He claimed this "school" taught a "gradualist" (''jian jiao'' 漸教) idea of enlightenment as opposed to Huineng's supposedly superior "sudden" (''dun jiao'' 頓教) teaching. However, although a substantial amount of Shenhui's polemics survive, he is never recorded as mentioning this verse contest, which he presumably would have done in order to bolster the case for his descent from the superior Huineng. For this reason, in part, scholars doubt the historicity of the verse contest. Instead, it is thought that the Platform Sutra was composed by the Oxhead School in an attempt to reconcile the artificial split between the so-called Northern and Southern Schools. According to the Buddhologist John McRae, the two verses were likely intended to compliment one another and speak of two sides of one practice. Further, Shenxiu's verse does not explicitly suggest gradualism, but rather alludes to a need for constant, unending practice. Whatever the case may be, historically speaking it is clear that Shenxiu was a far more respected and prominent teacher than the virtually unknown Huineng, who only became famous through later [[hagiography]], including the Platform Sutra.

==Teachings==
Although Shenxiu was labeled a teacher of the “Northern School” (''Beizong'' 北宗) of Chan in subsequent histories of Chan, he saw himself as teaching in the “East Mountain” (''Dongshan'' 東山) tradition of Hongren. The “Northern School” appellation was applied in the early 730’s by the monk  Shenhui  who accused Shenxiu of teaching a “gradualist” approach to Chan Buddhism.

Shenxiu was highly educated and studied the Buddhist [[scriptures]] assiduously. He re-interpreted the scriptures as metaphors of “skilful means” (Sanskrit: ''[[upāya]]''; ''fangbian'' 方便) for “contemplation of the mind," (''kan xin'' 看心) advocating the attainment of [[Buddhahood]] in all daily activities, here and now. Every act was seen as religious practice. For example, he saw simple activities, like taking a bath, as a religious act. He taught that soap used to clean away dirt “is actually the ability of discrimination by which one can ferret out the sources of evil within oneself.” Cleaning the mouth with toothpicks is “nothing less than the Truth by which one puts an end to false speech.” Overt religious activities such as burning of incense were seen as “the unconditioned ''[[Dharma]]'', which ‘perfumes’ the tainted and evil karma of ignorance and cause it to disappear.” &lt;ref&gt;McRae, 2003:50&lt;/ref&gt;

In meditation practice, Shenxiu taught that the student should develop the innate ability of the mind “to illuminate and understand all things” &lt;ref&gt;McRae, 2003:53&lt;/ref&gt; and to see the emptiness of all things.  He taught that there is a profound stillness and tranquility in all things. A “Northern School” text abbreviated as the ''Five Skillful Means'' (''Wu Fangbian'' 五方便) states: “in purity there is not a single thing…Peaceful and vast without limit, its untaintedness is the path of ''[[bodhi]]'' (बोधि). The mind serene and enlightenment distinct, the body’s serenity is the ''bodhi'' tree.”&lt;ref&gt;McRae, 2003:53&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Shenxiu and the so-called “Northern School” were subsequently attacked as teaching a gradualist approach to enlightenment, the ''Guanxin Lun'' (觀心論) (''Treatise on the Contemplation of the Mind''), a Northern text which Zen scholar John McRae claims is “unquestionably written by him [Shenxiu]” &lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1986:207&lt;/ref&gt; (though there is no direct historical evidence) emphatically states: “It does not take long to witness this (i.e., to realize sagehood); [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] is in the instant. Why worry about your white hair (i.e., about your age)?”&lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1986:207&lt;/ref&gt; Shenxiu’s exhortations to constant, unremitting practice gave Shenhui the opening to attack the teaching as “gradualist” (a charge which would ironically apply to the entire Dongshan tradition of the Fourth and Fifth Patriarchs). In any case, the vilification of Shenxiu by Shenhui occurred some thirty years after Shenxiu’s death. During his lifetime, and especially his relatively brief teaching in the capital cities of the Tang Dynasty, Shenxiu’s teachings were received with widespread acceptance and reverence. The influence of Shenxiu’s teachings on subsequent Chan doctrine and practices is still a somewhat open question.
