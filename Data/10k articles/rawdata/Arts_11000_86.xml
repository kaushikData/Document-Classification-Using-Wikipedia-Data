The '''Aarne–Thompson classification systems''' are indices used to classify [[Folklore|folktales]]: the [[Antti Aarne|Aarne]]–[[Stith Thompson|Thompson]] Motif-Index (catalogued by alphabetical letters followed by numerals), the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (cataloged by AT or AaTh numbers), and the '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system''' (developed in 2004 and cataloged by ATU numbers). 

They are named after their authors, [[Antti Aarne]], [[Stith Thompson]], and [[Hans-Jörg Uther]].

The indices are used in [[folkloristics]] to organize, classify, and analyze [[folklore]] narratives and are essential tools for folklorists, as [[Alan Dundes]] explained in 1997 about the first two indices, "the identification of folk narratives through [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] and/or tale type numbers has become an international ''[[sine qua non]]'' among bona fide folklorists".&lt;ref name="dundes"&gt;Dundes, Alan (1997) "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3814885 The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique]". ''Journal of Folklore Research'' Vol. 34, No. 3, pp. 195–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing folktale types==
The Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index divides tales into sections with an AT number for each entry. The names given are typical, but usage varies; the same tale type number may be referred to by its central motif or by one of the variant folktales of that type, which can also vary, especially when used in different countries and cultures. The tale type does not have to be accurate for every folktale. For example, ''The Cat as Helper'' (545B) also includes tales where a fox helps the hero. Closely related folktales are often grouped within a type. For example, tale types 400–424 all feature brides or wives as the primary protagonist, for instance ''The Quest for a Lost Bride'' (400) or the ''Animal Bride'' (402). Subtypes within a tale type are designated by the addition of a letter to the AT number, for instance: the ''Persecuted Heroine'' (510) has subtypes 510A, ''[[Cinderella]]'', and 510B, ''[[Catskin]]'' {{crossref|printworthy=y|1=(see other examples of tale types in the [[#Online resources and examples of tale types|online resource links]] at the end of this article)}}.

[[Antti Aarne]] was a student of [[Julius Krohn]] and his son [[Kaarle Krohn]]. Aarne developed their [[historic-geographic method]] of comparative folkloristics, and developed the initial version of what became the Aarne–Thompson tale type index for [[Morphology (folkloristics)|classifying folktales]], first published in 1910.

The American folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] translated Aarne's [[motif (folkloristics)|motif-based]] classification system in 1928, enlarging its scope. With Thompson's second revisions to Aarne's catalogue in 1961, he created the "AT number system" (also referred to as "AaTh system"), which is often used today, more commonly in its updated "ATU number" form. According to [[D. L. Ashliman]], "The Aarne–Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales".&lt;ref name=ashliman&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman|Ashliman, D. L.]] 1987. ''A Guide to Folktales in the English Language: Based on the Aarne–Thompson Classification System.'' New York, Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AT-number system was updated and expanded in 2004 with the publication of ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography'' by Hans-Jörg Uther. Uther noted that many of the earlier descriptions were cursory and often imprecise, that many "irregular types" are in fact old and widespread, and that "emphasis on oral tradition" often obscured "older, written versions of the tale types".&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt; To remedy these shortcomings Uther developed the '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification''' (ATU) system&lt;ref&gt;''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales'', Donald Haase, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and included more tales from eastern and southern Europe as well as "smaller narrative forms" in this expanded listing.&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt;

==Organising motifs==
{{main|Motif-Index of Folk-Literature}}
The Aarne–Thompson ''[[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature]]'' organizes thousands of motifs into a similar system. Entries are first organized by an umbrella topic (for example, category S is "Unnatural Cruelty"). Entries are then divided into more specific subcategories. For example, entry S50 "Cruel relatives-in-law", under which is the more specific entry S51.1 "Cruel mother-in-law plans death of daughter-in-law".

==Critical response==
In his essay "The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique", Alan Dundes explains that the Aarne–Thompson indexes are some of the "most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis".&lt;ref name=dundes/&gt;

The tale type index was criticized by [[Vladimir Propp]] of the [[Russian Formalism|Formalist]] school of the 1920s for ignoring the {{em|functions}} of the [[Motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a "macro-level" analysis means that the stories that share [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features as salient.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale''. Similarly, [[Alan Dundes]] points out that "Aarne’s mistake was not classifying tales on the basis of narrative plot rather than [on characters]" because "the same tale can be told with either animal or human characters" (197). "Introduction." Theory and History of Folklore. Ed. Anatoly Liberman. University of Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 1984. pg ix&lt;/ref&gt;  He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify [[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]] an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale'', p. 5 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the motivation for his work,&lt;ref name="uther"&gt;{{cite web |first=Hans-Jörg |last=Uther |url=http://www.folklorefellows.fi/?page_id=915 |title=Classifying folktales: The Third Revision of the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (FFC 184) |publisher=folklorefellow.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uther presents several criticisms of the original index. He points out that Thompson's focus on oral tradition sometimes neglects older versions of stories, even when written records exist, that the distribution of stories is uneven (with Eastern and Southern European as well as many other regions' folktale types being under-represented), and that some included folktale types have dubious importance. Similarly, Thompson had noted that the tale type index might well be called ''The Types of the Folk-Tales of Europe, West Asia, and the Lands Settled by these Peoples''.&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt; However, Alan Dundes notes that in spite of the flaws of tale type indexes (e.&amp;nbsp;g., typos, redundancies, censorship, etc.; p.&amp;nbsp;198),&lt;ref name="dundes" /&gt; "they represent the keystones for the comparative method in [[folkloristics]], a method which despite postmodern naysayers ... continues to be the hallmark of international folkloristics" (p.&amp;nbsp;200).&lt;ref name="dundes" /&gt;

==Use in folkloristics==

A [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] study, published by [[folklorist]] Sara Graça da Silva and [[anthropologist]] Jamshid J. Tehrani in 2016, tried to evaluate the time of emergence for the "Tales of Magic" (ATU 300–ATU 749), based on a [[phylogenetic]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graça da Silva |first=Sara |last2=Tehrani  |first2=Jamshid J. |date=January 2016 |title=Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales |url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/1/150645#F4 |journal=Royal Society Open Science |publisher=The Royal Society |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1098/rsos.150645 |access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found four of them to belong to the [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) stratum of magic tales, namely:

* ATU 328 ''The Boy Steals Ogre's Treasure'',
* ATU 330 ''[[The Smith and the Devil]]'' (= [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|KHM]] 81a),
* ATU 402 ''The Animal Bride'' (= KHM [[:de:Die drei Federn|63]] and [[:de:Der arme Müllerbursch und das Kätzchen|106]]), and
* ATU 554 ''The Grateful Animals'' (= ''[[The White Snake]]'', KHM 17, and ''[[The Queen Bee]]'', KHM 62).

Ten more magic tales were found to be current throughout the Western branch of the Indo-European languages, comprising the main European language families derived from PIE (i.&amp;nbsp;e. [[Balto-Slavic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Italo-Celtic]]):

* ATU 311 ''Rescue by Sister'' (= ''[[Fitcher's Bird]]'', KHM 46),
* ATU 332 ''[[Godfather Death]]'' (= KHM 44),
* ATU 425&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'',
* ATU 470 ''Friends in Life and Death'',
* ATU 500 ''The Name of the Supernatural Helper'' (= ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'', KHM 55),
* ATU 505 ''The Grateful Dead'',
* ATU 531 ''The Clever Horse'' (= ''[[Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful]]'', KHM 126),
* ATU 592 ''The Dance among Thorns'' (= ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Der Jude im Dorn|Der Jude im Dorn]]}}'', KHM 110 is an example of this type of tale, and one of many racist and antisemitic folk tales that have been recorded),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maarten Janssen |url=http://www.mftd.org/index.php?action=atu&amp;act=select&amp;atu=592 |title=Multilingual Folk Tale Database |publisher=Mftd.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**The original version of the "Dance Among the Thorns" tale-type comes from 15th century Europe, and features a monk who was forced to dance in a thorn bush, by a boy with a magic flute or fiddle. It reflected the anticlerical sentiment of many folk tales at the time, and implies that the monk deserves this punishment. An American version of this tale, told to folklorist  Marie Campbell in 1958 in Kentucky, included this apology from the informant: "Seems like all the tales about Jews gives the Jews a bad name — greedy, grabbing for cash money, cheating their work hands out of their wages — I don't know what all. I never did know a Jew, never even met up with one." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC&amp;pg=PA786&amp;lpg=PA786&amp;dq=ATU+592&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TdDjHA6OZI&amp;sig=BPMc1SNTkK7wUuyJsQCm4lAS2mQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCzfe_4IXcAhVKzVMKHR5EBLMQ6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ATU%20592&amp;f=false |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales [3 Volumes&amp;#93; - Donald Haase - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-12-30 |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ATU 650&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; ''Strong John'' (= ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Der starke Hans|Der starke Hans]]}}'', KHM 166), and
* ATU 675 ''The Lazy Boy''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3226">The '''Académie André Delvaux''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] professional organisation dedicated to the promotion and development of [[Cinema of Belgium|Belgian cinema]]. Founded in 2010, it is responsible for the annual [[Magritte Awards]], Belgium's principal film awards.

==History==
The Académie André Delvaux was founded by two associations: the Francophone Film Producers Association (UPFF), represented by Patrick Quinet, [[Marion Hänsel]], Olivier Bronckart and Philippe Kauffmann, and the association of authors Pro Spère, represented by Luc Jabon, André Buytaers, Benoît Coppée and Alok Nandi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academieandredelvaux.com/_downloads/download.php?file=20_101028_Satuts_AAD.pdf|title=Annexes du Moniteur belge|publisher=Académie André Delvaux|format=PDF|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=January 9, 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was chosen in honour of the Belgian film director [[André Delvaux]] (1926–2002). The academy aims to promote the Belgian [[film industry]] around the globe. Its main task is to organize the [[Magritte Awards]], replacing the [[Joseph Plateau Award]], awarded from 1985 to 2006. Charly Herscovici, who created the foundation Magritte, allowed the academy to use the name of [[René Magritte]] for the awards.

The board of directors of the academy is composed of Luc Jabon (Pro Spère), Patrick Quinet (Union des producteurs de films francophones), Frédéric Delcor ([[French Community of Belgium|Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles]], Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel), Nicole Gillet ([[Festival International du Film Francophone de Namur]]), Philippe Reynaert (Wallimage), Philippe Logie ([[BeTV (Belgium)|BeTV]]), [[Jaco Van Dormael]] and Dan Cukier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academieandredelvaux.com/home.php?lang=fr|title=Académie André Delvaux|publisher=Académie André Delvaux|accessdate=January 9, 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1st Magritte Awards]] ceremony took place on 5 February 2011 at the [[Square – Brussels Meeting Centre|Square]] in the historic site of [[Mont des Arts]], [[Brussels]]. Twenty categories were presented, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 2009–2010 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moniteurdufilm.be/?article=77&amp;PHPSESSID=d0636412b8c21fa5e4cc15a80ae5ad53 |title=Le cinéma belge était à l’honneur lors de la Première édition des Magritte du cinéma belge francophone |work=Moniteur du film |accessdate=January 9, 2012 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205055415/http://www.moniteurdufilm.be/?article=77&amp;PHPSESSID=d0636412b8c21fa5e4cc15a80ae5ad53 |archivedate=December 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Algol''''' was an [[avant-garde]] Catalan magazine edited by the artistic group [[Dau al Set]] and first published in 1947. It was founded by [[Joan Pons]] and [[Joan Brossa]] and edited by [[Enric Tomo i Freixes]]. Only 100 copies of ''Algol'' were published. The 12-page magazine was printed on [[guarro]], a type of linen paper.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}

[[Dau al Set]] was formed by the poet Joan Brossa, the philosopher [[Arnau Puig]] and the painters Joan Pons, [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Modest Cuixart]] and [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]]. It was a very important group in the Spanish post-war era.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0021566.xml?s.q=dau+al+set#.UwHjbWJ5P7B Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana]&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine included literary texts by Brossa and Puig and illustrations by Pons, [[Jordi Mercadé]] and [[Francesc Boadella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc2.cbuc.cat/cdm/ref/collection/algol/id/0 Descripció]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group later published another magazine, called ''[[Dau al Set]]'' after their own name, which was the sequel to ''Algol''. ''Dau al Set'' was first published in 1948 and had a total of 56 pages. It also contained works by Brossa, Puig, and many other artists.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1215">'''''Andaruni''''' ({{lang-fa|اندرونی}} "inside") is a term used in [[Iranian architecture]].

In [[traditional Persian residential architecture]], the ''andaruni'', is in contrast to the ''[[Biruni (persian architecture)|biruni]]'', and is a part of the House in which the private quarters are established. This is specifically where the [[Iranian women|women]] of the house are free to move about without being seen by an outsider (''na mahram''). The only men allowed in the Andaruni are those directly related to the lord of the house (his sons) and the lord himself, which may include boys under the age of puberty, and guests allowed in under special circumstances.

The court (usually in the [[talar]]) of the house would usually be situated in the Andaruni.

== History and ideas ==
In the PL7, Zio Nirchio ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Plato in Twelve Volumes'' cit. by PL7, Vols. 5 &amp; 6 translated by Paul Shorey. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1969. {{ISBN|0-674-99262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] saw the function of the [[actor]] as bogus, presenting a dangerous illusion of reality, and masking the truth of existence by the pretence of acting. [[Aristotle]], in ''[[The Poetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Aristotle in 23 Volumes'', Vol. PL7, translated by W. H. Fyfe. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1932. {{ISBN|0-674-99563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the role of the actor somewhat differently, suggesting that by witnessing ''pity and fear'' (in his view the essence of [[tragedy]]) on stage, an audience could experience a [[catharsis]] of the emotions associated with real tragic events, without having to experience them as first-hand participants.

Since then, the 'stand-off' between those who have seen art as having a direct impact on morality, and those who have asserted its independence, has persisted. [[Tolstoy]] was ambivalent about the role of the artist (despite being one himself). In ''[[What is Art?]]'' he castigated now-[[Western canon|canon]]ical artists such as [[Shakespeare]], [[Goethe]] and [[Wagner]] for failing to express the 'simple truths' about morality (as he saw them), opting instead to show off their poetic cleverness. He saw their work as morally reprehensible, effectively a wasting of their talents through their failure to communicate moral truth to the masses.

Since the late nineteenth century and beyond, with the development of '[[the Arts]]' as a cultural concept, the debate about art and morality has intensified, with the ever more challenging activities of artists becoming targets for those who see art as an influence for bad or good, and it has been a mainstay of many art critics' negative reviews. [[John Ruskin]] accused [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] of "flinging a pot of paint in the face of the audience",&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Adam.  "A Sense of Justice: Whistler, Ruskin, James, Impressionism", ''Victorian Studies'' Volume 42, Number 4&lt;/ref&gt; and several of the ballets of [[Diaghilev]] scandalised audiences with their explicit (at the time) sexual themes.

Whistler and Ruskin eventually went face-to-face in the courtroom. But in 1961, one of the most [[Lady Chatterley's Lover#Controversy|famous legal clashes]] between art and morality occurred when [[Penguin Books]] were taken to court over their publication of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Chatterley's Trial'', Penguin Books {{ISBN|0-14-102232-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1977 the Christian morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] successfully sued a magazine, ''[[Gay News]]'', under [[blasphemous libel]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[popular culture]], [[pornography]] (if seen in aesthetic terms) is used as an example of the [[objectification]] of women, and violent films have been cited as the influence for so-called ''[[Copycat crimes|copycat]]'' acts in reality. An example of this was the [[Hungerford Massacre]], where a gunman was alleged by the [[tabloid press]] to have been influenced by the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' series of films starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].

In September 2001, shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center Attack]], the German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] said of the atrocity that it was "Lucifer's greatest work of art."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osborne-conant.org/documentation_stockhausen.htm The Stockhausen Affair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stockhausen.org/message_from_karlheinz.html Stockhausen's response&lt;/ref&gt; (However, Stockhausen's comments were taken out of context and misunderstood.) The responses were immediate and extreme, fuelled once again by the tabloid press. Some have found, here and elsewhere, art in the service of morality to be politically dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.necessaryprose.com/badart.htm Bad Art: The Iraq War out of Context&lt;/ref&gt;

In purely philosophical terms, the precise nature of art's links with morality have been long been questioned. Some have found no link between the aesthetic and the moral (i.e. being morally reprehensible does not deny an artwork its art status; it does not cease having aesthetic value no matter how depraved some might see it being), whereas others, who have not gone down the explicitly Platonist route, have argued that the relationship is one akin to [[supervenience]]. Here, it is argued that an essential component of the production of art, the human factor, can only be made sensible if taken along with the perceived moral codes which govern humanity.

'''''Candy Rain''''' ({{zh|c=花吃了那女孩|w=Huā Chīle Nā Nǚhái}}), also known as 愛情糖果雨('''''àiqíng tángguǒ yǔ'''''), is a 2008 [[Taiwanese film]] directed by [[Chen Hung-I]] (陳宏一).

== Plot ==
''Candy Rain'' is a romantic drama which combines four intimate, lyrical tales exploring lesbian relationship in contemporary [[Taiwan]]. In the first episode, a young girl escapes a broken love for the uncertainties of friendship (and more) in [[Taipei]]. In the second, another girl, seeking her ideal, finds herself involved with a wealthy woman instead. The third story follows a heroine trying to find a balance between marriage and separation from her true love. The final story portrays a volatile foursome anchored by singer-actress Karena Lam. A rich, bittersweet spectrum of love and loss, based on true stories.

The '''''Codex Repetitae Praelectionis''''' was the second edition of the ''[[Codex Justinianus]]'' (Code of Justinian). It came into force by the [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitution]] ''Cordi'' on 16 November 534 and was necessary due to [[Justinian I|Justinian's]] own legislative activity in creating new laws since the original code was issued in 529. It consists of 12 books and was written mainly in Latin.&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Codex Justinianus" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 474. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10029">'''Community arts''', also sometimes known as "dialogical art", "community-engaged" or "community-based art," refers to artistic activity based in a [[community]] setting. Works from this genre can be of any media and is characterized by interaction or dialogue with the community. Often professional artists collaborate with people who may not otherwise normally actively engage in the arts. The term was defined in the late-1960s and spawned a movement which grew in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Scandinavia]], the term "community art" means more often contemporary art project.

Often community art is based in economically deprived areas, with a community-oriented, grassroots approach. Members of a local community will come together to express concerns or issues through an artistic process, sometimes this may involve professional artists or actors. These communal artistic processes act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or even at a national or international level.

In English-speaking countries, community art is often seen as the work of community [[arts centre]]. [[Visual arts]] ([[fine art]], video, [[new media art]]), music, and theater are common mediums in community art centers. Many arts companies in the UK do some community-based work, which typically involves developing participation by non-professional members of local communities.

== Community art and public art ==
The term "community art" refers also to the field of community, neighbourhood and public art practice with roots in social justice and popular and informal education methods. In the art world, community art signifies a particular art making practice, emphasizing community involvement and collaboration. Community art is most often art for social change and involves some empowerment of the community members who come together to create artwork/s with artists. This is a growing national, international, regional and local field. Recently community arts and sustainability work or environmental action have begun to interface, including urban revitalization projects creating artwork at a neighbourhood level.

== Forms of Collaborative Practices ==
Models of community-engaged arts can vary with three forms of collaborative practices emerging from among the sets of common practices. In the artist-driven model, artists are seen as the catalysts for social change through the social commentary addressed in their works. A muralist whose work elicits and sustains political dialogue would be a practitioner of this model. In the second model, artists engage with community groups to facilitate specialized forms of art creation, often with the goal of presenting the work in a public forum to promote awareness and to further discourse within a larger community. In the process-driven or dialogic model, artists may engage with a group in order to facilitate an artistic process that addresses particular concerns specific to the group. The use of an artistic process (such as dance or [[Social Circus|social circus]]) for problem-solving, therapeutic, group-empowerment or strategic planning purposes may result in artistic works that are not intended for public presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icasc.ca/what-art-social-change|title=What is Art for Social Change? {{!}} Art for Social Change|website=icasc.ca|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second and third models, the individuals who collaborate on the artistic creation may not define themselves as artists but are considered practitioners of an art-making process that produces social change.

Due to its roots in social justice and collaborative, community-based nature, art for social change may be considered a form of cultural democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melucci|first=Alberto|last2=Avritzer|first2=Leonardo|date=2000-12-01|title=Complexity, cultural pluralism and democracy: collective action in the public space|url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/39/4/507|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=507–527|doi=10.1177/053901800039004001|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, the processes (or the works produced by these processes) intend to create or promote spaces for participatory public dialogue.

In Canada, the field of community-engaged arts has recently seen broader use of art for social change practices by non-arts change organizations. The resultant partnerships have enabled these collaborative communities to address systemic issues in health, education, as well as empowerment for indigenous, immigrant, LGBT and youth communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf http://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar social innovation trend has appeared where business development associations have engaged with artists/artistic organizations to co-produce cultural festivals or events that address social concerns.

As the field diversifies and practices are adopted by various organizations from multiple disciplines, ethics and safety have become a concern to practitioners.[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-016-9257-7?wt_mc=internal.event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst] As a result, opportunities for cross-disciplinary training in art for social change practices have grown within the related field of [[Arts in education|arts education]].

== Online community art ==
A [[community]] can be seen in many ways, it can refer to different kind of groups. There are also [[virtual communities]] or online communities.  [[Internet art]] has many different forms, but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project.

==Community theatre==
[[Community theatre]] includes theatre made by, with, and for a community—it may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help, or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community. Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time professional staff. Community theatre is often [[devised theatre|devised]] and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as [[carnival]], [[circus]], and [[parade]]s, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre. Community theatre is understood to contribute to the [[social capital]] of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience-members.

'''Conditioned taste aversion''' occurs when an animal associates the [[taste]] of a certain food with symptoms caused by a [[toxicity|toxic]], spoiled, or [[poison]]ous substance. Generally, taste aversion is developed after ingestion of food that causes [[nausea]], [[disease|sickness]], or vomiting. The ability to develop a taste aversion is considered an [[Adaptation|adaptive trait]] or survival mechanism that trains the body to avoid poisonous substances (e.g., poisonous berries) before they can cause harm. The association reduces the probability of consuming the same substance (or something that tastes similar) in the future, thus avoiding further poisoning. It is an example of [[classical conditioning|classical or "Pavlovian" conditioning]].

Studies on conditioned taste aversion which involved irradiating rats were conducted in the 1950s by [[John Garcia (psychologist)|Dr. John Garcia]],&lt;ref&gt;Garcia J, Kimeldorf DJ, Koelling RA. Conditioned aversion to saccharin resulting from exposure to gamma radiation. ''Science'' 1955; 122(3160): 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to it sometimes being called the '''Garcia effect'''.

Conditioned taste aversion sometimes occurs when sickness was merely coincidental and not related to the substance that caused the sickness. For example, a person who becomes very sick after consuming vodka-and-orange-juice cocktails may then become averse to the taste of orange juice, even though the sickness was caused by the over-consumption of alcohol. Under these circumstances, conditioned taste aversion is sometimes known as the '''"[[Sauce Bearnaise|Sauce-Bearnaise]] Syndrome"''', a term coined by [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Hager.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P. &amp; Hager, J. L. (1972, August). Biological boundaries of learning. The sauce-bearnaise syndrome. ''Psychology Today'', ''V6'', 59-61, 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Garcia's study ==

While studying the effects of radiation on various behaviors in the mid to late 1950s, Dr. John Garcia noticed that rats developed an aversion to substances consumed prior to being irradiated. To examine this, Garcia put together a study in which three groups of rats were given sweetened water followed by either no radiation, mild radiation, or strong radiation. When rats were subsequently given a choice between sweetened water and regular tap water, rats who had been exposed to radiation drank much less sweetened water than those who had not. Specifically, the total consumption of sweetened water for the no-radiation, mild radiation and strong radiation rats was 80%, 40% and 10%, respectively.

This finding ran contrary to much of the learning literature of the time in that the aversion could occur after just a single trial and over a long delay. Garcia proposed that the sweetened water became regarded negatively because of the nausea inducing effects of the radiation, and so began the study of conditioned taste aversion.

Many scientists were skeptical of Garcia's findings because it did not follow the basic principles of classical conditioning. However, Garcia replicated his results multiple times. He demonstrated that the particular stimulus used in classical conditioning does matter. An internal stimulus produced an internal response while an external stimulus produced an external response; but an external stimulus would not produce an internal response and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hockenbury|first=Don H. Hockenbury, Sandra E.|title=Discovering psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4292-1650-0|pages=197|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==

Taste aversion does not require cognitive awareness to develop&amp;mdash;that is, the subject does not have to consciously recognize a connection between the perceived cause (the taste) and effect (the negative feeling). In fact, the subject may ''hope'' to enjoy the substance, but the body handles it reflexively. Conditioned taste aversion illustrates the argument that in classical conditioning, a response is elicited.

Also, taste aversion generally only requires one trial.  The experiments of [[Ivan Pavlov]] required several pairings of the neutral stimulus (e.g., a ringing bell) with the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., meat powder) before the neutral stimulus elicited a response. With taste aversion, after one association between sickness and a certain food, the food may thereafter elicit the response. In addition, lab experiments generally require very brief (less than a second) intervals between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. With taste aversion, however, the hotdog a person eats at lunch may be associated with the vomiting that person has in the evening.

If the flavor has been encountered before the subject becomes ill, the effect will not be as strong or will not be present. This quality is called [[latent inhibition]]. Conditioned taste aversion is often used in laboratories to study gustation and learning in rats.

Aversions can also be developed to odors as well as to tastes.

Common vampire bats (''Desmodus rotundus'') do not learn taste aversions despite being closely related to other species of bats that do.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe2002&gt;{{Ratcliffe John. [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0003347203920598/1-s2.0-S0003347203920598-main.pdf?_tid=f60c7f4e-ffd7-11e7-af92-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1516669047_f53b3148c97194c238a9a7088848404c "An exception to the rule: common vampire bats do not learn taste aversions"], ''[[Animal Behaviour]]'', Ontario, 21 May 2002. Retrieved on 22 January 2018.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet of common vampire bats only consists of vertebrate blood and therefore it is hypothesized that the development of a taste aversion to their only food source would not be advantageous for these animals.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe2002 /&gt;

== In humans ==

Taste aversion is fairly common in humans. When humans eat bad food (e.g., spoiled meat) and get sick, they may find that food aversive until [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] occurs, if ever. Also, as in nature, a food does not have to ''cause'' the sickness for it to become aversive. A human who eats [[sushi]] for the first time and who happens to come down with an unrelated stomach virus may still develop a taste aversion to sushi. Even something as obvious as riding a roller coaster (causing nausea) after eating the sushi will influence the development of taste aversion to sushi. Humans might also develop aversions to certain types of alcohol because of vomiting during intoxication.

Taste aversion is a common problem with [[chemotherapy]] patients, who become nauseated because of the drug therapy but associate the nausea with consumption of food.

==  Applications ==

Taste aversion has been demonstrated in a wide variety of both captive and free-ranging predators.  In these studies, animals that consume a bait laced with an undetectable dose of an aversion agent avoid both baits and live prey with the same taste and scent as the baits.  When predators detect the aversion agent in the baits, they quickly form aversions to the baits, but discriminate between these and different-tasting live prey.

== Stimulus generalization ==

Stimulus generalization is another learning phenomenon that can be illustrated by conditioned taste aversion. This phenomenon demonstrates that we tend to develop aversions even to types of food that resemble the foods which cause us illness. For example, if one eats an orange and gets sick, one might also avoid eating [[tangerine]]s and [[clementine]]s because they look similar to oranges, and might lead one to think that they are also dangerous.

Stimulus generalization operates in most facets of animal and human life far beyond food tastes and aversion. Trauma and negative reinforcement of all kinds create aversion of other negative reaction to generalizations from the adverse event or events.  And like taste aversion, the generalization may or not be conscious.  Stimulus generalization is a factor in most "superstitious behavior", racism and prejudice of all kinds.

== Compared with taste avoidance==

Although the terms "taste avoidance" and "taste aversion" are often used interchangeably, studies with rats indicate they are not necessarily synonymous. "Aversion" is defined as "a strong dislike or disinclination"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/aversion "Aversion"]. Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and "avoidance" is defined as "stopping oneself from doing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/avoid "Avoid"]. Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that in avoidance, the organism is controlling its behavioural responses. Taste avoidance and taste aversion can at times go hand in hand, but they cannot be looked at or be defined the same way.

Studies on rats to determine how they react to different tasting liquids and injections indicate this difference. Scientists measured the facial and somatic reactions of rats after exposure to a flavored solution (sucrose or salt) which do not induce abnormal feelings. However, immediately after the rat ingests the solution, the rat is injected with a drug that induces nausea. The rat subsequently expresses a disgust reaction towards the solution, seen by mouth gaping. This is a [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioned response]] as the rat is associating the disgust with the solution that it drank immediately before the injection. The rat experiences taste ''aversion''.  This is similar to when a human, for example, eats a steak that is perfectly safe and edible and coincidentally contracts a stomach bug and starts vomiting within a few hours of eating the steak. Although the human may know that the vomiting was due to a virus and not from eating the steak, the conditioned response in the brain associates the steak with vomiting due to the timing and the human may avoid steak because he has developed a learned taste aversion to the steak.

When examining taste avoidance, however, the rat may avoid a food yet still enjoy it and choose it over others. In further tests, the rats were tested with another sucrose solution but this time it was paired with a drug that gave positive, euphoric effects, such as [[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]], and [[morphine]].  The rats showed positive reactions to the drugs.  However, rats react to any change in physiological state as a sign of danger  and avoided approaching these solutions. When one of these euphoric solutions was placed next to another solution that had a learned taste aversion, the rat would choose the substance that it had a taste avoidance towards. Scientists theorize that in terms of evolution, because rats are unable to vomit and immediately purge toxins, rats have developed a strong "first line of defense", which is their sense of taste and smell. This further shows the importance of taste and the correlation between taste and any change in physiological state, whether it be good or bad. Because rats rely upon taste and pairing it with a reaction rather than relying on later responses that involve the [[gastrointestinal tract]], taste avoidance is just as prevalent as taste aversion, though the two don't necessarily go hand in hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Linda A.

The '''dialogue editor''' is a type of [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] who assembles, synchronizes, and edits all the [[dialogue]] in a [[film]] or television production. Usually, they will use the production tracks: the sound that was recorded on the set. If any of the production tracks are unusable they can be replaced by either alternate production tracks recorded on set or by ADR, [[automated dialogue replacement]], which is recorded after the shoot with the actors watching their performances in a sound studio and rerecording the lines. Large productions may have an ADR editor working under the dialogue editor, but the positions are often combined. The ADR editor or dialogue editor also work with the [[walla]] group in films which they are required, providing the background chatter noise in scenes with large crowds, such as parties or restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/AudiopostFAQ/audiopostfaq.htm filmsound.org Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.hollywoodshorts.com/2011/05/post_sound_tips/ hollywoodshorts.com, INTERVIEW: Post Sound Tips- Eric Lalicata &amp; Dan Snow, May 09, 2011] &lt;/ref&gt;

Once the dialogue editor has completed the dialogue track, the re-recording mixer then mixes it with the [[music]] and [[sound effects]] tracks to produce the final soundtrack.

'''Diane Rehm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|m}}; born '''Diane Aed'''; September 21,&lt;ref name="Weeks" /&gt; 1936) is a retired American public radio talk show host. Her program, ''[[The Diane Rehm Show]]'', was distributed nationally and internationally by [[National Public Radio]]. The show was produced at [[WAMU]], which is licensed to [[American University]] in Washington, D.C.

Rehm had announced her plans to retire from hosting the show after the 2016 elections. The final program was recorded and distributed on December 23, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/business/media/diane-rehm-retire-npr-wamu.html?_r=0 |title=Diane Rehm Announces Retirement From Long-Running Talk Show |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 8, 2015 |accessdate=December 15, 2015 |author=Victor, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/23/media/diane-rehm-final-broadcast/index.html|title=Diane Rehm says farewell to 'The Diane Rehm Show'|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=2016-12-23|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rehm announced she was going to host a weekly podcast, which she began doing in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/2016/12/21/diane-has-a-podcast|title=The Diane Rehm Show Is Over.

== Early life ==
Rehm was born in Washington, D.C. According to Rehm's [[autobiography]], ''Finding My Voice'', her father's family were [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians from Ottoman [[Mersin, Turkey|Mersin]], a city on the southern coast of [[Anatolia]]. According to Rehm, the family were [[Arabs]], and her mother was an educated woman who was fluent in both [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic]]. Rehm's father immigrated to America in 1911, following his older brothers. He returned to Mersin to marry her mother, but found that she and her family were living in [[Alexandria]], Egypt. He brought her to America in 1929; family memories of how the two met vary.&lt;ref name=FindingMyVoice&gt;{{cite book|last=Rehm|first=Diane|title=Finding My Voice|year=1999|publisher=Capital Books, Inc.|location=Herndon, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 interview in ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]'', she describes her father as coming from [[Beirut]], Lebanon.&lt;ref name=HarrisWashingtonian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Shane|title=What Made Me: NPR's Diane Rehm|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/what-made-me-nprs-diane-rehm/|accessdate=11 June 2015|work=[[Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehm attended William B. Powell Elementary and [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Washington D.C.)|Roosevelt High School]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Weeks" /&gt; Upon graduation, she was employed by the city's highways department, where she became a radio [[dispatcher]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Personal life ==
Rehm married John Rehm, her second husband, in 1959; he was working at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], she was working as a secretary.&lt;ref name="Rosenwald" /&gt; John Rehm died June 23, 2014 after he stopped eating and drinking to end his suffering from Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?n=john-b-rehm&amp;pid=171467459|title=JOHN B.

She has two adult children, David and Jennifer.&lt;ref name="Gatewood" /&gt;On October 14, 2017 Diane Rehm and John Hagedorn were married at the Washington National Cathedral. 

Rehm has [[spasmodic dysphonia]], a neurological condition that affects the quality of her voice.&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weeks|first1=Linton|title=Diane Rehm finds a voice of her own|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/daily/rehm0823.htm|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Rehm began her radio career in 1973&lt;ref name="Gatewood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkwomen.com/0904/coverstory/0904_coverstory.html |title=Networking: Whos Whos, Whats What for Business Executives, "The Diane Rehm Show," A WOMAN'S VOICE |publisher=Networking Magazine |author=Gatewood, Miranda |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328080345/http://www.networkwomen.com/0904/coverstory/0904_coverstory.html |archivedate=March 28, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a volunteer for WAMU's ''The Home Show.'' In 1979, she took over as the host of WAMU's morning talk show, ''Kaleidoscope'', which was renamed ''The Diane Rehm Show'' in 1984.

Rehm has interviewed many political and cultural figures, including [[John McCain]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Madeleine Albright]]. She has said that her most touching interview was with [[Fred Rogers]] of the [[PBS]] program ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', conducted just before his death.&lt;ref name="Gatewood" /&gt; Rehm has described her interviews with [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] to have been "amazing experiences."&lt;ref name="Ruben"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rehm is the queen of talk radio |publisher=The Beacon |date=January 2010 |author=Ruben, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has written three autobiographical books. The first, ''Finding My Voice'', dealt with her traditional upbringing in a [[Christian Arab]] household, her brief first marriage and divorce, her 50-year marriage to John Rehm, raising her children, the first 20 years of her radio career, and her battles with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[osteoporosis]], and [[spasmodic dysphonia]].&lt;ref name="wamu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wamu.org/programs/dr/diane_rehm/finding_my_voice.php |title=The Diane Rehm Show: Finding My Voice |publisher=WAMU 88.5 FM, American University Radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812140031/http://www.wamu.org/programs/dr/diane_rehm/finding_my_voice.php |archivedate=August 12, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with John Rehm she co-wrote ''Toward Commitment: A Dialogue about Marriage'', which was published in 2002.

== Corporation for Public Broadcasting report ==
In 2005, a private study funded by the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] reported that Rehm booked 22 [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] guests for every 5 [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] guests.  The study was criticized as a politicized attempt to, in Rehm's word, "scare" journalists with the accusation of [[liberal bias]]. One criticism of the study concerned its criteria of what constituted "liberal" – a category which included seemingly moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] such as Senator [[Chuck Hagel]] and former Representative [[Bob Barr]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063002029.html |title=CPB Liberal Bias Study Flawed, Critics Say |website=Washingtonpost.com |date=July 1, 2005|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was commissioned by [[Kenneth Tomlinson]], whose appointment to the chairmanship of the CPB by George W. Bush had been criticized by liberals as politically motivated. Tomlinson hired Indiana consultant [[Frederick W. Mann]], a conservative thinker previously associated with the [[Young America's Foundation]], which has described itself as "the principal outreach organization of the Conservative Movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.org/node/868 |title=Kenneth Tomlinson &amp; the Mann Report |website=Project for Excellence in Journalism|date=March 13, 2006|accessdate=May 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509160659/http://journalism.org/node/868 |archivedate=May 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on the study by the CPB's Inspector General, Kenneth Konz, criticized Tomlinson's methods; the report led to Tomlinson's immediate resignation in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110302235.html |title=Kenneth Tomlinson Quits Public Broadcasting Board |website=Washingtonpost.com |date=2005-11-04 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Rehm personally "called Mann's findings 'unprofessional and simplistic.'  [and] added 'I've been booking shows for 25 years. I don't think they have any idea what it takes to achieve the professionalism and expertise and the right people to express a variety of points of view. . . . What [Kenneth Tomlinson]'s doing, I think, is trying to scare public broadcasters.' "&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt;

== Documentaries ==
Rehm has been featured in three political [[Documentary film|movie documentaries]]: ''[[Man from Plains|Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains]]'', ''[[I.O.U.S.A.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2274266/ |title=Diane Rehm |author= |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dinesh D'Souza|Dinesh D'Souza's]] ''[[2016: Obama's America]]'' which used her quote, "And then you've got the cover of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, a cover story by Dinesh D'Souza.  I think nothing has turned my stomach so much in recent years as reading that piece."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2010-09-17/news-roundup-hour-1/transcript |title=News Roundup: Hour 1 |author= |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
===2015 Bernie Sanders interview===

'''Dichromatism''' (or polychromatism) is a phenomenon where a material or solution's [[hue]] is dependent on both the concentration of the absorbing substance and the depth or thickness of the medium traversed.&lt;ref&gt;Kennard IG, Howell DH (1941) Types of colouring in minerals. Am Mineral 26:405–421&lt;/ref&gt; In most substances which are not dichromatic, only the brightness and saturation of the colour depend on their concentration and layer thickness.

[[File:Kurbiskernol.jpg|thumb|A drop of pumpkin seed oil on a white plate, showing dichromatism]]
Examples of dichromatic substances are [[pumpkin seed oil]], [[bromophenol blue]], and [[resazurin]].
When the layer of pumpkin seed oil is less than 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm thick, the oil appears bright green, and in layer thicker than this, it appears bright red.

The phenomenon is related to both the physical chemistry properties of the substance and the physiological response of the [[visual system|human visual system]] to colour. This combined physicochemical–physiological basis was first explained in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Kreft S and Kreft M (2007) Physicochemical and physiological basis of dichromatic colour, Naturwissenschaften 94, 935-939. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/h5630lr536pj1333/fulltext.pdf On-line PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical explanation==
Dichromatic properties can be explained by the [[Beer-Lambert law]] and by the excitation characteristics of the three types of cone [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in the human [[retina]]. Dichromatism is potentially observable in any substance that has an absorption spectrum with one wide but shallow local minimum and one narrow but deep local minimum. The apparent width of the deep minimum may also be limited by the end of the visible range of human eye; in this case, the true full width may not necessarily be narrow. As the thickness of the substance increases, the perceived hue changes from that defined by the position of the wide-but-shallow minimum (in thin layers) to the hue of the deep-but-narrow minimum (in thick layers).

The absorbance spectrum of pumpkin seed oil has the wide-but-shallow minimum in the green region of the spectrum and deep local minimum in the red region. In thin layers, the absorption at any specific green wavelength is not as low as it is for the red minimum, but a broader band of greenish wavelengths are transmitted, and hence the overall appearance is green. The effect is enhanced by the greater sensitivity to green of the photoreceptors in the human eye, and the narrowing of the red transmittance band by the long-wavelength limit of cone photoreceptor sensitivity.
According to the Beer-Lambert law, when viewing through the coloured substance (and thus ignoring reflection), the proportion of light transmitted at a given wavelength, ''T'', decreases exponentially with thickness ''t'', T = e&lt;sup&gt;−''at''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' is the absorbance at that wavelength. Let ''G'' = e&lt;sup&gt;−''a''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; be the green transmittance and ''R'' = e&lt;sup&gt;−''a''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; be the red transmittance. The ratio of the two transmitted intensities is then (''G''/''R'') = e&lt;sup&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-''a''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;)''t''&lt;/sup&gt;. If the red absorbance is less than the green, then as the thickness ''t'' increases, so does the ratio of red to green transmitted light, which causes the apparent hue of the colour to switch from green to red.

[[File:Dichromatism.jpg|800px]]

==Quantification==
The extent of dichromatism of material can be quantified by the [[Kreft's dichromaticity index]] (DI). It is defined as the difference in [[hue]] angle (Δh&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;) between the colour of the sample at the dilution, where the [[colorfulness|chroma]] (colour saturation) is maximal and the colour of four times more diluted (or thinner) and four times more concentrated (or thicker) sample. The two hue angle differences are called dichromaticity index towards lighter (Kreft's DI&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and
dichromaticity index towards darker (Kreft's DI&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This means that pumpkin oil changes its colour from green-yellow to orange-red (for 44 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] in [[Lab colour space]]) when the thickness of the observed layer is increased from cca 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 2&amp;nbsp;mm; and it changes slightly towards green (for 9 degrees) if its thickness is reduced for 4-fold.

==History==
A record by [[William Herschel]] (1738–1822), shows he observed dichromatism with a solution of ferrous sulphate and tincture of nutgall in 1801 when working on an early [[solar telescope]], but he did not recognise the effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=Lilienthal%20telescope&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false '''The History of the Telescope''' - By Henry C.

The '''''Dutch interiors''''' are a series of three paintings painted by [[Joan Miró]] in 1928, each inspired by [[Dutch Golden Age]] paintings of Dutch interiors. ''Dutch Interior I'' is a reinterpretation of the ''Lute Player'' by [[Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh]], ''Dutch Interior II'' is a reinterpretation of ''[[Children Teaching a Cat to Dance]]'' by [[Jan Steen]], and ''Dutch Interior III'' is a reinterpretation of the ''Young woman at her toilet'', also by Steen. They belong to a Mirós' period called "assassination of painting".
In the Spring of 1928, during a trip to Belgium and Holland, Miró was impressed by the [[Dutch master]]s of the 17th-century. After buying colorful postcards of some paintings he began his ''reinterpretations''. The colors are the hues of the original paintings, but the intensity of the color is purely Miró. Thus, a green-gray gradient wall of Martensz Sorgh becomes a green apple in Miró.

==''Dutch Interior I''==

This painting presents a scene where the lute player stands in the centre. A woman besides him looks at the partiture, near a table. Under the table, a cat and a dog are playing. These domestic components contrast with the landscape of Amsterdam which is seen through a window.

It includes the same degree of detail shown in ''[[The Farm (Miró)|The Farm]]'', with nowaday objects&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Maria Malet, Joan Miró , Barcelona, Edicions 62 , 1992 ( {{ISBN|84-297-3568-2}} )&lt;/ref&gt; as the basket of the house. The huge size of the main elements, as the lute, corresponds to its importance in the scene and not to its real size or the proportions of the original picture. This ability to break the model by distorting the images (mainly sizes and shapes of the objects) is a key characteristic of Miró's style.&lt;ref&gt;Pesquero, Saturnino. Joan Miró: la intencionalidad oculta de su vida y obra. Erasmus Ediciones, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It doesn't go never very far away from the Flemish model. As Miró reported "I had the postcard pinned up on my easel while I painted"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A4016&amp;page_number=13&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 Painting's Description at Moma]&lt;/ref&gt;

The colours belong to the same hue as in the original painting but with a greater intensity. They are pure and flat colours, not mixed ones, with special attention to green, white and brown.

==''Dutch Interior II''==

In this painting there are some repeated elements, like the dog and the cat, who dance with a group of children. The subject is not a description or a realistic work, but the music and the sound. Two red eyes are watching the scene and they foresse the fantasy touch of the third one, so the three paintings can be seen as a progressive series. Blue and brown are the main colours of the interior, while the cat serves as the spinning force of the whole composition.

It shows the aim of Miró to perform what it was called antipainting, influenced by Dada and Marcel Duchamp. When he takes a famous painting and transforms it, he is recognizing his debt with the model while he destroys it.&lt;ref&gt;Dupin, Jaques, Miró, Flammarion, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Miró is questioning his own previous work.

==''Dutch Interior III''==

The third painting of the series differs from the other two because, despite of being inspired by a domestic scene of a Flemish model, it changes the subject: the main character is a woman who isn't taking a bath but giving birth to a goat. This woman is impaled by a nail to the floor and is framed by a black line, one of the typical colours of Miró.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz, Jesús et al., Miró, Tikal, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The cruelty of the scene is softened by the stylization of the details,&lt;ref&gt;Dupin, Jacques, Miró, Flammarion, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; although the red of the blood makes it harder, attracting the attention of the viewer.

The '''Emmanuel Gallery''' is an [[art gallery]] and historic building at 1205 10th Street in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], United States, on the [[Auraria Campus]].

The gallery is housed in Denver's oldest surviving church building and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''Emmanuel Shearith Israel Chapel'''. It was built in 1876 as an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal church]], on the site of a Sunday School building that was erected in 1859. In 1903, it was bought by the Shearith Israel congregation and converted to serve as a [[Jewish synagogue]], which it was until 1958.&lt;ref name="nrhpdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=69000041}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Emmanuel Shearith Israel Chapel / Emmanuel Episcopal Chapel |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=1 July 2016 |author=Robert Fink |date=October 23, 1969 }} with {{NRHP url|id=69000041|photos=y|title=Two photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''False documentation''' is the process of creating documents which record fictitious events.  The documents can then be used to "prove" that the fictional events happened.  A common [[propaganda]] tool, false documentation is often used by [[management]] groups and [[totalitarian]] governments for four basic reasons:
# to have a basis for accusations against groups or individuals who oppose those in authority,
# to invoke hatred against certain [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[ethnic]] or [[religious]] groups (appeal to bigotry),
# To support the actions of those in power (appeal to [[patriotism]]), and
# To cover the mistakes of those in power ([[deniability]]).

Perhaps the best illustration of false documentation is [[Nazi Germany]], where the authorities falsified documents for all four reasons.

There are three basic methods for falsifying documentation.  One way, of course, is to create an entirely fictional event and write it down.  The other is to misrepresent an actual incident by embellishment or exaggeration so that the blame for the incident is misplaced.  The third is to refuse to document an actual event, thereby exonerating the instigators for lack of proof.

The practice of false documentation rests on the fallacy, promoted by management organizations and governments, that whatever has been written down is unquestionably true.  In business, it rests on a further bias: the tendency of management to believe managers rather than to collect and objectively judge evidence.  As [[folklorist]] [[Jan Harold Brunvand]] points out, when a story or a claim appears in print, it gains an air of authority.  Many people are skeptical of spoken rumors, but few doubt the veracity of stories appearing in the news media.

A related fallacy is, of course, that whatever has ''not'' been documented must not have happened. Although absence of evidence is [[evidence of absence]], whether any given event happened is entirely independent of whether it was documented.

In [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''1984'', the [[Ministry of Truth]] has an entire department devoted to altering past editions of [[newspapers]] in the belief that changing documentation will change the public's perception of history.  One of the novel's greatest ironies is that the Ministry of Truth deals exclusively in lies.

{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}
The '''final girl''' is a [[trope (literature)|trope]] in [[horror film]]s (particularly [[slasher film]]s). It refers to the last girl or woman alive to confront the killer, ostensibly the one left to tell the story. The final girl has been observed in many films, including ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]''.{{sfn|Rogers|2002|pp=118,120}} The term was coined{{sfn|Totaro|2002}} by [[Carol J. Clover]] in her book ''[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws|Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film]]'' (1992).{{sfn|Clover|1992|pp=260}} Clover suggested that in these films, the viewer began by sharing the perspective of the killer, but experienced a shift in identification to the final girl partway through the film. 

==Usage of the term==
The original meaning of "final girl", as described by Clover in 1992, is quite narrow. Clover studied [[slasher film]]s from the 1970s and 1980s (which is considered the [[golden era]] of the genre) and defined the final girl as a female who is the sole survivor of the group of people (usually youths) who are chased by a villain, and who gets a final confrontation with the villain (whether she kills him herself or she is saved at the last minute by someone else - i.e. a police officer), and who has such a 'privilege' because of her implied moral superiority (i.e. she is the only one who refuses sex, drugs and other such behaviors, unlike her other friends). 

However, the term "final girl" is often used, especially in recent years, in a much broader sense, applied also outside the slasher genre, and to females who are not morally pure, or even who survive together with other survivors, provided the other survivors are not the main focus of the struggle. The stereotypical virginal girl contrasted with her girlfriends' promiscuity is largely out of use today. Furthermore, slasher films have declined in popularity in recent decades, being replaced with [[science fiction]] horror in the 1990s, and [[supernatural horror]] in the 21st century. In fact, it has been argued that the most common female character trope of the 21st century horror is the Dysfunctional Mother female character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/scripps_theses/958/|title=The Final Girl Grown Up: Representations of Women in Horror Films from 1978-2016|first=Cupp,|last=Lauren|date=April 28, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trope concept==
A common plot line in many horror films is one in which a series of victims is killed one-by-one by a killer amid increasing terror, culminating in a climax in which the last surviving member of the group, usually female, either vanquishes the killer or escapes. 

The final girl trope has evolved throughout the years, from early final girls most often being [[damsels in distress]], often saved by a strong male (such as a police officer or a heroic stranger), to more modern final girls who are more likely to survive due to their own abilities. [[Lila Crane]], from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', is an example of a female survivor (according to Clover's definition not a final girl due to lack of moral purity) who is saved by a male (also named [[Samuel Loomis|Sam Loomis]]) at the film's ending, and [[Laurie Strode]] from ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' is a final girl saved by someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4fLaCLD11MC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq|title=Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film|last=Clover|first=Carol J.|date=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691006202|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On this basis, Tony Williams argues that, whilst [[List of horror films of the 1980s|1980s horror film]] heroines were more progressive than those of earlier decades, the gender change is done conservatively, and the final-girl convention cannot be regarded as a progressive one "without more thorough investigation".{{sfn|Williams|1996|pp=169&amp;ndash;170}} Furthermore, in many slashers, the final girl's victory is often ambiguous or only apparent. The fact that she is still alive at the end of the movie does not make her a victorious heroine. In many of these movies, the end is ambiguous, where the killer/entity is or might be still alive, leaving the viewers uncertain about the future of the final girl (a notable example is [[Jess (Black Christmas)|Jess Bradford in ''Black Christmas'']] (1974). Tony Williams also gives several examples of final girls in the heroines of the ''Friday the 13th'' series such as Chris Higgins from ''[[Friday the 13th Part III|Part III]]''. He notes that she does not conclude the film wholly victorious. Chris is [[catatonia|catatonic]] at the end of the film. Williams also observes that ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'' does not have a final girl, despite Trish Jarvis surviving at the end. Williams also notes that final girls often survive, but in the sequel they are either killed or institutionalized. A notable example is [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]] who survives ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980) only to be killed in the beginning of ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'' (1981). Derek Soles argues that the tragic destiny of such final girls represents an expression of patriarchal society where capable, independent women must by be contained or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Essentials of Academic Writing'', by Derek Soles, pg 374.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent films, this has started to change, with the final girl no longer being always doomed, a notable example being the ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' series.

According to Clover, the final girl in many movies shares common characteristics: she is typically sexually unavailable or [[virgin]]al, and avoids the vices of the victims like [[illegal drug use]]. She sometimes has a [[unisex name]] such as Avery, Chris, or Sidney. Occasionally the final girl will have a shared history with the killer. The final girl is the "investigating consciousness" of the film, moving the narrative forward and, as such, she exhibits intelligence, curiosity, and vigilance. Another trope of slashers (particularly in the 1980s) is "death by sex", where sex scenes are shortly followed by violence, with the participants being murdered in gruesome ways.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838159409364261&lt;/ref&gt; More recent horror movies challenge more of these tropes. [[Buffy Summers]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', in the words of Jes Battis, "subverts" the final girl trope of [[B-grade]] horror films.{{sfn|Battis|2005|pp=69}} Jason Middleton observes that although Buffy fulfills the monster-killing role of the final girl, she is the opposite of Clover's description of a final girl in many ways. Buffy is a cheerleader, a "beautiful blond" with a feminine first name, and "gets to have sex with boys and ''still'' kill the monster".{{sfn|Middleton|2007|pp=160&amp;ndash;161}} [[Sidney Prescott]] in  ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' also survives despite having sex.

One of the basic premises of Clover's theory is that audience identification is unstable and fluid across gender lines, particularly in the case of the slasher film. During the final girl's confrontation with the killer, Clover argues, she becomes masculinized through "phallic appropriation" by taking up a weapon, such as a knife or [[Chainsaws in popular culture|chainsaw]], against the killer. The phenomenon of the male audience having to identify with a young female character in an ostensibly male-oriented [[film genre|genre]], usually associated with sadistic [[voyeurism]], raises interesting questions about the nature of slasher films and their relationship with [[feminism]]. Clover argues that for a film to be successful, it is necessary for this surviving character to be female because she must experience abject terror, and many viewers would reject a film that showed abject terror on the part of a male. The terror has a purpose, in that the female, if she survives, is 'purged' of undesirable characteristics, such as relentless pursuit of personal pleasure. Certain films, like ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'' (2015), can be said to subvert traditional expectations of a final girl.

== Examples of final girls ==
=== Mari Collingwood ===
{{main|Mari Collingwood}}
While the 1972 version of the character has been viewed as more of a victim, the 2009 incarnation of the character has been observed to follow the "final girl" archetype. In ''Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study|last=Heller-Nicholas|first=Alexandra|publisher=McFarland|year=2011|isbn=9780786449613|location=|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandra Heller-Nicholas notes that that 2009 version of the character manifests traits of the trope, stating:
:"The most obvious shift towards a more generic horror structure, however, manifests in the "final girl" elements of Mari's character that are absent in the original. In 2009, Mari is not interested in drugs and argues it (although she finally succumbs). She fights back consistently throughout her attack; she deliberately lures Krug to her parents house as a way of possibly getting help; and Krug himself even observes at one point that she is a "cool customer." The film celebrates Mari's determination to survive, and the fact that this Mari lives and the 1972 one does not inadvertently acts as condemnation of the earlier version. The 2009 Mari was a fast swimmer and could get away (she was still shot, but only in the shoulder). But the 1972 Mari was physically unable to escape, and thus her "punishment" was death. Sara Paxton's Mari in the recent ''The Last House on the Left'' is not killed, and this presents the possibility that she herself was able to enact her own revenge, a dramatic act that would have significantly moved the film from being a rape revenge film where her parents act for her, to one where the raped woman seeks vengeance on her own behalf."
:"The depiction of Mari after Krug and his gang leave her (assuming she is dead) is a clear genre-marker, as she climbs out of the dark water at night to stumble home ''Creature from the Black Lagoon''-style. This depiction of her as a vacant monster continues throughout the rest of the film. Mari is not so much a rape survivor as she is the walking dead, whose only function is to provide her parents (specifically her father) with a motivation for violent and spectacular vengeance. Even in the scenes where John performs emergency surgery on their living room coffee table, Mari's face is mostly turned from the camera. It is less about ''her'' reaction and trauma than it is the ''impact'' her traumatized body has on her father."

=== Jess Bradford ===
{{main|Jess (Black Christmas)}}
An early example of a "final girl" can be found in the film ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974), where [[Jess (Black Christmas)|Jess Bradford]], played by [[Olivia Hussey]], is a well-developed character who refuses to back down against a series of more or less lethal male antagonists.&lt;ref name=Piepenburg&gt;{{cite news| last1= Piepenburg| first1= Erik| title=In Horror Films, the ‘Final Girl’ Is a Survivor to the Core| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/movies/in-horror-films-the-final-girl-is-a-survivor-to-the-core.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|accessdate=24 October 2015|work=The New York Times|date= 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jess is technically not a final girl according to the narrow definition, due to lack of chastity, but being a sole survivor of an early major influential slasher she is often analyzed together with final girls.

=== Sally Hardesty ===
{{Main|Sally Hardesty}}
[[Sally Hardesty]] from ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (1974), created by [[Tobe Hooper]] and portrayed by [[Marilyn Burns]], has been regarded as one of the earliest examples of the final girl trope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3315496/marilyn-burns-first-final/|title=Marilyn Burns: The First 'Final Girl' - Bloody Disgusting|website=bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laurie Strode ===
{{main|Laurie Strode}}
According to Clover, [[Laurie Strode]] (from ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]], [[Halloween: Resurrection|Halloween Resurrection]], and [[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween 2018)]]'' is another example of a final girl. Tony Williams notes that Clover's image of supposedly progressive final girls are never entirely victorious at the culmination of a film nor do they manage to eschew the male order of things as Clover argues. He holds up Strode as an example of this. She is rescued by a male character, Dr. [[Samuel Loomis]], in the ending of ''Halloween''.

=== Ellen Ripley ===
{{main|Ellen Ripley}}
Before the release of ''[[Alien 3]]'', Clover identified [[Ellen Ripley]] from the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] as a final girl. Elizabeth Ezra continues this analysis for ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'', arguing that by definition both Ripley and Annalee Call must be final girls, and that Call is the "next generation of Clover's Final Girl". In Ezra's view, Call exhibits traits that fit Clover's definition of a final girl, namely that she is boyish, having a short masculine-style haircut, and that she is characterized by (in Clover's words) "smartness, gravity, competence in mechanical and other practical matters, and sexual reluctance" being a ship's mechanic who rejects the sexual advances made by male characters on the ship. However, Ezra notes that Call fits the description imperfectly as she is a [[gynoid]], not a human being.{{sfn|Ezra|2008|pp=73&amp;ndash;74}}

Christine Cornea disputes the idea that Ripley ''is'' a final girl, contrasting Clover's analysis of the character with that of [[Barbara Creed]], who presents Ripley as "the reassuring face of womanhood". Cornea does not accept either Clover's or Creed's views on Ripley. While she accepts Clover's general thesis of the final girl convention, she argues that Ripley does not follow the conventions of the slasher film, as ''Alien'' follows the different conventions of the [[science fiction film]] genre. In particular, there is not the foregrounding in ''Alien'', as there is in the slasher film genre, of the character's sexual purity and abstinence relative to the other characters (who would be, in accordance with the final girl convention, killed by the film's monster "because" of this). The science fiction genre that ''Alien'' inhabits, according to Cornea, simply lacks this kind of sexual theme in the first place, as it has no place in such "traditional" science fiction formats.{{sfn|Cornea|2007|pp=150&amp;ndash;151}}

=== Ginny Field ===
{{main|Ginny (Friday the 13th)}}
The character [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]] (from ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'') has often been viewed as an example of the trope. In ''The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film'', [[Barry Keith Grant]] stated that, "Ginny temporarily adopts Mrs. Voorhees's authoritarian role to survive. Although circumstances necessitate this, she clearly uses her enemy's strategy to become a phallic mother herself. This posture really questions the positive image of the Final Girl." He then called her "not victorious" when she called out for her boyfriend at the end of the film saying that it was done in a "non-independent manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film|last=Grant|first=Barry|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=0292772459|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Kenneth Muir references Ginny in ''Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1'', saying "Amy Steel is introduced as Ginny, our final girl and heroine, and the only person who seems to have an inkling of the nearby danger. She's more resourceful than Alice and nearly upstages even Laurie Strode during the film's tense finale, wherein she brazenly dresses up as Jason's dead mother and starts barking orders at the confused serial killer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=MacFarland|year=2012|isbn=0786455012|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle'', Richard Nowell said "The shift in characterization of the female leads was also trumpeted during Ginny's self-confident entrance (Amy Steel) in ''Friday the 13th Part II''. Where the makers of its predecessor introduced Alice as she prepared cabins while dressed in denim jeans and a shapeless lumberjack shirt, the sequel's conventionally attractive lead is established immediately as combining masculine traits with feminine attributes. Ginny exits a battered VW bug in a flowing fuchsia skirt and a low-cut t-shirt."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle|last=Nowell|first=Richard|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=2010|isbn=1441188509|location=|pages=210|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginny's adoption of the monster's own strategy, in ''Part II'', brings into question whether the final girl image is in fact a wholly positive one.{{sfn|Williams|1996|pp=169&amp;ndash;170}}

===Sarah Connor===
{{main|Sarah Connor (Terminator)}}
Sarah Connor was a timid young woman for the most part in the first film, ''[[The Terminator]]''. She learned of the Terminator from Kyle Reese, and that he had come for her. By the end of the film, when it was down to her versus the Terminator, she had become a tough-as-nails heroine, and defeated the Terminator by luring it into a hydraulic press, where she crushed it. By the second film, she had become a hardened warrior, in danger of losing her humanity.

=== Nancy Thompson ===
{{main|Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)}}
The character [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] (from ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]''),  has often been regarded as one of the most influential horror movie heroines. In his book ''Horror films of the 1980s'', John Kenneth Muir&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=McFarland|year=2012|isbn=0-78645-501-2|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; references Nancy Thompson, stating the following:

:"As written by Craven and performed by Heather Langenkamp, Nancy is a rarity in the horror genre: an intelligent and insightful youth who is capable of connecting the important things in her life. Only Nancy can recognize the link between worlds for what it is, and look below the surface of reality because she is already trained to do so, through family history. Nancy is prepared in her battle with Freddy because, one senses, she has already detected the dark truth lurking beneath the affluent surface of Elm Street. She has suffered her parent's divorce, her father's absence, and her mother's alcoholism...Nancy is even compared explicitly to Hamlet...in that Hamlet stamps out the lies of his mother, an act which Nancy will repeat during the course of the film..."

:"So the key to defeating her Freddy...is something that goes against Nancy's most prominent characteristic. She must turn her back on the dream demon. She must take back all the energy she gave him...This is Nancy's crisis: knowing when to dig for truth and confront the lies, and when to turn her back on the corruption and lies she has discovered..."

:"The final girl must actively take steps to protect herself and vanquish evil. For example, Nancy buys a survivalist, self-defense manual and in the conclusion of ''Elm Street'', baits Freddy into chasing her. She then runs him through a punishing course of booby traps...Unlike Laurie, whom ''Halloween'' depicts as a victim of unchangeable 'fate,' someone who must mount a defense on the fly, Nancy is armed for battle and ready to rock."

=== Sidney Prescott ===
{{main|Sidney Prescott}}
Kearney points to the character of [[Sidney Prescott]] in the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' franchise. One of the final girl stereotypes was that the final girl is supposed to be a virgin, but the ''Scream'' films challenged that by allowing Prescott to survive until the end – even after having sex.

:''For information on swapping of (non-free) music see [[File sharing]], [[Napster]] or [[eMule]]''.
[[File:Free music.svg|thumb|right|The crossed out copyright symbol with a musical note on the right hand side is the free music symbol, signifying a lack of copyright restrictions on music. It may be used in the abstract, or applied to a sound recording or musical composition.]]

'''Free music''' or '''libre music''' is music that, like [[free software]], can freely be copied, distributed and modified for any purpose. Thus free music is either in the [[public domain]] or licensed under a free license by the artist or copyright holder themselves, often as a method of promotion. It does ''not'' mean that there should be no fee involved. The word free refers to [[Libre (word)|freedom]] (as in [[free software]]), not to [[Gratis versus libre|price]].&lt;ref name="Samudrala"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ram.org/ramblings/philosophy/fmp.html|title = The Free Music Philosophy |accessdate = 2008-10-26|last = Samudrala|first = Ram|authorlink =Ram Samudrala|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free Music Philosophy&lt;ref name="Samudrala"/&gt; generally encourages creators to free music using whatever language or methods they wish.  A Free Music Public License (FMPL)&lt;ref name="FMPL"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://free-music.org/fmpl/"|title = The Free Music Public License|accessdate = 2011-09-13|last = Samudrala|first = Ram|authorlink =Ram Samudrala|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is available for those who prefer a formal approach.
Some free music is licensed under licenses that are intended for software (like the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]) or other writings (the [[GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]]). &lt;!-- [[Richard Stallman]] wrote that this is not a great idea. --&gt; But there are also licenses especially for music and other works of art, such as [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'s [[Open Audio License]], [[LinuxTag]]'s [[Open Music License]], the [[Free Art license]] and some of the [[Creative Commons Licence]]s.

==History==
Before the [[History of copyright law|advent of copyright law]] in the early 18th century and its subsequent application to music compositions first, all music was "free" according to the definitions used in [[free software]] or free music, since there were no copyright restrictions. In practice however, music reproduction was generally restricted to live performances and the legalities of playing other people's music was unclear in most jurisdictions. Copyright laws changed this gradually so much so that in the late 20th century, copying a few words of a musical composition or a few seconds of a sound recording, the two forms of music copyright, could be considered criminal infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/17-18red.htm |title=NET Act: 17 U.S.C. and 18 U.S.C. as amended (redlined) |website=U.S. Department of Justice |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114064223/http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/17-18red.htm |archivedate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the concept of free music was codified in the Free Music Philosophy&lt;ref name="Samudrala"/&gt; by [[Ram Samudrala]] in early 1994. It was based on the idea of ''[[Free Software]]'' by [[Richard Stallman]] and coincided with nascent open art and open information movements. Up to this point, few modern musicians distributed their recordings and compositions in an unrestricted manner, and there was no concrete rationale as to why they did it, or should do it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} &lt;!-- Write about bands like the Grateful Dead, etc. --&gt;

The Free Music Philosophy used a three pronged approach to voluntarily encourage the spread of unrestricted copying, based on the fact that copies of recordings and compositions could be made and distributed with complete accuracy and ease via the Internet. First, since music by its very nature is organic in its growth, the ethical basis of limiting its distribution using copyright laws was questioned. That is, an existential responsibility was fomented upon music creators who were drawing upon the creations of countless others in an unrestricted manner to create their own.  Second, it was observed that the basis of [[copyright law]], "to promote the progress of science and useful arts", had been perverted by the music industry to maximise profit over creativity resulting in a huge burden on society (the control of copying) simply to ensure its profits. Third, as copying became rampant, it was argued that musicians would have no choice but to move to a different economic model that exploited the spread of information to make a living, instead of trying to control it with limited government enforced monopolies.&lt;ref name="schulman_1999a"/&gt;

The Free Music Philosophy was reported on by diverse media outlets including ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'',&lt;ref name="billboard_jul181998"/&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'',&lt;ref name="forbes_jul111997"/&gt; ''Levi's Original Music Magazine'',&lt;ref name="levi_nov192008"/&gt; ''[[Free Radical (magazine)|The Free Radical]]'',&lt;ref name="free_radical_2001"/&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;ref name="wired_jun101997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired_jun121998"/&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt_dec161998"/&gt; Along with [[free software]] and [[Linux]] (a free operating system), [[copyleft]] licenses, the explosion of the Web and rise of [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]], the cementing of [[mp3]] as a compression standard for recordings, and despite the efforts of the music industry, free music became largely the reality in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name="troelsjust"/&gt; Organisations such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and [[Creative Commons]] with free information champions like [[Lawrence Lessig]] were devising numerous licenses that offered different flavours of copyright and copyleft.  The question was no longer why and how music should be free, but rather how creativity would flourish while musicians developed models to generate revenue in the Internet era.&lt;ref name="schulman_1999a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="music_future"/&gt;&lt;ref name="napster_compendium"/&gt;

'''The Glasgow School of Art''' ('''GSA''') is [[Scotland]]'s only [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]] self-governing [[art school]] offering university-level programmes and research in [[architecture]], [[fine art]] and [[design]].

The school is housed in a number of buildings in the centre of [[Glasgow]], the most famous of which was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in phases between 1896-1909. The Mackintosh Building, which became one of the city's iconic landmarks, was severely damaged by fires in May 2014 and June 2018.&lt;ref name="guardian-2018-fire"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carrell |first1=Severin |last2=Brooks |first2=Libby |last3=Rawlinson |first3=Kevin |title='Heartbreaking': fire guts Glasgow School of Art for the second time |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/firefighters-tackle-blaze-at-glasgow-school-of-art |accessdate=16 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1845 as the '''Glasgow Government School of Design''', the school changed its name to The Glasgow School of Art in 1853. It was first located at 12 Ingram Street and moved to the [[McLellan Galleries]] in 1869. 

In 1897, work began on a new building to house the school on Renfrew Street, funded by a donation of £10,000 from the Bellahouston Trust, left from the will of [[Moses Stevens of Bellahouston]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mackintosh-architecture.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/name/?nid=BellaTru&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], chosen for the commission by the school's director, [[Francis Henry Newbery|Francis Newbery]], who oversaw a period of expansion and fast-growing reputation. The first half of the building was completed in 1899 and the second half in 1909.

The School's campus has grown since that time and in 2009 an international architectural competition was held to find an architect-led design team who would develop the Campus Masterplan and design the Phase 1 building. The competition was won by New York-based [[Steven Holl]] Architects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenholl.com |title=Steven Holl Architects |publisher=Stevenholl.com |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with Glasgow-based JM Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmarchitects.net/|title=jmarchitects|work=jmarchitects.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reid Building was completed in 2014 and sits opposite the now destroyed Mackintosh Building on a site previously occupied by the Foulis, Assembly and Newbery Tower Buildings.

The school has produced most of Scotland's leading contemporary artists including, since 2005, 30 per cent of [[Turner Prize]] nominees and four recent Turner Prize winners: [[Simon Starling]] in 2005, [[Richard Wright (artist)|Richard Wright]] in 2009, [[Martin Boyce]] in 2011 and [[Duncan Campbell (artist)|Duncan Campbell]] in 2014. The School of Architecture is highly rated by the architecture profession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graduatearchitecture.com/ARCHSCHOOLS/archschools_en.html |title=World's Best Architecture Schools and Universities – Top 10 List |publisher=Graduatearchitecture.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216043303/http://www.graduatearchitecture.com/ARCHSCHOOLS/archschools_en.html |archivedate=16 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the School of Design has been described by [[Design Week]] as "leaders in design education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art|url=http://www.fulbright.org.uk/about/partner-with-us/fulbright-partners/glasgow-school-of-art|work=Fulbright Partners|publisher=The US-UK Fulbright Commission|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School is organised into five academic schools, the [[Mackintosh School of Architecture]] (named after Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who is also the GSA's most revered alumnus), the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation (formerly the Digital Design Studio), specialising in digital and virtual technologies was launched in October 2016. The Innovation School was launched in September 2017. GSA also has a long-established portfolio of non-degree art and design classes for children and adults delivered through GSA Open Studio.

Disciplines include [[fine-art photography]] (founded by [[Thomas Joshua Cooper]] in 1982); [[painting]] and [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]] and [[environmental art]], [[product design]], [[Design engineering|product-design engineering]], [[textile design]], [[fashion design]], [[silversmithing]] and [[jewellery design]], [[interior design]], [[communication design]], [[interaction design]], and [[Architectural theory|architecture]].

===2014 fire===

The renowned Mackintosh library was destroyed; the archive was water damaged, but was able to be air and freeze dried. There were no reported casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27556659 |title=Glasgow School of Art fire: Iconic library destroyed |publisher=BBC News|date= |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire broke out as students were preparing for their Degree Show. Eyewitnesses said that the fire appeared to have started when a projector exploded in the basement of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building just before 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name="BBC-fight-to-save" /&gt;&lt;ref name=stv-2014-fire&gt;{{cite web|title=Firefighters battle major blaze at Mackintosh Glasgow School of Ar|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/276365-rennie-mackintosh-glasgow-school-of-art-on-fire/|work=STV News|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators later determined that the cause was not a faulty projector, but "a canister of expanding foam" used in close proximity to a hot projector, causing flammable gases to ignite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art blaze: Report says foam canister caused fire|author=Reevel Alderson, Home affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-30214533#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper, the use of aerosol cans is against school policy. The report from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service found that the design of the building contributed greatly to the spread of the fire: "the number of timber lined walls and voids, and original ventilation ducts running both vertically and horizontally throughout the building" as well as "a vertical service void", which "ran the entire height of the building … [and] allowed flames, hot gases, and smoke to travel". [[Fire damper| Fire and smoke dampers]], which are intended to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through ducts, had not been [[Retrofitting|retrofitted]]. In addition, an intended "fire suppression system" for the building had not been completed. A school staff member was on hand when the blaze first ignited, but was unable to contain the fast-spreading flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art fire a 'freak accident'|author=CRAIG BROWN|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-a-freak-accident-1-3616895|publisher=The Scotsman: Scotland on Sunday|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoration ====
A careful restoration process began soon after the fire; work on restoring and recreating the Mackintosh design, including the famous library interior, started in 2016.&lt;ref name="SheaRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Christopher|title=Restoring a Charles Rennie Mackintosh Architectural Gem From the Ashes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/arts/design/restoring-a-charles-rennie-mackintosh-architectural-gem-from-the-ashes.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 July 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration was performed with historical accuracy, including the use of original wood species such as [[longleaf pine]] and [[tulipwood]].&lt;ref name="BrooksRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Libby|title=Glasgow School of Art's library restoration begins in earnest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/24/glasgow-school-of-art-mackintosh-library-fire-restoration-begins-in-earnest|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MackintoshRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mackintosh at the Glasgow School of Art|url=https://www.longleaflumber.com/the-mackintosh-at-the-glasgow-school-of-art/|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 fire===
A large fire broke out in the Mackintosh Building on 15 June 2018, causing extensive damage. Emergency services received the first call at 11:19&amp;nbsp;pm BST, and 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were dispatched to the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/world/europe/uk-fire-glasgow-school-of-art.html|title=Glasgow Jewel Goes Up in Flames for Second Time in 4 Years|publisher=Ny Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; No casualties were reported. {{As of|2018|June|18|alt=The cause of the fire is not yet known.}}&lt;ref name="guardian-2018-fire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glasgow fire: Major blaze ravages art school's Mackintosh Building |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44504659 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Murray &amp; Alan Dunlop Architects|Alan Dunlop]], visiting professor of architecture at [[Robert Gordon University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.e-architect.co.uk/aberdeen/scott-sutherland-rgu-glasgow|title=Scott Sutherland Aberdeen: School of Architecture - e-architect|date=2010-01-30|work=e-architect|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; who studied at the Mackintosh School of Architecture, was contacted by the press immediately after the fire and stated: "I can’t see any restoration possible for the building itself.

Drone footage enabled a clearer assessment of the extent of the interior damage, and a programme of partial dismantling was established to stabilise the portions of the facade at risk of collapse, notably the south elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gsapress.blogspot.com/2018/07/news-release-work-begins-to-dismantle.html|title=Work begins to dismantle dangerous sections of the Mackintosh Building|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Glasgow City Council]] spokesperson said: "There is a consensus emerging that the intention of the building control people, HES ([[Historic Environment Scotland]]) people and the art school is to save the building... Right now, people are operating on the understanding it will be saveable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/shell-of-glasgow-school-of-art-building-may-be-saved-from-demolition|title=Glasgow School of Art building expected to be saved from demolition|last=|first=|date=18 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted by Roger Billcliffe that “It has been voted Britain’s most important building several times over, and we have all of the information needed to recreate every detail, following extensive laser surveys after the first fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/19/bulldoze-or-rebuild-architects-at-odds-over-future-of-glasgow-school-of-art|title=Bulldoze or rebuild?

The first opportunity for the school administration to visit the site happened on 19 June 2018. [[Muriel Gray]], Chair of the Board of Governors, stated: "This was the first opportunity for the expert team to see the building and begin what will be a long and complex process of determining the future of the Mack, but we remain optimistic. There is a huge desire to see Mackintosh’s masterpiece rise again, one which we all share. We have incredibly detailed information on the building collated over the last 4 years, and have worked with teams of talented craftspeople who were doing a tremendous job on the restoration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/about-gsa/key-information/mackintosh-building-fire-15-june-2018/|title=Statement from the GSA 19 June 2018 - Work to assess the condition of the Mackintosh Building underway|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent statement to the BBC, Professor Tom Inns, director of the school, affirmed that "This building is not beyond saving. It will be saved in some form." He continued to support his firm belief that the building should continue in its function as a working art school, rather than a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44530694|title=Fire-ravaged art school 'will be saved'|date=2018-06-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk factors====

At the time of the fire, [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinklers]] had yet to be installed in the building. Components for the fire suppression system had been delivered the day before, but were weeks away from assembly and testing. Building control officers have expressed concerns that the end walls may collapse. The building remains cordoned off and affected residents have been offered accommodation by Glasgow City Council.&lt;ref name="BBCSprinklers"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44592882 |accessdate = 24 June 2018 | work = BBC News | date = 24 June 2018 | title = Glasgow School of Art fire safety system 'was weeks away' |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2018 it was announced that work is being planned to take down parts of the building that are in danger of collapse. Compensation for local residents and businesses will be made available by the Scottish Government.&lt;ref name="BBCDismantle"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-44497880 |accessdate = 28 June 2018 | work = BBC News | date = 28 June 2018 | title = Glasgow School of Art in danger of 'sudden collapse' |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2018, Glasgow School of Art terminated its £25 million restoration contract with Kier following the Mackintosh Building fire.

==Campus==
[[File:gsa westernfacade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The western façade of the Mackintosh building]]
The school currently has two separate campuses: the School of Fine Art, Digital Culture, and MFA programmes are in the vicinity of the Mackintosh building. The School of Design – Textiles, Jewellery &amp; Silversmithing, Product Design Engineering, Product Design, Communication Design and Interior Design – the Centre for Advanced Textiles, Design Innovation Studio and the Where the Monkey Sleeps cafe have recently{{when|date=August 2018}} moved back to the Garnethill Campus with the occupation of the new Reid Building.

The Institute of Design Innovation (InDI), a research centre of the School of Design is based in Forres and the school has a Representative Office in Beijing, PRC. The GSA has a specialist research and postgraduate centre, [[Digital Design Studio]] (DDS), based on the southside of Glasgow in a new facility at [[Pacific Quay]] by the [[River Clyde]] in a building called The Hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hub-pq.com/home.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910023225/http://www.hub-pq.com/home.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-09-10|title=Graphic Design Agency / Brand Consultants Midlands – Alt Design|work=Alt Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mackintosh Building was the heart of the campus and continued to be a functioning part of the school until the first major fire on 23 May 2014. The building housed the [[Fine Art]] Painting department, first year studios and administrative staff. It houses the Mackintosh gallery which held many different exhibitions throughout the year. The Mackintosh Gallery (also known as the Mackintosh Museum) was the only part of the Mackintosh building open to the general public; all other areas of the school were only viewable by guided tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CathieRandall |url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/tours |title=Tours |publisher=Gsa.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to this rule was the Degree Show where all the studios within the Mackintosh building were opened to allow people to view the graduating year's final artworks. Since the fire of May 2014 the School of Fine Art has been temporarily housed in a campus at the Tontine Building, [[Merchant City]], Glasgow &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/visual/13412640.GSA_degree_show_takes_root_in_the_Trongate/|title=GSA Degree Show takes root in Trongate|last=|first=|date=2015|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Mackintosh Building underwent restoration and the newly acquired Stow Building is refurbished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/support-gsa/mackintosh-campus-appeal/|title=Mackintosh Campus Appeal|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=The Glasgow School of Art|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Glasgow_art_architecture.jpg|alt=|thumb|A model of the GSA]]
The Richmond Building houses the Fine Art Photography department. The Mackintosh School of Architecture and the school's library and learning resources are situated in The Bourdon Building. The Barnes Building on West Graham Street is the base for the Sculpture and Environmental Art, International Foundation and Interaction Design programmes.

An international architectural competition was launched in March 2009 to find the design team to prepare a campus masterplan and detailed design of the first new building phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitecture.com/news/read/GSA+launches+international+search+for+architects|title=Scottisharchitecture.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the competition was Steven Holl Architects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waite |first=Richard |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/steven-holl-unveils-glasgow-school-of-art-mackintosh-designs/5207716.article |title=Steven Holl unveils Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh designs |publisher=Architects Journal |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in partnership with Glasgow’s JM Architects and Arup Engineering. Work commenced in 2011 and continued until 2013. The building was structurally complete in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/glasgow_school_of_art_competition.php|title=Glasgow School of Art Competition – Extension Building|work=Glasgow Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new building has been named the Reid Building after the last Director: Dame [[Seona Reid]], and won Building of the Year at the 2014 Architect's Journal awards – the AJ100 Awards in May 2014, and the Award for Arts or Entertainment Structures at the [[IStructE]]'s 2014 [[Structural Awards]].

==Singapore Campus==
Since September 2012, the GSA has delivered years 3 and 4 of its Bachelor of Arts (Hons) Programmes in Communication Design and Interior Design in Singapore, in partnership with the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] (SIT), based at the [[Temasek Polytechnic]] Campus in Tampines.
The programmes enable Diploma students from the Singapore Polytechnics to progress from a Diploma to a BA (Hons) degree. 
Students studying in Singapore benefit from the same programme of study and award as in the home institution, along with resources and equipment according to the GSA specifications.

==Students==
The GSA has been ranked in the top 10 of specialist educational institutions in ''[[The Guardian]]'' University Guide, ranking it the top specialist visual arts institution in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2011/may/17/universityguide |title=University guide 2012: Specialist institutions league table |date=17 May 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its degrees are validated by the [[University of Glasgow]]. Of its 1,900 students, almost 20 per cent are international, 20 per cent from the rest of the UK and approximately 20 per cent are postgraduate. The GSA is placed 10th in the 2015 QS World Rankings for Art and Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/art-design#sorting=rank%20region=%20country=%20faculty=%20stars=false%20search=|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2015 – Art &amp; Design|date=22 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2nd in the nationally ranking 2016 Complete University Guide league table for Art and Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Art%20&amp;%20Design|title=Top UK University League Tables and Rankings 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HESA statistics show the GSA to have one of the lowest student drop-out rates in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7436091.stm |date=4 June 2008 |title=University drop-out rate |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/which-universities-have-the-highest-first-year-dropout-rates |date=28 August 2017 |title=Which universities have the highest first year dropout rates? |work=Channel 4 News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the funding councils published figures which placed Glasgow School of Art as having the second-lowest number of students from a working-class background out of a list of UK higher education institutions. With 7 per cent of its students coming from social classes IIIm, IV and V (skilled manual, semi-skilled or un-skilled workers), the figures put it above Oxford and Cambridge in terms of exclusivity. Glasgow School of art disputed the figures, explaining that the majority of its applicants did not come through the [[UCAS]] system on which the statistics were based so the numbers involved were very small. This was reinforced by [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]], which said the figures should be treated with care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacLeod|first=Donald|title=Glasgow 'posher' than Oxbridge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/dec/18/accesstouniversity.highereducation|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=18 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the Commission on Widening Access (CoWA) found the percentage of Scottish-domiciled full-time first degree entrants from SIMD 20 (20 per cent most deprived areas of Scotland) at the GSA was 22.2 per cent. This is the second highest in Scotland, according to CoWA's report, with only [[University of the West of Scotland]] having more.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Widening Access – Technical paper on measures and targets, p11, Annex A (14 Mar 2016) [http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00496620.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Glasgow School of Art is host to a number of high-profile research projects, funded primarily through the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]], and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], although other UK research councils have funded projects in the past.

At the last [[Research Assessment Exercise]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/ByHei/95|title=REF2014 results by institution/Glasgow School of Art|last=|first=|date=2014|website=results.ref.ac.uk|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GSA had the largest art and design research community in Scotland and with 23 per cent of research evaluated as world leading. The GSA has a number of research centres including the Digital Design Studio, Mackintosh Environmental Architectural Research Unit, Institute of Design Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/55365510 |title=Institute of Design Innovation on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centre for Advanced Textiles and the Glasgow Urban Lab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ScottParsons |url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/research/research-centres/ |title=Research Centres |publisher=Gsa.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research professors include Professor Thomas Joshua Cooper, Professor Alastair Macdonald, Professor Tim Sharpe, Professor Irene McAra-McWilliam {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|list=OBE}}, Professor Ken Neil, Professor Johnny Rodger, Professor Christopher Platt, Professor Steve Love, Professor Paul Chapman and Professor Brian Evans.

==Exhibitions==
The school runs an annual public programme of exhibitions and events. The Reid Gallery has a curated programme that works with contemporary artists, designers and architects; and GSA staff and students, and makes connections to the heritage and architecture of the Glasgow School of Art and its collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/life/gsa-events|title=GSA Events|date=|publisher=Gsa.ac.uk|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iberian schematic art''' is the name given to a series of prehistoric representations (almost always cave paintings) that appear in the [[Iberian peninsula]], which are associated with the first metallurgical cultures (the [[Copper Age]], the [[Bronze Age]] and even the start of the [[Iron Age]]). Its [[chronology]] is still a matter for debate, but it could span from the [[4th millennium BC|fourth]] up to the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BC]], overlapping, at its start, with [[Levantine Art]] and surviving marginally in some isolated regions during much later stages.

Its main characteristic, and that which gives it its name, is the [[schematic]], that is, a figurative style in which only the basic fragments of each figure are represented (eliminating all the rest); what's more, the representation is so basic that the graphic elements are converted into mere outlines, but without losing the minimal identifying features. In fact, the schematic phenomenon is considered somewhat more precise and problematic, and it is integrated in a wide movement which affects almost all of Europe and the [[Mediterranean]].

It could be said that the schematic phenomenon has global dimensions, although each region, including the Hispanic, has its own, differentiating aspects.

==The schematic phenomenon in the Iberian peninsula==
Schematics in art is a concept linked to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] (a figurative representation more or less faithful to nature, with concrete details which allow the easy identification of the figures), stylization (also figurative, but which accentuates certain details considered arbitrarily important, repeating and distorting them until they lose their real shapes), and [[abstract art|abstraction]] (representations completely unconnected with reality which are associated with a philosophical symbolism and which, although they may unconsciously contain some real elements, such a link is not possible to prove).

Even if one only takes the peninsular ambit into account, schematic art lacks uniformity, it spans quite a wide chronology and its geography is too wide, which makes its study difficult and makes it almost impossible to establish cultural phases or regions.

'''''Kenan &amp; Kel''''' is an American [[teen]] [[sitcom]] created by [[Kim Bass]] for [[Nickelodeon]]. It starred ''[[All That]]'' cast members [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A 'Honeymooners' For Kids|author=Hinman, Catherine|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-08-17/lifestyle/9608150907_1_kenan-and-kel-kenan-thompson-kel-mitchell|date=August 17, 1996|work=The Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 62 episodes and a [[Two Heads Are Better Than None|made-for-TV movie]] were produced over four seasons from 1996 to 2000. The first two seasons were filmed at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], and the remaining two were filmed at the [[Nickelodeon on Sunset|Nick on Sunset]] theater in [[Hollywood]].

''Kenan &amp; Kel'' received critical acclaim, with praise of the performance of the title characters. It won the "Favorite TV Show" award at the 1998 [[Kids Choice Awards]], and Thompson and Mitchell were ranked No. 40 and No. 39, respectively, on VH1's 100 Greatest Kid Stars. Reruns of the show are currently shown on TeenNick, as part of their programming block ''[[NickSplat]],'' as well as MTV2, a sister channel of TeenNick under Viacom.

==Premise==
The show was set in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and centered on the antics of two mischievous teenagers, Kenan Rockmore ([[Kenan Thompson]]) and Kel Kimble ([[Kel Mitchell]]). Kenan is a high school student with a job at a local grocery store, while Kel is his clumsy, [[orange soda]]-loving best friend.

Episodes of the series always open and closed with Kenan and Kel breaking the [[fourth wall]] by interacting with the studio audience, standing in front of a red curtain that is placed in front of the main set while they are still in character. A frequent running gag of the openings is Kel never knowing what the night's episode would be about and Kenan refusing to tell him. The closings would frequently feature Kenan coming up with a new scheme, often asking Kel to get various assorted items and meet him somewhere. Frazzled, Kel would exclaim his catchphrase, "Aww, here it goes!"

Another catchphrase commonly heard throughout the series is "WHYYYYYYY!?!?", usually screamed by Kenan after Kel does something stupid.

The theme song, entitled "Aw, Here It Goes", is performed by rapper [[Coolio]]. He is featured in the opening credits of the show along with Kenan and Kel. The lyrics describe the show and reference other famous duos such as [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], [[Abbott &amp; Costello]], [[Penn &amp; Teller]], and former [[Los Angeles Lakers]] teammates [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], as well as [[Nancy Drew]] and [[The Hardy Boys]].

==Production==
The series was created by Kim Bass (who also co-created the teen sitcom ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]''). It was reminiscent of the classic [[double act|comedic duo]] stylings of [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Martin and Lewis]] or Abbott and Costello (who were actually mentioned in the theme song), with Kenan being the straight man and Kel his comedic foil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenen, Kel Get a Show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-08-13/features/9608130309_1_smashing-pumpkins-nickelodeon-kenan-thompson|date=August 13, 1996|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was taped in front of a live-studio audience and ran from August 17, 1996&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0172OK1RI/|title=Kenan &amp; Kel Season 1|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to July 15, 2000&lt;ref name="amazon5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00MEYYLI2/|title=Kenan &amp; Kel Season 5|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, totaling 62 episodes. One full-length [[TV movie]] was created, entitled ''Two Heads Are Better Than None'', which aired on July 15, 2000, thus ending the series serving as its finale. The Kenan &amp; Kel characters also made a special guest appearance on the ''[[Cousin Skeeter]]'' two-part episode, "Hoo, I'm Wild Wild West".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0549853/|title="Cousin Skeeter" The Hoo, I'm Wild Wild West: Part 1 (TV Episode 1999)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
Reruns of the series briefly aired on ''[[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvschedulearchive.com/other/nick-gas/1999-030099.txt&lt;/ref&gt; After the series finished its run, reruns continued to air on Nickelodeon from January 21, 2001 to February 15, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvschedulearchive.com/nickelodeon/2004/020904.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

The series reran on [[TeenNick|The N]] (later known as TeenNick) from October 13, 2007, to August 2, 2009. It then returned to the channel from July 25, 2011, to February 3, 2013, and again from March 4, 2013, to May 31, 2014, as part of its ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'' programming block (later called [[The Splat]] and now called [[NickSplat]]), which continues to air sporadic reruns.

==History==
The Little Carib Theatre was formally opened in November 1948. The foundation stone was laid by [[Paul Robeson]], who at the time was visiting Trinidad, and whom the founder Beryl McBurnie had met in New York.&lt;ref name=Raymond&gt;Judy Raymond, [http://caribbean-beat.com/issue-20/beryl-mcburnie-first-lady-dance#axzz3tRDzalgO "Beryl McBurnie: the First Lady of Dance"], ''[[Caribbean Beat]]'', Issue 20 (July/August 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pearl Connor]], [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/29/guardianobituaries1 "Beryl McBurnie" (obituary)], ''The Guardian'' (London), 29 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, the work of the Little Carib Dance Company had been recognised and celebrated overseas, having performed at such events as the Caribbean Festival of Arts in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1952, the [[Jamaica]] Tercentenary Celebrations in 1955 and the opening of the Federal Parliament of [[Toronto]] in April 1958. In the 1960s the Little Carib building had to be closed down and was re-built in three years.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;

Many of the plays of [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Derek Walcott]] were first staged at the Little Carib Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/NGO-pays-tribute-to-Derek-Walcott-296153751.html "NGO pays tribute to Derek Walcott"], ''Sunday Express'' (Trinidad), 12 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Banham, Errol Hill, George Woodyard (eds), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qtlUwQAvKxoC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=little+carib+theatre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Tro34hcYjL&amp;sig=xiv2RJgIbkbK4y2vALmeHO_aE8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR1ejom6fdAhUHEVAKHUk9DnMQ6AEwJXoECC4QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20carib%20theatre&amp;f=false ''The Cambridge Guide to African and Caribbean Theatre''], Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; where he held weekly theatre workshops&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt; as founding director, from 1959 to 1971, of what became the [[Trinidad Theatre Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changeperformingarts.com/artists/walcott.html "Derek Walcott"], Change Performing Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadtheatreworkshop.com/#!history/chp0 "History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708173538/http://www.trinidadtheatreworkshop.com/ |date=2013-07-08 }}, Trinidad Theatre Workshop.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Čedomir "Ljubo" Čupić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Чедомир "Љубо" Чупић}}; 1913 – 9 May 1942) was a Yugoslav law student, political commissioner of Communist resistance movement in [[Nikšić]], [[Montenegro]] and a decorated war hero of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. He became famous for the photo of him taken moments before he was shot by [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] collaborators who captured him, showing him with shackles on his hands and smiling. He is a recipient of the [[Order of the People's Hero]], a Yugoslav gallantry medal. He is commonly referred to by media as "Montenegrin [[Che Guevara]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/osmijeh-ljuba-cupica-na-elektroskoli-88795|title=Osmijeh Ljuba Čupića na Elektroškoli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glas-javnosti.rs/aktuelne-vesti/2012-05-09/vijenci-na-grob-ljuba-cupica|title=Vijenci na grob Ljuba Čupića - Glas javnosti|website=www.glas-javnosti.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born in 1913 in the United States, being one of the ten children in an immigrant Montenegrin working-class family of father Sava and mother Stana (née Burić), from the village of Zagreda.

During the 1930s, he moved to Nikšić, where he finished high school. He studied law at the [[University of Belgrade]], and was a member of a progressive student movement, and joined the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1940.

After the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] he returned to Nikšić and participated in the preparation of the uprising. In July 1941, he fled from the Nazi-occupied city, and joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan]] division "Đuro Đaković", formed by communists and [[SKOJ]] members who also escaped from Nikšić.

As a commissioner of the Partisan movement in Nikšić, he was captured by [[Chetniks]] in April 1942, after a battle on [[Battle of Kablena Glavica|Kablena Glavica]] near Nikšić. He was tortured in prison and was subject to a public trial by the ''[[ad hoc]]'' court composed by the Chetniks. He was sentenced to death and executed by shooting squad following the illegal and biased trial. Before the public execution, he cheered his friends and the people who were forced to witness the event. Among his last word was the parole "Long live the glorious Communist Party."

== Legacy ==
He was posthumously declared a [[Order of the People's Hero|people's hero]] by the decree of the Yugoslav President [[Josip Broz Tito]] on 10 July 1953.

In memory of Ljubo Čupić, a street in Zagorič, a neighbourhood of [[Podgorica]], has been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leksikon-yu-mitologije.net/read.php?id=7114 Yugoslav lexicon - Ljubo Čupić] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717065651/http://www.leksikon-yu-mitologije.net/read.php?id=7114 |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lollybot Collective''' is a multimedia [[art collective]] founded in [[Detroit, MI]].&lt;ref&gt;The Arts - Do-It-Yourself: The Lollybot Collective&lt;{{cite web |url=http://thedetroiter.com/b2evoArt/blogs/index.php?blog=2&amp;c=1&amp;more=1&amp;pb=1&amp;tb=1&amp;title=do_it_yourself_the_lollybot_collective |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828131134/http://thedetroiter.com/b2evoArt/blogs/index.php?blog=2&amp;title=do_it_yourself_the_lollybot_collective&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The collective is made up of over fifty artists dedicated to positive change in a fun environment. Their gallery shows are well known for their laid back atmosphere, live shows and cheap beer. The collective is non-profit, all money is used to support the continuation of the artists' galleries and music. They do not take an independent commission from sold art pieces.

Interaction between the audience and the art is highly encouraged. In their first show about accidents, an artist Curt Greene created a balanced sculpture that would fall apart if touched. In their second show "Feedback" the walls of the gallery were lined with brown paper allowing the audience to write responses to the art on the wall. This notion was used again in their third show "Restrictions". Video has also been used as a way to interact with art, at "Restrictions" there was a camera placed outside the bathroom that fed into a TV placed in the bathroom so that the person inside could see the line outside the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;Alarm Press Magazine Spotlight &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alarmpress.com/7535/music-interview/diy-venue-spotlight-the-lollybot-collective/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215184232/http://www.alarmpress.com/7535/music-interview/diy-venue-spotlight-the-lollybot-collective/ |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective was founded in 2007 by college friends Matthew Pritchard and Jeff Nolan who were attending The [[College for Creative Studies]] in Detroit.

'''''Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies''''' was a periodical of the [[Warburg Institute]] that was published between 1941 and 1968. It was conceived as a companion to the ''[[Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes]]'', with each edition including a number of short specialist studies of an aspect of Medieval or Renaissance thought.

==Publication history==
The first edition was edited by [[Richard William Hunt|Richard Hunt]] of the [[University of Liverpool]] and [[Raymond Klibansky]] of [[Oriel College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;"Announcement", ''Speculum'', Vol. 14, No. 4 (Oct., 1939), p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; Production was hindered by war-time conditions. The first issue had been almost completely set in type at the St Catherine's Press in [[Bruges]] when the Germans invaded Belgium, meaning that printing had to be moved to England. &lt;ref&gt;"Review: ''Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies''", [[Gray C. Boyce]], ''[[The American Historical Review]]'', Vol. 47, No. 2 (Jan., 1942), p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Review ''Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies''. Volume I, Number 1", R. Weiss, ''[[The Modern Language Review]]'', Vol. 36, No. 4 (Oct., 1941), pp. 520-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

After it had been published for several years, ''Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies'' changed from a periodical to a serial.&lt;ref&gt;"Review ''Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies''", [[Wayne S. Vucinich]], ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', Vol. 37, No. 2 (Apr., 1962), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased publication completely in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;British Library. 7 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indexes of contributors were published in the ''[[Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes]]''.

The '''Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum''' is a permanent exhibition of 27 carved [[Pictish stone]]s in the centre of the village of [[Meigle]] in eastern [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Ritchie 1997, p.2"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; It lies on the [[A94 road]] running from [[Coupar Angus]] to [[Forfar]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1997, inside front cover.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum occupies the former parish school, built 1844.&lt;ref name="R89p58"&gt;Ritchie 1989, 1993, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of stones implies that an important church was located nearby, or perhaps a monastery.&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt; There is an early historical record of the work of Thana, son of Dudabrach, who was at Meigle (recorded as ''Migdele'') in the middle of the 9th century during the reign of [[Uurad|King Pherath]].&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R97p6"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Thana was likely to have been a monk serving as a scribe in a local monastery that could have been founded in the 8th century.&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R97p6"/&gt; The stones contained in the museum were all found near Meigle, mostly in the neighbouring churchyard or used in the construction of the old church.&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R97p9"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The present church building dates to about 1870,&lt;ref name=HScot /&gt; the previous building having been destroyed in a fire on 28 March 1869.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt; The stones are Christian monuments to the dead of the [[Pict]]ish warrior aristocracy, who are depicted on the stones bearing their weapons or hunting.&lt;ref name="Ritchie 1997, p.2"/&gt;

==The museum==
The museum building was originally the village schoolhouse.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt; The building was purchased by the local [[laird]] Sir George Kinloch towards the end of the 19th century in order to protect the symbol stones.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt; In 1936 the museum passed into the ownership of the State, it was renovated after the [[Second World War]] and reopened to the public in 1949.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt;

==The stones==
[[File:Meigle 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Meigle 2, depicting Daniel in the lions' den and interpreted in local folklore as Vanora, wife of King Arthur, being fed to wild beasts in punishment for her enforced infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1997, pp.9-10, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
About one third of the stones in the museum are Class II in nature (stones with symbols carved in relief and usually bearing a Christian cross).&lt;ref&gt;Feachem 1977, 1992, pp.192, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stones date to the 9th or 10th century AD and were intended as tombstones.&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt; The stones are carved from the local [[sandstone]], which is suitable for fine sculpture.&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt; Some stylistic elements of the stones show the influence of [[Northumbria]].&lt;ref name="R97p8"/&gt; The Pictish stones at Meigle have a distinct local style that includes an emphasis on aggressive biting beasts, the decorating of crosses with a diagonal key pattern and the usage of rounded heads on cross-slabs.&lt;ref name="R97p14"/&gt;

The sandstone used to sculpt the monuments is [[old red sandstone]], a relatively soft stone that lends itself to detailed carving but is susceptible to erosion.&lt;ref name="R97p14"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments are likely to have been worked with iron tools such as chisels, punches and hammers, together with hammerstones and wooden mallets.&lt;ref name="R97p14"/&gt; The sculpted designs may have been copied from painted [[vellum]] pattern books.&lt;ref name="R97p14"/&gt;

According to the local records, eight stones were lost before the close of the 19th century, including Meigle 10.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt; Some of the surviving stones are parts of larger monuments and it is probable that other fragments are buried in Meigle churchyard or have been used in the construction of walls.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt; Before being moved into the museum, Meigle 1 and Meigle 2 stood on either side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, in front of a grass-covered mound called Vanora's Grave.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt; Some of the stones appear to have been trimmed and placed near the Grave in the 16th and 17th centuries in order to decorate it.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meigle 1''' is a cross-slab.&lt;ref name="R97p12"/&gt; The stone was originally used as a [[standing stone]] two millennia before it was sculpted by the Picts, it has [[cup and ring mark]]s low down on the back of the stone.&lt;ref name="R97p15"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is [[Greece|Greek]] in style, with full circles at each of the four andles between the shaft and the arms.&lt;ref name="R97p15"/&gt; The inside of the cross is decorated with interlace patterns, the cross-point being decorated with spirals.&lt;ref name="R97p15"/&gt; The cross shaft itself is flanked by images of mythical beasts.&lt;ref name="R97p15"/&gt; It has an uncoordinated jumble of symbols arranged around a hunting scene on the other side.&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt; Among these are images of a winged figure that perhaps represents a [[Persia]]n deity and of a kneeling camel, as well as a Pictish Beast, salmon, a serpent and Z-rod, a mirror, a comb, a dog's head, animals and horsemen.&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R97p15"/&gt; This stone originally stood on the west side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 2.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt; Meigle 1 may be the oldest stone at Meigle, possibly carved in the late 8th century.&lt;ref name="R97p12"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meigle 2''' stands nearly {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="R97p16"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a cross on one side and depicts [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lions' den on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1989, 1993, pp.37, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the head of the cross is possibly based on that of a [[Crux gemmata|jewelled metal cross]] and is unique.&lt;ref name="R89p56"&gt;Ritchie 1989, 1993, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; The projecting boss at the centre of the cross has eight smaller bosses around it that probably symbolise the eight days of [[Passion Week]] running from [[Palm Sunday]] to [[Easter Sunday]] inclusive.&lt;ref name="R97p16"/&gt; The shaft of the cross contains three pairs of sculpted animals facing each other, with interlaced tails and tongues, while other beasts fill the space between the cross and the outer border of the monument.&lt;ref name="R97p16"/&gt; The monument is the work of a master sculptor with the figures being cut in deep relief and arranged in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref name="R89p56"/&gt; Meigle 2 has projecting tenons on its top and sides and was probably intended to slot into a screen or wall.&lt;ref name="R89p58"/&gt; Local folklore holds that the representation of Daniel in the lions' den depicts [[King Arthur]]'s wife [[Guinevere]], known locally as [[Vanora]].&lt;ref name="HScot"/&gt; She was abducted by King [[Mordred]] and condemned by Arthur to be torn apart by wild beasts.&lt;ref name="HScot"/&gt; The monument was said to mark her grave.&lt;ref name="HScot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertyabout.htm?PropID=PL_209&amp;PropName=Meigle%20Sculptured%20Stone%20Museum |title=Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meigle 2 was originally located on the east side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 1, and in front of a mound identified in local folklore as Vanora's Grave.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt; Apart from the scene representing Daniel, the back of the monument also contains various other sections.&lt;ref name="R97p16"/&gt; These include a mounted huntsman with two hounds at the top, with an angel hovering above the dogs.&lt;ref name="R97p16"/&gt; Below this there is a procession of four horsemen, with three leading the fourth, who is distinguished by a large saddlecloth.&lt;ref name="R97p16"/&gt; The next row down is the Biblical Daniel scene, below this is a [[centaur]] holding an axe in each hand and branches trailing behind him.&lt;ref name="R97p16"/&gt; The lowest section depicts a beast grasping an ox, a club-wielding human figure is positioned behind the aggressor.&lt;ref name="R97p16"/&gt; The stone has lost some detail due to erosion,&lt;ref name="R89p56"/&gt; although this is concentrated at the lower part of the cross itself and suggests that some form of human activity regularly caused abrasion of that portion - the opposite side being less worn.&lt;ref name="R97p16"/&gt;

[[File:Meigle 5.jpg|thumb|right|Meigle 5, the base of the cross has the unusual embellishment of two upward-curving animal heads.&lt;ref name="R89p61"&gt;Ritchie 1989, 1993, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Meigle 3''' dates to the 9th century AD.&lt;ref name="R89p44"&gt;Ritchie 1989, 1993, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; One side has a cross, with a part of a Pictish double-disc symbol to the left, below the arm.&lt;ref name="R97p18"/&gt; On the other is inscribed a mounted warrior wearing a sword below his cape, the scabbard tipped with a [[chape]].&lt;ref name="R89p44"/&gt; The warrior is seated on a striped saddle cloth and carries a spear in his right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1989, 1993, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; Meigle 3 is a low gravestone and the warrior may be a portrait of the deceased person.&lt;ref name="R97p18"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone was cut shorter at least twice in antiquity, its original height may have been {{convert|0.6|m|in}}.&lt;ref name="R97p18"/&gt;

'''Meigle 4''' is a fragmented cross-slab with the central portion missing, the surviving fragments are masterpieces of sculpture.&lt;ref name="R89p61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R97p19"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals are carved on either side of the top of the cross, with their heads curving up to bite two animals forming the frame of the design.&lt;ref name="R89p61"/&gt; There is an animal below the left arm of the cross with elaborate entwined tail and horns.&lt;ref name="R97p19"/&gt; Opposite this, below the right arm of the cross, is the upper portion of a person struggling against an animal.&lt;ref name="R97p19"/&gt; The inside of the cross is filled with interlace patterns.&lt;ref name="R97p19"/&gt; The reverse of the monument has tightly packed figures and symbols. A mounted horseman occupies the top of the stone, with  two interlaced serpents behind.&lt;ref name="R97p19"/&gt; Under the horse's hooves is another entwined serpent, a Pictish Beast and another animal, with another horseman behind.&lt;ref name="R97p19"/&gt; A crescent with V rod symbol occupies the lowest portion of the stone.&lt;ref name="R97p19"/&gt;

'''Meigle 5''' has a cross carved in high relief on one side.&lt;ref name="R97p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R89p61"/&gt; The base of this Greek-style cross sports the unusual decoration of two animal heads.&lt;ref name="R89p61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R97p20"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each quarter of the background contains a single beast.&lt;ref name="R97p20"/&gt; Meigle 5 is a small monument and was carved as an upright headstone for a grave.&lt;ref name="R97p12"/&gt; The back of the stone depicts a lone horseman with a decorated saddle-cloth.&lt;ref name="R97p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R97p20"/&gt; On one edge of the monument are inscribed two symbols; the so-called [[Pictish Beast]] and a mirror.&lt;ref name="R97p12"/&gt;

'''Meigle 6''' is the central fragment of a cross-slab.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt; The surviving shaft of the cross is decorated with a diagonal key pattern.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt; The back of the stone has,from top to bottom, a horse and rider, a double disc symbol, a crescent and a dog wearing a collar.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt;

[[File:Meigle 7 back.jpg|thumb|left|The back of Meigle 7 showing Z-rod and discs.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt;]]
'''Meigle 7''' is the top portion of a rounded cross-slab.&lt;ref name="R97p21"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is decorated with a diagonal key pattern.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt; The back of the monument has a double disc and Z-rod and a comb.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt;

'''Meigle 8''' is a small fragment measuring {{convert|0.22|m|in}} across.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt; It has an eroded cross on one side and the upper portion of two animals on the reverse, facing each other with forelegs in the opposing beast's mouth.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt; A symbol above them may represent a tool.&lt;ref name="R97p21"/&gt;

'''Meigle 9''' is a recumbent tombstone.&lt;ref name="R97p22"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a shallow slot in the top and sculpted panels on both long sides.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt; One of the panels depicts a [[griffin]], an interlace pattern, an elongated animal wrapped into a knot and two animals facing each other.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt; The other panel is composed of an animal, a sitting person with his limbs entwined with the legs of a bird, another animal, some spiral patterns and a final section that is badly eroded.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt;

'''Meigle 10''' is now lost.&lt;ref name="R97p8"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a carved rectangular panel depicting a horse pulling a carriage bearing a driver and two passengers, the monument also showed a crouching archer and several beasts.&lt;ref name="R97p8"/&gt; The sculpture probably formed a part of a low church screen, possibly separating the [[chancel]] and the [[nave]].&lt;ref name="R97p8"/&gt; The stone had been moved inside the old church for protection and was destroyed in the fire of 1869.&lt;ref name="R97p9"/&gt;

[[File:Meigle 26 side panel pt1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Detail of one side of Meigle 26.]]
'''Meigle 11''' is another recumbent monument and is the largest of the recumbent stones from Meigle.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt; The long sides of the stone have deeply recessed panels with wide borders that once were decorated but are badly worn.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt; The top of the monument is undecorated and has a wide slot at one end.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt; One side of the stone has the sculpted images of three mounted riders accompanied by a dog, behind them is a humanoid figure with an animal's head and gripping two entwined serpents.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt; The other side of the monument is decorated with two intertwined animals followed by a dog and a bear, one above the other, and an unidentified object.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt; To the right of these is a panel of twelve bosses encircled by serpents.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt; At the extreme right is a wheel of seven bosses set within a frame formed of two upright animals with entwined tails and gripping the extremities of a human figure in their mouths.&lt;ref name="R97p22"/&gt;

[[File:Meigle 3.jpg|thumb|left|Meigle 3, showing a Pictish horseman and details of his costume and weapons.&lt;ref name="R89p44"/&gt;]]
'''Meigle 12''' is one of the last monuments from Meigle.&lt;ref name="R97p13"/&gt; It is a recumbent gravestone sculpted with a lozenge pattern along the upper surface and with a fish monster and an animal on one side.&lt;ref name="R97p13"/&gt; The other side has a dog biting the leg of a deer and two bulls charging each other.&lt;ref name="R97p23"/&gt; Both ends of the monument are damaged.&lt;ref name="R97p23"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meigle 13''' was a piece of a broken cross-slab, now lost.&lt;ref name="R97p23"/&gt;

'''Meigle 14''' is a fragment of a cross-slab.&lt;ref name="R97p24"&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Another fragment of the same monument was built into the old church and was destroyed in the fire.&lt;ref name="R97p24"/&gt; The surviving fragment of cross is filled with interlace and a diagonal key pattern.&lt;ref name="R97p24"/&gt; The reverse side shows a robed cleric carrying a book and a part of a second similar figure, the lost section had the rest of this second figure and a third figure almost identical to the first, facing in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="R97p24"/&gt;

'''Meigle 15''' is a fragment from the shaft of a small cross-slab.&lt;ref name="R97p24"/&gt; The shaft of the cross is filled with an interlace pattern, on the left are two fighting beasts, on the right side is another animal biting its own back.&lt;ref name="R97p24"/&gt;

'''Meigle 16''' through to '''Meigle 19''' were all fragments of cross-slabs and are now lost.&lt;ref name="R97p24"/&gt;

'''Meigle 20''' is a fragment from the centre of a cross-slab.&lt;ref name="R97p24"/&gt; The shaft is filled with interlace and the fragment also has the carved image of a rider.&lt;ref name="R97p24"/&gt;

[[File:KarlII monks.jpg|thumb|[[Charles the Bald]] receives the [[First Bible of Charles the Bald|Vivian Bible]] from the monks of [[Tours]] in 845 (fol. 423)]]

A '''presentation miniature''' or '''dedication miniature''' is a [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] painting often found in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, in which the [[Donor portrait|patron or donor]] is presented with a book, normally to be interpreted as the book containing the miniature itself.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Brown, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  The miniature is thus symbolic, and presumably represents an event in the future.  Usually it is found at the start of the volume, as a [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] before the main text, but may also be placed at the end, as in the [[Vivian Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 116&lt;/ref&gt; or at the start of a particular text in a collection.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier manuscripts the recipient of the book may be a dead saint, the founder of a monastery or monastic order, for example, and the person handing over the book the abbot, or sometimes the scribe of the book.  The genre is an extension of other forms of dedication portraits, for example wall-paintings or mosaics in churches showing the person who commissioned the church holding a model of it. Ultimately they stretch back to scenes where classical rulers receive tribute, or those where a procession of Early Christian martyrs carry their crowns to present Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 83&lt;/ref&gt; The miniatures are often found in luxury books presented to the emperor or another major figure, which usually followed significant donations of land to the monastery concerned.

In the early period the manuscripts concerned are normally religious books, especially liturgical ones. The texts are old, and the "offering" represented is the creation of an expensive illuminated manuscript. In the late [[Middle Ages]] works,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 102, places this revival in the 15th century, but 14th century examples are numerous, as [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah7FgcSdn9IC&amp;pg=PA251 Cynthia Stone points out]. Two are illustrated here.&lt;/ref&gt; often secular ones, are generally presented by their author or translator, though lavish copies of older texts may also still receive presentation miniatures.  In these first cases the "offering" is usually the text itself, and the patron had presumably often paid for his own luxury copy himself, though some translators and even authors were also scribes.  Now the text dedication to the patron, at this period often long and flowery, came to form part of the work itself, and at least the text was repeated in further copies.  Such author's dedications, now far shorter, have remained part of the printed book. Sometimes presentation miniatures were also repeated in subsequent copies.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Brown, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michelle P. Brown|Michelle Brown]] distinguishes between presentation miniatures, where the actual book containing the miniature passed between the parties shown, and dedication miniatures in subsequent copies made for other people.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Brown, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early medieval==
[[File:Beauvais+Vignay.jpg|thumb|Two royal visits to respectively the author and translator of [[Vincent de Beauvais]]'s work translated in French by [[Jean de Vignay]] as ''Le Miroir historial'', c. 1333]]
Royal presentation miniatures are especially a feature of Late [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]], providing a series of portraits of the [[Ottonian emperor]]s, mostly not actually shown with the book, and a precedent for later rulers.  In a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain miniatures depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 116–118&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the [[Hornbach Sacramentary]] the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St [[Pirmin]], founder of [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the "command structure" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solothurn]] Zentralbibliothek Codex U1 (ex-Cathedral Treasury), folios 7v to 10r; Alexander, 89–90; Legner, Vol 2, B2, all eight pages illustrated on pp. 140–141; Dodwell, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Egbert Psalter]] also has four pages of presentation scenes, with two each spread across a full opening, the left with a bowing offeror in near profile, the right with the enthroned receiver. [[Egbert (archbishop of Trier)|Egbert, Archbishop of Trier]] receives the book in the first pair, then presents it to [[Saint Peter]] in the second.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Thomas. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/767279 "Art and Artifice in Ottonian Trier."] ''Gesta'', Vol. 36, No. 1. (1997), pp 65–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large proportion of the portraits that survive of monastic scribes, who may also have been the artists for the miniatures, come from presentation miniatures, more typically showing presentations to either saints or other clergy who had commissioned books.  Such scenes continue to appear in the Romanesque period.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 89–93&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving portrait of a reigning English king (coins excepted) and the earliest English presentation miniature shows [[Æthelstan]] presenting Saint [[Cuthbert]] with the copy of Bede's ''Life of Saint Cuthbert'' containing it, probably in 934.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 170; {{cite web|title=History by the Month: September and the Coronation of Æthelstan’|date=8 September 2015|publisher=Parker Library, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|url= https://theparkerlibrary.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/history-by-the-month-september-and-the-coronation-of-aethelstan/|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was presented by Æthelstan to the saint's shrine in [[Chester-le-Street]]; southern-based medieval English kings were always careful to pay due respect to Cuthbert, the great saint of the North.&lt;ref name="Foot 2011 155 156"&gt;Foot, ''Æthelstan: The First King of England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

In the High Middle Ages presentation miniatures in luxury copies of the main liturgical and devotional books, showing the book being presented, tended to be replaced by miniatures of the owner or donor at prayer, sometimes using a book which can be taken as the volume containing the miniature. These often include the object of the prayer, Christ, the Virgin Mary, or a saint.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 180–181, 194–196, 227–229, 321–323, 371–373&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the owner is shown being "presented" to Christ or the Virgin by his [[patron saint]], as though at court, but these are not generally called "presentation miniatures".

The form did not die out, however. The earliest surviving copy of the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' was presented by the monks of [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis]], who had compiled the text, to [[Philip III of France|Philip III]] in about 1274, with two presentation scenes, though neither act as frontispieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman, 11–17; figs. 3 and 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late medieval==
[[File:MMW 10B23 002R MINMJean de Vaudetar.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean de Vaudetar, [[valet de chambre]] to King [[Charles V of France]], presents the king with his gift of a ''[[Bible Historiale]]'' in 1372.

As book culture increased in the Late Middle Ages, authors still relied on gifts from patrons to reward their efforts, and it is in this context that the dedication miniature revived. Very often the miniature was in the personal copy made by the patron for his library. The author or translator kneels, holding out his book, and the patron is often surrounded by a group of courtiers, advertising his generosity in encouraging literature.  The public and ceremonial presentation of gifts from, but mostly to, the monarch or lord was a great feature of medieval court life, concentrated on the New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Stratford, 126–133&lt;/ref&gt;  A high proportion of the surviving portraits of late medieval scholars and artists, and a significant proportion of those of the patrons, come from these miniatures, many of which show individualized features and were probably by artists who had had good opportunity to observe their subjects.

The French royal family, including their Burgundian cousins, led the fashion, which spread to England and elsewhere.  Extensively illuminated books were also presented to royalty as diplomatic gifts, or by ambitious courtiers to the monarch, and these might include presentation miniatures.  Sometimes the presentation miniature might be the only one in a book; such was the case with [[Louis de Gruuthuse]]'s copy of [[Boccaccio]]s ''De mulieribus claris'' translated into French ([[BnF]], Ms Fr. 133, f 2r).&lt;ref&gt;Lie, 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Charles V of France]] (r. 1338–1380), one of the first great [[bibliophile]] medieval monarchs, had a large library and especially encouraged and commissioned translations of books into French, which were very often given a presentation miniature.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 143&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to be shown in dedication miniatures a century after his death.  Louis de Gruuthuse's copy of about 1470 of the "[[Pseudo-Seneca]]"'s ''De remediis fortuitorum'' translated into French for Charles V has a miniature showing the king receiving the text, but with de Gruuthuse standing to the side (BnF, Ms. fr. 1090, fol. 1).&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 246–247&lt;/ref&gt;  The copy made about 1475 for [[Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy]] had a different image.  This is a double presentation where firstly [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] himself hands the text to the translator, who bends a knee to receive it, and then down a passageway in the background the translator kneels to present it to two male figures.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;

As here, dedication miniatures for old texts sometimes go well back in history, sometimes giving historic figures the features of contemporary ones. [[Guillebert de Lannoy]] (1386–1462), a leading Burgundian nobleman, diplomat and traveller, wrote around 1440 ''L'Instruction de josne prince'' ("Advice for a Young Prince"), which he dressed up with a fictional origin in the court of [[Norway]] "long, long ago", followed by a rediscovery of the manuscript text.  The dedication miniature in [[Charles the Bold]]'s copy illustrates the Norwegian story, but using up-to-date Burgundian costume and, it seems, the faces of the ducal family.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 235–237&lt;/ref&gt;  Another variation was to show the patron visiting the author, or even the illuminator, as they worked, an indication in the rise in status of those producing manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The form survived the arrival of printed books, though they became much rarer. When [[Edward IV of England]]'s brother in law, [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers]] had [[William Caxton]] print his own translation of the ''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers]]'' in 1477, the book he presented to Edward was a special manuscript copied from the printed edition, with a presentation miniature, implying "that a printed book might not yet have been regarded as sufficiently distinguished for a formal gift of this kind".&lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, 269&lt;/ref&gt;  Some printed books continued the form in [[woodcut]], with printers such as [[Antoine Vérard]] in Paris joining the types of presenters depicted.

'''Pura Vida Bracelets''' is a [[La Jolla, California]]-based company that sells hand-crafted bracelets online and through boutique stores. It was founded in 2010 by Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman, who discovered the bracelets while on a vacation in [[Costa Rica]]. After a number of celebrities were spotted wearing the product, interest increased, and the company has since sold over 2 million bracelets. Pura Vida partners with a number of charities, producing bracelets in those charities' colors and donating a portion of those bracelets' sale prices back towards the partner charities.

'''Roseanne Cherrie Barr''' (born November 3, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, writer, and television producer. Barr began her career in [[stand-up comedy]] at clubs before gaining critical and popular acclaim in the television sitcom ''[[Roseanne]]'' (1988–1997; 2018). She won both an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actress for her work on the show.

Barr was born into a Jewish family living in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. She became a standup comedian in 1980. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she began to emerge as a celebrity through her role in ''[[Roseanne]]'' and other public performances. Barr sparked controversy when performing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at a nationally aired baseball game on July 25, 1990. After singing the anthem in what many perceived to be a deliberately disrespectful manner, Barr grabbed her crotch and spat. This performance was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, and was called "disgraceful" by then-President [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=Anthem&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/07/23/roseanne-on-the-day-she-shrieked-the-star-spangled-banner-grabbed-her-crotch-and-earned-a-rebuke-from-president-bush/ |title= Roseanne on the day she shrieked ‘The Star-Spangled Banner,’ grabbed her crotch and earned a rebuke from President Bush |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr has been active and outspoken on political issues. She won nearly 70,000 votes for president in the general election of 2012, as the presidential nominee of the [[Peace and Freedom Party]].&lt;ref name="FEC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2012/2012pres.pdf|title=2012 Presidential Popular Vote Summary for All Candidates Listed on at least one State Ballot|accessdate=November 6, 2016|author=Federal Election Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Donald Trump]] announced his candidacy for president in 2015, Kelly Weill of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote that Barr "veered right" in her politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/roseanne-keeps-promoting-qanon-the-pro-trump-conspiracy-theory-that-makes-pizzagate-look-tame|title=Roseanne Roseanne Keeps Promoting QAnon, the Pro-Trump Conspiracy Theory That Makes Pizzagate Look Tame|first=Kelly|last=Weill|date=March 30, 2018|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Roseanne'' was revived, Trump called her to congratulate her on her show's ratings and thank her for her support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/donald-trump-roseanne-call-ratings|title=Donald Trump Called Roseanne to Congratulate Her on His Favorite Thing: Huge TV Ratings|first=Yohana|last=Desta|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has frequently defended her support of Trump, and has been criticized for her extensive use of personal attacks, [[conspiracy theories]], and [[fake news]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/everything-that-led-to-abcs-roseanne-cancellation-2018-5|title=Every controversial step that led toward ABC's 'Roseanne' cancellation — from Pizzagate to Parkland to the final racist last straw|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Please see [[Talk:Roseanne Barr|the talk page]] discussion before revising this specific section of the lede in regards to the racist tweet.--&gt;
''Roseanne'' was revived in 2018 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  A ratings success, the revival was initially renewed for an additional season, but was then abruptly canceled on May 29, due to Barr making a controversial [[Twitter|tweet]], which many called "racist" and she later called a "bad joke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC drops Roseanne show after racist tweet|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44294632|work=BBC News|date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Roseanne Barr was born on November 3, 1952, in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], to a Jewish family. She is the oldest of four children born to Helen (née Davis), a [[bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] and cashier, and Jerome Hershel "Jerry" Barr,&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogymagazine.com/roseannebarr.html|title=The Family Tree of Roseanne Barr|publisher=Genealogy Magazine|date=March 16, 2006|accessdate=February 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203113806/http://genealogymagazine.com/roseannebarr.html|archivedate=February 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked as a salesman.&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt; Her father's family were Jewish emigrants from Russia, and her maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt; Her paternal grandfather changed his surname from "Borisofsky" to "Barr" upon entering the United States.&lt;ref name="jjournal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tugend|first=Tom|url=http://jewishjournal.com/news/los_angeles/la_woman/12864/|title=Roseanne Shares Secrets and Jibes |work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|publisher=TRIBE Media Corp|date=March 23, 2006|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmZkhoNq?url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/la_woman/article/roseanne_shares_secrets_and_jibes_20060324/|dead-url=no|archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her Jewish upbringing was influenced by her devoutly [[Orthodox Jew]]ish maternal grandmother.&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt; Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in [[Latter-day Saints|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt; Barr has stated, "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roseanne: My Life as a Woman |last=Barr |first=Roseanne |year=1989 |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Row]] |isbn=978-0-06-015957-3 |pages=51–53 |url=http://www.ldsfilm.com/actors/Roseanne.html |accessdate=February 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmZowEhp?url=http://www.ldsfilm.com/actors/Roseanne.html|dead-url=no |archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Barr was three years old, she got [[Bell's palsy]] on the left side of her face. Barr said, "[so] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later, Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came "exactly at the right time".&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt;

At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and was elected president of a Mormon youth group.&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt;

At 16, Barr was hit by a car; the incident left her with a traumatic brain injury.&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt; Her behavior changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at [[Utah State Hospital]].&lt;ref name="PhiladelphiaDailyNews"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Gallagher|first=Maria|journal=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|title=Thin Roseanne?

In 1970, when Barr was 18 years old, she moved out by informing her parents she was going to visit a friend in Colorado for two weeks, but never returned.&lt;ref name="PhiladelphiaDailyNews"/&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up comedian: 1980–1986===
While in Colorado, Barr did stand-up gigs in clubs in Denver and other Colorado towns. She later tried out at [[The Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles and went on to appear on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name="PhiladelphiaDailyNews"/&gt;

In 1986, she performed on a [[Rodney Dangerfield]] special and on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the following year had her own [[HBO]] special called ''The Roseanne Barr Show'', which earned her an [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy Award]] for the funniest female performer in a television special.&lt;ref name="SanFranciscoChronicle1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dykstra|first=Carol|journal=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|title=Domestic Goddess Rules Her Own Show – Comedian Roseanne Barr turns housework into hilarity |date=October 16, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr was offered the role of Peg Bundy in ''[[Married... with Children]]'' but turned it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelley|first=Bill|work=Sun-Sentinel|title=`Roseanne` A Quirky But Funny Sitcom|date=October 18, 1988|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-10-18/features/8803010607_1_roseanne-barr-paycheck-sitcom|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her routine she popularized the phrase, "domestic goddess", to refer to a homemaker or housewife. The success of her act led to her own series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], called ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''.

===''Roseanne'' sitcom, film, books, and talk show: 1987–2004===
{{Main|Roseanne}}
In 1987, ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' executive producers [[Carsey-Werner Productions|Marcy Carsey]] and [[Tom Werner]] wanted to bring a "no-perks family comedy" to television. They hired ''Cosby'' writer [[Matt Williams (producer)|Matt Williams]] to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play [[Roseanne Conner]].&lt;ref name="EW2008pg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html|title=A 'Roseanne' Family Reunion – The behind-the-scenes truth about Roseanne Barr's groundbreaking sitcom|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|page=1|date=October 24, 2008|accessdate=February 17, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmZxURct?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html|archivedate=April 8, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered on October 18, 1988, and was watched by 21.4&amp;nbsp;million households, making it the highest-rated debut of that season.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368_2,00.html|title=A 'Roseanne' Family Reunion – The behind-the-scenes truth about Roseanne Barr's groundbreaking sitcom|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|page=2|date=October 24, 2008|accessdate=February 17, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xma2UUNa?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368_2,00.html|archivedate=April 8, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr became outraged when she watched the first episode of ''Roseanne'' and noticed that in the credits, Williams was listed as creator.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"/&gt; She told Tanner Stransky of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing".&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"/&gt; In the same interview, Werner said, "I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is something legislated by the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]], and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters."&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"/&gt;

During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"/&gt; Barr gave [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] and [[Joss Whedon]] their first writing jobs on ''Roseanne''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/25/entertainment/la-et-st-bunheads-sherman-palladino-20130225|title=Amy Sherman-Palladino Hopes 'Bunheads' Gets a Callback|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;

''Roseanne'' ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997. Barr won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Golden Globe]], a [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids Choice Award]], and three [[American Comedy Awards]] for her part in the show. Barr had crafted a "fierce working-class domestic goddess" persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother "who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism".&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;Barr, R. (May 15, 2011) [http://nymag.com/print/?/arts/tv/upfronts/2011/roseanne-barr-2011-5/ "And I Should Know"] ''New York Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

For the final two seasons, Barr earned $40 million, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business at the time, after [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/1820/|last=Plotz|first=David|title=Domestic Goddess Dethroned|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=May 18, 1997|accessdate=April 7, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmazWlus?url=http://www.slate.com/id/1820/|archivedate=April 8, 2011|deadurl=no|quote=She's earned $40 million in the last two years, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business, after [[Oprah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roseanne Barr at the 1992 Emmy Awards-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Barr attending the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards|1992 Emmy Awards]]]]

[[Barbara Ehrenreich]] called Barr a working-class spokesperson representing "the hopeless underclass of the female sex: polyester-clad, overweight occupants of the slow track; fast-food waitresses, factory workers, housewives, members of the invisible pink-collar army; the despised, the jilted, the underpaid",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|date=April 2, 1990|title=The Undainty Feminism of Roseanne Barr|work=[[The New Republic]]|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a master of "the kind of class-militant populism that the Democrats, most of them anyway, never seem to get right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taranto |first=James |date=August 1, 1990 |url=http://home.roadrunner.com/~taranto/roseanne.htm |title=Roseanne Barr: From Deification to Disgust |work=[[New York Tribune]] |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61yRWgp5w?url=http://home.roadrunner.com/~taranto/roseanne.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barr refuses to use the term "blue collar" because it masks the issue of class.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R.

During ''Roseanne''{{'}}s final season, Barr was in negotiations between [[Carsey-Werner Productions]] and ABC executives to continue playing [[Roseanne Conner]] in a spin-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DE123DF937A35757C0A961958260 |title=Roseanne to Continue on TV But Is Expected to Leave ABC |last=Carter |first=Bill |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=April 4, 1997 |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmbmB6OA?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DE123DF937A35757C0A961958260 |archivedate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After failed discussions with ABC as well as [[CBS]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], Carsey-Werner and Barr agreed not to continue the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1D8143CF93AA35757C0A961958260 |title=A Rest for Roseanne |last=Carter |first=Bill |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=April 9, 1997 |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmbrEUsq?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1D8143CF93AA35757C0A961958260 |archivedate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She released her autobiography in 1989, titled ''Roseanne—My Life As a Woman''.&lt;ref name="Biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/roseanne-barr-9463817|title=Roseanne Biography (1952–)|publisher=[[Biography.com]]|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she made her film debut in ''[[She-Devil]]'', playing a scorned housewife, Ruth. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave her a positive review saying, "Barr could have made an easy, predictable and dumb comedy at any point in the last couple of years. Instead, she took her chances with an ambitious project – a real movie.

On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' where Barr admitted the word "incest" could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the "darkest time" in her life.&lt;ref name="Oprah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/celebrities/2011/02/14/17276856-wenn-story.html|title=Barr: 'I was wrong about incest revelations'|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|publisher=[[Sun Media]]|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=February 18, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmdC04aS?url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/celebrities/2011/02/14/17276856-wenn-story.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told [[Oprah Winfrey]], "I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs&amp;nbsp;... to deal with the fact that I had some mental illness&amp;nbsp;... I totally lost touch with reality&amp;nbsp;... (and) I didn't know what the truth was&amp;nbsp;... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family".&lt;ref name="Oprah"/&gt; She added that not everything was "made up", saying, "Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification".&lt;ref name="Oprah"/&gt; Geraldine said they did not speak for twelve years, but had reconciled.&lt;ref name="Oprah"/&gt;

Barr filed for divorce from Tom Arnold on April 18, 1994 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, citing [[irreconcilable differences]].&lt;ref name="LADaily1994"/&gt; Their efforts to have children were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="HamiltonSpectator"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Roseanne weds again amidst tight security|journal=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|publisher=[[Torstar Corporation]]|date=February 15, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===National anthem===
On July 25, 1990, Barr performed "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" [[off-key]] before a baseball game between the [[San Diego Padres]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] at [[Jack Murphy Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roseanne-barr-fergie-national-anthem_us_5a8b1014e4b05c2bcace097f |title=Roseanne Jokes Her National Anthem Was ‘Better’ Than Fergie’s |first=Curtis M. |last=Wong |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com |date=February 19, 2018 |accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later said she was singing as loudly as possible to hear herself over the public-address system, so her rendition of the song sounded "screechy". Following her rendition, she mimicked the often-seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. Barr later said that the Padres had suggested she "bring humor to the song", but many criticized the episode, including [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W.

On September 19, she appeared at the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests and spoke in support of the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/19/wall-street-protesters-angry|title=Wall Street protesters: over-educated, under-employed and angry|last= McVeigh |first=Karen|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=September 19, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61yST65o6?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/19/wall-street-protesters-angry|archivedate=September 26, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; "She stated any 'guilty' Wall Street bankers should be forced to give up any income over $100 million, and if they are unable to live on that, be sent to re-education camps, and if that doesn't help be [[Decapitation|beheaded]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roseanne Barr: 'Guilty' Wall Street Bankers Should Be Sent to Reeducation Camps or Beheaded|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/10/03/roseanne-barr-guilty-wall-street-bankers-should-be-sent-to-reeducation-camps-or/?test=faces|accessdate=October 3, 2011|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=October 3, 2011|agency=[[News Corporation]]|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018|reason=The quote does not appear in the source, although it seems similar to what is reported.}}

Barr was given a prime speaking role at the [[2012 Green National Convention|Green Party National Convention]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], but decided to instead send a surrogate ([[Farheen Hakeem]]) to speak on her behalf. Barr's surrogate reportedly chided the party for not respecting Barr's candidacy. A shouting match in a hallway reportedly ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/read-this-roseanne-barr-blows-off-green-party-jason-kidd-kerry-kennedy-arrested-on-driving-charges/2012/07/15/gJQAptTanW_blog.html | title=Read this: Roseanne Barr blows off Green Party; Jason Kidd, Kerry Kennedy arrested on driving charges | work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 16, 2012| accessdate=July 16, 2012 | author=The Reliable Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr repeatedly criticized [[Jill Stein]] after losing the Green Party nomination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2012/10/green-party-misses-crucial-political-opp/|title=Green Party pres’l candidate misses crucial political opportunity by not talking up democracy in Israel/Palestine|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2012/07/green-party-post/|title=Green Party Compromised|accessdate=October 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016075016/http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2012/07/green-party-post/|archive-date=October 16, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2012/10/dr-stein-needs-to-study-her-history/|title=Dr. Stein needs to Study her History|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused controversy by using alleged [[transphobic]] words in statements about Stein on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/roseanne-barr-gets-into-twitter-twist-up-over-transgender-comments-20121026/|title=Roseanne Barr Gets Into Twitter Twist-Up Over Transgender Comments|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after losing the Green Party nomination, Barr announced that she would run on the [[Peace and Freedom Party]] ticket with activist [[Cindy Sheehan]] as her [[running mate]].&lt;ref&gt;Abcarian, Robin (August 2, 2012) [http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-roseanne-barr-peace-and-freedom-party-candidate-20120802,0,3965135.story "Roseanne Barr: Peace and Freedom Party presidential candidate"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved August 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 2012, Barr won the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party.&lt;ref name="trending"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/05/america-one-step-closer-to-president-roseanne/ | title=TRENDING: America one step closer to President Roseanne | publisher=CNN | date=August 5, 2012 | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | author=Yoon, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/roseanne-finally-won-a-presidential-nomination.html | title=Roseanne Barr Finally Won a Presidential Nomination | work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=August 5, 2012 | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | author=Bankoff, Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr's running mate, Cindy Sheehan, immediately had disagreements with Barr, from Barr's views on policy, to Barr's desire to only campaign online, and Barr's treatment of Green Party nominee [[Jill Stein]], leading Sheehan to request that her name be taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. Sheehan was told it was too late to have her name removed, so she instead announced that she was would be leaving the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cindysheehanssoapbox.blogspot.com/2015/02/of-noodges-and-nukes-by-cindy-sheehan.html | title=Of Noodges and Nukes by Cindy Sheehan | work=Cindy Sheehan Official Site | date=February 12, 2015 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Sheehan, Cindy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cindysheehanssoapbox.blogspot.com/2012/09/no-longer-on-campaign-formal.html| title=No Longer on Campaign.

Barr appeared on the ballot in California,
Colorado, and Florida. She did not appear on the ballot in her home state of Hawaii, which did not allow write-in votes. She ended up voting for President [[Barack Obama|Obama]]. She received 67,326 votes nationwide, placing sixth overall with 0.05% of the popular vote; Stein, who appeared on the ballot of thirty-six states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], placed far ahead of her in fourth place with 0.36% of the popular vote and 469,627 votes.&lt;ref name="FEC"/&gt;

Barr was followed by a film crew throughout her entire campaign, with documentarian [[Eric Weinrib]] directing, leading to questions about the sincerity of her campaign. Over 300 hours were filmed and were released as a film called ''Roseanne for President!''. Despite questions of her sincerity regarding her campaign, Barr and her family have insisted her desire to run for president was "very real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/tribeca-film-review-roseanne-for-president-1201475205/| title=Tribeca Film Review: ‘Roseanne for President!’ | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=April 18, 2015 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Kenigsberg, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roseanne-barr-presidential-campaign-doc-708579| title=Roseanne Barr Presidential Campaign Doc in the Works (Exclusive) | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=June 2, 2014 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Siegel, Tatiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/04/17/tribeca-film-festival-2015-roseanne-for-president-explores-the-alternative-party-system/| title=‘Roseanne For President!’ Explores the Alternative Party System | work=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=April 17, 2015 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Ayers, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thelaughbutton.com/features/time-roseanne-ran-president/| title=That time Roseanne ran for President | work=The Laugh Button | date=May 31, 2016 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Mark Says Hi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''station point''' is a [[location (geography)|location]] or vantage point from which an [[artist]] or exhibitor intends an [[observation|observer]] to experience an [[art]]work.

In [[photography]], the station point is the location of the [[camera]] at the point in time when the camera [[Video|records]] a [[Perspective (visual)|view]] to a [[recording medium]].

In traditional [[graphical perspective]], '''oculus''' (abbreviated ''O'') denotes the point&lt;ref&gt;[[Kirsti Andersen]] (2007) ''Geometry of an Art'', p. xxix, Springer, {{ISBN|0-387-25961-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[space]] where a viewer sees a scene to be portrayed on a [[picture plane]]. When depiction of a scene is taken over by a camera with [[photography]], the "eye point" or oculus becomes the station point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">Founded in 2001, the '''Stock Artists Alliance''' was an international trade association of [[photographers]] who produce images for [[stock photography]]. The mission of SAA was to support and protect the business interests of professional stock photographers with regard to the worldwide distribution of their [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref name="SAA"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716115607/http://www.stockartistsalliance.org/info/about/mission Stock Artists Alliance website: Mission Page at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an advocate for its members, SAA encouraged the use of fair contracts and ethical behavior at all levels of the industry. SAA monitored the [[stock photography]] industry and served as an ombudsman for its members' interests in dealing with picture agencies and other distribution channels.&lt;ref name="SAA"/&gt;

SAA's first major negotiation was with [[Getty Images]] to improve the photographers' contract.

In 2008, SAA joined over 60 other art licensing businesses (including the [[Artists Rights Society]], the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]], [[Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators]], Illustrator's Partnership of America and the Advertising Photographers of America, among others) in opposing both [http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11320236 The Orphan Works Act of 2008] and [http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11322171 The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008].&lt;ref name="ipa2"&gt;[http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 Orphan Works Legislative Action Center: Groups Opposed to the Orphan Works Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930014130/http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 |date=2008-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known collectively as "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080930014130/http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 Artists United Against the U.S. Orphan Works Acts]," the diverse organizations joined forces to oppose the bills, which the groups believe "permits, and even encourages, wide-scale infringements while depriving creators of protections currently available under the Copyright Act."&lt;ref name="ipa2"/&gt;

In October 2009 SAA formally became a member of the [[Alliance of Visual Artists]] an umbrella organization representing six photographic associations and some 45,000 professional photographers (direct and affiliated members) worldwide, led by [[Professional Photographers of America]]

The organization ceased operations in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/2011/03/stock-photographers-advocacy-group-saa-shutting-down.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Four boys are spending summer vacation by themselves at a remote boarding school. In an introductory sequence, the boy Yu is shown jumping off a cliff in a presumed suicide over his unrequited love for another of the boys, Kazuhiko. But during the vacation period, a new boy, Kaoru, arrives who is the exact image of Yu, but who insists he has no connection to him. The other boys, Naoto and Norio, are also attracted to Kazuhiko who now finds himself fascinated by Kaoru.

The '''Teatro Bibiena''' di Mantova (also known as, among others, the '''Teatro Scientifico''', '''Teatro Accademico''' or '''Teatrino della Accademia Filarmonica''') was made by [[Antonio Galli da Bibbiena|Antonio Bibiena]] in 1767-1769 and decorated in 1773-1775 with a facade of Piermarini designed by Paolo Pozzo (1741–1803).

Constructed for the Royal [[Virgilian Academy]] of Science and Arts (the "Accademia Virgiliana"), the theatre in [[Mantua]] was designed in late [[Baroque]] or early [[Rococo]] style by [[Antonio Galli Bibiena]] and erected between 1767 and 1769. With a bell-shaped floorplan and four rows of boxes, it followed the new style of theatres then in vogue. It was intended to host both theatre productions and concerts, and scientific discourses and conventions. Bibiena also provided the [[monochrome]] [[fresco]]es in the interior.&lt;ref name=Mantua&gt;{{cite web|title=Teatro Scientifico Bibiena|url=http://www.comune.mantova.it/index.php/cultura/musei-e-monumenti/teatro-scientifico-bibiena|publisher=Community of Mantua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is now considered to be his most important work.&lt;ref name=Sanders/&gt;

It was opened officially on 3 December 1769. A few weeks later, on 16 January 1770, thirteen-year-old [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] played a concert here, with resounding success.&lt;ref name=Mantua/&gt; His father, Leopold Mozart, wrote about the theatre: "In all my life, I have never seen anything more beautiful of its kind".&lt;ref name=Sanders&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Donald|title=Music at the Gonzaga Court|year=2012|publisher=Lexington|isbn=9780739167274|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igZbXtl7HAAC&amp;pg=PA165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1773, [[Giuseppe Piermarini]], who constructed the neighbouring palazzo for the Accademia Virgiliana, designed and built the [[façade]] of the theatre.&lt;ref name=Mantua/&gt;

Still used for its original purposes, it now can also be visited by tourists as one of Mantua's museums.&lt;ref name=Mantua/&gt; The theatre is relatively small, with a scene 12,3 metres wide and 5,6 metres deep, and a maximum audience of 363 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strutture teatrali della provincia di Mantova|url=http://www.cultura.regione.lombardia.it/cs/Satellite?c=Redazionale_P&amp;childpagename=DG_Cultura%2FDetail&amp;cid=1213374468504&amp;packedargs=NoSlotForSitePlan%3Dtrue%26menu-to-render%3D1213305614897&amp;pagename=DG_CAIWrapper#1213374479000|work=Culture, identità a Autonomie|publisher=Lombardy region|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211905/http://www.cultura.regione.lombardia.it/cs/Satellite?c=Redazionale_P&amp;childpagename=DG_Cultura%2FDetail&amp;cid=1213374468504&amp;packedargs=NoSlotForSitePlan%3Dtrue%26menu-to-render%3D1213305614897&amp;pagename=DG_CAIWrapper#1213374479000|archivedate=2015-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting depicts a nude young man with a mix of both masculine and feminine features (the feminine being especially prominent in the lack of body hair or defined musculature, the long eyelashes and the finely groomed eyebrows) standing behind a table which blocks our view of him below the waist.  On the table is a yellow book with a red bookmark, that has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of male/female intercourse.  The man's right arm is hidden from view by a Greek column, connecting this painting to the art of the ancient Greeks, a common theme among de Chirico's work.  The man himself is likely a younger version of the figure of [[Dionysos]] who appears in later works by de Chirico, such as ''The Phantom''.&lt;ref name=Bohn/&gt;

The common interpretation of the painting is that the figure represents de Chirico's father, with the book on the table representing the artists' parent's lovemaking, perhaps witnessed at some point by the young artist.&lt;ref name=Bohn/&gt;

In ''The Child’s Brain'', the man depicted has his pelvic area covered by a book. This can be interpreted as the man being faced with the terror of castration which can be found in the psychological work of Sigmund Freud. De Chirico was in tune with Freud's studies, reflecting a fascination with psychosexual stages, particularly the phallic stage. It is at this time that the male child develops an obsession with his genitals, that leads to the realization of gender difference and a fear of castration.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David B. "Psychosexual Development." Psychosexual Development. Brown University, 1996. Web. 13 Mar. 2013. &lt;http://www.victorianweb.org/science/freud/develop.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary: or, the Accomplish'd Housewives Companion''''' was a cookery book written by John Nott and first published in London in 1723.

==Context==

Nott had been the chief cook for a string of aristocrats, named on the title page of his book as the Dukes of Somerset, Ormond, and Bolton, and the Lords Lansdown and Ashburnham.

==Book==

===Contents===

The book describes how to make savoury dishes including "Bisks, Farces, forc'd Meats, Marinades, Olio's, Puptons, Ragoos, Sauces, Soops, Pottages". Pastries include biscuits, cakes, custards, puddings, pies and tarts. Confectionery includes candying and conserving flowers, fruits, and roots, as well as jellies, marmalades and decorative "sugar-works". Drinks include the making of beer, cider, mead, perry and English wines, as well as cordials. The book ends with a list of suggested bills of fare for every month of the year.&lt;ref name="Nott"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nott |first1=John |title=The cooks and confectioners dictionary; or, The accomplish'd housewifes companion|date=1723 |publisher=C. Rivington |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P38EAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is prefaced with a four-page Introduction "To All Good Housewives", beginning "Worthy Dames, Were it not for the sake of Custom, which has made it as unfashionable for a Book to come abroad without an Introduction, as for a Man to appear at Church without a Neckcloth, or a Lady without a Hoop-petticoat, I should not have troubled you with this."{{efn|This memorably humorous start was boldly plagiarised by [[Eliza Smith]] four years later in her ''[[The Compleat Housewife]]''.&lt;ref name=Yost&gt;{{cite journal| author=Yost, Genevieve |title=The Compleat Housewife or Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion. A Bibliographical Study |journal=William and Mary Quarterly |volume=18 | year=1938 |pages=419–435 |jstor=1922976 |doi=10.2307/1922976}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The introduction ends with "Your humble Servant, The Compiler". There follows "Some Divertisements in Cookery, us'd at Festival-Times, as Twelfth-Day, &amp;c."

The main text is laid out as a dictionary from [[Ale|Al]] to [[Zest (ingredient)|Zest]]. It included items now unfamiliar, such as [[battalia pie|Battalia Pye of Fish]], a "very large Pye, and cut with [[Battlements]] ... with as many Towers as will contain your several sorts of Fish", which included [[salmon]], [[cockle (bivalve)|cockles]], [[prawn]]s, [[oyster]]s, and [[Littorinidae|periwinkles]].&lt;ref name="Foodie"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clarkson |first1=Janet |title=Battalia Pie |url=http://www.theoldfoodie.com/2012/11/battalia-pie.html |website=The Old Foodie |accessdate=8 February 2016 |date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is followed by Bills of Fare, Terms of Art for Carving, Instructions for Carving, The Manner of Setting out a Desert of Fruits and Sweet-meats, and the Alphabetical Index.

[[File:To make an Amlet of Asparagus Nott 1723.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Recipe "To make an Amlet of Asparagus" in John Nott's ''The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary'', 1723]]

Since the main text is an alphabetical list, there are no sections, and the recipes stand alone without instructions on kitchen equipment or general comments on types of dish.

The entries are named, either like "Asparagus with Butter" as dishes, or like "To make an Amlet of Asparagus" as goals to be attained. The ingredients are not listed. Quantities, if mentioned at all, are simply included in the text, as "an Egg or two", relying on the cook's judgement as to the exact quantity needed. Cooking conditions are similarly mentioned only in passing, as "over a gentle Fire". For example:&lt;ref name=Omelette/&gt;

::'''To make an Amlet of Asparagus'''

:: Blanch your [[Asparagus]], cut them in short Pieces, fry them in fresh Butter, with a little Parsley and [[Chives|Chibols]] ; then pur in some Cream, season them well, and let them boil over a gentle Fire: In the mean time make an [[Omelette|Amlet]] with new laid Eggs, Cream, and Salt ; when it is enough, dress it on a Dish ; thicken the Asparagus with the Yolk of an Egg or two, turn the Asparagus on the Amlet, and serve it up hot.&lt;ref name=Omelette&gt;Nott, 1723, page 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Nott's recipe for hot chocolate is said to be delicious. The bibliographer [[William Carew Hazlitt]], in his 1902 ''Old Cookery Books'', considered Nott well-read and intelligent as he drew his recipes from many sources at home and abroad, including "to dress mutton the Turkish way".&lt;ref name="Jane"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary: An 18th Century Cookery Book|url=https://janeaustensworld.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/the-cooks-and-confectioners-dictionary-an-18th-century-cookery-book/|publisher=Jane Austen's World|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Cookbooks|url=http://www.djmcadam.com/old-cookery-books.html|accessdate=5 February 2016|date=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nott's "Queen's Pottage" is recreated at ''The Gilbert Scott'' restaurant, though ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' notes that the chef, [[Marcus Wareing]], omits the original [[Comb (anatomy)|cockscomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clay|first1=Xanthe|title=The Gilbert Scott, St Pancras Hotel, London, restaurant preview|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/restaurants/8495233/The-Gilbert-Scott-St-Pancras-Hotel-London-restaurant-preview.html|accessdate=5 February 2016|agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nott's [[Salmagundy]] is likewise reworked by [[Heston Blumenthal]] in his ''Dinner'' restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunt|first1=Tristram|title=Dinner by Heston Blumenthal: a taste of the past|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/03/dinner-heston-blumenthal-history-menu|accessdate=5 February 2016|agency=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets'' notes that the "ubiquitous" [[crème brûlée]] appeared in the ''Dictionary'', but that [[Elizabeth David]] had traced Nott's version to François Massialot's recipe in his 1691 ''Cuisinier royal et bourgeois'', rendered as "Burnt Cream" in the English translation of his book,  ''The Court and Country Cook'' of 1702.&lt;ref name="GoldsteinMintz2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldstein |first1=Darra |last2=Mintz |first2=Sidney |last3=Krondl |first3=Michael |title=The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbi6BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 |year=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-931339-6 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation comments that Nott seems to have plagiarized "heavily" from [[Robert May (chef)|Robert May]] as well as Massialot, without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History is Served 18th Century Cookbook Bibliography|url=http://recipes.history.org/bibliography/|publisher=The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The 1570 ''Siege of Malta'', written in the immediate aftermath of the events by the Cretan writer [[Antonios Achelis]], is a classical work of [[Cretan Greek]] literature.
* ''[[Eight-Pointed Cross]]'' (2011) by Marthese Fenech remains faithful to historical events and tells the story from the perspectives of a Maltese family and an Ottoman family. The narrative culminates with Dragut's 1551 raid of Gozo. Work on the sequel, which focuses on the Siege of 1565, is currently underway.
* [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[The Siege of Malta (novel)|The Siege of Malta]]'', written in 1831-1832, was not published until 2008.
* [[Roger Crowley]]'s ''Empires of The Sea'' (2008) has a lengthy section on the siege of Malta.

Modern authors have attempted to capture the desperation and ferocity of the siege, with varying degrees of success.

* ''[[Angels in Iron]]'' (2004) by [[Nicholas Prata]] remains faithful to the historical narrative and tells the story from a distinctly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] point of view.
* The Great Siege, Malta 1565, Ernle Bradford (1961)
* The novel ''[[Ironfire: An Epic Novel of Love and War]]'' (2003) by [[David Wadsworth Ball|David W. Ball]] is the story of kidnapping, slavery and revenge leading up to the siege of Malta. It takes a somewhat less sympathetic view of the Catholic Knights Hospitaller and maintains a more romantic approach. (The British edition is called "The Sword and the Scimitar.")
* The novel ''The Religion'' (2006) by [[Tim Willocks]] tells the story of the siege through the eyes of a fictional mercenary called Mattias Tannhauser, who is on Malta fighting (at times) alongside the Knights (referred to primarily as ''The Religion''), while trying to locate the bastard son of a Maltese noblewoman.  In this attempt his opponent is a high-ranking member of the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]]. The story presents a picture of both sides of the conflict without romanticising or sanitising the content for modern consumption.
* The novel ''[[Blood Rock]]'' (2008) by James Jackson tells the story of the siege with a focus on a fictional English mercenary called Christian Hardy. Throughout the siege, Hardy works to discover the identity of the traitor within The Religion who works to ensure a Moslem victory. The traitor works on behalf of the French king, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], who believed that peace with the Ottoman Empire was in the French interest and that the marauding Knights Hospitaller, by annoying the Sultan, threatened the security of France.
*It is the main plot of ''[[Pirates of Christ]]'' (2007), the historical novel by [[Edward Lamond]].&lt;ref name="Pirates of Christ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piratesofchrist.com|title=Website for 'Pirates of Christ' novel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dorothy Dunnett]] in "[[The Disorderly Knights]]" (1966), the third volume of The "[[Lymond Chronicles]]", gives a detailed fiction account of the events of 1551 in Malta, Gozo and Tripoli. Although several of the characters are fictional, the bulk of the personages are historical.
* In the video game ''[[Age of Empires III]]'', released in 2005, the story-based campaign mode has a fictional account of the siege of Malta.
* ''Clash Of Empires: The Great Siege'' (2011), a novel written by [[Christopher Hart (novelist)|Christopher Hart]], under the pen name William Napier, focuses on how the events of 1565 effected Nicholas Ingoldsby, a fictional English character, and  the son of one of the Knights of St. John.
* The novel ''The sword and the scimitar'' (2012), by [[Simon Scarrow]], is set around the Siege of Malta, and recounts events through the eyes of the disgraced veteran Knight Sir Thomas Barrett (a fictional character),  who is secretly searching for a hidden scroll that is in the possession of the Knights of St. John, that could threaten the reign of his Queen, [[Elizabeth I]].
* The novel ''The Course of Fortune'' (J. Boylston, 2015), by [[Tony Rothman]], published in three volumes, recounts the events leading up to the Siege of Malta beginning with the 1551 raid on Gozo, in which the corsair Turgut Reis enslaved the island's entire population.  The story is told through the eyes of a young Spanish mercenary and relies heavily on early and original sources.

==Biography==

Timothy Binkley studied mathematics at [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], earning a B.A. (1965) and an M.A. (1966). His PhD in philosophy, from [[University of Texas at Austin]] (1970), explored [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s use of language.

Binkley has lectured and taught at several colleges and universities in the United States, most notably at [[School of Visual Arts]] where he initiated the MFA Computer Art program, the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/library/cyber/mirapaul/111397mirapaul.html "Salon's Digital Art Ends Up Flat."] Mirapaul, Matthew. ''The New York Times'', "Technology | Cybertimes", November 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he founded the New York Digital Salon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydigitalsalon.org/10/essay.php?essay=3 "The Stone Age of the Digital Arts"], Malina, Roger.

He has exhibited his [[interactive art]] in the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia.

==Philosophy==

Binkley postulates that twentieth-century art is a strongly self-critical discipline, which creates ideas free of traditional piece-specifying conventions including aesthetic parameters and qualities. The artwork is a piece, and a piece isn't necessarily an aesthetic object—or an object at all. Binkley states that anything that can be thought about or referred to can be labeled an artwork by an artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/beardsley/1.html [[Monroe Beardsley]] ''Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism'', 1st ed.], 1958; 2d ed., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Binkley argues that the computer is neither a medium nor a tool,&lt;ref&gt;[http://grahameweinbren.net/GW_Papers/Emulating%20the%20ErlKing.html "''The Erl King'' and its Digital Emulation"], Weinbren, Grahame. Martha Kinder and Tara McPherson (eds.), ''Interactive Frictions'', University of California Press, (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesis.lambertsblog.co.uk/?page_id=274 "Computer Art Thesis: A Critical Examination of Computer Art"], Lambert, Nick. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; since both media and tools have inherent characteristics that can be explored through an artist's gestures or physical events for mark-making. Instead, the computer is a chameleon-like or even promiscuous assistant, whose services can be applied to any number of tasks and whose capabilities can be defined endlessly from application to application. Binkley refers to the computer as a non-specific technology and an incorporeal metamedium. Yet the computer contains phenomena not found in other media: namely, a conceptual space where symbolic content can be modified using mathematical abstractions. The notion of an “original” and its consequent value are considered irrelevant, obsolete, or inapplicable to computer art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/61196135/The-problem-of-media-in-contemporary-art-theory-1960--1990 Van Der Meulen, Sjoukje. ''The Problem of Media in Contemporary Art Theory''], (2009): Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Binkley's philosophy extends beyond art and aesthetics to culture itself, whose foundations he believes we are overhauling through our involvement with computers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h0vnDc2447IC&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;ots=oedvUySRkj&amp;dq=Timothy%20Binkley%20digital%20culture&amp;pg=PA418#v=onepage&amp;q=Timothy%20Binkley%20digital%20culture&amp;f=false Rosen, Philip.

The '''Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage''' is a treaty that was adopted on 2 November 2001 by the General Conference of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).&lt;ref name=Official_Text&gt;UNESCO [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/2001-convention/official-text/ "2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage"] 2 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The convention is intended to protect "all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character" which have been under water for over 100 years.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Art.1}} This extends to the protection of shipwrecks, sunken cities, prehistoric art work, treasures that may be looted, sacrificial and burial sites, and old ports that cover the oceans' floors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/the-underwater-heritage/&lt;/ref&gt; The preservation of underwater cultural heritage is significant as it allows for the retelling of numerous historical events. As part of its duty to conduct scientific research and provide continuous education on the importance of underwater cultural heritage, UNESCO strives to maintain these sites for the enjoyment of current and future generations. The convention may provide a customary framework to help raise awareness and seek to combat the illegal looting and pirating occurring in waters worldwide. As an international body, member states of the convention agree to work towards the preservation of sunken cultural property within their jurisdiction and the high seas.

==Cultural heritage==
As an international body, UNESCO continues to work towards the preservation of cultural goods worldwide. Similar to cultural property, only physical goods that are bestowed to future generations may fall into the protection of cultural heritage. It is thus a form of inheritance that allows current and future generations to learn about significant historical events.&lt;ref name = Frigo&gt;Frigo, Manlio. "Cultural property v. cultural heritage: A 'battle of concepts' in international law?." ''International Review of the Red Cross'' 86.854 (2004): 367–78 at 369.&lt;/ref&gt; Particular to the concept of heritage, international agreements exist under the Council of Europe  such as the 1885 Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage of Europe and the European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. These bodies create broad legal protections around cultural heritage antiquities and sites that are specific to communities worldwide.&lt;ref name = Frigo/&gt; The 1954 Hague Convention was truly the first international convention that attempted to discuss the protection of cultural heritage. In defining property that is considered 'important' and 'valuable' for the good of the people, the issue of protecting cultural property became noticeable to international parties.&lt;ref name = Forrest&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p.3&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the 1972 UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, that the term 'cultural heritage' was employed to define the cultural objects to be protected at an international level &lt;ref&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to its expansive definition, the concept of cultural heritage was further revised in the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. They serve to assert the universal value of protecting cultural objects that make up the history and identity of nations.

Along with the 100-year limitation period, the 2001 UNESCO Convention included the phrase 'cultural, historical or archaeological character' as the qualifying concepts that define underwater cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Because many objects of cultural heritage lose their significance when taken out of water, this convention seeks to ensure the preservation of sunken sites.

==Content==
;Official text:
The official text of the convention sets out the obligations of the states parties in regards to the protection of underwater cultural heritage, defined in Article 1 as:

"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character which have been partially or totally under water, periodically or continuously, for at least 100 years"&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

Articles 1–4 define the convention and its objectives, as well as its relation to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) and the [[law of salvage]].&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

Articles 5–12 define varying levels of obligations and procedures within the four [[maritime boundary|maritime zones]] ([[Territorial Waters|Territorial Sea]], Contiguous Zone, [[Exclusive Economic Zone]], [[International Waters]]) defined by [[UNCLOS]].&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

Articles 13–21 define further obligations, such as seizing illicitly recovered underwater cultural heritage, cooperating with other states parties, and providing training in [[underwater archaeology]].&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

Articles 22–35 clarify a number of points relevant to the functional aspects of the convention, such as the creation of statutory bodies, the settlement of disputes between states parties, and modes of ratification.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

;Annex:
In addition to the official text of the convention, an annex of 36 rules governs the practical aspects of activities directed at underwater cultural heritage. States parties are required to ensure that these rules are applied within their territorial sea and contiguous zone,&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Art.7–8}} and also that they are adhered to by all nationals and flag vessels.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Art.16}}

Rules 1–8 define general principles. Key among these are the complete prohibition of the commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Rule 2}} and the principle that ''[[in situ]]'' preservation should always be considered as a first option.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;{{rp|Rule 1}} The rules also cover aspects such as project design, conservation, documentation, and reporting.&lt;ref name=Official_Text/&gt;

==International law==
Situated between admiralty/private maritime law, the law of the sea, and cultural heritage law, the legal framework of underwater cultural heritage law is robust. [[Admiralty law]] is a branch entrenched within private international law relating to the control of maritime practices between private entities.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.8"&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). ''Underwater cultural heritage and international law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Activities that fall under the protection of admiralty law include marine operations, marine salvaging, shipping and receiving. Subject to the common law jurisdiction and handled within domestic court systems, the body of admiralty law seeks to protect the rights and interests of private parties, with respect to practices at sea.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.8"/&gt; On a broader level, this law seeks to fulfill public policy objectives including the safety of life and property, while ensuring the protection of the global marine environments.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.9"&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). ''Underwater cultural heritage and international law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The public international law body of the [[law of the sea]] was established to manage inter-state relations regarding practices in international waters. This complex body of law has grown to develop its own principles, particular methods of enforcement and Tribunals. Its primary objective is to create a supportive legal framework to determine the rights and duties of states with respect to their use of the ocean.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.9"/&gt;

In 1982, the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]  (UNCLOS) was developed to govern the deep-sea beds vis-à-vis increasing commercial exploitation of sunken objects.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.10"&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). ''Underwater cultural heritage and international law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the emergence of newly independent states, a need was created for an international legal body that would help protect underwater cultural goods, in waters used by many parties worldwide. Resulting from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) between 1973 and 1982, the Convention has created many new regulations applicable to nation states. Once signed, the Convention had established two maritime zones with governing international regulations, affixed the maximum depth-level at sea at twelve miles, created specific regimes for international and archipelagic states, and introduced three new international institutions.&lt;ref name="Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.10"/&gt;

The 2001 UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage is a product of international agreement on the adequate conduct of member states at sea.&lt;ref name=Official_Text /&gt; Its legal framework stems from two distinct sections of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), including article 149 and 303.

Article 149 of the LOSC provides that:
" All objects of an archaeological and historical nature found in the
Area shall be preserved or disposed of for the benefit of mankind
as a whole, particular regard being paid to the preferential rights
of the State or country of origin, or the State of cultural origin, or
the State of historical and archaeological origin." &lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"&gt;http://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Bautista-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 303 of the LOSC states that:
"1. States have the duty to protect objects of an archaeological and
historical nature found at sea and shall cooperate for this purpose.

2. In order to control traffic on such objects, the coastal State
may, in applying article 33, presume that their removal from the
seabed in the zone referred to in that article without its approval
would result in an infringement within its territory or territorial
sea of the laws and regulations referred to in that article.

3. Nothing in this article affects the rights of identifiable owners,
the law of salvage or other rules of admiralty, or laws or practices
with respect to cultural heritage.

4. This article is without prejudice to other international
agreements and rules of international law regarding the protection
of objects of an archaeological and historical nature." &lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

To ensure that member states abide by the regulations stipulated within the Convention, they are to further adopt the following;

1 Each Party is to adopt domestic legislation that prohibits nationals and vessels from engaging in activities that would purposely interfere with the protection of underwater cultural heritage

2 Each Party is to require that all nationals and vessels report any new discoveries to UNESCO and fellow member states that are considered to be a part of underwater cultural heritage located in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Continental shelf and Area

3 Each Party is to take appropriate measures to prevent the dealing of objects considered to be underwater cultural heritage. This includes the illicit sale or exportation, as well as trade or seizing of the object found in their territory.

==Significant cases==
A recorded 22 earthquakes between 320 and 1303 AD on the coast of Pharos in Egypt shook the city of Alexandria, which was home to [[Pharos Lighthouse]].&lt;ref name="touregypt.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/pharoslighthouse.htm|title=Pharos Lighthouse of Alexandria|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of these earthquakes, and several more in the centuries that followed suggest that the large monument may have fallen into the sea, leaving massive blocks of stone awaiting the exploration mission led by archaeologist Jean-Yves Empereur in 1994. While many components of the old lighthouse are on display at the Kom el-Dikka museum in Alexandria, archaeologists suggest that around 500 pieces remain on the sea floor.&lt;ref name="touregypt.net"/&gt; Today, the Alexandria Lighthouse is among one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. 
 
On July 19, 1545, the British Fleet known as the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' sunk to the bottom of the [[Portsmouth Harbour]], in the United Kingdom. While its failures still remain a mystery, is estimated that at least 500 men were trapped in the ship, and only 35 of these escaped to safety &lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, G. (2013). The Mary Rose Museum (Portsmouth). ''The Journal of Transport History'', 34(2), 198.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, sixty million people watched as the vessel was lifted out of its resting place, with its 19,000 discovered objects still intact. Due to the preservation of this monument of underwater cultural heritage in the ''Mary Rose'' museum, the public can continue to enjoy the vessel and all of her artifacts.

Off the coast of Sweden in 1628, the pride of the Swedish Navy, the ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' sunk deep beneath the frigid waters of the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name="Adams, A. 1995"&gt;Adams, A. (1995, ). Sweden's vasa museum, an overwhelming sight: Final edition. The Record&lt;/ref&gt; Under the orders of King Gustavus II Adolphus, the immense vessel was built to support Swedish military campaigns during the Thirty Years' War, yet was toppled by swift winds at sea.&lt;ref name="Adams, A. 1995"/&gt; The Vasa remained peacefully underwater until a team of archaeologists raised the wreck in 1961.&lt;ref name="Adams, A. 1995"/&gt; Fortunately, the wreck and all of its belongings were salvaged, despite its lengthily time spent on the ocean floor. Today, the Swedish ''Vasa'' museum in Stockholm is an emblem of cultural heritage, dedicated to educating public citizens worldwide.

In 1985, two scientists discovered the [[RMS Titanic|''RMS'' Titanic]] in the northern waters of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada &lt;ref&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the wreck, 1,800 artifacts were found, deeming the discovery a very important contribution to the field of Underwater Cultural Heritage &lt;ref&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Titanic'' has raised significant questions surrounding the remaining passengers, the value of the wreck and the items lost therein, as well as the impact of the accident &lt;ref&gt;Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the ship, and other sunken wrecks, may have also raised questions about the legal framework of the UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage.

==Pirating and looting==

As early as the sixth century BC, as Rome gained control over the Greek colonies of Italy and aligned itself with the western states, it developed a fleet that would allow the state to become the most powerful naval entity. Due to the lawless waters along the eastern coasts of Italy, this area was prevalent in pirating. Modern scholars refer to this area as being "inhabited by wild, uncivilized tribes, who were active marauders of the land and sea, and were constantly reinforced from the interior".&lt;ref&gt;Heller-Roazen, Daniel. The Enemy of All: Piracy and the Law of Nations. New York: Zone Books, 2009. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; While many dispute the accounts of these events, the marauding nature of pirates may continue to remain true today. Although naval warfare has decreased in popularity, modern pirates are now turning to alternatives to attain their desired treasures.

Today, it is estimated that three million undiscovered shipwrecks and ruins continue to lie at the bottom of the oceans. With the introduction and growing popularity of scuba-diving since the 1940s, the accessibility of such underwater cultural heritage sites are becoming easier to modern pirates in search of new treasure. Studies have already shown that as of 1974, all known shipwrecks off the coasts of Turkey have been exploited by underwater pirates.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/underwater/infokit_en/|title=Publication Name:|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Israeli archaeologists estimate that at least 60 per cent of cultural objects that once lay in wrecks and sites have now disappeared without any trace.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; Due to the sheer mass of the world's oceans and the inability to monitor all activity that takes place therein, pirates and underwater thieves continue to pose a significant threat to the preservation of cultural heritage and cultural property.

In 2006, the UNESCO convention was ratified by an additional state, [[Portugal]], needing international protection for the looting of its underwater cultural heritage sites. At least six international treasure hunting organizations had established themselves off the coasts of Portugal to reap the benefits of the nation's coastline after new legislation had allowed for the sale of artifacts collected underwater during archaeological excavations in 1993. Due to this, physical goods may have been looted without proper care, damaging the cultural property that was left behind. Not only did Portugal face a loss of cultural goods, but also possible facts about its historical events.  
&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; Today, Portugal is among one of the nations that is protected by the body of the UN Convention, wherein the commercial exploitation and dispersion are legally banned, and underwater archeological sites and wrecks are preserved for the future.

==Criticisms==
Abstaining from signing the 2001 UN Convention, the United States has stipulated that the term "all traces of human existence" is too broad, legally and as a mechanism tool for the protection of underwater cultural heritage for the preservation of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; A problem that may arise with the 100-year period is that the beginning of this period is not clearly identified in the Convention, nor in the LOSC &lt;ref&gt;Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). "Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'". The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of the LOSC Articles is that they are considered ambiguous and obscure in nature. Article 149 fails to specify the manner in which objects of an archaeological nature are to be preserved of and disposed, as well as which mechanisms should be instituted in their conservation so as to benefit all current and future generations &lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

With the discovery of the [[Spanish galleon San José]] by the Colombian Government, and in an effort to claim the galleon with all its cargo, the Spanish Government tried to use the convention as a measure to stop Colombia from salvaging the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.las2orillas.co/quienes-reclamaran-el-tesoro-del-galeon-san-jose/|title=¿Quiénes reclamarán el tesoro del galeón San José?|work=Las2orillas|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 13 recognises sovereign immunity over sunken warships, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/2001-convention/official-text/|title=Official texts – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Colombia is not a participating member of the convention. Separately, Colombia has called the galleon part of its submerged patrimony so it is constitutionally bound to protect and preserve the warship.

'''Unbreakable glass''' is [[glass]], or glass substitute, which does not display the normal fragility of glass - in general the term is not used to refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable.

==In history==
A number of ancient writers tell the story of the inventor who approached the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] with his invention of unbreakable glass.  Tiberius asked if anyone else  was aware of the  invention.  When the inventor replied that he was the only person who knew the secret, Tiberius had him killed.  The motivation, according to Reynolds, was to protect the livelihood of the glassmakers.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2002"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Terry S.

The '''Vesunna Gallo-Roman Museum''' is a museum of [[Gallo-Roman]] art and archaeology in the town of [[Périgueux]], located in the French [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Dordogne]]. The Gallo-Roman ruins covered by a glass museum was constructed to protect a historical monument of [[France]].

==History==

===The excavations of the ''domus'' of Bouquets===
In 1959, a few metres from the [[Vesunna Tower]], the remains of a ''[[domus]]'' (wealthy urban town house) were discovered.&lt;ref name="Musees"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://musees-aquitaine.com/musees/fiche_musee.php?id=14 | title=Vésunna, Musée gallo-romain de Périgueux | work=Musées Aquitains | accessdate=23 July 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725225025/http://musees-aquitaine.com/musees/fiche_musee.php?id=14 | archive-date=25 July 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a project for the construction of rental housing on the site of municipal nurseries, archaeologists carried out surveys which brought to light Gallo-Roman walls adorned with painted plaster, preserved to a height of one meter high. What followed was a series of excavations:

* From 1960 to 1968, under the direction of Claude Barrière, assisted by Max Sarradet: the plan of the ''domus'' is updated. Archaeologists distinguished two stages in the occupation of the site: the ''domus'' was built in the first century AD, and then backfilled by over one meter in the middle of the second century. It has a kitchen, a [[triclinium]] (dining room), private thermal bath with the house centred on a garden with a pool. The remains are classified as a French Historical Monument on 25 October 1963.
* From 1973 to 1977, under the direction of Anne and Jean-Luc Tobie and Marc Gauthier: searches focused on the north and south of the site. They brought to light a [[peristyle]] colonnade to the North and a large reception room in the South. Several wells were excavated and they discovered a wooden pump in the well.
* From 1992 to 1995, under the direction of Claudine Girardy Caillat: surveys are conducted to prepare for the construction of the Museum. The excavations were organised around an oak tree and the area planned for the construction of a thick wall.
* From 1999 to 2000, under the direction of Luc Wozny: archaeologists excavated the street to the North of the (''decumanus maximus'') and updated the entry of the ''domus''.

Upon discovery, the site was named the ''villa des Bouquets'', after the name of the street that ran parallel to it. It is today called the ''Vesunna domus''.

===The Creation of the museum===

There soon appeared the need to ensure a good conservation of the site. The idea of a museum building is old. The first projects had been studied even before the end of the excavations. The decision was finally taken in 1992 by the municipal council of Périgueux. An architectural drawing competition took place in 1993. The museum is a project of [[Jean Nouvel]], an architect born in [[Fumel]], France and a winner of the [[Pritzker Prize]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=Penisson/&gt;{{rp|26}} The main constraint that weighed on the project by Jean Nouvel was the impact of the future museum on a site that since 1963 had been classified as a historical monument.&lt;ref name=Musees/&gt; In response to this need, while ensuring maximum view ability to future visitors, Jean Nouvel has created a project whose philosophy can be summed up in two words: protect and reveal the site:&lt;ref name=Penisson/&gt;{{rp|26}}

* Protect the site against climatic hazards: for this a roof supported by 14 pillars of 9 meters high was built. The impact on the ground of these pillars is minimal. They are based on [[Deep foundation#Micropiles|micropiles]] driven deep into the ground, supporting studs of a [[metre]] wide, holding the pillars. To West, a 90 meter long concrete wall serves as a spur to a "umbrella roof.
* Reveal and so inform the gaze of the visitor confronted with the ruins: from a landscaped entrance around a green oak tree, two hundred years old, the visitor is led to back in time. The museum building has a "thick wall" in the West and a vegetation barrier to South to ensure that the gaze of the visitor is diverted from the modern buildings and allows the visitor to immerse themselves in the history of the inhabitants of the ancient city. The tour begins on the first floor where the model of the ancient city, Vesunna, reflects the urban plan in the second century of our era. It continues on two mezzanines where the work of the architect highlights the domus. The museum develops a theme of the city and public life. The route continues down onto the archaeological site, using a raised wooden deck floor resting on a metal frames. By following the displays, the visitor discovers the objects of the everyday life of the Gallo-Romans. Beyond the glass walls of the museum composed of suspended modules, one can identify the remains of the rampart of the 4th century and the Tower of Vesunna.&lt;ref name=Musees/&gt; The house of Taillefer, possibly occupied by the most famous archaeologist of Périgueux, is protected by the flowing roof of the museum and house the office of the curator.&lt;ref name=Penisson/&gt;{{rp|27}}

For the visitor who arrives in the garden of Vésone, the Museum is barely visible between the trees. The glass walls allow the site to be visible from the outside, the building looks like an open window on the past.

The Vesunna Museum opened its doors to the public on 12 July 2003.&lt;ref name="Perigueux"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.perigueux-vesunna.fr/a-city-under-the-city/ | title=A city under the city | work=Ville de Perigueux | accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 12 to 14 July 2013, the Vesunna Museum celebrated its ten years with events such as a free concert, a giant picnic in the park of Vésone, a film projection and a reconstruction of a Roman camp at the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Les 10 ans de Vesunna| work=South Ouest | date=4 July 2013 | author=Gibert, Chantal | pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the museum and its amenities were labelled disability friendly for a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;Vesunna labellisé "Tourisme &amp; Handicaps", ''[[Périgueux le magazine des Périgourdins]]'', no. 21 du 4&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; trimestre 2013, {{p.|24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Museum's collections==
The permanent exhibition comprises the discoveries made on the territory of the [[Petrucores]] people ([[Gauls]]) with a territory equivalent to that of the current [[Dordogne]] department. Blocks of [[limestone]] from the rampart of the fourth century AD are hung along the "thick wall". The collection is divided into two parts: on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanines]] traces of public life in the city of the Petrocores and objects of daily life on the ''domus''.

* After the model of Vésunna that puts into perspective the site in its urban environment, the visitor can observe the decorations and inscriptions of the public buildings of the city: the mosaic of the [[Roman Forum|forum]], models of [[temple]] and the Roman [[amphitheatre]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]], the remains of columns. On the second mezzanine, presentations of the burial world, [[stele|stela]] from the ramparts of the fourth century AD. Then on past the religious statuary and the theme of trade, before moving down onto the "domus".
* A model to 1:50 scale shows the ''domus of Vésone'' at the end of second century AD.&lt;ref name="Penisson"&gt;{{cite book | title=Vesunna. The Gallo-Roman Museum in Perigueux. | publisher=Editions Sud Ouest | author=Penisson, Elisabeth | year=2008 | isbn=978-2-87901-903-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The collection cases are presented in themes: water with the presentation of a pump made of wood found in one of the wells, religion, heating, food, games, and care of the body.&lt;ref name=Penisson/&gt;{{rp|3}}

The visit is conducted around the ''domus''' central garden, where you can see a magnificent [[fresco]] representing rich marine fauna on a background of red Bordeaux, dating from the middle of the second century AD.

On the first floor, a room is used for temporary exhibitions. Until November 4, 2012, it was devoted to Jean-Claude Golvin. Discover the presentations from ancient cities from the work of the architect-archaeologist.

'''Web design''' encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; [[interface design]]; authoring, including standardised code and [[proprietary software]]; [[user experience design]]; and [[search engine optimization]]. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.&lt;ref name="different jobs" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps [[web engineering]] in the broader scope of [[web development]]. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of [[Web usability|usability]] and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with [[web accessibility]] guidelines.

==History==
[[File:WebDesignBooks.JPG|thumb|Web design books in a store]]

===1988–2001===
Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. However, web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people’s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, and music.

====The start of the web and web design====
In 1989, whilst working at [[CERN]] [[Tim Berners-Lee]] proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the [[World Wide Web]]. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.&lt;ref name="World Wide Web" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Longer Biography
  |url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Longer.html
  |accessdate=2012-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Bina]], created the [[Mosaic browser]]. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |title=Mosaic Browser
  |url=http://www.techopedia.com/images/pdfs/history-of-the-internet.pdf
  |accessdate=2012-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[W3C]] was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |location=United States
  |isbn=1-56592-871-7
  |page=804
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications Corp. that later became known as [[Netscape Communications]], the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the [[browser wars]] began, as [[Microsoft]] and [[Netscape]] fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably [[Cascading Style Sheets]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Dynamic HTML]]. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.&lt;ref name=Browsers &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution of web design ====
In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique.&lt;ref name=Browsers/&gt;  The [[HTML markup]] for [[HTML element#Tables|tables]] was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and [[web accessibility]]. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank [[spacer .GIF]] images to stop empty table cells from collapsing.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Evolution" &gt;{{citation |last=Chapman  |first=Cameron  |title=The Evolution of Web Design  |url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/|publisher=Six Revisions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030030802/http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/ |archivedate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CSS]] was introduced in December 1996 by the [[W3C]] to support presentation and layout. This allowed [[HTML]] code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see [[tableless web design]].

In 1996, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to [[ActionScript]], and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, [[Graphics Interchange Format#Animated GIF|animated GIFs]] and [[JavaScript]]. However, because Flash required a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]], many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't forego using [[motion graphics]] altogether) and JavaScript for [[software widget|widgets]]. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Evolution" /&gt;

====End of the first browser wars====
During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an [[Open-source license|open source licence]], enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;  The [[Web Standards Project]] was formed and promoted browser compliance with [[Comparison of layout engines (HTML)|HTML]] and [[Comparison of layout engines (Cascading Style Sheets)|CSS]] standards by creating [[Acid1]], [[Acid2]], and [[Acid3]] tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image format.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;  During this time Netscape was sold to [[AOL]] and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;

===2001–2012===
Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.

Since the end of the [[Browser wars|browsers wars]]{{when|date=May 2016}} new browsers have been released. Many of these are [[open-source software|open source]] meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The new options are considered by many{{Weasel inline|date=May 2016}} to be better than Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]].

The [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] has released new standards for HTML ([[HTML5]]) and CSS ([[CSS3]]), as well as new [[JavaScript]] [[Application programming interface|API's]], each as a new but individual standard.{{when|date=May 2016}} While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and ''some'' of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).

== Tools and technologies ==
Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both [[Vector graphics editor|vector]] and [[Raster graphics editor|raster]] graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or generated by [[Website builder|WYSIWYG editing software]]. Other tools web designers might use include mark up [[HTML validator|validators]]&lt;ref name="W3C_validator"&gt;{{cite web|title=W3C Markup Validation Service|url=http://validator.w3.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skills and techniques ==

=== Marketing and communication design ===
Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B) [[business-to-business]] website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a [[retail]] or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of [[web navigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=THORLACIUS|first=LISBETH|title=The Role of Aesthetics in Web Design|journal=Nordicom Review|year=2007|issue=28|pages=63–76|url=http://www.nordicom.gu.se/en/tidskrifter/nordicom-review-12007/role-aesthetics-web-design|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.

=== User experience design and interactive design ===
User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works. This is part of the [[user experience design]]. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the [[interactive design]] of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less [[usability|user-friendly]] website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castañeda|first=J.A Francisco |last2=Muñoz-Leiva|first2=Teodoro Luque|title=Web Acceptance Model (WAM): Moderating effects of user experience|journal=Information &amp; Management |year=2007 |volume=44 |pages=384–396|doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the [[user interface design]].

Advanced interactive functions may require [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.

=== Page layout ===
Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the [[page layout]].  For example, a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout.  Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of [[aesthetics]] on larger screens.

'''Fluid layouts''' increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and [[Grid (page layout)|grid-based design]] in both page layout design principle and in coding technique, but were very slow to be adopted.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-based markup and [[spacer .GIF]] images&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to considerations of [[Screen reader|screen reading devices]] and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, [[Web banner|embedded advertising]] areas, navigation areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of the reader's screen (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the browser can make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts, but not fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below [[body text]] rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.

[[Responsive Web Design]] is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS &lt;code&gt;@media&lt;/code&gt; rule. In March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html|title=Rolling out mobile-first indexing|work=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sites using responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.

===Typography===
Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of [[typeface]]s or [[Typeface#Style of typefaces|type styles]]. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.

Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in [[web typography]], as well as the usage of font downloading.

Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=John|title=20 Do’s and Don’ts of Effective Web Typography| url=http://webdesignledger.com/tips/20-dos-and-donts-of-effective-web-typography|accessdate=2012-03-19|date=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion graphics===
The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content. In either case, [[motion graphic design]] may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.

Motion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable the animations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html World Wide Web Consortium: Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality of code ===
Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called [[tag soup]]. [[W3C Markup Validation Service|Validating via W3C]]&lt;ref name="W3C_validator" /&gt; can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information can then be corrected by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C QA|title=My Web site is standard! And yours?| url=http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/Web-Quality|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generated content ===
There are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.

==== Static websites ====
{{Main|Static web page}}
A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as [[Jekyll (software)|Jekyll]] and [[Adobe Muse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware. These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and [[virtual machine|virtual server]]s offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.

Almost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and stylesheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.

==== Dynamic websites ====
{{Main|Dynamic web page}}
Dynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use a [[document database]] such as [[MongoDB]] or [[NoSQL]] to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.

In the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or [[website wireframe|wireframe]]d using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.

When dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]] or [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page and data was inserted into places defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.

Both of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as [[content management system]]s.  These build on top of general purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well recognised models, such as a time-sequenced [[blog]], a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organisational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.

Editing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself, and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is [[Wikipedia]].

==Homepage design==
Usability experts, including [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usableinterface.com/articles/homepage.php|first=Kyle|last=Soucy|archivedate=8 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608071219/http://www.usableinterface.com/articles/homepage.php |title=Is Your Homepage Doing What It Should?|publisher=Usable Interface}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nielsen|Tahir|2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/|title=The Ten Most Violated Homepage Design Guidelines|date=10 November 2003|first=Jakob|last=Nielsen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005150112/http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/ |archivedate=5 October 2013|publisher=Nielsen Norman Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/essential-tips-for-designing-an-effective-homepage/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821151637/http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/essential-tips-for-designing-an-effective-homepage/ |archivedate=21 August 2013|date=20 August 2009|first=Kayla|last=Knight|publisher=Six Revisions|title=Essential Tips for Designing an Effective Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/09/29/is-home-page-design-relevant-anymore/|publisher=User Interface Engineering|first=Jared|last=Spool|date=29 September 2005|archivedate=16 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916092857/http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/09/29/is-home-page-design-relevant-anymore/ |title=Is Home Page Design Relevant Anymore?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading many practitioners to argue that homepages are less important than most people think.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=10 Usability Tips Based on Research Studies|url=http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/|first=Cameron|last=Chapman|date=15 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902031226/http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/ |archivedate=2 September 2013|publisher=Six Revisions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page|title=Myth #17: The homepage is your most important page|first=Zoltán|last=Gócza|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602172028/http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page |archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://giraffeforum.com/wordpress/2010/04/18/the-decline-of-the-homepage/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524221238/http://giraffeforum.com/wordpress/2010/04/18/the-decline-of-the-homepage/ |archivedate=24 May 2013|title=The decline of the homepage|first=Gerry|last=McGovern|date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prioritizing Design Time: A Long Tail Approach|first=Joshua|last=Porter|date=24 April 2006|publisher=User Interface Engineering|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514075119/http://www.uie.com/articles/prioritizing_design_time/ |archivedate=14 May 2013|url=http://www.uie.com/articles/prioritizing_design_time/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jared Spool argued in 2007 that a site's homepage was actually the least important page on a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/08/06/usability-tools-podcast-home-page-design/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429113949/http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/08/06/usability-tools-podcast-home-page-design/ |archivedate=29 April 2013|first=Jared|last=Spool|date=6 August 2007|title=Usability Tools Podcast: Home Page Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called 'sliders' and 'rotating banners') have become an extremely popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined space.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best practices in carousel design for effective web marketing|first=Chris|last=Bates|date=9 October 2012|publisher=Smart Insights|url=http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403013507/http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/ |archivedate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Messner2013&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html |title=Image Carousels: Getting Control of the Merry-Go-Round|first=Katie|last=Messner|publisher=Usability.gov|date=22 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010094459/http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html |archivedate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a website's search engine optimisation and usability.&lt;ref name=Messner2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496|archivedate=22 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031942/http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496 |title=Homepage Sliders: Bad For SEO, Bad For Usability|first=Harrison|last=Jones|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/|title=Don’t Use Automatic Image Sliders or Carousels, Ignore the Fad|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125013642/http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/ |archivedate=25 November 2013|first=Peep|last=Laja|date=27 September 2012|publisher=ConversionXL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupations ==
There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and [[web developer]], who often work closely together on a website.&lt;ref name ="careersinwebdesign"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oleksy|first=Walter|title=Careers in Web Design| year=2001|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9780823931910 |pages=9–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OJSA5wS7kQC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working knowledge of [[markup language]]s such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.  Particularly in smaller organizations one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Designer|url=http://www.myjobsearch.com/careers/web-designer.html|accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Further jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include:  
*[[Graphic designers]] to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts and buttons
*Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting viewers to the site, by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet
*SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website and make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines
*Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of the site&lt;ref name="different jobs" /&gt;
*User experience [[User experience design|(UX) designer]] incorporates aspects of user focused design considerations which include information architecture, user centered design, user testing, interaction design, and occasionally visual design.

The [[white savior]] is a [[trope (cinema)|cinematic trope]] in which a [[white people|white]] character rescues [[person of color|people of color]] from their plight.&lt;ref name="temple1" /&gt; Certain critics have observed this narrative in an array of genres of films in [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]], wherein a white protagonist is portrayed as a [[Messiah|messianic figure]] who often learns something about him or herself in the course of rescuing characters of color.&lt;ref name="temple1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sturges"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Kysa |last1=Nygreen | first2=Barbara| last2=Madeloni| first3=Jennifer | last3=Cannon |title=Neoliberalizing Educational Reform: America's Quest for Profitable Market-Colonies and the Undoing of Public Good |chapter='Boot Camp' Teacher Certification and Neoliberal Education Reform | editor-last=Sturges | editor-first=Keith M. | publisher=Springer Publishing | location=New York City|date=2015|page=116 | isbn=978-94-6209-975-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the white savior is one way the mass communications medium of cinema represents the [[sociology of race and ethnic relations]], by presenting abstract concepts—such as [[morality]]—as innate characteristics, racial and cultural, of white people, rather than as characteristics innate to people of color.&lt;ref name="temple2" /&gt; The white savior usually is a man who is out of place within his own society, until he assumes the [[The White Man's Burden|burden of racial leadership]] to rescue non-white foreigners and minorities from their plights. As such, white savior stories "are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic" fantasies of psychological [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hernán|last1=Vera|first2=Andrew M.|last2=Gordon|title=Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|date=2003|ISBN=978-0847699476|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Whiteness of Oscar Night" (2015), [[Matthew Hughey]] describes the narrative structure of the subgenre:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A White Savior film is often based on some supposedly true story. Second, it features a nonwhite group or person who experiences conflict and struggle with others that is particularly dangerous or threatening to their life and livelihood. Third, a White person (the savior) enters the milieu and through their sacrifices, as a teacher, mentor, lawyer, military hero, aspiring writer, or wannabe Native American warrior, is able to physically save—or at least morally redeem—the person or community of folks of color, by the film's end. Examples of this genre include films like ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' (1989), ''[[Dangerous Minds]]'' (1996), ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'' (1997), ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000), ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' (2003), ''[[Half Nelson (film)|Half Nelson]]'' (2006), ''[[Freedom Writers]]'' (2007), ''[[Gran Torino]]'' (2008), ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'' (2009), ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'' (2011), and the list goes on.&lt;ref name=Hughey2015&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew W.|last=Hughey |authorlink = Matthew Hughey|url=https://contexts.org/blog/the-whiteness-of-oscar-night/ |title=The Whiteness of Oscar Night |website=Contexts |date=January 19, 2015 |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of cinematic adaptations of the play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1959), by [[Lorraine Hansberry]], and the novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1960), by [[Harper Lee]], the films of the [[blaxploitation]] genre of the 1970s reflected continued discontent over the social and racial inequality of non-white people in the United States and functioned as counterbalance to the trope of the white savior. Then in the 1980s, continued cultural [[hypersegregation]] led to the common misbelief, by many American white people, that the nation had reached a post-racial state of social relations, which resulted in a backlash against the racial and ethnic diversity of the cinema of the previous decades, on screen during the 1960s and the 1970s; thus, the popular cinema of the 1990s and the early 2000s featured the white savior narrative. That reappearance of the white-savior narrative occurred because the majority of white people in the United States had little substantive social interaction with people of different races and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="temple1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Philip S. S.|last1=Howard|first2=George J. Sefa|last2=Dei|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX4Gp55jacMC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=white+savior+nonwhites+real+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAscDh1MvaAhXNzlkKHRSeC4wQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=white+savior+nonwhites+real+life&amp;f=true|title=Crash Politics and Antiracism: Interrogations of Liberal Race Discourse|date=27 May 2018|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of story==

=== Inspirational teacher  ===

The white-savior teacher story, such as ''[[Up the Down Staircase (film)|Up the Down Staircase]]'' (1967), ''[[Dangerous Minds]]'' (1995), and ''[[Freedom Writers]]'' (2007), "features a group of lower-class, urban, non-whites (generally black and Latino/a) who struggle through the social order in general, or the educational system specifically. Yet, through the sacrifices of a white teacher they are transformed, saved, and redeemed by the film's end."&lt;ref name="hughey2010" /&gt; As an inspirational tale of the human spirit, the storyline of the white-savior-teacher is not racist, in itself, but is culturally problematic for being [[racialist]], because it is a variant of the white-savior narrative that factually misrepresents the cultural and societal reality that there exist minority-group teachers who have been successfully educating (racial, ethnic, cultural) minority-group students in their communities, without the saving stewardship of white people.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kathleen| last=Fitzgerald | title=Recognizing Race and Ethnicity: Power, Privilege, and Inequality | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, Colorado|date=2014|page=364 | isbn=978-0-8133-4931-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Man of principle  ===
The white savior's principled opposition to [[chattel slavery]] and to [[Jim Crow laws]] makes him advocate for the humanity of slaves and defender of the rights of black people unable to independently stand within an [[institutional racism|institutionally racist]] society, in films such as ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1962), ''[[Conrack]]'' (1974), and ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'' (1997). Despite ostensibly being stories (fictional and true) about the racist oppression of black people, usually in the [[Southern United States]] (American South), the white-savior narrative relegates characters of color to the story's background, as the passive object(s) of the dramatic action, and in the foreground places the white man who militates to save him, and them, from the depredations of racist white folk, respectively: a false accusation of inter-racial rape, truncated schooling, and chattel slavery.&lt;ref name="vera32_33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berlatsky" /&gt;

''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Berlatsky said the denouement's use of the white savior, while historically accurate, was unnecessary, "As it is, in the context of Hollywood, Northup's stunned/numb gratitude at the end of the film tends to blur into a montage of other teary-eyed black actors gazing with awe and wonder at the surprising, over-determined nobility of some white actor or other."&lt;ref name="berlatsky" /&gt;

Film critic [[Ann Hornaday]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "[Director] Ross has insisted that he didn't want 'Free State of Jones' to become another white savior movie, but that's precisely what it is, especially during scenes when the murderous injustice of slavery is refracted through Knight’s frustrated tears." Hornaday said the film could have avoided the trope by focusing more on Knight's alliance with a former slave or his relationships with his wife and an enslaved house servant.&lt;ref name="hornaday" /&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Vann R. Newkirk II said, "To say that McConaughey's portrayal of Newton Knight is a white savior perhaps undersells the trope... A better film would have muddled the clean white-savior narrative with an actual exploration of what the racial politics of a mixed-race insurgency in the South might have been like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Newkirk II | first=Vann R. | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/06/the-faux-woke-state-of-jones/489071/ | title=The Faux-Enlightened ''Free State of Jones'' | magazine=[[The Atlantic]] | date=June 28, 2016 | accessdate=October 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[A. O. Scott]] said, "...while Mr. Ross's story makes Newton unambiguously heroic, this is not yet another film about a white savior sacrificing himself on behalf of the darker-skinned oppressed. Nor for that matter is it the story of a white sinner redeemed by the superhuman selflessness of black people.''Free State of Jones'' is a rarer thing: a film that tries to strike sparks of political insight from a well-worn genre template."&lt;ref name="scott20160623" /&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' film critic Richard Brody said, "It's tempting to shunt ''Free State of Jones'' into the familiar genre of the white-savior tale, but Newton Knight appears as something else—not so much as a savior but as an avatar of a new South. By seeing his own interests clearly and considering the economic and social structure of his locale and his nation insightfully, he's able to transcend heritage and history and to forge a community, both during and after the war, that will be fair, inclusive, and—yes—post-racial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Brody | first=Richard | url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-historical-imagination-and-free-state-of-jones | title=The Historical Imagination and ''Free State of Jones'' | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=June 23, 2016 | accessdate=October 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Gilbert''' (20 May 1804 – 3 January 1890) was an English writer and [[Royal Navy]] [[surgeon]].  He wrote a considerable number of novels, biographies, histories, essays (especially about the dangers of alcohol and the plight of the poor) and popular fantasy stories, mostly in the 1860s and 1870s. Some of these have been reprinted in recent decades and are still available today.  He is best remembered, however, as the father of dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].

==Life and career==
Gilbert was born at [[Bishopstoke]], Hampshire, the eldest son of William (1780–1812), a grocer in Commercial Row, [[Blackfriars, London]], and his wife Sarah ''née'' Mathers (1782–1810).&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, family tree and pp. 5 and 13. Gilbert's ODNB entry says her name was Catherine, but Ainger's extensive, and later, research on family history is clear.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both his parents died of tuberculosis by the time William was seven years old, and thereafter, he and his younger siblings, Joseph and Jane, were raised in London by their mother's sister and her husband, Mary ''nee'' Mathers (b. 1778) and John Samuel Schwenck (d. 1865), a childless and financially comfortable couple.  Gilbert's father had also left the children legacies that would be invested by their uncle until the youngest had reached age 21, so Gilbert's would not be due to him until age 26.  With the three young Gilbert children, the Schwencks soon moved from [[Lambeth]] to a larger house in [[Clapham]], where they raised the children with affection.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert served the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]] as a [[midshipman]] from 1818 (age 14) to 1821 but was unhappy with the conditions, and so he quit the service. He then spent several years in Italy, returning to England about 1825. There he studied at [[Guy's Hospital]] and served as an assistant surgeon in the navy, and then he entered the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1830.  At this time, he received his an annuity from his father's estate, giving him financial independence, and also published a volume of his poetry.  He first married Mary Ann Skelton in 1832, who died two years later at around age 20.  By this time, he had privately published another book, but after the death of his wife, he published no more for many years.  He married Anne Mary Bye Morris (1811–1888), age 24, on 14 February 1836.  She was the daughter of Thomas Morris (1760–1849), an apothecary, and Christiana ''nee'' Sutherland (1777–1845).  The couple's famous son, [[W. S. Gilbert]], was born on 18 November 1836 at the Morris's house in Southampton Street. The Gilberts then moved to [[Hammersmith]], near Anne's sister Harriet and her family.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, family tree and pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, Gilbert took his wife and toddler on a long trip to Italy, where he had lived as a young man.  There, their daughter Jane Morris Gilbert (1838–1906) was born.  In 1841, Gilbert's brother and sister, Joseph and Jane, both died of tuberculosis.  Gilbert received some property owned by his sister and became a potential co-guardian to Joseph's two young sons, together with the Schwencks.  In 1843, his daughter Mary Florence (1843–1911) was born.  In early 1845, Gilbert decided to take custody of his two young nephews from their mother, Catherine, who had begun a relationship with an officer of the East India Company.  She brought a custody lawsuit and her children were returned to her.  Amidst considerable publicity critical of Gilbert and the Schwencks, Gilbert fled with his young family to [[Boulogne]], France, where his daughter, Anne Maude (1845–1932), was born. The family lived there for two years and returned to London in 1847, moving to [[Brompton, London|Brompton]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert and Anne "led an increasingly quarrelsome life" in London.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Stedman, Jane. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10707/10707?back=,33400 "Gilbert, William (1804–1890)"], ''Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 21 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early writing career===
Gilbert began his writing career around 1857. He was concerned, throughout his life, with the welfare of the poor and served as honorary secretary of the Society of the Relief of Distress. His interest in the poor is evident in his writing, and one of his recurring themes was that poverty and alcohol, not genealogy, was the major cause of crime and the main factor in one's later fortunes. This theme would also be seen in his son's writing.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the elder Gilbert's first pieces was a pamphlet entitled, "On the Present System of Rating for the Relief of the Poor in the Metropolis" (1857). In 1858, anonymously, Gilbert published ''Dives and Lazarus, or the adventures of an obscure medical man in a low neighbourhood.''  The book was a fictional account focusing on what Gilbert saw as the increasing disparity in the lives of the rich and the poor. A similar theme pervades another early Gilbert novel, ''The Weaver's Family'' (1860). This theme continued to concern Gilbert throughout his career including in ''Contrasts; dedicated to the ratepayers of London'' (1873) and in one of his fiercest attacks on social abuses, ''The City; An Inquiry into the Corporation, its livery companies, and the administration of their charities and endowments'' (1877),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wJkHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22william+gilbert%22+%22the+city+an+inquiry%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sw9WUwYZGX&amp;sig=FCDBe9_AfGizfqHEEtVz79G0qw8 Online googlebooks version of ''The City'']&lt;/ref&gt; describing how 50,000 working-class people were evicted from their dwellings to make room for the [[Metropolitan Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;  In an age of [[male chauvinism]], Gilbert also wrote several articles about discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian. "The Beginnings of Bab: a perspective", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 3, issue 21, Summer 2007, pp. 662–63&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Gilbert published a novel, ''Margaret Meadows, A Tale for the Pharisees''. This was made into a play called ''Mary Warner'' by [[Tom Taylor]] in 1869, who was forced to pay Gilbert a settlement for plagiarising his novel. Gilbert's most successful early novel was ''Shirley Hall Asylum: Or the Memoirs of a Monomaniac'' (1863), which told the stories of inmates of a lunatic asylum from the point of view of an escapee driven mad by trying to solve the problem of [[perpetual motion]]. Gilbert's first novel published under his own name was ''Christmas Tale: The Rosary, a Legend of Wilton Abbey'' (1863). The story purports to be the written confession of one Alicia Longspée, who had been Lady Abbess of the [[Wilton Abbey|Benedictine Convent at Wilton]] in the 15th century. Gilbert's next novel, ''De Profundis, a tale of the social deposits'' (1864) is the story of a foundling rescued by a Scottish Fusilier Guardsman stationed in London. The foundling grows up to marry the guardsman's daughter. Another 1864 book was ''The Goldsworthy Family, or the country attorney'', about an unethical lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's 1865 book, ''The Magic Mirror'' (about a mirror that grants wishes), containing stories with a moral was illustrated by his multi-talented son. Gilbert also wrote histories and articles and stories for numerous periodicals (often anonymously), including ''Cornhill, Temple Bar, St. Paul's, the Quiver, The Contemporary Review, The Sunday Magazine, Good Things, Good Words, Strahan's Boy's and Girl's (sic) Annual'' and ''The Fortnightly Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Gilbert's best-known, and most popular, works were his ''Innominato'' tales of the supernatural, published in various magazines, including ''[[Argosy Magazine|Argosy]]'', and finally collected in [http://www.haddon-hall.com/Libretti/WizardOfTheMountainFirst.pdf ''The Wizard of the Mountain'' (1867)]. One of the best-known is "The Last Lords of Gardonal" (1867).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/lastlord.htm Online copy of "The Last Lords of Gardonal"]&lt;/ref&gt;  These stories concerned the adventures of an enigmatic wizard and astrologer called the Innominato (in English, "Nameless"), in 14th century Italy, who tried to use his powers to help people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jessnevins/vici.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+17:04:22 Article about the Innominato character]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1868, Gilbert wrote ''The Doctor of Beauweir, an autobiography'', told from the point of view of a South Wales medic.  ''King George's Middy'' (1869), also illustrated by W. S. Gilbert, relates the adventures of a [[Leicestershire]] squire's son who becomes a midshipman and is marooned of the coast of Africa. Another 1869 novel was Sir Thomas Branston. Later that year, Gilbert produced his most famous biography, ''Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara: a biography: Illustrated by rare and unpublished documents''. In this work, Gilbert concluded, after extensive research, that there was no evidence of the acts of gross immorality of which Borgia was accused, including murder. This was followed in 1870 by ''The Inquisitor, or the Struggle in Ferrara'', about the life of [[Renée of France]], Duchess of Ferrara, set in 1554.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 297–98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the novel ''Martha'' was followed by ''The Landlord of the "Sun"'', again describing a descent into degradation, this time involving a villainous seducer, an illegitimate child and drunkenness, and, in 1873, by ''Clara Levesque.''  Another theme that was seen in Gilbert's writings was his dislike of established religion and the Roman Catholic Church in particular. Two works on this theme included ''Facta non Verba: a comparison between the good works performed by the ladies in Roman Catholic communities in England and the unfettered efforts of their Protestant sisters'' (1874) and ''Disestablishment from a Church point of view'' (1875).&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 298–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert had a mercurial temper and was difficult to live with, imposing arbitrary restrictions on his wife and daughters. After many years of strained relations with his wife, Gilbert left home and separated from her in 1876 after forty years of marriage. He left his wife and daughters substantial incomes and the family home, assuming that he would be able to earn a good living from his writing.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he soon became seriously ill and appeared to be dying, and his doctors advised him not to write. His wife did not assist in his care and did not, ultimately, allow him to return home. Her son appealed to her on his father's behalf, but she would not change her mind. W. S. Gilbert apparently never contacted his mother again.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Gilbert went to live with Jane, his only married daughter, and her husband in The Close at [[Salisbury]], where he resided for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Gilbert published ''Them Boots'', another description of characters from the lowest class of society, as well as ''The City''. Pursuing another favourite theme, the dangers of drink, Gilbert also published in 1877 ''Nothing but the Truth, an unvarnished picture of the effects of intemperance'', and example of his many writings about the dangers of alcohol. 1879 saw the publication of ''Mrs. Dubosq's Bible'', about a French [[Huguenot]] group in [[Spitalfields]] in the 18th century, and the possession of a 1650 Geneva Bible by a poor person. In 1880, ''Memoirs of a Cynic'' was a protest against cruelty and hypocrisy. This was followed in 1881 by ''Modern Wonders of the World, or the new Sinbad'', a series of 10 stories told to London children by Hassan, the son of an Egyptian slave dealer. His last book, published in 1882, ''Legion, or the modern demoniac'', returns to Gilbert's campaign against drink, which, he illustrated, leads to "crime, profligacy, suicide, homicide, brutality, cruelty, pauperism, idiocy and insanity."&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 300–01&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert died at the age of 86 and was buried in The Close at Salisbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Direct descendants of the Gilbert family still live in [[Cornwall]], England.

==Description==
''Witches' Sabbath'' shows the devil in the form of a [[garland]]ed goat, surrounded by a [[coven]] of disfigured, young and aging witches in a moonlit barren landscape. The goat possesses large horns and is crowned by a wreath of oak leaves. An old witch holds an infant in her hands. The devil seems to be acting as priest at an initiation ceremony for the child, though popular superstition at the time believed the devil often fed on children and human fetuses. The skeletons of two infants can be seen; one discarded to the left, the other held by a [[crone]] in the centre foreground.

Typical of the imagery of [[witchcraft]], many of the symbols used are inverted.

Goya used the imagery of covens of witches in a number of works, most notably in one of his ''[[Black Paintings]]'', ''[[Witches' Sabbath (The Great He-Goat)|Witches' Sabbath or The Great He-Goat]]'' (1821–1823).

Interest in the supernatural was a feature of [[Romanticism]], and is to be found for example in Weber's opera ''[[Der Freischütz]]''.  However, in a Spanish context, Goya's paintings have been seen as a protest against those who upheld and enforced the values of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], which had been active in [[Witch-hunt|Witch hunting]] during the seventeenth-century [[Basque witch trials]]. The later ''Witches Sabbath'' was painted as a bitter struggle raged between liberals and those in favour of a church and a [[royalist]]-lead state, which culminated in the so-called [[Ominous Decade]] (1823-1833).&lt;ref name="NYM"&gt;"Dark Knight". ''New York Magazine'', Volume 22, No. 2, 1989. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;
Both paintings can be seen as an attack on the superstitious beliefs rife in Spain during a period when tales of midnight gatherings of witches and the appearance of the devil were commonplace among the rural populace.
They reflect the artist's disdain for the popular tendency towards superstition and the church-led return to medieval fears.  Goya's depictions of such scenes mocked what he saw as medieval fears exploited by the established order for political and capital gain.&lt;ref&gt;Boime, 262&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Master Clam Catches a Shrimp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Master Clam catching a Shrimp. Southern Song Dynasty, mid-13th century. Property of the Freer Sackler Gallery.]]
'''Xianzi''' ({{zh|t=蜆子}}), or '''Kensu''' in Japanese, also known as the Shrimp Eater, was a semi-historical [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]]/[[Zen]] monk, considered to be one of the “scattered sages,” who were deviant or otherwise unusual figures within the Chan tradition. Infamous for his iconoclastic breaking of the taboo on eating meat set forth in the [[Vinaya|Vinaya Code]] of monastic rules, the Shrimp Eater appears in several traditional Zen paintings as both a comedic figure that underscores the Zen tradition of humor, as well as an eccentric, enlightened individual.

== Sources ==
Most information on Xianzi comes from the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'', a collection of hagiographies (1004-1007 C.E.) intended to highlight the “anti-textualism and iconoclasm of the Chan monks”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Absconding |date=2009 |publisher=Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the Harvard Art Museum |author1=Pellizzi, Francesco |author2=Crow, Thomas |author3=Taws, Richard |author4=Casati, Roberto |isbn=9780873658546 |location=Cambridge, Mass |oclc=319493067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included within this collection of hagiographies are many nontraditional Chan Buddhist figures, such as Xianzi, who never became patriarchs or abbots on their own, but whose stories were still considered vital for the transmission of Chan teachings. Additional information on Xianzi comes from the poems and inscriptions that monks wrote on paintings of him. One such inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Japanese painter Josetsu reads:
{{Quote|text=Zen believers say the origin [of all things] is emptiness&lt;br&gt;
An enlightened one like you – is there another?&lt;br&gt;
Cold or hot, just one plain robe is enough.&lt;br&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Buddhist Patriarch Kensu with Shrimp LACMA AC1994.139.1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Buddhist Patriarch Kensu with Shrimp. Late 17th Century Japan.]]
It is recorded in the Jing-de Era Record that Xianzi lived in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and was a pupil to [[Dongshan Liangjie]] 洞山良價, the founder of the [[Caodong school|Caodong]] 曹洞, or Sōtō, school of Chan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Zen : masters of meditation in images and writings |author1=Brinker, Helmut |date=1996 |publisher=Artibus Asiae |author2=Kanazawa, Hiroshi |others=Museum Rietberg |isbn=3907070623 |location=Zürich |oclc=34569329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was known to never have taken students of his own or teach the dharma&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sengai : master Zen painter |author1=Furuta, Shōkin |date=2000 |publisher=Kodansha International |author2=Tsukimura, Reiko |isbn=4770023286 |location=Tokyo |oclc=44059558}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sengai), Xianzi was renowned for his eccentricities. Specifically, he was known to catch and eat shrimp, clams, and prawns from nearby lakes and streams, despite the Buddhist prohibition against consuming meat. Paradoxically, Xianzi was said to have attained enlightenment a moment after he had caught a shrimp and was preparing himself to consume it. For this reason, he was understood to be an enlightened individual and carrier of the transmission, rather than a degenerate monk and rule breaker.

In addition to his eccentricities regarding the consumption of meat, Xianzi was known as a wanderer, never living in or belonging to an official monastery despite his lineage ties to the founder of one of Chinese preeminent schools of Chan Buddhism. Instead, he preferred to mingle with laypeople, spending most of his days catching his dinner. He did not wear the [[Kasaya (clothing)|elaborate robes]] of a more traditional Chinese monk, instead wearing the same ragged robe during both summer and winter. At night, he slept beneath the paper offerings at the [[White Horse Temple]], much as a homeless would in the modern day. Some have even speculated that he was crazy, although some secondary sources suggest that he was just feigning madness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Vinaya Code ===
The Vinaya was the set of rules and principles that governed many Buddhist monastic communities. Among these rules were prohibitions against having sexual intercourse, regulations on begging, and an iron-clad ban on eating meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The essentials of the Vinaya tradition |author=Gyōnen, Gishin |date=1995 |publisher=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research |isbn=0962561894 |location=Berkeley, Calif. |oclc=35978564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks who broke these rules were said to have committed “[[Parajika|pārājika]],” or the eight misbehaviors and were declared “asaṃvāsa,” which means outside of the Buddhist religious community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Shayne|date=|title=When and Where Is a Monk No Longer a Monk? On Communion and Communities in Indian Buddhist Monastic Law Codes.|url=|journal=Indo-Iranian Journal|volume=52.2|pages=115–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those deemed outside of the Buddhist religious community were not excommunicated per se, but rather were seen as deviants who were not representative of the tradition that they espoused. As someone who routinely ate fish, Xianzi would have certainly been considered asaṃvāsa under the Vinaya Code. The very paintings of Xianzi violate the Vinaya Code to a certain degree, because scholarship shows that originally, the code prohibited humor and laughter, believing it to be counterproductive to a monk’s serious undertakings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other parts of the Vinaya Code insist on humility and poverty. The expensive, elaborate robes of high society were frowned on, and monks were supposed to wear the cast-off rags of society. Additionally, in the late 8th century, the Chan master Bozhang recognized the changing dynamics of monastic life, and created the Bozhang qinggui 百丈淸規, which were additional rules for monastic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The spirit of Zen : a way of life, work and art in the Far East |author=Watts, Alan |date=1960 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=0802130569 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=8710916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new rules reformed the ways that monks obtained their food, mandating that monks devote part of their time not just to begging for alms, but instead providing some sort of labor, causing monks to work for their food. Many farms were set up alongside monasteries as a result. Although Xianzi did break some basic Vinaya rules, he also upheld others. His dress is simple and although his consumption of meat may have been blasphemous, he did fulfill the responsibility laid out in the Bozhang qinggui of laboring for his food.

=== Xianzi as a Symbol of Zen Humor ===
[[File:The Shrimp Eater.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|The Shrimp Eater. Hanging scroll with inscription done by the monk-painter Muqi Fachang during mid-13th century China.]]
Humor is thought to be one of the defining elements of Chan/Zen teaching, and that humor is almost certainly reflected in the case of Xianzi. Some argue that Chan/Zen masters used humor as a means of conveying its essential wordless transmission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a similar way that [[Mahākāśyapa]] wordlessly received the transmission of the dharma through [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni]] Buddha’s [[Flower Sermon|flower sermon]], so too will those who look upon a humorous Chan/Zen painting wordlessly receive the transmission, provided that they get the joke. Understanding humor requires rigor and training, because humor without full-mindedness is grotesque and meaningless, while full-mindedness without awareness of its limitations is empty. In this way, it is argued that Chan/Zen humor is used to replicate the experience of no-mind that Chan/Zen teachings are based on.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Zen humor, as in the case of Xianzi, is typically irreverent and iconoclastic. The paradox of Xianzi is that even though he shamelessly breaks monastic rules by eating meat, that is the way in which he achieved enlightenment. An inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Chinese monk-painter [[Muqi Fachang]] 牧溪法常 (ca. 1210-ca. 1279) &lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;alludes to this, reading:
{{Quote|text=Picking up his net at random and dragging it through the mud,&lt;br&gt;
Wading across the water, illicit goods emerge before him&lt;br&gt;
He comes face to face with this troublesome taboo&lt;br&gt;
If the offering tray from the altar for the gods is missing,&lt;br&gt;
It is because in the end he never cast off the handiwork of demons|sign=|source=Unknown}}&lt;blockquote&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, Kun. The Form of no-Form: Reconstructing Huineng in Two Paintings by Liang Kai. Order No. 10599033 University of Oregon, 2017 Ann Arbor ProQuest. 26 Mar. 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This kind of irreverence for Buddhist teachings and traditions is repeated in other figures such as the ebullient [[Budai|Budai/Hotei]] 布袋, known literally as the laughing monk. It is speculated that the reason for Chan/Zen’s strong use of humor is that although Chan/Zen Buddhism held itself as being unique for having received the true transmission in an unbroken lineage from Shakyamuni Buddha, in everyday life there were few things that separated Chan/Zen monks from those of other sects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They frequently lived in the same monasteries, abided by the same rules, and read the same sutras. Humor was used to differentiate Chan/Zen from the rest, because it made fun of the very precepts that all of the other schools adhered to so rigorously. By asserting its iconoclastic side, Chan/Zen teachings professed their true knowledge and possession of the transmission.

=== The Scattered Sages ===
[[File:The Zen Eccentric Zhutou.jpg|thumb|upright|The Zen Eccentric Zhutou (Zhimeng.) Painted in the early 16th century Muromachi Period Japan by Josetsu.]]
Xianzi is one of several traditional Chan/Zen figures known as the “scattered sages,” many of which are depicted with in the same humorous, iconoclastic light. Examples of other Scattered Sages include the laughing monk Budai/Hotei, Tanka 丹霞 the icon burner, the Four Sleepers ([[Hanshan (poet)|Hanshan]] 寒山, [[Shide (monk)|Shide]] 拾得, [[Fenggan]] 豐干, and Fenggan’s tiger,) and Zhimeng 智猛.

Zhimeng in particular bears similarities to Xianzi, because he was a figure famous for eating pig’s heads as his favorite treat, much in the same way that Xianzi favored eating shrimp. As a result of their similarities, it was not uncommon for hanging scrolls of Xianzi and Zhimeng to be exhibited together. The artist Josetsu (1405-1496,) for instance, painted the two individually, but their paintings are strikingly similar and are displayed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.artsmia.org/art/122101/the-zen-eccentric-zhutou-right-of-a-pair-of-zhutou-and-xianzi-yogetsu|title=The Zen Eccentric Zhutou|last=|first=|date=|website=The Minneapolis Institute of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars theorize that many of the Scattered Sages actually predate Chan/Zen Buddhism and exist outside of its religious context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were absorbed into the Chan/Zen pantheon as a means of co-opting traditional Chinese culture, enhancing Chan/Zen’s cultural appeal and diverting local customs into a Buddhist framework. However, the evidence for this in the case of Xianzi is limited and no hard conclusions can be drawn.

Although his name can be translated as “Master Clam” and in his biography he is said to have eaten both shrimp and clams, Xianzi is always painted holding a shrimp in his hand and never a clam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, he is frequently painted with his fishing net in one hand to show that he caught his prey himself. His beard is always painted with blurry grey brushstrokes, and although his robes are always relatively simple and never decorated or elaborate, sometimes they more closely resemble the traditional robes of monk, rather than those of a peasant. His humble lifestyle is never drawn into question and his poverty is always made clear. Lastly, all known paintings of Xianzi show him eating shrimp – details of his life outside of his shrimp-eating habit are sometimes alluded to in the inscriptions and poems written at the top of the painting, but they are never explicitly shown.
[[File:The Zen Eccentric Xianzi.jpg|thumb|upright|The Zen Eccentric Xianzi. Painted in the early 16th century Muromachi Period Japan by Josetsu.]]
Much of Xianzi’s iconography remains the same from painting to painting, but there seem to be three general categories of depicting him; in one, Xianzi holds the shrimp above his head with his mouth open as if to eat it, while in the second he holds it in front of his face at eye level, intently examining it. In the former category, Xianzi is also frequently smiling and standing more informally, while in the latter category his posture is more restrained. Although when Xianzi is painted looking at the shrimp with his mouth closed he can either be wearing the robes of a monk or the simpler, more ragged robes of the destitute, he is never painted both with his mouth open to eat the shrimp and the robes of a monk. In those paintings, his dress is not representative of the monastic tradition. The third way in which Xianzi is painted shows him actually fishing, with one shrimp already in his hand to show what exactly he is doing. He is intent on his work and pursues no other activities.

Like many paintings done of the “scattered sages,” all paintings of Xianzi are done in the style of apparition painting. They are monochromatic ink paintings, frequently executed on hanging scrolls. The reason for the dominance of this particular style is that even though most paintings of Xianzi and other Scattered Sages were done by monk painters, it is understood that the audience they were trying to appeal to was the Chinese literati and scholastic community of Song Dynasty China, which preferred the apparition painting style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These paintings were frequently given as gifts to members of the scholar elite, and so they naturally reflected the tastes of their recipients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Image:Images d'Epinal.jpg|thumb|Old commercial signal pointing to the Imagerie d'Épinal location]]
'''Épinal prints''' were prints on popular subjects rendered in bright sharp colours, sold in [[France]] in the 19th century.  They owe their name to the fact that the first publisher of such images &amp;mdash; [[Jean-Charles Pellerin]] &amp;mdash; having been born in [[Épinal]], named the printing house he founded in 1796, ''[[Imagerie d'Épinal]].'' 

The expression ''image d'Épinal'' has become proverbial in French and refers to an emphatically traditionalist and naïve depiction of something, showing only its good aspects.

The prints were also a regular point of comparison for criticizing paintings by Courbet - notably his Burial at Ornans and Peasants of Flagey Returning from the Fair - and Manet.  Acknowledging the proximity of some of Manet's works, like his Fifer, Zola turned the comparison into praise.
