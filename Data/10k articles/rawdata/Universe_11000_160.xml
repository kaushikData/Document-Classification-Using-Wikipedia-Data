The '''1983 Melbourne [[dust storm]]''' was a [[meteorological phenomenon]] that occurred during the afternoon of 8 February 1983, throughout much of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] and affected the capital, [[Melbourne]]. Red soil, dust and sand from Central and Southeastern Australia was swept up in high winds and carried southeast through Victoria. The dust storm was one of the most dramatic consequences of the 1982/83 drought, at the time the worst in Australian history and is, in hindsight, viewed as a precursor to the [[Ash Wednesday fires|Ash Wednesday bushfires]] which were to occur eight days later.

==Background==
In late 1982 and early 1983, the [[El Niño]] weather cycle had brought record [[drought]] to almost all of eastern [[Australia]], with Victoria's [[The Mallee|Mallee]] and northern [[Wimmera]] severely affected.

During the morning of Tuesday 8 February 1983, a strong but dry cold front began to cross Victoria, preceded by hot, gusty northerly winds. The loose topsoil in the Mallee and Wimmera was picked up by the wind and collected into a huge cloud of dust that heralded the cool change. At [[Horsham, Victoria|Horsham]] in western Victoria, raised dust was observed by 11:00am.  Within an hour, it had obscured the sky.

Fed by the strong northerly, the temperature in [[Melbourne]] rose quickly and by 2:35pm it had reached {{convert|43.2|C}}, at that time a record February maximum. Around the same time, a dramatic red-brown cloud could be seen approaching the city.

The dust storm hit Melbourne just before 3:00pm, accompanied by a rapid drop in temperature and a fierce wind change that uprooted trees and damaged houses. Within minutes, visibility in the capital had plunged to {{convert|100|m}}. City workers huddled in doorways, covering their mouths from the choking dust, and traffic came to a standstill.

The worst of the storm was over by 4:00pm, when the wind speed dropped.  The dust cloud was approximately {{convert|320|m}} high when it struck Melbourne, but in other areas of Victoria it extended thousands of metres into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;''Drought, dust and deluge : a century of climatic extremes in Australia'' (2004) : Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that about 50,000 tonnes of topsoil were stripped from the Mallee (approximately 1,000 tonnes of it being dumped on the city). The combined effect of drought and dust storm inflicted damage on the land that, according to the then President of the Victorian Farmers and Graziers’ Association, would take up to 10 years and tens of millions of dollars to repair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/storm7.html The Melbourne dust-storm of February 1983]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact weather pattern that had caused the dust storm was repeated one week later, when the [[Ash Wednesday fires]] caused enormous destruction and loss of life.

'''A.D.O.R.''', born '''Eddie Castellanos''', is a U.S. hip hop artist whose work includes the [[Pete Rock]]-produced hit "Let It All Hang Out" ([[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], 1992), and "One for the Trouble" (Atlantic, 1994), produced by [[Marley Marl]]. The latter has been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] extensively in later songs, most famously [[Fatboy Slim]]'s 1998 remix of "Renegade Master" by [[Roger McKenzie|Roger "Wildchild" MacKenzie]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Castellanos was born in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights, New York City]]. His father was a musician by profession, and as a child Castellanos attended his shows. At six years of age he moved with his family to [[Mount Vernon, New York]], later to be known in hip hop circles as "money earnin' Mount Vernon" due to the preponderance of rap stars it produced.The future A.D.O.R. went to high school there, where he met [[Sean Combs]], [[Heavy D]], Al B. Sure, and [[Pete Rock]]. Becoming interested in hip hop, he took the name A.D.O.R. (standing for both Another Dimension of Rhythm and A Declaration Of A Revolution). Sean Combs, by this time working at [[Uptown Records]], began presenting A.D.O.R.'s demo tapes to record companies. Heavy D's DJ, DJ Eddie F, secured him a management and production deal. In 1992 he recorded his first record, the single "Let It All Hang Out", for [[Atlantic Records]].&lt;ref name=am1/&gt;

==="Let It All Hang Out"===
The musical backing for A.D.O.R.'s raps on "Let It All Hang Out" was by his old friend Pete Rock, by 1992 already an acclaimed producer, and now commonly cited as one of the hip hop genre's best. Stanton Swihart of [[allmusic]] describes the track as an "infectious" outing that was an "instant classic" on release, driven by Rock's "irresistible horn loop" and the "tight flow" of A.D.O.R.'s rhymes. A hit in the summer of 1992, for Swihart its qualities have now proved timeless.&lt;ref name=am1&gt;Stanton Swihart. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:difyxqlhldke~T1 A.D.O.R. Biography]", allmusic, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=am2&gt;Stanton Swihart. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gbfpxqwjldse A.D.O.R.: Shock Therapy]", allmusic, undated.&lt;/ref&gt; HipHopDX calls "Let It All Hang Out" "a certifiable Pete Rock classic", with "delicious horns" that no other producer could emulate.&lt;ref name=dx&gt;J-22. "[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.370 A.D.O.R. - Classic Bangerz]", hiphopdx, January 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Though most critical commentary focuses on the production, the rapper's contribution is roundly praised; Steve Juon of RapReviews notes in particular that the record established A.D.O.R.'s distinctive, high-pitched register.&lt;ref name=juon&gt;Steve Juon. "[http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2003_12_bangerzv1.html A.D.O.R. :: Classic Bangerz Volume 1 :: Tru Reign Records ] rapreviews, December 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="One for the Trouble" and ''The Concrete''===
A.D.O.R. toured with major acts and made television appearances building on the buzz created by "Let It All Hang Out". In 1994 he followed up with a second single, "One for the Trouble", produced by K-Def and the legendary Queensbridge producer [[Marley Marl]]. This record provided the "back once again with the ill behaviour" vocal snippet which dominates [[Fatboy Slim]]'s 1998 hit remix of "Renegade Master" by [[Roger McKenzie|Wildchild]]. "One for the Trouble" signaled  that plans were underway for a debut album on Atlantic titled ''The Concrete''. Despite his successful run at the major label, A.D.O.R. was let go from his contract with Atlantic in 1995 without ''The Concrete'' being released, reportedly because of disputes over creative decisions, even though promotional items were released and the catalogue number 82443 was assigned to the release.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;Gabrielle Schafer. "[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ador/articles/story/5927916/tru_reign_signs_deal_with_sumthing_distribution Tru Reign Signs Deal With Sumthing Distribution ]", ''Rolling Stone'', January 6, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tru Reign: ''Shock Therapy''===
A.D.O.R. formed his own record company in 1996: Tru Reign Records. For his fledgling label he immediately recorded and released as a single another Pete Rock track, "Enter the Center". It was a successful venture. Stanton reports that it sold "remarkably well" given its independent, small scale distribution, and received heavy radio play.&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; He considers it the equal of its predecessor "Let It All Hang Out", but Juon goes further, offering that both Rock and Castellanos had improved their respective techniques in the six years between the two tracks. He draws attention to a new-found depth in the lyrical content of A.D.O.R.'s rap, putting this advancement down to maturity and experience in the later record.&lt;ref name=juon/&gt; HipHopDX's reviewer found in "Enter the Center" "more of Pete Rock's understated brilliance".&lt;ref name=dx/&gt; A.D.O.R.'s singles to date were collected on his debut album for Tru Reign, ''Shock Frequency'' (1998). Rock and Marley Marl were joined there by [[Diamond D]] and [[DJ Clark Kent|Clark Kent]], making an impressive roster. "Shock to Bliss" and "Shock Frequency" were reminiscent of Rock's cuts, and almost as good, and Kent's contribution "From the Concrete" completed the album's highlights. The record as a whole betrayed its 1992 roots, though reviewers found this was not a bad thing, even if it did mean that it seemed to lack relevance or urgency in the musical climate of 1998.&lt;ref name=am2/&gt;

===''Classic Bangerz'', ''The Signature of the Ill'', and beyond===
In January 2000, Tru Reign secured a distribution deal with [[Nile Rodgers]]' company Sumpthing Distribution. By this time, A.D.O.R.'s roster at Tru Reign also included artists K The Terrorbull, Nappy Redd &amp; Filthy Rich, and Cristal Lane.&lt;ref name=stone/&gt; A.D.O.R. released the album ''Animal 2000'' in this year. All was quiet until 2003, when he reemerged with the compilation ''Classic Bangers, Vol. 1'', and then an album of new music, ''Signature of the Ill'', in 2005. Both were received favorably by critics, yet the praise was again qualified as it had been with ''Shock Frequency''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s reception: the compilation of old material (which mined ''Shock Frequency'' heavily) ''and'' the collection of new music both seemed throwbacks to simpler times, with lyrics that concentrated on fun and a smooth flow rather than the trickery and internal or polysyllabic rhyme schemes of virtuoso rappers following in the wake of [[Biggie]] or [[Big Pun|Pun]].&lt;ref name=dx/&gt;&lt;ref name=juon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Teufel . "
For the song, Step Up. Castellanos hired Producer and Director Ronald Farnham to make the music video, which was shot in Tampa, Florida.

The '''Abadan refinery''' ({{lang-fa|پالایشگاه آبادان}} ''Pālāyeshgāh-e Ābādān'') is located in [[Abadan, Iran|Abadan]] near the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]]. Built by the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (later [[BP]]), it was completed in 1912 and was one of world's largest [[oil refinery|oil refineries]]. Its [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company#Nationalisation and coup|nationalisation in 1951]] prompted the [[Abadan Crisis]] and ultimately the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|toppling]] of the democratically elected&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56651387|title=Iran|last=Kamin.|first=Mohammadi,|last2=1963-|first2=Elliott, Mark,|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=1740594258|oclc=56651387}}&lt;/ref&gt; prime minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mossaddegh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no2/article10.html|title=All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refinery was largely destroyed in September 1980 by Iraq during the initial stages of the Iraqi invasion of Iran's [[Khuzestan]] province, triggering the [[Iraq-Iran war]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}. It had a capacity of 635,000 b/d in 1980 and formed a [[oil refineries|refinery complex]] with important [[petrochemical]] plants. Its capacity has been increased steadily since the war ended in 1988 and is now listed as {{convert|429000|oilbbl/d}} of crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abadan-ref.ir/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=84  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725211827/http://www.abadan-ref.ir/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=84 |date=2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, [[Sinopec]] signed a $1 billion deal to expand the Abadan refinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinopec Signs $1b Abadan Refinery Expansion Deal|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/energy/78896/sinopec-signs-1b-abadan-refinery-expansion-deal|website=Financial Tribune|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bicycle drivetrain systems''' are used to transmit power on [[bicycle]]s, [[tricycle]]s, [[quadracycle]]s, [[unicycle]]s, or other [[Human Powered Vehicle#Human-powered vehicles (HPV)|human-powered vehicle]]s from the riders to the drive wheels. Most also include some type of a [[Transmission (mechanics)|mechanism]] to convert [[speed]] and [[torque]] via [[gear ratio]]s.

==History==
[[File:MacMillan Bicycle Rev.jpg|thumb|A [[treadle bicycle]]]]
The history of bicycle drivetrain systems is closely linked to the [[history of the bicycle]]. Major changes in bicycle form have often been initiated or accompanied by advances in drivetrain systems. Several early drivetrains used straight-cut gears that meshed directly with each other outside of the hub.&lt;ref name=Berto1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bicycles have used a double-sided rear wheel, with different-sized sprockets on each side. To change gears, the rider would stop and dismount, remove the rear wheel and reinstall it in the reverse direction. Derailleur systems were first developed in the late 19th century, but the modern cable-operated parallelogram derailleur was invented in the 1950s.

Bicycle drivetrain systems have been developed to transmit power from riders to drive wheels by a variety of methods. Most bicycle drivetrain systems incorporate a [[freewheel]] to allow [[:wikt:coast|coasting]], but direct drive and fixed-gear systems do not. The latter are sometimes also described as [[bicycle brake systems]].

===Direct===
Some human powered vehicles, both historical and modern, employ [[Direct drive mechanism#Other uses|direct drive]]. Examples include most Penny-farthings, unicycles, and [[Tricycle#Adult and child model comparison|children's tricycles]].

Another interpretation of direct drive is that the rider pushes directly against the ground with a foot, as employed in [[balance bicycle]]s and [[chukudu]]s.

===Two-wheel drive===
In 1991, a two-wheel drive bicycle was marketed under the Legacy name. It used a [[flexible shaft]] and two bevel gears to transmit torque from the rear wheel, driven by a conventional bicycle chain with derailleurs, to the front wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Four-wheel drive|AWD]] system, aimed at mountain bikers, comprises an adapted differential that sends power to the front wheel once the rear begins to slip. In the late 1990s, 2WD 'Dual Power' mountain bikes were sold in Germany under the [[Subaru]] name. They used one belt to transfer power from the rear wheel to the head tube, a small gearbox to allow rotation of the front fork, and then a second belt to transfer power to the front wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Speed and torque conversion==

A cyclist's legs produce power optimally within a narrow pedalling [[Cadence (cycling)|speed range]]. Gearing is optimized to use this narrow range as best as possible. Bicycle drivetrain systems have been developed to convert speed and torque by a variety of methods.

===Implementation===
Several technologies have been developed to alter gear ratios. They can be used individually, as an external derailleur or an internal hub gear, or in combinations such as the [[SRAM Dual Drive#Hybrid gearing with derailleurs|SRAM Dual Drive]], which uses a standard 8 or 9-speed [[Cogset#Cassettes|cassette]] mounted on a three-speed internally geared hub, offering a similar gear range as a bicycle with a cassette and triple [[Crankset#Chainring|chainrings]].

* [[Hub gear]]
** [[NuVinci Continuously Variable Transmission#Bicycles|Continuously variable]]
* [[Gearbox bicycle]]
* [[Retro-Direct]]
* [[Lever]] and [[cam]] mechanism, as in the [[Stringbike]]

===Control===
* [[Shifter (bicycle part)|Shifters]]
** [[Electronic Gear-Shifting System]]
** [[Autobike]]

===Theory===
* [[Bicycle gearing]]
** [[Gear ratio]]
** [[Gear inches]]

===Single-speed===
* [[Single-speed bicycle]]
** [[Fixed-gear bicycle]]

==Integration==
While several combinations of power collection, transmission, and conversion exist, not all combinations are feasible. For example, a shaft-drive is usually accompanied by a hub gear, and derailleurs are usually implemented with chain drive.

'''''Bitter Seeds''''' is a 2011 [[documentary film]] by American filmmaker and [[Movie director|director]] and [[political commentator]] Micha Peled. The film is the third part of Peled's globalization trilogy after ''[[Store Wars: When Wal-Mart Comes to Town]]'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peled, Micha|title=Store Wars: When Wal-Mart Comes to Town|date=2001|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/store-wars-when-walmart-comes-to-town/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[China Blue]]'' (2005).

== Synopsis ==
Micha Peled's documentary on biotech (Bt) farming in [[India]] observes the impact of genetically modified cotton on India's farmers, with a suicide rate of over a quarter million [[Bt cotton]] farmers each year due to financial stress resulting from massive crop failure and the price of Monsanto's Bt seeds.  The film also disputes claims by the biotech industry that Bt cotton requires less pesticide and promises of higher yields, as farmers discover that Bt cotton requires more pesticide than organic cotton, and often suffer higher levels of infestation by [[Mealybug]] resulting in devastating crop losses, and financial and psychological stress on cotton farmers.  Due to the biotech seed monopoly in India, where Bt cotton seed has become the standard, and organic seed has become unobtainable, thus pressuring cotton farmers into signing Bt cotton seed purchase agreements with biotech [[multinational corporation]] [[Monsanto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itvs.org/films/bitter-seeds |title=Bitter Seeds |publisher=ITVS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

'''Calcium hexaboride''' (sometimes '''calcium boride''') is a compound of [[calcium]] and [[boron]] with the chemical formula CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. It is an important material due to its high [[electrical conductivity]], [[hardness]], chemical stability, and [[melting point]]. It is a black, lustrous, chemically inert powder with a low density. It has the cubic structure typical for metal hexaborides, with octahedral units of 6 boron atoms combined with calcium atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Boron and Refractory Borides| author = Matkovich, V. I.| publisher = Springer-Verlag| location = Berlin| year = 1977| isbn = 0-387-08181-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and [[lanthanum]]-doped CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; both show weak [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties, which is a remarkable fact because calcium and boron are neither magnetic, nor have inner 3d or 4f electronic shells, which are usually required for ferromagnetism.

== Properties ==
CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has been investigated in the past due to a variety of peculiar physical properties, such as [[superconductivity]], valence fluctuation and [[Kondo effect]]s.&lt;ref name = kondo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Etourneau |author2=P. Hagenmuller | title = Structure and physical features of the rare-earth borides| doi = 10.1080/13642818508240625 | journal = Philos. Mag. B | volume = 52| issue= 3 |page = 589 | year = 1985|bibcode = 1985PMagB..52..589E }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most remarkable property of CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is its ferromagnetism. It occurs at unexpectedly high temperature (600 K) and with low magnetic moment (below 0.07 [[Bohr magneton|&lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt;]] per atom). The origin of this high temperature ferromagnetism is the ferromagnetic phase of a dilute electron gas, linkage to the presumed excitonic state in calcium boride, or external impurities on the surface of the sample. The impurities might include [[iron]] and [[nickel]], probably coming from impurities in the boron used to prepare the sample.

:CaO + 3 B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 10 Mg → CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 10 MgO

Other methods of producing CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; powder include:
*Direct reaction of calcium or [[calcium oxide]] and boron at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C;
:Ca + 6B → CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

*Reacting Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with boron in vacuum at about 1700&amp;nbsp;°C ([[carbothermal reduction]]);&lt;ref name=otani/&gt;
:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +7B → CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + BO(g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g)

*Reacting [[calcium carbonate]] with [[boron carbide]] in vacuum at above 1400&amp;nbsp;°C (carbothermal reduction)
*Reacting of CaO and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg to 1100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name ="Calcium"/&gt;
*Low-temperature (500&amp;nbsp;°C) synthesis
:CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaCl + 12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4Na
results in relatively poor quality material.&lt;ref name = "Shi"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Shi, L.| journal = Chem.

* To produce pure CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals, e.g., for use as cathode material, the thus obtained CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; powder is further recrystallized and purified with the [[zone melting]] technique.

== Uses ==
Calcium hexaboride is used in the manufacturing of boron-[[alloy]]ed [[steel]] &lt;ref name ="Calcium"/&gt; and as a [[deoxidation]] agent in production of [[oxygen-free copper]]. The latter results in higher conductivity than conventionally phosphorus-deoxidized copper owing to the low solubility of boron in copper.&lt;ref name ="Borides"/&gt; CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can also serve as a high temperature material, surface protection, [[abrasive]]s, tools, and wear resistant material.

CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is highly conductive, has low [[work function]], and thus can be used as a [[hot cathode]] material. When used at elevated temperature, calcium hexaboride will oxidize degrading its properties and shortening its usable lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Organic light-emitting materials and devices|author1=Zhigang R. Li |author2=Hong Meng | publisher = CRC Press| year = 2006| isbn= 1-57444-574-X| page = 516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is also a promising candidate for n-type [[thermoelectric]] materials, because its power factor is larger than or comparable to that of common thermoelectric materials Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and PbTe.&lt;ref name=pyr/&gt;

CaB also can be used as an antioxidant in carbon bonded refractories.

== Precautions ==
Calcium hexaboride is irritating to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system. This product should be handled with proper protective eyeware and clothing. Never put calcium hexaboride down the drain or add water to it.

'''Central oil storage''' (COS), or '''central storage''', is the term used for a communal heating system that began to be utilized in the middle of the twentieth century.

The term also applies to industrial, plant and agricultural applications, all of which may not be communal in nature.

==Household applications==
The concept involved using oil (usually [[kerosene]], but sometimes [[gas oil]]), in the way that [[natural gas]] is used today – it being fed from a central source and metered into individual dwellings on a housing estate.&lt;ref name="Watkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szokolay"/&gt; The concept was utilized by major oil companies such as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt; and [[BP]]. Each household was obliged to use their oil from their tank, unlike the situation where a consumer owns their own tank obtains their own oil.

The book ''Introduction to Architectural Science'' states about liquid fuel storage tanks, "often in a housing development a central storage tank is installed (usually underground) which will be filled by an oil company", and that a supply of liquid fuel is piped to individual apartments or houses from the central storage tank.&lt;ref name="Szokolay"/&gt;

===Logistics===
Oil would be delivered by road tanker and discharged into a tank capable of holding, for example, 5000 [[gallon]]s. This oil would then be piped to each home, initially through a master [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], which then subdivided underground with a branch leading into each property.&lt;ref name="Watkins"/&gt; Each property was provided with a meter located on an outside wall which was read whenever necessary.

A 5,000-gallon tank would usually be installed on an estate numbering up to 50 or 60 properties, although they ranged from a low of about 12 up to a high of in the thousands. The majority of tanks were situated above ground in an elevated position. This meant the oil could flow into each house under the influence of gravity. Other tanks were situated underground and were equipped with an [[electric pump]], usually feeding oil to a small 'header' tank, again in an elevated position, to allow gravity to then distribute the oil.

The level of oil in the tank would be checked regularly and new supplies ordered when necessary. One potential problem with this system is that it was possible, through negligence, for the tank to run dry, resulting in a number of properties being left with no heat.

From the early 1980s, their owners began to close down COS sites. The significant increases in the price of oil had led many customers to convert to gas, solid fuel, or even to install their own oil tank. With fewer and fewer users per site, and maintenance costs remaining the same, the oil companies went through a closure programme, resulting in few sites still being operational in the new millennium.

As at early 2008, the ownership of many sites is unclear. Sites have been sold through a number of companies which have then been closed down. This presents problems for householders and local authorities alike, for when a site experiences a problem – such as an unsafe [[bund wall]], or even a leak – there is no one to pursue to correct matters.

==Industrial applications==
Central oil storage is also performed at industrial and plant locations and operations.&lt;ref name="Van Deventer"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=piAFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA186|title=Handbook of Machine Shop Management|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014|page=186|author1=Deventer|first1=John Herbert Van|year=1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central oil storage in industrial applications may be utilized in part to conserve oil, because oil barrels may leak oil.&lt;ref name="Van Deventer"/&gt;

'''Cirrocumulus castellanus''' is a type of [[cirrocumulus cloud]]. The name ''cirrocumulus [[castellanus]]'' is derived from [[Latin]], meaning "of a castle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of castellanus |url=http://latinlexicon.org/definition.php?p1=1002184 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |author=Numen - The Latin Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clouds appear as round turrets that are rising from either a lowered line or sheet of clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunlop |first=Storm |title=The weather identification handbook |year=2003 |publisher=Lyons Press |location=Guilford, Conn. |isbn=1-58574-857-9 |pages=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR2ft4G5TgQC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=Cirrocumulus%20castellanus&amp;f=false |edition=1st Lyons Press |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirrocumulus castellanus is an indicator of [[atmospheric instability]] at the level of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callanan |first=Martin |title=Cirrocumulus castellanus |url=http://nephology.eu/cirrocumulus/cirrocumulus-castellanus |work=International Cloud Atlas |publisher=nephology.eu |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clouds form when condensation occurs in the base cloud, causing [[latent heat]]ing to occur.

'''Colin Barry Phipps''' (23 July 1934 &amp;ndash; 10 January 2009) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[petroleum]] [[geologist]] and chairman of several petroleum companies. From 1974 to 1979 he was a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Member of Parliament, but in 1980 he joined the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]].

==Early life and studies==
Colin Barry Phipps was born in Britain on 23 July 1934 at [[Swansea]].  He attended Townfield Elementary School in Hayes, [[Middlesex]], then [[Acton High School|Acton County Grammar School]], and the [[Bishop Gore School]], Swansea.  From [[University College London]] he gained a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in [http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk Geology] in 1955; and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk Geology] from the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1957.

==Career==

===Parliament===
He stood in the [[Walthamstow East]] by-election in March 1969, and lost decisively.

He served as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Dudley West (UK Parliament constituency)|Dudley West]] from February 1974 to 1979, when he stood down. His successes in the oil industry made him one of the more wealthy Labour MPs. He joined the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] in the 1980s, and unsuccessfully stood for election in [[Worcester (UK Parliament constituency)|
Worcester]] at the 1983 general election, and [[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]] in 1987.

===Geology===
From 1957 to 1964 Phipps worked with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] in [[Venezuela]], the [[Netherlands]] and the United States.

In 1964, well before North Sea oil was known about, he left Shell and became an independent geology consultant and in 1973 he founded Clyde Petroleum, which had many involvements in [[North Sea oil]]. While working with this company he was also an MP from 1974 to 1979. He  became the company's Chief Executive from 1979 to 1983 and its Chairman from 1983 to 1995.

From 1989 to 2002 Phipps was Chairman of Greenwich Resources, a [[gold mining]] company. He was Chairman of the English String Orchestra (and was also involved with the English Symphony Orchestra) and [[Falklands Conservation]] from 1990 to 1992.

In 1996 he founded [[Desire Petroleum]], remaining Chairman until his death in 2009.  Although Phipps had visited the [[Falkland Islands]] in 1975, he did not become hopeful about oil prospects in the area until 2004, when a seismic survey of the [[Geology of the Falkland Islands|geology]] showed considerable quantities of oil.

==Personal life==
In 1965 he married Marion Lawrey, and they had two sons and two daughters.

Phipps died on 10 January 2009, in a Birmingham hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malverngazette.co.uk/news/local/4054159.Oil_exploration_pioneer_passes_away/ Oil exploration pioneer passes away]&lt;/ref&gt;

He owned a {{convert|195|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in [[Worcestershire]].

It is distinguished from other, non-cementitious [[types of concrete]] all binding some form of aggregate together, including [[asphalt concrete]] with a [[bitumen]] binder, which is frequently used for [[road surface]]s, and [[polymer concrete]]s that use polymers as a binder.

When aggregate is mixed together with dry Portland cement and water, the mixture forms a fluid [[slurry]] that is easily poured and molded into shape. The cement reacts chemically with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses.&lt;ref&gt;Zongjin Li; ''Advanced concrete technology''; 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Often, additives (such as [[pozzolan]]s or [[superplasticizer]]s) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material. Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as [[rebar]]) embedded to provide [[tensile strength]], yielding [[reinforced concrete]].

Famous concrete structures include the [[Hoover Dam]], the [[Panama Canal]] and the Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. The earliest large-scale users of concrete technology were the [[ancient Romans]], and concrete was widely used in the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Colosseum]] in Rome was built largely of concrete, and the concrete dome of the Pantheon is the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/chapt01/chapt01.htm |title=The Pantheon |first=David |last=Moore |work=romanconcrete.com |date=1999 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001052926/http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/chapt01/chapt01.htm |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, large concrete structures (for example, [[dam]]s and multi-storey car parks) are usually made with reinforced concrete.

After the Roman Empire collapsed, use of concrete became rare until the technology was redeveloped in the mid-18th century. Worldwide, concrete has overtaken steel in tonnage of material used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9suuDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=concrete+usage+Vaclav+Smil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNjdma0urbAhUC3FMKHciABVUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=concrete&amp;f=false|title=Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization|last=Smil|first=Vaclav|date=2016-12-04|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781365581908|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word concrete comes from the Latin word "''concretus''" (meaning compact or condensed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=concretus|url=http://latinlookup.com/word/12124/concretus|publisher=Latin Lookup|accessdate=1 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512013931/http://latinlookup.com/word/12124/concretus|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the perfect passive participle of "''concrescere''", from "''con''-" (together) and "''crescere''" (to grow).

==History==
===Prehistory===
Small-scale production of concrete-like materials dates to 6500 BC, pioneered by the [[Nabataea]] traders or [[Bedouins]], who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan. They discovered the advantages of hydraulic lime, with some self-cementing properties, by 700 BC.  They built [[kiln]]s to supply mortar for the construction of rubble-wall houses, concrete floors, and underground waterproof [[cistern]]s. They kept the cisterns secret as these enabled the Nabataea to thrive in the desert.&lt;ref name="nachi.org"/&gt; Some of these structures survive to this day.&lt;ref name="nachi.org"&gt;From The History of Concrete - InterNACHI http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm#ixzz31V47Zuuj {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115151648/http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm |date=15 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical era===
In the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian and later [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras, builders re-discovered that adding [[Pozzolan|volcanic ash]] to the mix allowed it to set underwater.

German archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] found concrete floors, which were made of lime and pebbles, in the royal palace of [[Tiryns]], Greece, which dates roughly to 1400–1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heinrich Schliemann|author2=Wilhelm Dörpfeld|author3=Felix Adler|title=Tiryns: The Prehistoric Palace of the Kings of Tiryns, the Results of the Latest Excavations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pw4BAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA203|year=1885|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York, New York|pages=190, 203, 204, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Carolina Sparavigna, [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1110/1110.5230.pdf "Ancient concrete works"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lime mortars were used in Greece, Crete, and Cyprus in 800 BC.  The [[Assyria]]n Jerwan Aqueduct (688 BC) made use of [[waterproof concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen T and Lloyd S, (1935) "Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan," ''Oriental Institute Publications'' 24, Chicago University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Concrete was used for construction in many ancient structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ancient Concrete Structures|author=Stella L. Marusin|publisher=Concrete International|volume=18|issue=1|pages=56–58|date=1 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans used concrete extensively from 300 BC to 476 AD, a span of more than seven hundred years.&lt;ref name=MAST&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Concrete|url=http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/hist.html|publisher=Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127052951/http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/hist.html|archivedate=27 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Roman Empire, [[Roman concrete]] (or ''[[opus caementicium]]'') was made from [[quicklime]], [[pozzolana]] and an aggregate of [[pumice]]. Its widespread use in many [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman structures]], a key event in the [[history of architecture]] termed the [[Roman Architectural Revolution]], freed [[Roman engineering|Roman construction]] from the restrictions of stone and brick materials. It enabled revolutionary new designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lancaster| first = Lynne| title = Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome. Innovations in Context| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date = 2005| isbn = 978-0-511-16068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concrete, as the Romans knew it, was a new and revolutionary material. Laid in the shape of [[arch]]es, [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] and [[List of Roman domes|domes]], it quickly hardened into a rigid mass, free from many of the internal thrusts and strains that troubled the builders of similar structures in stone or brick.&lt;ref&gt;D.S. Robertson: ''Greek and Roman Architecture'', Cambridge, 1969, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern tests show that ''opus caementicium'' had as much compressive strength as modern Portland-cement concrete (ca. {{convert|200|kg/cm2|MPa psi|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cowan: ''The Masterbuilders,'' New York 1977, p. 56, {{ISBN|978-0-471-02740-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the absence of reinforcement, its [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] was far lower than modern [[reinforced concrete]], and its mode of application was also different:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1101/notes/concrete/section_2_history.html History of Concrete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227213256/http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1101/notes/concrete/section_2_history.html |date=27 February 2017 |publisher=University of Memphis| access-date= 2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of [[rubble]]. Second, integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mark, Paul Hutchinson: "On the Structure of the Roman Pantheon", ''Art Bulletin'', Vol. 68, No. 1 (1986), p. 26, fn. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The long-term durability of Roman concrete structures has been found to be due to its use of [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] (volcanic) rock and ash, whereby crystallization of strätlingite and the coalescence of calcium–aluminum-silicate–hydrate cementing binder helped give the concrete a greater degree of fracture resistance even in seismically active environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/52/18484|title=Mechanical resilience and cementitious processes in Imperial Roman architectural mortar|first1=Marie D.|last1=Jackson|first2=Eric N.|last2=Landis|first3=Philip F.|last3=Brune|first4=Massimo|last4=Vitti|first5=Heng|last5=Chen|first6=Qinfei|last6=Li|first7=Martin|last7=Kunz|first8=Hans-Rudolf|last8=Wenk|first9=Paulo J.

[[File:Smeaton's Lighthouse00.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;Smeaton's Tower&lt;/center&gt;]]
The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures ensured that many survive to the present day. The [[Baths of Caracalla]] in Rome are just one example. Many [[Roman aqueduct]]s and bridges, such as the magnificent [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France, have masonry cladding on a concrete core, as does the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].

===Middle Ages===
After the Roman Empire, the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly reduced until the technique was all but forgotten between 500 and the 14th century. From the 14th century to the mid-18th century, the use of cement gradually returned. The ''[[Canal du Midi]]'' was built using concrete in 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/2/0/1/2/p20122_index.html |title=The Politics of Rediscovery in the History of Science: Tacit Knowledge of Concrete before its Discovery |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505160054/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/2/0/1/2/p20122_index.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}. allacademic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial era===
Perhaps the greatest step forward in the modern use of concrete was [[Smeaton's Tower]], built by British engineer [[John Smeaton]] in Devon, England, between 1756 and 1759. This third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] pioneered the use of [[hydraulic lime]] in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate.&lt;ref name=InterNACHI&gt;{{cite web|title=the History of Concrete|url=http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm|publisher=The International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI)|author=Nick Gromicko|author2=Kenton Shepard|last-author-amp=yes|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115151648/http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm|archivedate=15 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Many [[types of concrete]] are available, distinguished by the proportions of the main ingredients below. In this way or by substitution for the cementitious and aggregate phases, the finished product can be tailored to its application.  Strength, density, as well as chemical and thermal resistance are variables.

[[#Aggregates|Aggregate]] consists of large chunks of material in a concrete mix, generally a coarse [[gravel]] or crushed rocks such as [[limestone]], or [[granite]], along with finer materials such as [[sand]].

[[#Cement|Cement]], most commonly [[Portland cement]], is associated with the general term "concrete."  A range of other materials can be used as the cement in concrete too.  One of the most familiar of these alternative cements is [[asphalt concrete]]. Other cementitious materials, such as [[fly ash]] and [[slag cement]], are sometimes added as mineral admixtures (see below) – either pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete component – and become a part of the binder for the aggregate.

To produce concrete from most cements (excluding asphalt), [[water]] is mixed with the dry powder and aggregate, which produces a semi-liquid slurry that can be shaped, typically by pouring it into a form. The concrete solidifies and hardens through a [[Chemical reaction|chemical process]] called [[mineral hydration|hydration]]. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, creating a robust stone-like material.

[[#Chemical admixtures|Chemical admixtures]] are added to achieve varied properties. These ingredients may accelerate or slow down the rate at which the concrete hardens, and impart many other useful properties including increased tensile strength, entrainment of air and water resistance.

[[#Reinforcement|Reinforcement]] is often included in concrete.  Concrete can be formulated with high [[compressive strength]], but always has lower [[tensile strength]].  For this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension, typically [[steel]] [[rebar]].

[[#Mineral admixtures and blended cements|Mineral admixtures]] have become more popular over recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are [[fly ash]], a by-product of [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]]; [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]], a byproduct of [[steelmaking]]; and [[silica fume]], a byproduct of industrial [[electric arc furnace]]s. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while reducing the amount of industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement, or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.

The ''[[types of concrete#Mix design|mix design]]'' depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete is mixed and delivered, and how it is placed to form the structure.

===Cement===
{{main|Cement}}
[[File:Stockage de ciments.JPG|thumb|Several tons of bagged cement, about two minutes of output from a 10,000 ton per day [[cement kiln]]]]

Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and many [[plaster]]s. British masonry worker [[Joseph Aspdin]] patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the similarity of its colour to [[Portland stone|Portland limestone]], quarried from the English [[Isle of Portland]] and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a mixture of calcium silicates ([[alite]], [[belite]]), [[tricalcium aluminate|aluminates]] and [[calcium aluminoferrite|ferrites]] – compounds which combine calcium, silicon, aluminium and iron in forms which will react with water. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating [[limestone]] (a source of calcium) with clay or shale (a source of silicon, aluminium and iron) and grinding this product (called ''[[clinker (cement)|clinker]]'') with a source of [[sulfate]] (most commonly [[gypsum]]).

In modern [[cement kiln]]s many advanced features are used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced. Cement kilns are extremely large, complex, and inherently dusty industrial installations, and have emissions which must be controlled. Of the various ingredients used to produce a given quantity of concrete, the cement is the most energetically expensive. Even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then [[Cement mill|grind it into cement]]. Many kilns can be fueled with difficult-to-dispose-of wastes, the most common being used tires. The extremely high temperatures and long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement kilns to efficiently and completely burn even difficult-to-use fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cement Production|url=http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf|publisher=IEA ETSAP- Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme|accessdate=9 January 2013|author=Evelien Cochez|author2=Wouter Nijs|last-author-amp=yes|author3=Giorgio Simbolotti|author4=Giancarlo Tosato|location=IEA ETSAP, Technology Brief I03, June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124004654/http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Combining [[water]] with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration. The cement paste glues the aggregate together, fills voids within it, and makes it flow more freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibbons|first=Jack|title=Measuring Water in Concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-construction/measuring-water-in-concrete.aspx|publisher=Concrete Construction|accessdate=1 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511192721/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-construction/measuring-water-in-concrete.aspx|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated by [[Abrams' law]], a lower water-to-cement ratio yields a stronger, more durable concrete, whereas more water gives a freer-flowing concrete with a higher [[Workability|slump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHAPTER 9 Designing and Proportioning Normal Concrete Mixtures|url=http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf|work=PCA manual|publisher=Portland Concrete Association|accessdate=1 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526015347/http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf|archivedate=26 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impure water used to make concrete can cause problems when setting or in causing premature failure of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taha|first=Ramzi A.|title=Use of Production and Brackish Water in Concrete Mixtures|url=http://www.iasks.org/sites/default/files/swes20100102039043.pdf|work=International Journal of Sustainable Water and Environmental System|accessdate=1 October 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydration involves many different reactions, often occurring at the same time. As the reactions proceed, the products of the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other components of the concrete to form a solid mass.&lt;ref name=Hydration&gt;{{cite web|title=Cement hydration|url=http://www.understanding-cement.com/hydration.html|publisher=Understanding Cement|accessdate=1 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017144613/http://www.understanding-cement.com/hydration.html|archivedate=17 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggregates===
{{main|Construction aggregate}}
[[File:Gravel 03375C.JPG|thumbnail|right|Crushed stone aggregate]]

Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. [[Sand]], natural gravel, and [[crushed stone]] are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition, and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled [[blast furnace]] slag and [[bottom ash]] are also permitted.

The size distribution of the aggregate determines how much binder is required. Aggregate with a very even size distribution has the biggest gaps whereas adding aggregate with smaller particles tends to fill these gaps. The binder must fill the gaps between the aggregate as well as pasting the surfaces of the aggregate together, and is typically the most expensive component. Thus variation in sizes of the aggregate reduces the cost of concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/materials/Aggregate/Aggregatesmain.htm The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225184337/http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/materials/Aggregate/Aggregatesmain.htm |date=25 December 2012 }}. Engr.psu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The aggregate is nearly always stronger than the binder, so its use does not negatively affect the strength of the concrete.

Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates inhomogeneity due to the influence of vibration. This can lead to strength gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| first = Vitaliy I.| last = Veretennykov| first2 = Anatoliy M.| last2 = Yugov| first3 = Andriy O.| last3 = Dolmatov| first4 = Maksym S.| last4 = Bulavytskyi| first5 = Dmytro I.| last5 = Kukharev| first6 = Artem S.| last6 = Bulavytskyi| editor = Mohammed Ettouney| isbn = 978-0-7844-1002-8| title = Concrete Inhomogeneity of Vertical Cast-in-Place Elements in Skeleton-Type Buildings| booktitle = AEI 2008: Building Integration Solutions| publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers| date = 2008| location = Reston, Virginia| url = http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf| doi = 10.1061/41002(328)17| accessdate = 25 December 2010| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132318/http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf| archivedate = 3 April 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative stones such as [[quartzite]], small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative "exposed aggregate" finish, popular among landscape designers.

In addition to being decorative, exposed aggregate may add robustness to a concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquepaving.com.au/exposed_aggregate.htm Exposed Aggregate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112205554/http://www.uniquepaving.com.au/exposed_aggregate.htm |date=12 January 2013 }}.

===Reinforcement===
{{main|Reinforced concrete}}
[[File:Fotothek df ps 0000276 Montage von Bewehrungselementen aus Rundstahl.jpg|thumb|upright|Constructing a [[rebar]] cage that will be permanently embedded in a finished [[reinforced concrete]] structure]]

Concrete is strong in [[compression (physical)|compression]], as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load. However, it is weak in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack, allowing the structure to fail. [[Reinforced concrete]] adds either [[rebar|steel reinforcing bars]], [[Fiber-reinforced concrete|steel fibers]], glass fibers, or plastic fibers to carry [[tension (physics)|tensile loads]].

===Chemical admixtures===
''[[Chemistry|Chemical]] admixtures'' are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes. In normal use, admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement and are added to the concrete at the time of batching/mixing.&lt;ref name="FHWA Admixtures"&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Admixtures | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html | accessdate = 25 January 2007 | date = 14 June 1999 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127132641/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html | archivedate = 27 January 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See the section on Concrete Production, below.)The common types of admixtures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Cement Admixture Association | url = http://www.admixtures.org.uk/types.asp | title = Admixture Types | accessdate = 25 December 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110903081932/http://www.admixtures.org.uk/types.asp | archivedate = 3 September 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are as follows:
* [[Accelerant|Accelerators]] speed up the hydration (hardening) of the concrete. Typical materials used are [[calcium chloride|{{chem|CaCl|2}}]], [[Calcium nitrate|Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. However, use of chlorides may cause corrosion in steel reinforcing and is prohibited in some countries, so that nitrates may be favored. Accelerating admixtures are especially useful for modifying the properties of concrete in cold weather.
* [[Retarder (chemistry)|Retarders]] slow the hydration of concrete and are used in large or difficult pours where partial setting before the pour is complete is undesirable. Typical [[polyol]] retarders are [[sugar]], [[sucrose]], [[sodium gluconate]], [[glucose]], [[citric acid]], and [[tartaric acid]].
* [[Air entrainment|Air entraining agents]] add and entrain tiny air bubbles in the concrete, which reduces damage during [[Weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles, increasing durability. However, entrained air entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease compressive strength by 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconstructor.org/concrete/air-entrained-concrete-strength-effects/8427/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201090223/http://theconstructor.org/concrete/air-entrained-concrete-strength-effects/8427/ |archivedate=1 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; If too much air becomes trapped in the concrete as a result of the mixing process, [[Defoamer]]s can be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface of the wet concrete and then disperse.
* [[Plasticizer]]s increase the workability of plastic or "fresh" concrete, allowing it be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort. A typical plasticizer is lignosulfonate. Plasticizers can be used to reduce the water content of a concrete while maintaining workability and are sometimes called ''water-reducers'' due to this use. Such treatment improves its strength and durability characteristics. [[Superplasticizer]]s (also called ''high-range water-reducers'') are a class of plasticizers that have fewer deleterious effects and can be used to increase workability more than is practical with traditional plasticizers. Compounds used as superplasticizers include sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensate, sulfonated melamine formaldehyde condensate, acetone formaldehyde condensate and polycarboxylate ethers.
* [[Pigment]]s can be used to change the color of concrete, for aesthetics.
* [[Corrosion inhibitor]]s are used to minimize the corrosion of steel and steel bars in concrete.
* Bonding agents are used to create a bond between old and new concrete (typically a type of polymer) with wide temperature tolerance and corrosion resistance.
* Pumping aids improve pumpability, thicken the paste and reduce separation and bleeding.

* [[Fly ash]]: A by-product of coal-fired [[power station|electric generating plants]], it is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass).

* [[Silica fume]]: A byproduct of the production of silicon and [[ferrosilicon]] alloys. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100 times smaller.

==Production==
[[File:Concrete plant in Mansfield, Ohio.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Concrete plant]] showing a [[concrete mixer]] being filled from ingredient silos]]

Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients—water, aggregate, cement, and any additives—to produce concrete.  Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern usage, most concrete production takes place in a large type of industrial facility called a [[concrete plant]], or often a batch plant.

In general usage, concrete plants come in two main types, ready mix plants and central mix plants.  A ready mix plant mixes all the ingredients except water, while a central mix plant mixes all the ingredients including water.  A central mix plant offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better measurements of the amount of water added, but must be placed closer to the work site where the concrete will be used, since hydration begins at the plant.

A concrete plant consists of large storage hoppers for various reactive ingredients like cement, storage for bulk ingredients like aggregate and water, mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments, machinery to accurately weigh, move, and mix some or all of those ingredients, and facilities to dispense the mixed concrete, often to a [[concrete mixer]] truck.

Modern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid, so that it may be poured into forms, which are containers erected in the field to give the concrete its desired shape.  Concrete [[formwork]] can be prepared in several ways, such as [[Slip forming]] and [[Steel plate construction]].  Alternatively, concrete can be mixed into dryer, non-fluid forms and used in factory settings to manufacture [[Precast concrete]] products.

A wide variety of equipment is used for processing concrete, from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery.  Whichever equipment builders use, however, the objective is to produce the desired building material; ingredients must be properly mixed, placed, shaped, and retained within time constraints. Any interruption in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to begin to set before the next batch is added on top. This creates a horizontal plane of weakness called a ''cold joint'' between the two batches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concrete.org.uk/fingertips-nuggets.asp?cmd=display&amp;id=372 ''Cold Joints''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074543/http://www.concrete.org.uk/fingertips-nuggets.asp?cmd=display&amp;id=372 |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[The Concrete Society]], accessed 2015-12-30&lt;/ref&gt; Once the mix is where it should be, the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product.

When initially mixed, Portland cement and water rapidly form a [[gel]] of tangled chains of interlocking crystals, and components of the gel continue to react over time. Initially the gel is fluid, which improves workability and aids in placement of the material, but as the concrete sets, the chains of crystals join into a rigid structure, counteracting the fluidity of the gel and fixing the particles of aggregate in place. During curing, the cement continues to react with the residual water in a process of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]. In properly formulated concrete, once this curing process has terminated the product has the desired physical and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Among the qualities typically desired are [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength]], low moisture permeability, and chemical and volumetric stability.

Thorough mixing is essential for the production of uniform, high-quality concrete. For this reason equipment and methods should be capable of effectively mixing concrete materials containing the largest specified aggregate to produce ''uniform mixtures'' of the lowest slump practical for the work.

''Separate paste mixing'' has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before combining these materials with [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] can increase the [[compressive strength]] of the resulting concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 Premixed cement paste] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092034/http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 |date=28 September 2007 }}. Concreteinternational.com (1989-11-01). Retrieved on 2013-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The paste is generally mixed in a ''high-speed'', shear-type mixer at a [[Water-cement ratio|w/cm]] (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, [[Plasticizer|superplasticizers]], [[pigment]]s, or [[silica fume]]. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ACI 304R-00: Guide for Measuring, Mixing, Transporting, and Placing Concrete (Reapproved 2009) | url=https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workability===
{{Main|Concrete slump test}}
[[File:Cannon Renewal Project - October 2016 (30662609012).jpg|thumb|Concrete floor of a [[parking garage]] being placed]]

''Workability'' is the ability of a fresh (plastic) concrete mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or [[Segregation in concrete|segregation of aggregates]] (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconstructor.org/concrete/properties-of-fresh-concrete/6490/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116165251/http://theconstructor.org/concrete/properties-of-fresh-concrete/6490/ |archivedate=16 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles.  Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.concretenetwork.com/aggregate/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202232307/https://www.concretenetwork.com/aggregate/ |archivedate=2 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workability can be measured by the [[concrete slump test]], a simple measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the [[ASTM]] C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an "[[Duff Abrams|Abrams cone]]" with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little, having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50&amp;nbsp;mm) out of one foot (305&amp;nbsp;mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also be measured by the [[flow table test]].

Slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or [[superplasticizer]] without changing the [[water-cement ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=L|last2=Kaufmann|first2=J|last3=Winnefeld|first3=F|last4=Plank|first4=J|title=Multi-method approach to study influence of superplasticizers on cement suspensions|journal=Cement and Concrete Research|volume=41|page=1058|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.06.010|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other admixtures, especially air-entraining admixture, can increase the slump of a mix.

High-flow concrete, like [[self-consolidating concrete]], is tested by other flow-measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted.

After mixing, concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed.

===Curing===
[[File:Curing-concrete.jpg|thumb|A concrete slab being kept hydrated during water curing by submersion (ponding)]]

Concrete must be kept moist during curing in order to achieve optimal strength and durability.&lt;ref&gt;"Curing Concrete" Peter C. Taylor CRC Press 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-415-77952-4}}. eBook {{ISBN|978-0-203-86613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During curing [[hydrate|hydration]] occurs, allowing calcium-silicate hydrate (C-S-H) to form.  Over 90% of a mix's final strength is typically reached within four weeks, with the remaining 10% achieved over years or even decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Concrete Testing | url=http://technology.calumet.purdue.edu/cnt/rbennet/concrete%20lab.htm | accessdate=10 November 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024193802/http://technology.calumet.purdue.edu/cnt/rbennet/concrete%20lab.htm | archivedate=24 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of [[calcium hydroxide]] in the concrete into [[calcium carbonate]] from absorption of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] over several decades further strengthens the concrete and makes it more resistant to damage. This [[carbonation]] reaction, however, lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can corrode the reinforcement bars.

Hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Resulting strength distribution in vertical elements researched and presented at the article [http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf "Concrete inhomogeneity of vertical cast-in-place elements in skeleton-type buildings".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132318/http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf |date=3 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minifibers.com/documents/ADMIXUS-Admixtures-for-Cementitious-Applications.pdf "Admixtures for Cementitious Applications."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073633/http://www.minifibers.com/documents/ADMIXUS-Admixtures-for-Cementitious-Applications.pdf |date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the [[exothermic]] setting of cement. Improper curing can cause [[Spalling#Spalling in mechanical weathering|scaling]], reduced strength, poor [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance and [[fracture|cracking]].

====Techniques====
During the curing period, concrete is ideally maintained at controlled temperature and humidity. To ensure full hydration during curing, concrete slabs are often sprayed with "curing compounds" that create a water-retaining film over the concrete.  Typical films are made of wax or related hydrophobic compounds.  After the concrete is sufficiently cured, the film is allowed to abrade from the concrete through normal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daytonsuperior.com/docs/default-source/tech-data-sheets/section-05---curing-compounds.pdf?sfvrsn=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208184425/http://www.daytonsuperior.com/docs/default-source/tech-data-sheets/section-05---curing-compounds.pdf?sfvrsn=3 |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional conditions for curing involve by spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water.  The adjacent picture shows one of many ways to achieve this, ponding&amp;nbsp;– submerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to prevent dehydration. Additional common curing methods include wet burlap and plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete.

For higher-strength applications, [[accelerated curing]] techniques may be applied to the concrete.  One common technique involves heating the poured concrete with steam, which serves to both keep it damp and raise the temperature, so that the hydration process proceeds more quickly and more thoroughly.

==Specialty types==
{{main|Types of concrete}}

===Pervious===
{{Main|Pervious concrete}}
Pervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate, cement, water and little-to-no fine aggregates. This concrete is also known as "no-fines" or porous concrete. Mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles. The hardened concrete contains interconnected air voids totalling approximately 15 to 25 percent. Water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath. Air entrainment admixtures are often used in freeze–thaw climates to minimize
the possibility of frost damage.

===Nanoconcrete===
[[File:Decorative cameo plate.jpg|thumbnail|Decorative plate made of Nano concrete with High-Energy Mixing (HEM)]]
[[File:Nanoconcrete pavement, Blakeslee, PA.jpg|thumb|Two-layered pavers, pigmented top layer made of HEM nanoconcrete]]

Nanoconcrete is created by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is thorough enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30–600 [[watt]]s per kilogram of the mix.  This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net [[Energy density|specific energy]] expended upon the mix of at least 5000 [[joule]]s per kilogram of the mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Fridman  | editor-first = Vladen  | issue-date = August 22, 1995  | title = Method for producing Construction Mixture for concrete | country-code = US | series-number = 5443313}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[plasticizer]] or a [[superplasticizer]] is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional [[concrete mixer]]. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses on the surface of cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing.  This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of [[Calcium Silicate Hydrate]] (C-S-H) colloid creation.

The liquid activated high-energy mixture can be used by itself for casting small architectural details and decorative items, or foamed ([[Expanded polystyrene concrete|expanded]]) for [[lightweight concrete]]. HEM Nanoconcrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions and possesses an increased volume of gel, which reduces [[capillarity]] in solid and porous materials.

===Microbial===
Bacteria such as ''[[Bacillus pasteurii]]'', ''[[Bacillus pseudofirmus]]'', ''Bacillus cohnii'', ''Sporosarcina pasteuri'', and ''[[Arthrobacter crystallopoietes]]'' increase the compression strength of concrete through their biomass. Not all bacteria increase the strength of concrete significantly with their biomass.&lt;ref name=Navdeep2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intechopen.com/download/get/type/pdfs/id/28663|author1=Navdeep Kaur Dhami|author2=Sudhakara M.

===Polymer===
{{main|Polymer concrete}}
Polymer concretes are mixtures of aggregate and any of various polymers and may be reinforced. The cement is more costly than lime-based cements, but polymer concretes nevertheless have advantages, they have significant tensile strength even without reinforcement, and they are largely impervious to water. They are frequently used for repair and construction of other applications such as drains.

It should be noted, however, that the deadline was extended to June 23, 2021 for engineering controls in the hydraulic fracturing industry. Companies which fail to meet the tightened safety regulations can face financial charges and extensive penalties.

==Properties==
{{Main|Properties of concrete}}
Concrete has relatively high [[compressive strength]], but much lower [[tensile strength]].{{clarify|reason=no comparators specified - relatively to what? Lower than what?|date=June 2018}}  For this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension (often steel). The elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures crack to some extent, due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application.
[[File:Concrete Compression Testing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Compression testing of a concrete cylinder]]

Different mixes of concrete ingredients produce different strengths. Concrete strength values are usually specified as the lower-bound compressive strength of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen as determined by standard test procedures.

Different strengths of concrete are used for different purposes.  Very low-strength – {{convert|14|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} or less –  concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight.&lt;ref name=lightweight&gt;{{cite web|title=Structural lightweight concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|work=Concrete Construction|publisher=The Aberdeen Group|date=March 1981|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511221842/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air, foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is reduced.  For most routine uses, {{convert|20|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|32|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} concrete is often used.  {{convert|40|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable, although more expensive, option.  Higher-strength concrete is often used for larger civil projects.&lt;ref name=American&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordering Concrete by PSI|url=http://www.americanconcreteofiowa.com/aspx/diy.aspx?id=30|publisher=American Concrete|accessdate=10 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511142813/http://www.americanconcreteofiowa.com/aspx/diy.aspx?id=30|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strengths above {{convert|40|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} are often used for specific building elements.  For example, the lower floor columns of high-rise concrete buildings may use concrete of {{convert|80|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} or more, to keep the size of the columns small.  Bridges may use long beams of high-strength concrete to lower the number of spans required.&lt;ref name=Russel /&gt;&lt;ref name=NRMCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Concrete in Practice: What, Why, and How?|url=http://www.nrmca.org/aboutconcrete/cips/33p.pdf|publisher=NRMCA-National Ready Mixed Concrete Association|accessdate=10 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804024341/http://www.nrmca.org/aboutconcrete/cips/33p.pdf|archivedate=4 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally, other structural needs may require high-strength concrete. If a structure must be very rigid, concrete of very high strength may be specified, even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads.

Concrete is one of the most durable building materials. It provides superior fire resistance compared with wooden construction and gains strength over time. Structures made of concrete can have a long service life.

Due to cement's [[exothermic]] chemical reaction while setting up, large concrete structures such as [[dam]]s, [[navigation lock]]s, large mat foundations, and large [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] generate excessive heat during hydration and associated expansion. To mitigate these effects ''post-cooling''&lt;ref name="BerkCE"&gt;[http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf Mass Concrete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073606/http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2013-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly applied during construction. An early example at Hoover Dam used a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating.  Similar systems are still used; depending on volume of the pour, the concrete mix used, and ambient air temperature, the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed. Various methods also are used to pre-cool the concrete mix in mass concrete structures.&lt;ref name="BerkCE"/&gt;

Another approach to mass concrete structures that minimizes cement's thermal byproduct is the use of [[roller-compacted concrete]], which uses a dry mix which has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional wet placement. It is deposited in thick layers as a semi-dry material then roller [[compactor|compacted]] into a dense, strong mass.

===Surface finishes===
{{main|Decorative concrete}}
[[File:Smpolishedconcrete2.jpg|thumb|Black basalt polished concrete floor]]
Raw concrete surfaces tend to be porous, and have a relatively uninteresting appearance. Many different finishes can be applied to improve the appearance and preserve the surface against staining, water penetration, and freezing.

Examples of improved appearance include [[stamped concrete]] where the wet concrete has a pattern impressed on the surface, to give a paved, cobbled or brick-like effect, and may be accompanied with coloration. Another popular effect for flooring and table tops is [[polished concrete]] where the concrete is polished optically flat with diamond abrasives and sealed with polymers or other sealants.

Other finishes can be achieved with chiselling, or more conventional techniques such as painting or covering it with other materials.

The proper treatment of the surface of concrete, and therefore its characteristics, is an important stage in the construction and renovation of architectural structures.&lt;ref&gt;^ Sadowski, Łukasz; Mathia, Thomas.

===Prestressed structures===
{{Main|Prestressed concrete}}
[[File:Scott System cacti.jpg|thumb|Stylized cacti decorate a sound/retaining wall in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]|]]

[[Prestressed concrete]] is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in [[compressive stress]]es during construction to oppose tensile stresses experienced in use. This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs, by
better distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement. For example, a horizontal beam tends to sag. Prestressed reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this.
In pre-tensioned concrete, the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.

More than {{convert|55000|mi|km}} of highways in the United States are paved with this material. [[Reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]] and [[precast concrete]] are the most widely used [[types of concrete]] functional extensions in modern days. See [[Brutalism]].

[[Extreme weather]] conditions (extreme heat or cold; windy condition, and humidity variations) can significantly alter the quality of concrete. Many precautions are observed in cold weather placement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/cold-weather-concreting|title=Winter is Coming! Precautions for Cold Weather Concreting {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113155033/http://www.fprimec.com/cold-weather-concreting|archivedate=13 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low temperatures significantly slow the chemical reactions involved in hydration of cement, thus affecting the strength development. Preventing freezing is the most important precaution, as formation of ice crystals can cause damage to the crystalline structure of the hydrated cement paste. If the surface of the concrete pour is insulated from the outside temperatures, the heat of hydration will prevent freezing.

The [[American Concrete Institute]] (ACI) definition of cold weather placmement, '''ACI 306''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=306R-16 Guide to Cold Weather Concreting|url=https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30616|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915204757/https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30616|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:
* A period when for more than three successive days the average daily air temperature drops below 40 ˚F (~ 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C), and
* Temperature stays below 50 ˚F (10&amp;nbsp;°C) for more than one-half of any 24 hour period.
In Canada, where temperatures tend to be much lower during the cold season, the following criteria are used by [[Canadian Standards Agency|CSA]] A23.1:
* When the air temperature is ≤ 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and
* When there is a probability that the temperature may fall below 5&amp;nbsp;°C within 24 hours of placing the concrete.

The minimum strength before exposing concrete to extreme cold is 500 psi (3.5 MPa). CSA A 23.1 specified a compressive strength of 7.0 MPa to be considered safe for exposure to freezing.

===Roads===
[[Road surface#Concrete|Concrete roads]] are more fuel efficient to drive on,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping of Excess Fuel Consumption|url=https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102190351/https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption|archivedate=2 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, yet have a much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that [[pervious concrete]] can be used, which eliminates the need to place [[storm drain]]s near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.

===Energy efficiency===
Energy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the job site. Similarly, relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are produced by the chemical reactions in [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement manufacture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Madeleine|title=Emissions from the Cement Industry|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/|website=State of the Planet|publisher=Earth Institute, Columbia University|accessdate=13 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222053719/http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/|archivedate=22 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall [[embodied energy]] of concrete at roughly 1 to 1.5 megajoules per kilogram is therefore lower than for most structural and construction materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://strineenvironments.com.au/factsheets/concrete-and-embodied-energy-can-using-concrete-be-carbon-neutral/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174733/http://strineenvironments.com.au/factsheets/concrete-and-embodied-energy-can-using-concrete-be-carbon-neutral/ |archivedate=16 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in place, concrete offers great energy efficiency over the lifetime of a building.&lt;ref&gt;John Gajda (2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110916080530/http://www.arxx.com/Assets/CMS/WYSIWYGBase/file/5825%20PCA%20CD026.pdf Energy Use of Single Family Houses with Various Exterior Walls], Construction Technology Laboratories Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Green Building with Concrete|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-1-4987-0411-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs.&lt;ref name="Features and Usage of Foam Concrete"&gt;{{cite web|title=Features and Usage of Foam Concrete|url=http://www.chinaconcretepump.com/Foam-Concrete-Machine.html/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129122814/http://www.chinaconcretepump.com/Foam-Concrete-Machine.html/|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or [[rastra]] that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

===Fire safety===
[[File:1981 BostonCityHall byLebovich8 HABS MA1176.jpg|thumb|[[Boston City Hall]] (1968) is a [[Brutalist]] design constructed largely of precast and poured in place concrete. It was voted "The World's Ugliest Building" in 2008]]

Concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using steel frames, since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can thus last longer under the same fire conditions. Concrete is sometimes used as a fire protection for steel frames, for the same effect as above. Concrete as a fire shield, for example [[Fondu fyre]], can also be used in extreme environments like a missile launch pad.

Options for non-combustible construction include floors, ceilings and roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and [[Insulating concrete forms|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

Concrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such as high winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness, which results in minimal horizontal movement. However this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures, particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is required to resist more extreme forces.

===Earthquake safety===
As discussed above, concrete is very strong in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 Unreinforced Masonry Buildings and Earthquakes: Developing Successful Risk Reduction Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912163041/http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 |date=12 September 2011 }}, FEMA P-774 / October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf Seismic Retrofit Design Of Historic Century-Old School Buildings In Istanbul, Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111151034/http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf |date=11 January 2012 }}, C.C.

Concrete is widely used for making [[architectural structure]]s, [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], brick/[[Concrete masonry unit|block]] walls, [[Sidewalk|pavements]], bridges/[[overpass]]es, highways, runways, [[parking]] structures, [[dam]]s, pools/[[reservoir]]s, pipes, [[foundation (engineering)|footings]] for gates, [[fence]]s and [[Utility pole|poles]] and even [[boat]]s.  Concrete is used in large quantities almost everywhere there is a need for infrastructure. Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials in animal houses and for manure and silage storage structures in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Belie|first=Nele|date=2000|title=Durability of Building Materials and Components in the Agricultural Environment, Part III: Concrete Structures|url=|journal=J. Agric. Engng Res.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of concrete used worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.  Concrete's use in the modern world is exceeded only by that of naturally occurring water.&lt;ref name="Cement Trust"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the development impact of concrete?|url=http://cementtrust.wordpress.com/a-concrete-plan/|publisher=Cement Trust|accessdate=10 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917144159/http://cementtrust.wordpress.com/a-concrete-plan/|archivedate=17 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete is also the basis of a large commercial industry. Globally, the ready-mix concrete industry, the largest segment of the concrete market, is projected to exceed $100 billion in revenue by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/ready_mix_concrete/cement/prweb3747364.htm|title=Global Ready-Mix Concrete Market to Reach $105.2 Billion by 2015, According to New Report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220072810/http://www.prweb.com/releases/ready_mix_concrete/cement/prweb3747364.htm|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States alone, concrete production is a $30-billion-per-year industry, considering only the value of the ready-mixed concrete sold each year.&lt;ref name=NRMCA2&gt;{{cite web|title=Ready Mixed Concrete Production Statistics|url=http://www.nrmca.org/concrete/data.asp|publisher=NRMCA-National Ready Mixed Concrete Association|accessdate=10 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513112719/http://www.nrmca.org/concrete/data.asp|archivedate=13 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the size of the concrete industry, and the fundamental way concrete is used to shape the infrastructure of the modern world, it is difficult to overstate the role this material plays today.

===Environmental and health===
{{main|Environmental impact of concrete}}
The manufacture and use of concrete produce a wide range of environmental and social consequences. Some are harmful, some welcome, and some both, depending on circumstances.

A major component of concrete is [[cement]], which similarly exerts [[Cement#Environmental impacts|environmental and social effects]].&lt;ref name=Navdeep2012/&gt;{{rp|142}}
The cement industry is one of the three primary producers of [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]] (the other two being the energy production and transportation industries).

Concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to [[surface runoff]], which can cause heavy soil erosion, water pollution, and flooding, but conversely can be used to divert, dam, and control flooding. Concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution.

Concrete is a contributor to the [[urban heat island]] effect, though less so than asphalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reducing Urban Heat Islands|url=http://www.epa.gov/heatisld/resources/pdf/CoolPavesCompendium.pdf|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies found to be exposing workers to higher amounts could face financial payouts and other penalties.    

The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns due to toxicity and radioactivity.
Fresh concrete (before curing is complete) is highly alkaline and must be handled with proper protective equipment.
[[File:Crushed Concrete Granular Fill.jpg|thumb|Recycled crushed concrete, to be reused as granular fill, is loaded into a semi-dump truck]]

===Recycling===
{{Main|Concrete recycling}}

Concrete recycling is an increasingly common method for disposing of concrete structures. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to [[landfill]]s for disposal, but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness, governmental laws and economic benefits. &lt;ref&gt;General Chipping. [https://generalchipping.com/concrete-recycling-work/ “How Does Concrete Recycling Work?”], General Chipping. Retrieved on November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete, which must be free of trash, wood, paper and other such materials, is collected from demolition sites and put through a [[crusher|crushing machine]], often along with [[asphalt]], bricks and rocks.

Reinforced concrete contains [[rebar]] and other metallic reinforcements, which are removed with [[magnet]]s and recycled elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may go through the crusher again. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. [[Aggregate base]] gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road, with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it. Crushed recycled concrete can sometimes be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants, though the use of recycled concrete limits strength and is not allowed in many jurisdictions. On 3 March 1983, a government-funded research team (the VIRL research.codep) estimated that almost 17% of worldwide landfill was by-products of concrete based waste. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Chipping===
{{Main|Concrete chipping}}
[[Concrete chipping]] is the act of breaking away the dried concrete that forms along the walls of central mixers and [[ready-mix concrete]] trucks. Whenever possible, teams carry out the work by physically entering the spaces and breaking away the dried material with help from handheld jackhammers and chisels. Once removed, the broken concrete is either hauled away to landfills, recycled or reused in some other way.

While specific concrete chipping needs vary by fleet size, concrete blends at play and the specific drums in use, it is generally accepted that a company should have its drums chipped every three months. &lt;ref&gt;General Chipping.

[[File:Lednička Zanussi ZRA 319 SW, celkový pohled na zadní část.JPG|thumb|The condenser coil of a refrigerator]]In systems involving [[heat transfer]], a '''condenser''' is a device or unit used to [[Condensation|condense]] a substance from its [[gas]]eous to its [[liquid]] state, by cooling it.  In so doing, the [[latent heat]] is given up by the substance and transferred to the surrounding environment. Condensers can be made according to numerous designs, and come in many sizes ranging from rather small (hand-held) to very large (industrial-scale units used in plant processes).  For example, a [[refrigerator]] uses a condenser to get rid of [[heat]] extracted from the interior of the unit to the outside air. Condensers are used in [[air conditioning]], industrial [[chemical process]]es such as [[distillation]], steam [[power plant]]s and other heat-exchange systems.  Use of cooling water or surrounding air as the coolant is common in many condensers.&lt;ref name=chemengenc&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of CHemical Engineering Equipment| contribution = Condensers|publisher=    [[University of Michigan]]|accessdate=May 13, 2012|url=http://encyclopedia.che.engin.umich.edu/Pages/HeatTransfer/Condensers/Condensers.html

== Examples of condensers ==
*A [[surface condenser]] is one in which condensing medium and vapors are physically separated and used when direct contact is not desired. It is a [[shell and tube heat exchanger]] installed at the outlet of every [[steam turbine]] in [[thermal power station]]s.  Commonly, the [[cooling water]] flows through the tube side and the steam enters the shell side where the condensation occurs on the outside of the heat transfer tubes.  The condensate drips down and collects at the bottom, often in a built-in pan called a ''hotwell''.  The shell side often operates at a [[vacuum]] or partial vacuum, produced by the difference in specific volume between the steam and condensate. Conversely, the vapor can be fed through the tubes with the coolant water or air flowing around the outside.
* In [[chemistry]], a condenser is the apparatus which cools hot [[vapor]]s, causing them to condense into a [[liquid]].  See "[[Condenser (laboratory)]]" for [[laboratory]]-scale condensers, as opposed to industrial-scale condensers.  Examples include the [[Liebig condenser]], [[Graham condenser]], and [[Allihn condenser]]. This is not to be confused with a [[condensation reaction]] which links two fragments into a single molecule by an addition [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] and an elimination reaction.

:In laboratory [[distillation]], [[reflux]], and [[rotary evaporator]]s, several types of condensers are commonly used. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a cooling water jacket, and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the Allihn condenser has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense.  Being more complex shapes to manufacture, these latter types are also more expensive to purchase.  These three types of condensers are [[laboratory glassware]] items since they are typically made of glass.  Commercially available condensers usually are fitted with ground glass joints and come in standard lengths of 100, 200, and 400 mm. Air-cooled condensers are unjacketed, while water-cooled condensers contain a jacket for the water.

*Larger condensers are also used in industrial-scale distillation processes to cool distilled [[vapor]] into liquid distillate.  Commonly, the coolant flows through the tube side and distilled vapor through the shell side with distillate collecting at or flowing out the bottom.

[[File:Condenser unit for central air conditioning.JPG|thumb|'''Condenser unit''' for central air conditioning for a typical house]]
*A '''condenser unit''' used in [[central air conditioning]] systems typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming [[refrigerant]] vapor into liquid, a [[gas compressor|compressor]] to raise the pressure of the refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside.  A typical configuration of such a condenser unit is as follows:  The heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside.  In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes, which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can circulate from outside to inside the unit.  There is a motorized [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]] inside the condenser unit near the top, which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan.  The fan is used to pull outside cooling air in through the heat exchanger section at the sides and blow it out the top through the grating.  These condenser units are located on the outside of the building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit.  Of course, an [[electric power]] supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit.
*In a '''direct-contact condenser''', hot vapor and cool liquid are introduced into a vessel and allowed to mix directly, rather than being separated by a barrier such as the wall of a heat exchanger tube. The vapor gives up its [[latent heat]] and condenses to a liquid, while the liquid absorbs this heat and undergoes a temperature rise. The entering vapor and liquid typically contain a single condensable substance, such as a water spray being used to cool air and adjust its humidity.

'''Other Types of Condensers'''
{{tone|date=July 2015}}
In the world of [[Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning]] (HVAC), condensers happen to be a topic of great importance.  Instead of confusing information, the goal is to provide some basic information on the different types of condensers and their applications.

There are three other condensers used in HVAC systems

*'''Water-cooled'''
*'''Air-cooled'''
*'''Evaporative'''

'''Applications:'''

*'''Air cooled''' – If the condenser is located on the outside of the unit, the air cooled condenser can provide the easiest arrangement.  These types of condensers eject heat to the outdoors and are simple to install.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Most common uses for this condenser are domestic refrigerators, upright freezers and in residential packaged air conditioning units.  A great feature of the air cooled condenser is they are very easy to clean.  Since dirt can cause serious issues with the condensers performance, it is highly recommended that these be kept clear of dirt.

*'''Water cooled''' – Although a little more pricey to install, these condensers are the more efficient type.  Commonly used for swimming pools and condensers piped for city water flow, these condensers require regular service and maintenance.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They also require a cooling tower to conserve water.  To prevent corrosion and the forming of algae, water cooled condensers require a constant supply of makeup water along with water treatment.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Depending on the application you can choose from tube in tube, shell and coil or shell and tube condensers.  All are essentially made to produce the same outcome, but each in a different way.

*'''Evaporative''' – While these remain the least popular choice, they are used when either water supply is inadequate to operate water cooled condenser or condensation temperature is lower that can achieved by air cooled condenser. Evaporative condensers can be used inside or outside of a building and under typical conditions, operate at a low condensing temperature.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Typically these are used in large commercial air-conditioning units. Although effective, they are not necessarily the most efficient.

==Equation==

For an ideal single-pass condenser whose coolant has constant density, constant heat capacity, linear enthalpy over the temperature range, perfect cross-sectional heat transfer, and zero longitudinal heat transfer, and whose tubing has constant perimeter, constant thickness, and constant heat conductivity, and whose condensible fluid is perfectly mixed and at constant temperature, the coolant temperature varies along its tube according to:

: &lt;math&gt; \Theta(x) = \frac{T_H-T(x)}{T_H-T(0)} = e^{-NTU} = e^{-\frac{h P x}{\dot{m} c}} = e^{-\frac{G x}{\dot{m} c L}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''x'' is the distance from the coolant inlet;
* ''T(x)'' is the coolant temperature, and ''T(0)'' the coolant temperature at its inlet;
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the hot fluid's temperature;
* ''NTU'' is the number of transfer units;
* ''m'' is the coolant's mass (or other) flow rate;
* ''c'' is the coolant's heat capacity at constant pressure per unit mass (or other);
* ''h'' is the heat transfer coefficient of the coolant tube;
* ''P'' is the perimeter of the coolant tube;
* ''G'' is the heat conductance of the coolant tube (often denoted ''UA'');
* ''L'' is the length of the coolant tube.

In [[geometry]], the '''Cramer–Castillon problem''' is a problem stated by the [[Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Gabriel Cramer]] solved by the italian mathematician, resident in Berlin, [[Giovanni Salvemini|Jean de Castillon]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Stark}}, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem consists of (see the image):

Given a circle &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and three points &lt;math&gt;A, B, C&lt;/math&gt; in the same plane and not on &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, to construct every possible triangle inscribed in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; whose sides (or their elongations) pass through &lt;math&gt;A, B, C&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

Centuries before, [[Pappus of Alexandria]] had solved a special case: when the three points are collinear. But the general case had the reputation of being very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Wanner}}, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the geometrical construction of Castillon, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] found an analytic solution, easier than Castillon's. In the beginning of the 19th century, [[Lazare Carnot]] generalized it to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Ostermann and Wanner}}, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''December 1992 nor'easter''' produced record high [[tide]]s and snowfall across the northeastern United States. It developed as a [[low pressure area]] on December&amp;nbsp;10 over Virginia, and for two days it remained over the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] before moving offshore. In Maryland, the snowfall unofficially reached {{convert|48|in|mm|abbr=on}}; if verified, the total would have been the highest in the state's history. About 120,000&amp;nbsp;people were left without power in the state due to high winds. Along the Maryland coast, the storm was less severe than the [[1991 Perfect Storm|Perfect Storm]] in the previous year, although the strongest portion of the storm remained over New Jersey for several days. In the state, winds reached {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]], and tides peaked at {{convert|10.4|ft|m|abbr=on}} in [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]]. The combination of high tides and {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} waves caused the most significant flooding in the state since the [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962]]. Several highways and portions of the [[New York City Subway]] and [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]] systems were closed due to the storm. Throughout New Jersey, the nor'easter damaged about 3,200&amp;nbsp;homes and caused an estimated $750&amp;nbsp;million in damage (1992&amp;nbsp;USD).

The nor'easter increased tides across the northeastern United States for several days due to its slow movement. In New York City, tides reached {{convert|8.04|ft|m|abbr=on}} at [[Battery Park]], which flooded [[Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive]]. Along [[Long Island]], the nor'easter destroyed over 130&amp;nbsp;homes and left 454,000&amp;nbsp;people without power. In New England, 230,684&amp;nbsp;people lost power during the storm. Five&amp;nbsp;houses were destroyed in Massachusetts, and flooding reached {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep in Boston. Further inland, the storm produced significant snowfall, estimated at around {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} in [[The Berkshires]]. The high snow totals closed schools for a week in western Massachusetts. Overall, the storm caused between $1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;billion in damage (1992&amp;nbsp;USD) and 19&amp;nbsp;deaths, of which four were directly related to the storm. In March of the following year, the [[1993 Storm of the Century|Storm of the Century]] caused worse damage across a larger region of the eastern United States.

==Meteorological history==

==Impact==
The storm affected a large region of the northeastern United States from West Virginia to Massachusetts with heavy snowfall, sleet, rain, and high winds.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] attributed four deaths to the nor'easter, but only included those directly related; the agency did not include storm-induced traffic accidents or heart attacks.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt; The [[National Climatic Data Center]] reported 19&amp;nbsp;deaths related to the nor'easter,&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; although news reports shortly after the storm reported 20&amp;nbsp;deaths.&lt;ref name="eugene"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=1992-12-15|title=Storm Strikes Plains; East Coast Bails Out|accessdate=2012-03-15|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QkJWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gOoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5421,3440283&amp;dq=storm&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall damage was estimated between $1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;billion (1992&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]), mostly in New England.&lt;ref name="ncdc2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Lackey|date=2011-06-17|title=Billion Dollar U.S. Weather/Climate Disasters|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=2012-03-11|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/reports/billionz.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm's widespread snowfall ranked it as the equivalence of a Category&amp;nbsp;2, or "significant", on the ''Regional Snowfall Index'' scale.&lt;ref name="rsi"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|title=Regional Snowfall Index: RSI and Societal Impacts|accessdate=2012-03-09|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/rsi/nesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic===
In the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia]], the nor'easter dropped over {{convert|30|in|mm|abbr=on}} of snow. Officials restricted travel on roads to emergency vehicles only in the state's two easternmost counties.&lt;ref name="alb"/&gt; In the state, the storm left 15,000&amp;nbsp;people without power.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; In northern Virginia, {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} of snow stranded 2,500&amp;nbsp;people in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].&lt;ref name="alb"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Albany Herald|agency=Associated Press|title=Storm smashes into Northeast|accessdate=2012-03-15|date=1992-12-12|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qi9DAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Vq0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3509,1829297&amp;dq=storm+new+england&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In western Maryland, snowfall totals unofficially reached {{convert|42|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]]. If verified, the total would have been the highest snowfall amount in the state's history. High winds produced up to {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} snow drifts, which stranded trucks on [[Interstate 68]]. High winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving 120,000&amp;nbsp;people across the state without power, including some without any heat. At least 10&amp;nbsp;people required rescue from their homes.&lt;ref name="mary"&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-01-08|title=Maryland Winters|author=Barbara McNaught Watson|publisher=Baltimore/Washington National Weather Service|accessdate=2012-03-12|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/lwx/Historic_Events/md-winter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], the mixture of rain and snow caused hundreds of traffic accidents.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

The nor'easter struck about 14&amp;nbsp;months after the [[1991 Perfect Storm]] produced similarly high tides across the region, and only 11&amp;nbsp;months after another nor'easter in [[January 1992 nor'easter|January&amp;nbsp;1992]].&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt; In [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], the storm dropped {{convert|1.79|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall, which broke the daily rainfall record set in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=1992-12-11|title=Snow and rain across Midwest|newspaper=The Bryan Times|accessdate=2012-03-15|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y5RTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fYcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5412,3650857&amp;dq=storm+new+england&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; High tides damaged much of the dune system along the [[Assateague Island National Seashore]] and about a third of the newly installed dunes in [[Ocean City, Maryland]]. Along the Maryland coast, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, with a total of {{convert|2.90|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]]; the high rains flooded local streams. At Assateague National Seashore, wind gusts peaked at {{convert|54|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The storm struck shortly after a full moon, and the combination of high [[storm tide|tide]]s and waves breached dunes in some locations. Despite its longevity, the nor'easter was less severe than its predecessors along the Delaware Bay, mostly because the stronger northeast quadrant was over the coastline for one tidal cycle, and the predominant southeast winds were blocked by [[Cape Henlopen]]. However, there were still high tides and flooding along the Delaware Bay.&lt;ref name="dgs"&gt;{{cite report|author=Kelvin W. Ramsey|author2=John H. Talley|author3=Darlene V.

High tides continued in Delaware until December&amp;nbsp;15. Several days of high tides caused minor beach erosion and damaged dune systems. In [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]], there was property damage from coastal flooding. The storm produced significantly more rainfall than the storm in January&amp;nbsp;1992, including a total of {{convert|3.12|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt; A station in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] reported a record 24‑hour rainfall total of {{convert|3.25|in|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; The rains caused flooding and the third highest [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] on record at Duck Creek in [[Smyrna, Delaware|Smyrna]].

Most of the impact in New Jersey was from the high tides, which caused the worst flooding in 30&amp;nbsp;years in some locations.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt; In [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], high tides flooded portions of the [[New York City Subway]] and [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]] systems, leaving them closed for a few days.&lt;ref name="ams"/&gt; High tides destroyed portions of the boardwalks in [[Bradley Beach, New Jersey|Bradley Beach]] and [[Belmar, New Jersey|Belmar]], and also destroyed a century-old fishing pier in [[Ocean Grove, New Jersey|Ocean Grove]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Flooding closed portions of roads across North Jersey, including the [[Garden State Parkway]] near [[Cheesequake State Park]] and six [[State highways in New Jersey|state highways]].&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt; At [[Newark International Airport]], dozens of flights were canceled.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; The storm left 102,000&amp;nbsp;customers of [[FirstEnergy|Jersey Central Power &amp; Light]] without power.

===New York and New England===
Before the storm's circulation passed the New York area, its associated trough produced sustained easterly winds of 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h) along Long Island. Wind gusts reached 77&amp;nbsp;mph (124&amp;nbsp;km/h) at [[LaGuardia Airport]]. The strong easterly winds produced high tides in the region that increased gradually after three consecutive tidal cycles; this was due to the nor'easter's slow movement. There was a storm surge of about 3&amp;nbsp;ft (1&amp;nbsp;m) at [[Battery Park]] at the southern end of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="ams"/&gt; The same station reported a high tide of {{convert|8.04|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level,&lt;ref name="max"/&gt; which was high enough to surpass the sea walls for a few hours.

The '''Desert Biosphere Reserve and Experimental Range'''  is a [[biosphere reserve]] and experimental [[rangeland|range]] in the western reaches of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Utah]]. The experimental range was established in 1933 when {{convert|87|sqmi|km2}} of public lands were designated "as an agricultural range experiment station" by President [[Herbert Hoover]].

The range is maintained by the [[U.S. Forest Service]]'s [[Rocky Mountain Research Station]]. It was declared a [[biosphere reserve]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1976 but was withdrawn from the program as of June 14, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 14, 2017 |title=23 new sites added to UNESCO’s World Network of Biosphere Reserves |url=http://en.unesco.org/news/23-new-sites-added-unesco-s-world-network-biosphere-reserves |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the northwest of [[Pine Valley (Utah)|Pine Valley]], a valley section in southwest [[Millard County, Utah|Millard County]], about {{convert|40|mi}} west of [[Milford, Utah|Milford]]; the north section of the reserve covers the southern half of the [[Tunnel Springs Mountains]]. It protects a landscape typical of the [[Great Basin]], with its typical geography of north-south aligned mountain ranges separated by desert basins. Vegetation is typical of the [[Great Basin shrub steppe]], with [[shadscale saltbush]] ''(Atriplex confertifolia)'' and [[sagebrush]] ''(Artemisia'' spp.) [[scrubland]]s predominant. The reserve also includes areas of [[Single-leaf Pinyon]] ''(Pinus monophylla)''-[[juniper]] [[woodland]] and [[pasture]] land.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">In [[Norse mythology]], '''''Fimbulvetr''''' (or ''fimbulvinter''), commonly rendered in [[English language|English]] as '''Fimbulwinter''', is the immediate prelude to the events of [[Ragnarök]]. It means "great winter".

==Summary==
Fimbulwinter is the harsh winter that precedes the end of the world and puts an end to all life on Earth. Fimbulwinter is three successive winters, when snow comes in from all directions, without any intervening summer. Then, there will be innumerable wars.

The event is described primarily in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. In the poem ''[[Vafþrúðnismál]]'', [[Odin]] poses the question to [[Vafþrúðnir]] as to who of mankind will survive the Fimbulwinter. Vafþrúðnir responds that [[Líf and Lífþrasir]]  will survive and that they will live in the forest of [[Hoddmímis holt]]. 

The mythology might be related to the [[extreme weather events of 535–536]], which resulted in a notable drop in temperature across northern Europe. There have also been several popular ideas about whether or not the particular piece of mythology has a connection to the [[climate change]] that occurred in the Nordic countries at the end of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] from about 650 BC. Before that climate change, the Nordic countries were considerably warmer.&lt;ref&gt;Ström, Folke: ''Nordisk Hedendom'', [[Studentlitteratur]], Lund 2005, {{ISBN|91-44-00551-2}} (first published 1961) among others, refer to the climate change theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and other [[Nordic countries]], the term ''fimbulvinter'' is still used to refer to an unusually cold and harsh winter.&lt;ref name="saob" /&gt;

==Etymology==
Fimbulvetr comes from [[Old Norse]], meaning "awful, great winter". The prefix "fimbul" means "the great/big" so the correct interpretation of the word is "the great winter".&lt;ref name="saob"&gt;[[Svenska Akademiens Ordbok]], entry for ''Fimbulvinter'' [http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/68/17365.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''helium dimer''' is a [[van der Waals molecule]] with formula He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of two [[helium]] [[atom]]s.&lt;ref name=s94/&gt; This molecule is the largest with two atoms, and is very weakly bound together. The bond is so weak that it will break if the molecule rotates, or vibrates too much. It can only exist at very low [[cryogenic]] temperatures.

Two excited helium atoms can also bond to each other in a form called an [[excimer]]. This was discovered from a spectrum of helium that contained bands first seen in 1912. Written as He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with the * meaning an excited state, it is the first known [[Rydberg molecule]].&lt;ref name=Raunhardt009&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Raunhardt|first1=Matthias|title=Generation and spectroscopy of atoms and molecules in metastable states|date=2009|page=84|url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:41903/eth-41903-02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dihelium ions also exist with a negative, positive and double positive charge. Two helium atoms can be confined together without bonding in the cage of a [[fullerene]].

==Molecule==
Based on [[molecular orbital theory]], He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; should not exist, and a chemical bond cannot form between the atoms. However, the [[van der Waals force]] exists between helium atoms as shown by the existence of [[liquid helium]], and at a certain range of distances between atoms the attraction exceeds the repulsion. So a molecule composed of two helium atoms bound by the van der Waals force can exist.&lt;ref name=kol04&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolganova|first1=Elena|last2=Motovilov|first2=Alexander|last3=Sandhas|first3=Werner|title=Scattering length of the helium-atom–helium-dimer collision|journal=Physical Review A|date=November 2004|volume=70|issue=5|pages=052711|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.70.052711|bibcode=2004PhRvA..70e2711K|arxiv=physics/0408019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this molecule was proposed as early as 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glockler|first1=Geo.|title=Complex formation|journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society|date=1937|volume=33|pages=224|doi=10.1039/TF9373300224|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1937/tf/tf9373300224}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the largest known molecule of two atoms when in its [[ground state]], due to its extremely long bond length.&lt;ref name=kol04/&gt; The He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has a large separation distance between the atoms of about 5200&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]] (= 52 [[ångström]]).

The molecular helium anion is also found in liquid helium that has been excited by electrons with an energy level higher than 22&amp;nbsp;eV.

==Excimers==
In a normal helium atom two electrons are found in the 1s orbital. However, if sufficient energy is added, one electron can be elevated to a higher energy level. This high energy electron can become a valence electron, and the electron that remains in the 1s orbital is a core electron. Two excited helium atoms can react with a covalent bond to form a molecule called '''dihelium''' that lasts for short times of the order of a microsecond up to second or so.&lt;ref name=Raunhardt009/&gt; Excited helium atoms in the 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S state can last for up to an hour, and react like alkali metal atoms.&lt;ref name=Vrin002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vrinceanu|first1=D.|last2=Sadeghpour|first2=H.|title=He(1 ^{1}S)–He(2 ^{3}S) collision and radiative transition at low temperatures|journal=Physical Review A|date=June 2002|volume=65|issue=6|pages=062712|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.65.062712|bibcode=2002PhRvA..65f2712V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When high energy protons hit helium gas it also produces UV emission at around 600&amp;nbsp;Å by the decay of excited highly vibrating molecules of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; state to the ground state.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; The UV radiation from excited helium molecules is used in the pulsed discharge ionization detector (PDHID) which is capable of detecting the contents of mixed gases at levels below parts per billion.&lt;ref name=Cai13&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cai|first1=Huamin|last2=Stearns|first2=Stanley D.|title=Pulsed discharge helium ionization detector with multiple combined bias/collecting electrodes for gas chromatography|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|date=April 2013 |volume=1284|pages=163–173|doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One mechanism for formation of the helium molecules is firstly a helium atom becomes excited with one electron in the 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S orbital. This excited atom meets two other non excited helium atoms in a three body association and reacts to form a A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; state molecule with maximum vibration and a helium atom.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;

Helium molecules in the quintet state &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; can be formed by the reaction of two spin polarised helium atoms in He(2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) states.

In [[liquid helium]] the excimer forms a solvation bubble.

==Use==
The dihelium excimer is an important component in the helium discharge lamp.

A second use of dihelium ion is in ambient ionization techniques using low temperature plasma. In this helium atoms are excited, and then combine to yield the dihelium ion. The He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; goes on to react with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air to make N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  These ions react with a sample surface to make positive ions that are used in [[mass spectroscopy]]. The plasma containing the helium dimer can be as low as 30&amp;nbsp;°C in temperature, and this reduces heat damage to samples.&lt;ref name="SeróNúñez2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seró|first1=R.|last2=Núñez|first2=Ó.|last3=Moyano|first3=E.|title=Ambient Ionisation–High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry|volume=71|year=2016|pages=51–88|issn=0166-526X|doi=10.1016/bs.coac.2016.01.003|journal=Comprehensive Analytical Chemistry|series=Comprehensive Analytical Chemistry|isbn=9780444635723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tropicalcyclone}}

The practice of using names to identify [[tropical cyclone]]s goes back several centuries, with storms named after places, saints or things they hit before the formal start of naming in each basin. Examples of such names are the [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane]] (also known as the "San Felipe II" hurricane) and the [[1938 New England hurricane]]. The system currently in place provides identification of tropical cyclones in a brief form that is easily understood and recognized by the public. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is given to the [[Queensland Government]] Meteorologist [[Clement Wragge]], who named tropical cyclones and anticyclones between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived in the latter part of [[World War II]] for the Western Pacific. Over the following decades formal naming schemes were introduced for several tropical cyclone basins, including the [[Tropical cyclone basins|North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins]] as well as the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Australian region|Australian region]] and [[Indian Ocean]].

However, there has been controversy over the names used at various times, with names being dropped for religious and political reasons. Female names were exclusively used in the basins at various times between 1945 and 2000, and were the subject of several protests. At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes. Due to the potential for longevity and multiple concurrent storms, the names reduce the confusion about what storm is being described in forecasts, watches and warnings. Names are assigned in order from predetermined [[Lists of tropical cyclone names|lists]] once storms have one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than {{convert|65|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}}, depending on which basin it originates in. Standards vary from basin to basin, with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific, while a significant amount of gale-force winds are required in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name, at meetings of the World Meteorological Organization's various tropical cyclone committees.

The practice of using names to identify [[tropical cyclone]]s goes back several centuries, with systems named after places, people (like [[Roman Catholic]] [[Calendar of saints|saints]]), or things they hit before the formal start of naming in each basin.&lt;ref name="Mahina"&gt;{{cite web|title=They Called the Wind Mahina: The History of Naming Cyclones|url=ftp://ftp.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/pub/dorst/Mahina.pptx|work=Hurricane Research Division, Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|author=Dorst, Neal M|at=Slides 8–72|date=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wragge"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adamson, Peter|title=Clement Lindley Wragge and the naming of weather disturbances|volume=58|issue=9|journal=Weather|date=September 2003|pages=359–363|doi=10.1256/wea.13.03|bibcode=2003Wthr...58..359A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mújica-Baker"&gt;{{Cite report|first=Frank|last=Mújica-Baker|title=Huracanes y tormentas que han afectado a Puerto Rico|publisher=Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, Agencia Estatal para el Manejo de Emergencias y Administración de Desastres|url=http://www.gobierno.pr/NR/rdonlyres/49EA64D0-305B-4881-8B85-04B518004BD5/0/Ciclones_en_PR.pdf|pages=3-23|language=Spanish|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the 1526 San Francisco hurricane (named after Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], whose [[feast day]] is observed by Catholics on October&amp;nbsp;4),&lt;ref name="Mújica-Baker"/&gt; the 1834 [[Padre Ruiz hurricane]] (named after a then-recently-deceased Catholic priest whose funeral service was being held in the [[Dominican Republic]] upon landfall there),&lt;ref name="Neely 16"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neely|first=Wayne|title=The Greatest and Deadliest Hurricanes of the Caribbean and the Americas: The Stories Behind the Great Storms of the North Atlantic|date=2016|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781532011504|page=285|url=https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=WYLIDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT285&amp;lpg=PT285&amp;dq=%22Dominican+Republic%22+hurricane+Padre+Ruiz+funeral&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rb-M7Rygpu&amp;sig=o2jIR5_2ga2QRsY789leOVX8LYg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiqg9Gq_oPeAhVHnlkKHdkwD0kQ6AEwCXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dominican%20Republic%22%20hurricane%20Padre%20Ruiz%20funeral&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Longshore 10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Longshore|first=David|title=Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones, New Edition|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438118796|page=342|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=8kXwskQHBLoC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=%22Dominican+Republic%22+hurricane+Padre+Ruiz+funeral&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qFGk0L376P&amp;sig=vfB0vXDRkTVMS91kHm_2FMYwGx0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiqg9Gq_oPeAhVHnlkKHdkwD0kQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dominican%20Republic%22%20hurricane%20Padre%20Ruiz%20funeral&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane]] (named after [[Lake Okeechobee]] in the state of [[Florida]], [[United States]], where many of its effects were felt; also named the San Felipe II hurricane in the predominantly-Catholic island of [[Puerto Rico]] after a certain [[September 13 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)#Pre-Schism Western Saints|Saint Philip]] with a September&amp;nbsp;13 feast day),&lt;ref name="Mújica-Baker"/&gt; and the [[1938 New England hurricane]].

During August and September 1950, three tropical cyclones (Hurricanes [[Hurricane Baker (1950)|Baker]], [[Hurricane Dog (1950)|Dog]] and [[Hurricane Easy (1950)|Easy]]) occurred simultaneously and impacted the United States during August and September 1950, which led to confusion within the media and the public.&lt;ref name="Mahina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TC FAQ B1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?

A Hurricane by Any Name Can Be a Killer|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, during the next tropical cyclone ([[Hurricane Fox (1950)|Fox]]), [[Grady Norton]] decided to start using the names in public statements and in the seasonal summary.&lt;ref name="TC FAQ B1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?

As the dual sex naming of tropical cyclones started in the Northern Hemisphere, the NZMS considered adding ethnic Pacific names to the naming lists rather than the European names that were currently used.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; As a result of the many languages and cultures in the Pacific there was a lot of discussion surrounding this matter, with one name, "Oni," being dropped as it meant "the end of the world" in one language.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; One proposal suggested that cyclones be named from the country nearest to which they formed; however, this was dropped when it was realized that a cyclone might be less destructive in its formative stage than later in its development.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; Eventually it was decided to combine names from all over the South Pacific into a single list at a training course, where each course member provided a list of names that were short, easily pronounced, culturally acceptable throughout the Pacific and did not contain any idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; These names were then collated, edited for suitability, and cross-checked with the group for acceptability.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; It was intended that the four lists of names should be alphabetical with alternating male and female names while using only ethnic names. However, it was not possible to complete the lists using only ethnic names.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; As a result, there was a scattering of European names in the final lists, which have been used by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] and NZMS since the [[1980-81 South Pacific cyclone season|1980–81 season]].&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; During October 1985 the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center had to request an additional list, after the names preselected for that season was used up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kirkman, Don|title=Hurricanes hitting Southwest?

== Background==
The HLA system recycles energy by converting [[kinetic energy]] into [[potential energy]] during deceleration ''via'' [[hydraulics]], storing the energy at high pressure in an [[Hydraulic accumulator|accumulator]] filled with [[nitrogen gas]]. The energy is then returned to the vehicle during subsequent acceleration thereby reducing the amount of work done by the [[internal combustion engine]].  This system provides considerable increase in vehicle productivity while reducing [[fuel consumption]] in stop-and-go use profiles like [[Garbage truck|refuse vehicles]] and other heavy duty vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;

==Parallel vs. Series Hybrids==
The HLA system is a so-called parallel [[Hydraulic hybrid vehicle|hydraulic hybrid]].  In parallel systems the original vehicle [[Powertrain|drive-line]] remains, allowing the vehicle to operate normally when the HLA system is disengaged.  When the HLA is engaged, energy is captured and released during deceleration and acceleration respectively.  This is in contrast to so-called series hydraulic hybrid systems which replaces the entire traditional drive-line to provide power transmission in addition to [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] functions.

==Hydraulic vs. Electric Hybrids==
Hydraulic hybrids are said to be [[Power density|power dense]], while electric hybrids are [[Energy density|energy dense]].  This implies that [[Hybrid electric vehicle|electric hybrids]], while able to deliver large amounts of energy over long periods of time are limited by the rate at which the [[chemical energy]] in the batteries is converted to [[mechanical energy]] and ''{{linktext|vice versa}}''.  This is largely governed by [[Reaction rate|reaction rates]] in the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and [[Ampacity|current ratings]] of associated components.  Hydraulic hybrids on the other hand are capable of transferring energy at a much higher rate, but are then limited by the amount of energy that is stored.  For this reason, hydraulic hybrids lend themselves well to stop-and-go applications or applications with high vehicle weights.

==Applications==
===Concept Vehicles===
[[Ford Motor Company]] included the HLA system in their 2002 F-350 [[Tonka]] truck [[Concept car|concept vehicle]] where it was reported to have reduced fuel consumption by 25%-35% in stop-and-go driving.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Shuttle Bus===
[[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]], Ford, the US Army, and IMPACT Engineering, Inc. (of [[Kent, Washington]]), built an E-450 [[Public_transport_bus_service#Specialist_services|shuttle bus]] as part of the Army's HAMMER (Hydraulic Hybrid Advanced Materials Multifuel Engine Research) project.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Inkjet transfer''' or '''inkjet photo transfer''' is a technique to transfer a photograph or graphic, printed with an [[inkjet printer]] onto textiles, cups, CDs, glass and other surfaces.

A special transfer sheet, usually [[ISO A4]] size, is printed on with a regular inkjet printer. The photo has to be printed as a mirror image (except for some transfer sheets for dark materials).

==T-shirt transfer==

It is often a requirement of "home made" garments (adhesive based transfers) that they be washed inside out, only in cold water, sometimes by hand, and not be tumble dried. The heat from washing or drying conventionally, or from ironing over the transfer area, can damage the transfer or cause it to separate. These attributes generally makes them less practical for frequent wear than purchased items.

The second type of transfer paper is merely a substrate which ink is deposited onto, from which it is sublimated directly into the t-shirt fibers (requires at least 50% polyester fabric).  The main advantages of this process are permanence and lack of a rough adhesive on the surface of the fabric.  This technique is used commercially, and not easily reproduced at home, since a heat press is required to heat the inks to their sublimation temperature (over 200°F) evenly.

===Technique===
The transfer sheet is placed ink side down (usually) onto a [[t-shirt]] or fabric and ironed (without steam) onto the cloth.  Some transfer sheets change color to signal that the transfer is finished. To create a glossy effect with adhesive based transfers, the transfer sheet is removed after it has been cooled down. To create a matte effect, it is peeled off while still hot.

'''Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas''' ({{lang-ua|Івано-Франківський національний технічний університет нафти і газу}}) is an institution of higher education in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Ukraine]]. 

Since its establishment in 1967, the university has been known for preparing qualified and experienced specialists for the oil and gas industries. However, it has expanded to offer education in economics, management and law that is directly related to the needs of energy industry.

Ivano-Frankivsk Oil and Gas University has a two-pronged approach toward education of its students: in the classrooms and in the field. In the classroom, students are provided the theoretical knowledge. Then, by working at university "field-classrooms" or by holding internships with regional businesses and organizations, the future specialists gain practical experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nung.edu.ua/about/index.html About IFNT University of Oil and Gas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725032633/http://nung.edu.ua/about/index.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''kile''' ({{lang-ota|كيله}}) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] unit of volume similar to a [[bushel]], like other [[dry measure]]s also often defined as a specific weight of a particular commodity.  Its value varied widely by location, period, and commodity, from 8 to 132 [[Oka (mass)|oka]]. The 'standard' kile was 36 [[liter]]s or 20 oka.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11182">The '''Komar mass''' (named after Arthur Komar&lt;ref&gt;A. Komar'', Positive-Definite Energy Density and Global Consequences for General Relativity'', Physical Review, vol. 129, Issue 4, pp. 1873–1876 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;) of a system is one of several formal concepts of [[mass]] that are used in [[general relativity]].  The Komar mass can be defined in any [[stationary spacetime]], which is a [[spacetime]] in which all the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric components]] can be written so that they are independent of time. Alternatively, a stationary spacetime can be defined as a spacetime which possesses a timelike [[Killing vector field]].

The following discussion is an expanded and simplified version of the motivational treatment in (Wald, 1984, pg 288).

== Motivation ==

Consider the [[Schwarzschild metric]].  Using the Schwarzschild basis, a [[Frame fields in general relativity#Example: Static observers in Schwarzschild vacuum|frame field]] for the Schwarzschild metric, one can find that the radial acceleration required to hold a test mass stationary at a Schwarzschild coordinate of r is:

&lt;math&gt;a^\hat{r} = \frac{m}{r^2 \sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the metric is static, there is a well-defined meaning to "holding a particle stationary".

Interpreting this acceleration as being due to a "gravitational force", we can then compute the integral of normal acceleration multiplied by area to get a "Gauss law" integral of:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4 \pi m}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2m}{r c^2}}} &lt;/math&gt;

While this approaches a constant as r approaches infinity, it is not a constant independent of r.  We are therefore motivated to introduce a correction factor to make the above integral independent of the radius r of the enclosing shell. For the Schwarzschild metric, this correction factor is just &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g_{tt}}&lt;/math&gt;, the "red-shift" or "time dilation" factor at distance r.  One may also view this factor as "correcting" the local force to the "force at infinity", the force that an observer at infinity would need to apply through a string to hold the particle stationary.  (Wald, 1984).

To proceed further, we will write down a line element for a static metric.

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = -g_{tt} \, dt^2 + \mathrm{quadratic\ form}(dx \, dy \, dz) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt; and the quadratic form are functions only of the spatial coordinates x,y,z and are not functions of time.  In spite of our choices of variable names, it should not be assumed that our coordinate system is Cartesian.  The fact that none of the metric coefficients are functions of time makes the metric stationary: the additional fact that there are no "cross terms" involving both time and space components (such as dx dt) make it static.

Because of the simplifying assumption that some of the metric coefficients are zero, some of our results in this motivational treatment will not be as general as they could be.

In flat space-time, the proper acceleration required to hold station is &lt;math&gt; du/d \tau&lt;/math&gt;, where u is the 4-velocity of our hovering particle and tau is the proper time.   In curved space-time, we must take the covariant derivative.  Thus we compute the acceleration vector as:

:&lt;math&gt; a^b = \nabla_u u^b = u^c \nabla_c u^b&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_b = u^c \nabla_c u_b &lt;/math&gt;

where u&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; is a unit time-like vector such that u&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; u&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = -1.

The component of the acceleration vector normal to the surface is 
:&lt;math&gt;a_{\mathrm{norm}}= N^b a_b \,&lt;/math&gt; where N&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; is a unit vector normal to the surface.

In a Schwarzschild coordinate system, for example, we find that 
:&lt;math&gt; N^b a_b = \left( \frac {\partial g_{tt}} {\partial r} c^2 \right) / \left( 2 g_{tt} \sqrt{g_{rr}} \right) = \frac{m}{r^2 \sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;
as expected - we have simply re-derived the previous results presented in a frame-field in a coordinate basis.

We define &lt;math&gt;a\mathrm{inf} = \sqrt{g_{tt}} a\,&lt;/math&gt; so that in our Schwarzschild example &lt;math&gt;N^b a\mathrm{inf}_b = m/r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

We can, if we desire, derive the accelerations a&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and the adjusted "acceleration at infinity" ainf&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; from a scalar potential Z, though there is not necessarily any particular advantage in doing so. (Wald 1984, pg 158, problem 4)

&lt;math&gt;a_b = \nabla_b Z_1 \qquad Z_1 = \ln{gtt}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a\mathrm{inf}_b = \nabla_b Z_2 \qquad Z_2 = \sqrt{g_{tt}}&lt;/math&gt;

We will demonstrate that integrating the normal component of the "acceleration at infinity" ainf over a bounding surface will give us a quantity that does not depend on the shape of the enclosing sphere, so that we can calculate the mass enclosed by a sphere by the integral

&lt;math&gt;m = -\frac{1}{4 \pi} \int_A N^b a\mathrm{inf}_b dA&lt;/math&gt;

To make this demonstration, we need to express this surface integral as a volume integral.  In flat space-time, we would use [[Stokes theorem]] and integrate &lt;math&gt;-\nabla \cdot a\mathrm{inf}&lt;/math&gt; over the volume.  In curved space-time, this approach needs to be modified slightly.

Using the formulas for [[Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime|electromagnetism in curved space-time]] as a guide, we write instead.

&lt;!--sign - wrong here, or wrong later? --&gt;
&lt;math&gt;F_{ab} = a\,\mathrm{inf}_a \,u_b - a\,\mathrm{inf}_b \,u_a \,&lt;/math&gt;

where F plays a role similar to the "Faraday tensor", in that &lt;math&gt;a\mathrm{inf}_a = F_{ab} u^b\,&lt;/math&gt; We can then find the value of "gravitational charge", i.e. mass, by evaluating

&lt;math&gt;\nabla^a F_{ab} u^b&lt;/math&gt; and integrating it over the volume of our sphere.

An alternate approach would be to use [[Differential form#Integration of form|differential forms]], but the approach above is computationally more convenient as well as not requiring the reader to understand differential forms.

A  lengthy, but straightforward (with computer algebra) calculation from our assumed line element shows us that

&lt;math&gt; -u^b \nabla^a F_{ab} =  \sqrt{g_{tt}} R_{00} u^a u^b = \sqrt{g_{tt}} R_{ab} u^a u^b &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can write

&lt;math&gt;m = \frac {\sqrt{g_{tt}}} {4 \pi} \int_V R_{ab} u^a u^b &lt;/math&gt;

In any vacuum region of space-time, all components of the Ricci tensor must be zero.  This demonstrates that enclosing any amount of vacuum will not change our volume integral.  It also means that our volume integral will be constant for any enclosing surface, as long as we enclose all of the gravitating mass inside our surface.   Because Stokes theorem guarantees that our surface integral is equal to the above volume integral, our surface integral will also be independent of the enclosing surface as long as the surface encloses all of the gravitating mass.

By using Einstein's Field Equations

:&lt;math&gt;G^u{}_v = R^u{}_v - \frac{1}{2} R I^u{}_v = 8 \pi T^u{}_v&lt;/math&gt;

letting u=v and summing, we can show that R = -8 π T.

This allows us to rewrite our mass formula as a volume integral of the stress–energy tensor.

&lt;math&gt; m =  \int_V \sqrt{g_{tt}} \left( 2 T_{ab} - T g_{ab} \right) u^a u^b dV&lt;/math&gt;
:where V is the volume being integrated over
:T&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Stress–energy tensor]]
:u&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; is a unit time-like vector such that u&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; u&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -1

== Komar mass as volume integral - general stationary metric ==

To make the formula for Komar mass work for a general stationary metric, regardless of the choice of coordinates, it must be modified slightly.  We will present the applicable result from (Wald, 1984 eq 11.2.10 ) without a formal proof.

&lt;math&gt; m =  \int_V \left( 2 T_{ab} - T g_{ab} \right) u^a \xi^b dV&lt;/math&gt;

:where V is the volume being integrated over
:T&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Stress–energy tensor]]
:u&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; is a unit time-like vector such that u&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; u&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -1
:&lt;math&gt;\xi^b&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Killing vector]], which expresses the [[Time translation symmetry|time-translation symmetry]] of any [[stationary metric]].  The Killing vector is normalized so that it has a unit length at infinity, i.e. so that &lt;math&gt;\xi^a \xi_a = -1&lt;/math&gt; at infinity.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\xi^b\,&lt;/math&gt; replaces &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{g_{tt}} u^b\,&lt;/math&gt; in our motivational result.

If none of the metric coefficients &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}\,&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time, &lt;math&gt;\xi^a = \left( 1, 0, 0, 0 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

While it is not ''necessary'' to choose coordinates for a stationary space-time such that the metric coefficients are independent of time, it is often ''convenient''.

When we chose such coordinates, the time-like Killing vector for our system &lt;math&gt;\xi^a\,&lt;/math&gt;  becomes a scalar multiple of a unit coordinate-time vector &lt;math&gt;u^a\,&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.  &lt;math&gt;\xi^a = K u^a\,&lt;/math&gt;.  When this is the case, we can rewrite our formula as

&lt;math&gt; m = \int_V \left( 2T_{00} - T g_{00} \right) K dV&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;u^a&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a unit vector, K is just the length of &lt;math&gt;\xi^b&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. K = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{- \xi^a \xi_a}&lt;/math&gt;.

Evaluating the "red-shift" factor K based on our knowledge of the components of &lt;math&gt;\xi^a&lt;/math&gt;, we can see that  K = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g_{tt}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If we chose our spatial coordinates so that we have a locally [[Minkowskian]] metric &lt;math&gt;g_{ab} = \eta_{ab}\,&lt;/math&gt; we know that

:&lt;math&gt;g_{00}=-1, T = -T_{00}+ T_{11}+T_{22}+T_{33}\,&lt;/math&gt;

With these coordinate choices, we can write our Komar integral as

:&lt;math&gt;m = \int_V \sqrt{-\xi^a \xi_a} \left( T_{00}+T_{11}+T_{22}+T_{33} \right) dV &lt;/math&gt;

While we can't choose a coordinate system to make a curved space-time globally Minkowskian, the above formula provides some insight into the meaning of the Komar mass formula.  Essentially, both energy and pressure contribute to the Komar mass.  Furthermore, the contribution of local energy and mass to the system mass is multiplied by the local "red shift" factor &lt;math&gt;K = \sqrt{g_{tt}} = \sqrt{-\xi^a \xi_a}&lt;/math&gt;

== Komar mass as surface integral - general stationary metric ==

We also wish to give the general result for expressing the Komar mass as a surface integral.

The formula for the Komar mass in terms of the metric and its Killing vector is (Wald, 1984, pg 289, formula 11.2.9)

&lt;math&gt;m = - \frac{1}{8 \pi} \int_S \epsilon_{abcd} \nabla^c \xi^d &lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{abcd}\,&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Levi-Civita symbol|Levi-civita]] symbols
:&lt;math&gt;\xi^d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Killing vector]] of our [[stationary metric]], normalized so that &lt;math&gt;\xi^a \xi_a = -1&lt;/math&gt; at infinity.

The surface integral above is interpreted as the [[Differential form#Integration of forms|"natural"]] integral of a two form over a manifold.

As mentioned previously, if none of the metric coefficients &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}\,&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time, &lt;math&gt;\xi^a = \left( 1, 0, 0, 0 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The Koeberg nuclear power station is the only nuclear power station in South Africa and contains two uranium pressurised water reactors based on a design by [[Framatome]] of France. The station is located 30&amp;nbsp;km north of Cape Town. The plant is owned and operated by the country's national electricity supplier, [[Eskom]].

=== PBMR ===
The [[Pebble bed modular reactor]] (PBMR) was a particular design of [[pebble-bed reactor]] under development by South African company PBMR (Pty) Ltd since 1994. The project entailed the construction of a demonstration power plant at Koeberg near Cape Town and a fuel plant at [[Pelindaba]] near Pretoria. Government financing was withdrawn in 2010 because of missed deadlines and lack of customers.&lt;ref name=nip88&gt;

== Research ==
The [[South African Nuclear Energy Corporation]] (NECSA) was established as a public company by the Republic of South Africa Nuclear Energy Act in 1999 and is wholly owned by the [[South Africa|State]]. NECSA replaced the country's Atomic Energy Corporation. The main functions of NECSA are to undertake and promote research and development in the field of nuclear energy and related technologies; to process and store nuclear material and other restricted material; and to co-ordinate with other organisations in matters falling within these spheres.

The project is currently being dismantled.

== Education ==
The following South African universities offer courses in nuclear engineering:
* [[University of the Witwatersrand]], [[Johannesburg]]
* [[North-West University]], at the Post-graduate School of Nuclear Science and Engineering in [[Potchefstroom]]
* [[University of Cape Town]], [[Cape Town]]

The '''particle density''' or '''true density''' of a [[Granular material|particulate solid]] or [[Powder (substance)|powder]], is the density of the particles that make up the powder, in contrast to the [[bulk density]], which measures the average density of a large volume of the powder in a specific medium (usually [[air]]).

The particle density is a relatively well-defined quantity, as it is not dependent on the degree of compaction of the solid, whereas the bulk density has different values depending on whether it is measured in the freely settled or compacted state (tap density).  However, a variety of definitions of particle density are available, which differ in terms of whether pores are included in the particle volume, and whether voids are included.

==Measurement==

The measurement of particle density can be done in a number of ways:

===Archimedes' principle===

The powder is placed inside a pycnometer of known volume, and weighed.  The [[Relative_density#Pycnometer|Pycnometer]] is then filled with a fluid of known density, in which the powder is not soluble.  The volume of the powder is determined by the difference between the volume as shown by the pycnometer, and the volume of liquid added (i.e. the volume of air displaced).  A similar method, which does not include pore volume, is to suspend a known mass of particles in molten wax of known density, allow any bubbles to escape, allow the wax to solidify, and then measure the volume and mass of the wax/particulate brick.

A slurry of the powder in a liquid of known density can also be used with a [[hydrometer]] to measure particle density by [[buoyancy]].

Another method based on buoyancy is to measure the weight of the sample in air, and also in a liquid of known density.

A column of liquid with a density gradient can also be prepared:  The column should contain a liquid of continuously varying composition, so that the maximum density (at the bottom) is higher than that of the solid, and the minimum density is lower.  If a small sample of powder is allowed to settle in this column, it will come to rest at the point where the liquid density is equal to the particle density.

===Volumetric measurement===

A [[gas pycnometer]] can be used to measure the volume of a powder sample.  A sample of known mass is loaded into a chamber of known volume that is connected by a closed valve to a gas reservoir, also of known volume, at a higher pressure than the chamber.  After the valve is opened, the final pressure in the system allows the total gas volume to be determined by application of [[Boyle's law]].

A mercury [[porosimeter]] is an instrument that allows the total volume of a powder to be determined, as well as the volume of pores of different sizes:  A known mass of powder is submerged in mercury.  At ambient pressure, the mercury does not invade the interparticle spaces or the pores of the sample.  At increasing pressure, the mercury invades smaller and smaller pores, with the relationship between pore diameter and pressure being known.  A continuous trace of pressure versus volume can then be generated, which allows for a complete characterization of the sample's porosity.

A '''picul''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|k|əl}}&lt;ref name=OED&gt;http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50178784 "Picul" entry] at the [[OED Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word ''picul'' appeared as early as the mid 9th century in [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. 

Following [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and most especially the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial maritime trade, the term ''picul'' was both a convenient unit, and a [[lingua franca]] unit that was widely understood and employed by other [[Austronesian]]s (in modern [[Malaysia]] and the [[Philippines]]) and their centuries-old trading relations with [[India]]ns, [[China|Chinese]] and [[Arab]]s. It remained a convenient reference unit for many commercial trade journals in the 19th century. One example is ''Hunts Merchant Magazine'' of 1859 giving detailed tables of expected prices of various commodities, such as coffee, e.g. one picul of Javanese coffee could be expected to be bought from 8 to 8.50 Spanish dollars in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Hunt, Thomas Prentice Kettell, William Buck Dana. ''Hunt's merchants' magazine and commercial review, Volume 41''.Freeman Hunt, 1859 Google PDF download: [https://books.google.com/books/download/Hunt_s_merchants__magazine_and_commercia.pdf?id=OYooAAAAYAAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U363vNMSBj7ygE11A-iXyEIm9wa5Q&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:China &amp; Opium 1908 en.jpg|thumb|right|A 1903 map showing opium production in China measured in piculs]]
As for any [[History of measurement|traditional measurement unit]], the exact definition of the picul varied historically and regionally.
In imperial China and later, the unit was used for a measure equivalent to 100 [[catty|catties]].&lt;ref name="Xinhua Zidian"&gt;新华字典 (''[[Xīnhuá Zìdiǎn]]''), Peking, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, the [[Dutch East Indies]] authorities acknowledged local variances in the definition of the pikul.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Rasyid Asba. ''Kopra Makassar: perebutan pusat dan daerah : kajian sejarah ekonomi politik regional di Indonesia.'' Yayasan Obor Indonesia, 2007. {{ISBN|978-979-461-634-5}}.
318 pages quoting Algemen Verslag Resdientie Banoemas 1831: ANRIJ and ANRIJ Makassar 291/18: Chinne ''Verslag van de Havenmeester''&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Hong Kong]], one picul was defined in ''Ordinance No. 22 of 1844'' as {{frac|133|1|3}} [[avoirdupois pound]]s.&lt;ref name="1844 Ordinance"&gt;[http://oelawhk.lib.hku.hk/items/show/26 Weights and Measures – Ordinance No. 22 of 1844], Historical Laws of Hong Kong Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern definition is exactly 60.478982 [[kilogram]]s.&lt;ref name = "hk_law"/&gt;
The measure was and remains used on occasion in Taiwan where it is defined as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/appendix6.htm Weights and Measures in Use in Taiwan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229224604/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/appendix6.htm |date=2010-12-29 }} from the ''Republic of China Yearbook--Taiwan 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[last (unit)|last]], a measure of rice, was 20&amp;nbsp;picul, or 1,200&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrade |first=Tonio |year=2005 |title=How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century |url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/ |publisher=Columbia University Press |chapter=Appendix A: Weights, Measures, and Exchange Rates |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/appA.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The stone==
While the character "石" ("stone") is normally pronounced ''shi'' ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]: ''sek6''), as a unit of measure it is pronounced ''dàn'' ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]: ''daam3'').&lt;ref name="Xinhua Zidian"/&gt;

Historically, during the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasties, the stone was used as a unit of measurement equal to 120 [[catty|catties]]. Government officials at the time were paid in grain, counted in stones. The amount of salary in weight was then used as a ranking system for officials, with the top ministers being paid 2000 stones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/han-shu/bai-guan-gong-qing-biao 《漢書》 百官公卿表]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of [[Hong Kong]] as a British colony, the stone (石, with a Cantonese pronunciation given as ''shik'') was used as a measurement of weight equal to 120 catties or {{convert|160|lb|kg|lk=on|sigfig=3}}, alongside the picul of 100 catties.&lt;ref name="1844 Ordinance"/&gt; It was made obsolete by subsequent overriding legislation in 1885, which included the picul but not the stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oelawhk.lib.hku.hk/items/show/814 Weights and Measures Ordinance, 1885], Historical Laws of Hong Kong Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], a '''reaction mechanism''' is the step by step [[sequence]] of [[elementary reaction]]s by which overall [[Chemical substance|chemical]] change occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{JerryMarch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A chemical mechanism is a theoretical conjecture that tries to describe in detail what takes place at each stage of an overall chemical reaction. The detailed steps of a reaction are not observable in most cases. The conjectured mechanism is chosen because it is thermodynamically  feasible, and has experimental support in isolated intermediates (see next section) or other quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the reaction. It also describes each [[reactive intermediate]], [[activated complex]], and [[transition state]], and which bonds are broken (and in what order), and which bonds are formed (and in what order). A complete mechanism must also explain the reason for the [[reactant]]s and [[catalyst]] used, the [[stereochemistry]] observed in reactants and products, all [[Product (chemistry)|product]]s formed and the amount of each. 
[[Image:BromoethaneSN2reaction-small.png|thumb|center|540px|[[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction]] mechanism.  Note the negatively charged [[transition state]] in brackets in which the central [[carbon atom]] in question shows five bonds, an unstable condition.]]

The [[Arrow pushing|electron or arrow pushing]] method is often used in illustrating a reaction mechanism; for example, see the illustration of the mechanism for [[benzoin condensation]] in the following examples section.

A reaction mechanism must also account for the order in which molecules react. Often what appears to be a single-step conversion is in fact a multistep reaction.

==Reaction Intermediates==

Reaction intermediates are chemical species, often unstable and short-lived (however sometimes can be isolated), which are not reactants or products of the overall chemical reaction, but are temporary products and/or reactants in the mechanism's reaction steps.  Reaction intermediates are often [[free radicals]] or [[ions]]. 

The kinetics (relative rates of the reaction steps and the [[rate equation]] for the overall reaction) are explained in terms of the energy needed for the conversion of the reactants to the proposed transition states (molecular states that corresponds to  maxima on the [[reaction coordinate|reaction coordinates]], and to [[saddle point]]s on the  [[potential energy surface]] for the reaction).  

==Chemical kinetics==
Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of [[chemical kinetics]] to determine the [[rate equation]] and the [[reaction order]] in each reactant.&lt;ref&gt;Espenson, James H. ''Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms'' (2nd ed., McGraw-Hill, 2002) chap.6, ''Deduction of Reaction Mechanisms'' {{ISBN|0-07-288362-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the following reaction for example:

:CO + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NO

In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the [[rate law]] &lt;math&gt;r = k[NO_2]^2&lt;/math&gt;. This form suggests that the [[rate-determining step]] is a reaction between two molecules of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is:

:2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NO (slow)
:NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO &amp;rarr; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (fast)

Each step is called an elementary step, and each has its own [[rate law]] and [[molecularity]]. The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction. (Meaning, if we were to cancel out all the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction, we would be left with the original reaction.)

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the [[rate-determining step]]. Because it involves the collision of two NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate law of &lt;math&gt;r = k[NO_2]^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In [[organic chemistry]], the reaction mechanism for the [[benzoin condensation]], put forward in 1903 by [[A. J. Lapworth]], was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.
[[Image:Benzoin condensation2.svg|center|thumb|700px|[[Benzoin condensation]] '''reaction mechanism'''. [[Cyanide]] ion (CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) acts as a [[catalyst]] here, entering at the first step and leaving in the last step. Proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) transfers occur at (i) and (ii).  The [[arrow pushing]] method is used in some of the steps to show where electron pairs go.]]

A [[Chain reaction#Chemical chain reactions|chain reaction]] is an example of a complex mechanism, in which the [[Chain propagation|propagation]] steps form a closed cycle.

==Other experimental methods to determine mechanism==
Many [[experiment]]s that suggest the possible sequence of steps in a reaction mechanism have been designed, including:

* measurement of the effect of temperature ([[Arrhenius equation]]) to determine the [[activation energy]]&lt;ref&gt;Espenson p.156-160&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] observation of [[reaction intermediates]]
* determination of the [[stereochemistry]] of products, for example in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions&lt;ref&gt;Morrison R.T. and Boyd R.N. ''Organic Chemistry'' (4th ed., Allyn and Bacon 1983) p.216-9 and p.228-231, {{ISBN|0-205-05838-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* measurement of the effect of [[kinetic isotope effect|isotopic substitution]] on the reaction rate&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Atkins|Atkins P]] and de Paula J, ''Physical Chemistry'' (8th ed., W.H. Freeman 2006) p.816-8 {{ISBN|0-7167-8759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* for reactions in solution, measurement of the effect of pressure on the reaction rate to determine the volume change on formation of the activated complex&lt;ref&gt;Moore J.W. and [[Ralph Pearson|Pearson R.G.]] ''Kinetics and Mechanism'' (3rd ed., John Wiley 1981) p.276-8 {{ISBN|0-471-03558-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler K.J.]] and Meiser J.H., ''Physical Chemistry'' (Benjamin/Cummings 1982) p.389-392 {{ISBN|0-8053-5682-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* for reactions of ions in solution, measurement of the effect of [[ionic strength]] on the reaction rate&lt;ref&gt;Atkins and de Paula p.884-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laidler and Meiser p.388-9&lt;/ref&gt;
* direct observation of the [[activated complex]] by [[femtochemistry|pump-probe spectroscopy]]&lt;ref&gt;Atkins and de Paula p.892-3&lt;/ref&gt;
* infrared [[chemiluminescence]] to detect vibrational excitation in the products&lt;ref&gt;Atkins and de Paula p.886&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laidler and Meiser p.396-7&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[electrospray ionization mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Investigation of chemical reactions in solution using API-MS''
Leonardo Silva Santos, Larissa Knaack, Jurgen O. Metzger [[International Journal of Mass Spectrometry|Int. J. Mass Spectrom.]]; '''2005'''; 246 pp 84 - 104; (Review) {{doi|10.1016/j.ijms.2005.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[crossover experiment (chemistry)|crossover experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;Espenson p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical modeling==
A correct reaction mechanism is an important part of accurate [[predictive modeling]]. For many combustion and plasma systems, detailed mechanisms are not available or require development.

Even when information is available, identifying and assembling the relevant data from a variety of sources, reconciling discrepant values and extrapolating to different conditions can be a difficult process without expert help. Rate constants or thermochemical data are often not available in the literature, so [[computational chemistry]] techniques or [[group additivity method]]s must be used to obtain the required parameters.

Computational chemistry methods can also be used to calculate [[potential energy surface]]s for reactions and determine probable mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins and de Paula p.887-891&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecularity==
{{main|molecularity}}

'''Molecularity''' in [[chemistry]] is the number of colliding [[molecular entity|molecular entities]] that are involved in a single [[reaction step]].
* A reaction step involving one molecular entity is called unimolecular.
* A reaction step involving two molecular entities is called bimolecular.
* A reaction step involving three molecular entities is called trimolecular or termolecular.

In general, reaction steps involving more than three molecular entities do not occur, because is statistically improbable in terms of Maxwell distribution to find such transition state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34967">As with any material implanted in the body, it is important to minimize or eliminate [[foreign body]] response and maximize effectual integration. [[Brain implant|Neural implants]] have the potential to increase the quality of life for patients with such disabilities as [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], [[epilepsy]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[migraines]]. With the complexity of interfaces between a neural implant and brain tissue, adverse reactions such as fibrous tissue encapsulation that hinder the functionality, occur. Surface modifications to these implants can help improve the tissue-implant interface, increasing the lifetime and effectiveness of the implant.
[[File:Paint Electrode Array.png|thumb|400px|Typical neural implant electrode array.]]

== Background on Intracranial Electrodes ==

Intracranial electrodes consist of conductive electrode arrays implanted on a polymer or silicon, or a wire electrode with an exposed tip and insulation everywhere that stimulation or recording is not desired. [[Biocompatibility]] is essential for the entire implant, but special attention is paid to the actual electrodes since they are the site producing the desired function.

===Issues with Current Intracranial Electrodes===
One main physiological issue that current [[chronic electrode implants|long-term implanted electrodes]] suffer from are fibrous glial encapsulations after implantation. This encapsulation is due to the poor biocompatibility and biostability (integration at the hard electrode and [[soft tissue]] interface) of many neural electrodes being used today. The encapsulation causes a reduced signal intensity because of the increased electrical impedance and decreased charge transfer between the electrode and the tissue. The encapsulation causes decreased efficiency, performance, and durability.

[[Electrical impedance]] is the opposition to current flow with an applied voltage, usually represented as ''Z'' in units of ohms (Ω). The impedance of an electrode is especially important as it is directly related to its effectiveness. A high impedance causes poor charge transfer and thus poor electrode performance for either stimulating or recording the [[neural tissue]]. Electrode impedance is related to surface area at the interface between the electrode and the tissue. At electrode sites, the total impedance is controlled by the double-layer [[capacitance]].&lt;ref name=Joe1&gt;{{cite journal | title = Preparation and characterization of biocompatible carbon electrodes| journal= Composites Part B: Engineering | author1 = Jayapriya, J | year = 2012 | pages = 1329–1335|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacitance value is directly related to the surface area. Increasing the surface area at the electrode-tissue interface will increase the capacitance and thus decrease the impedance. The equation below describes the inverse relationship between the capacitance and impedance.

: &lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{1}{{i} \omega C_b + 1/R_b}&lt;/math&gt;

where i is the imaginary unit, w is the frequency of the current, C is capacitance, and R is resistance.

A desirable electrode would have a low impedance meaning a higher surface area. One method to increase this area is coating the electrode surfaces with a variety of materials. Many new materials and techniques are being researched to improve the behavior of neural electrodes. Currently, research is being done to increase the biocompatibility and integration of electrodes in neural tissue; this research is discussed in more detail below.

== Importance of Surface Chemistry ==

[[Surface chemistry]] of implantable electrodes proves to be more of a design concern for chronically implanted electrodes as compared to those with only acute implantation times. For acute implantations, the main concerns are [[laceration]] damage and degradation of particles left behind after electrode removal. For chronically implanted electrodes the cellular response and tissue encapsulation of the foreign body, regardless of degradation – even for materials that are highly biocompatible – are the primary concerns. Degradation, however, is still undesirable because particles can be toxic to tissue, can spread throughout the body, and even trigger an allergic response. Surface chemistry is an area of science applicable to biological implants. Bulk material properties are important when considering applications, however, it is the materials' surface (top several layers of molecules) that determines the biological response and is therefore the key to implant success.&lt;ref name=420Book&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biomaterials: The Intersection of Biology and Materials Science | author1 = Mikos, A.G. | author2 = Temenoff, J.S. | year = 2008 | pages = 138–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implants within the central nervous system are unique in their manor of cellular response; there is little room for error. Prosthesis in these areas are typically electrodes or [[multielectrode array|electrode arrays]].

== Electrochemical Considerations ==
Electrodes, especially stimulating electrodes and the high current density they discharge, can raise electrochemical issues. Electrodes will be surrounded by tissue and [[electrolytes]]; stimulation, resultant electric fields, and induced polarizations will change local ion concentrations and local pH which can then cause problems such as material corrosion and electrode fouling.&lt;ref name=Joe5&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biocompatibility Considerations at Stimulating Electrode Interfaces | journal= Annals of Biomedical Engineering| author1 = Beard, R.B.| year = 1992 | pages = 395–410|display-authors=etal | doi=10.1007/bf02368539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pourbaix diagram|Pourbiax diagrams]] will show the phases that a material will take in an aqueous environment, based on electrical potential and pH. The brain maintains a pH of around 7.2 to 7.4, and from the [[Pourbaix diagram]] of [[platinum]] &lt;ref name=Joe5 /&gt; it can be seen that at around 0.8 volts Pt at the surface will oxidize to PtO2, and at around 1.6 volts, PtO2 will oxidize to PtO3. These voltages do not seem to be outside of reasonable range for neural stimulation. The voltage required for stimulation may change significantly over the life of a single electrode. This change is required to maintain a consistent current output through variations in the surrounding environmental resistance. The changes in resistance may be due to: adsorption of material onto the electrode, corrosion of the electrode, encapsulation of the electrode in fibrous tissue – known as a [[glial scar]], or changes in the chemical environment around the electrode. Ohm's law ''V'' = ''I'' * ''R'' shows the interdependence of voltage, current and resistance. When voltage change causes a crossing of equilibrium lines as seen in a Pourbaix diagram during a stimulation, the changing polarization of the electrode is no longer linear.&lt;ref name=Joe5 /&gt; Undesirable polarization can lead to adverse effects such as corrosion, fouling, and toxicity. Because of this equilibrium potential, pH, and required current density should be considered when making material choice since these can affect the surface chemistry and biocompatibility of the implant.&lt;ref name=Joe5 /&gt;

=== Corrosion ===
[[Corrosion]] is a major issue with neural electrodes. Corrosion can occur because electrode metals are placed in an electrolytic solution, where the presence of current can either increase the rate of corrosion mechanisms or overcome limiting activation energies. [[Redox]] reactions are a mechanism of corrosion that can lead to dissolution of ions from the electrode surface. There is a base level of metal ions in tissue, however, when these levels increase beyond threshold values the ions become toxic and can cause severe health problems.&lt;ref name=toxicions&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hip implants – Paper VI – Ion concentrations | journal= Materials &amp; Design |author1 = Sargeant, Goswami | year = 2007 | pages = 155–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the fidelity of the electrode system can be compromised. Knowing the impedance of an electrode is important whether the electrode is used for stimulation or recording. When degradation of the electrode surface occurs because of corrosion, the surface area increases with its roughness. Calculating a new electrode impedance to compensate for the change in surface area once implanted it is not easy. This computational flaw can skew data from recording or pose a dangerous obstacle limiting safe stimulation.

=== Electrode Fouling ===
Electrode [[fouling]] is a major hindrance on the performance of electrodes. Few materials are completely bioinert, as in they trigger no bodily reaction. Some material that may be bioinert in theory fails to be ideal in practice because of defects in their formation, processing, manufacturing or sterilization. Fouling can be caused by adsorption of proteins, fibrous tissue, trapped cells or dead cell fragments, bacteria, or any other reactive particle. Protein adsorption is influenced by the nature and geometry of domains including hydrophobicity, polar and ionic interactions of the material and surrounding particles, charge distribution, kinetic movement, and pH.&lt;ref name=Joe5 /&gt; Phagocytosis of bacteria and other particles is mainly affected by surface charge, hydrophobicity, and chemical composition of the implant. It is important to note that the initial environment the implant is subjected to after implantation is different and unique compared to the environment after some time has passed since the area will undergo wound repair; the body's natural healing of the trauma will cause changes in local pH, electrolyte concentrations, and the presence and activity of biological compounds.

== Properties of Metals ==
For many reasons known and unknown, [[protein adsorption]] varies from material to material. Two of the biggest determining factors that have been observed are surface roughness and surface free energy.&lt;ref name=Joe9&gt;{{cite journal | title = Protein adsorption on materials for recording sites on implantable microelectrodes | journal= J Mater Sci: Mater Med | author1 = Selvakumaran, Jamunanithy | year = 2008 | pages = 143–151|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of exposed electrodes, it is desirable to have the adsorbed protein layer as thin as possible to increase sensitivity and performance. Noble metals are an obvious choice for achieving biocompatibility; however, when acting as electrodes, some of these noble metals will actually participate in the reaction, deteriorate, and trigger adverse effects via lost particles. The most (noble metals) are gold (Au), platinum (Pt), and iridium (Ir).

  and form the first adsorbed layer. As stated before this first layer determines the adsorption from then on out.

The properties of [[titanium]] were also investigated in the study that produced the data&lt;ref name=Joe5 /&gt; for the above table, however, its properties are not listed here since its poor conductive properties make it unsuitable for neural implants. Insight on titanium's surface chemistry may give direction to future research. Titanium has the roughest and most [[hydrophilic]] surface of any metal described thus far (the importance of protein adsorption, its mechanisms, and the interplay of hydrophilic properties are discusses further in the [[#Hydrogels|hydrogels]] section of the page). Titanium adsorbed the thickest protein layer after the first day and still after the seventh day, but actually had its thickness reduced by the 28th day. Gold, platinum and iridium's protein layers all continued to grow up until the 28th day, but the rates slowed over time.&lt;ref name=Joe9 /&gt;

Two more conductive materials that have notable characteristics are [[tungsten]] and [[indium tin oxide]]. Tungsten is electrically conductive and can be manufactured down to a very fine point, and for this reason has been used in intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) for mapping out spinal cords during terminal surgeries. Tungsten electrodes, however, can corrode and form tungstic ions in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and/or O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Tungstic acid has been seen to be highly toxic to cat motorneurons,&lt;ref name=Joe4&gt;{{cite journal | title = Epileptogenic action of tungstic acid gel on cat lumbar motoneurons | journal= Brain Res | author1 = Schwindt, P.C.| author2 = Spain, W.| author3=Crill, W| year = 1984 | pages = 140–144 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(84)90660-7 | volume=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason, does not currently make a suitable material for chronic implants. Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been used as electrode material for in vitro studies. ITO electrodes are very precise when stimulating and recording and when placed amongst plasma proteins, develop and maintain the thinnest protein layer compared to the other materials so far mentioned.&lt;ref name=Joe9 /&gt; It may have potential for acute in vivo usage, but over time, it has been observed to let go of particles producing highly toxic effects.&lt;ref name=Joe11&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sintered indium-tin-oxide (ITO) particles: a new pneumotoxic entity| journal= Industrial Toxicology and Occupational Medicine, Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels | author1 = Lison, D| year = 2009 | pages = 472–481|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical Adaptations ==
A variety of mechanical adaptations, such as tip geometry and surface roughness, to aid in neural implant design have been investigated and implemented in recent years. The geometry of an electrode affects the shape of the electric field emitted. The electric field shape, in turn, affects the current density produced by the electrode. Determining optimum surface roughness for neural implants proves to be a challenging topic. Smooth surfaces may be preferable to rougher ones as they may decrease the likelihood of bacterial adsorption and infection. Smooth surfaces would also make it more difficult for the initiation of a corrosion cell. However, creating a rougher, porous surface, may prove beneficial for at least two reasons: decreased potential polarization at the electrode surface as a result of increased surface area and decreased current density, and a decrease in fibrous tissue encapsulation thickness due to opportunity for tissue ingrowth. It has been determined that if interconnected pores with sizes between 25 and 150 [[micrometre|micrometers]], ingrowth of tissue can occur and can decrease the exterior tissue encapsulation thickness by a factor of approximately 10 (compared to a smooth electrode such as polished platinum-iridium).&lt;ref name=Joe5 /&gt;

== Coatings ==
Different material coatings for neural electrode surfaces are being researched to improve the long-term integration of electrodes in the neural tissue by improving biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and the charge transport between the electrode and the living tissue. The electrode functionality can be increased by adding a surface modification on the electrode of a conducting porous polymer with the incorporation of cell adhesion peptides, proteins, and anti-inflammatory drugs.&lt;ref name=BMED /&gt;

=== Conducting polymers ===
Polymers, especially conductive ones, have been widely researched to coat electrode surfaces. [[Conducting polymers|Conductive polymers]] are organic materials that have properties similar to metals and semiconductors in their ability conduct electricity and attractive optical properties.&lt;ref name = BMED /&gt; These materials have rough surfaces, resulting in large surface area and charge density. Conducting polymer coatings have been shown to improve the performance and stability of neural electrode.

Conductive polymers have been shown to lower the impedance of electrodes (an important property as mentioned above), increase the charge density, and improve the mechanical interface between the soft tissue and hard electrode. The porous (rough) structure of many conductive polymer coatings on the electrode increases the surface area.&lt;ref name=BMED /&gt; The high surface area of conductive polymers is directly related to decreased impedance and charge transfer improvement at the tissue-electrode interface. This improved charge transfer allows for better recording and stimulating in neural application. Table 2 below shows some common impedance and charge density values of different electrodes at a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, which is the characteristic of neural biological activity. The porous, high surface area of the conductive polymer coatings allows for target cell adhesion (increased cell and tissue integration), which increase the bio-compatibility and stability of the device.

[[File:Electrodepalacios.png|thumb|400px|Elastic modulus of the polymer coating interface between the hard electrode and soft tissue surface]]
Conducting polymer coatings as mentioned above can greatly improve the interface between the soft tissue in the body and the hard electrode surface. Polymers are softer, which reduces the inflammation from strain mismatch between tissue and electrode surface. The reduced inflammatory reaction causes a decrease in thickness of the glial encapsulation which causes signal degeneration. The elastic modulus of silicon (a common material that electrodes are made from) is around 100&amp;nbsp;GPa and the tissue in the brain is about 100&amp;nbsp;kPa.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite journal | title = Chapter 7: Soft, Fuzzy, and Bioactive Conducting Polymers for Improving the Chronic Performance of Neural Prosthetic Devices| journal= Indwelling Neural Implants: Strategies for Contending with the in Vivo Environment| author1 = Dong-Hwan, Kim | year = 2008 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrode modulus (stiffness) is about 100 times greater than that of the tissue in the brain. For the best device integration in the body, it is important to get the  stiffness between the two to be as similar as possible. To improve this interface, a conductive polymer coating (smaller modulus than the electrode) can be applied to the electrode surface which causes a gradient of mechanical properties to act as a mediator between the hard and soft surfaces. The added polymer coating reduces the stiffness of the electrode and allows for better integration of the electrode. The figure to the right shows a graph of how the modulus changes when integrating the polymer coating onto the electrode.

====Processing of conducting polymer coatings====
Another benefit of using conductive polymers as a coating for neural devices is the ease of synthesis and flexibility in processing.&lt;ref name=BMED&gt;{{cite journal | title = Conducting polymers in biomedical engineering| journal= Progress in Polymer Science| author1 = Guimard, Nathalie | year = 2007 |pages = 876–921 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducting polymers can be directly "deposited onto electrode surfaces with precisely controlled morphologies".&lt;ref name = book /&gt; There are two current ways conducting polymers can be deposited onto electrode surfaces which are chemical polymerization and electrochemical polymerization. In the application for neural implants, electrochemical polymerization is used because of its ability to create thin films and the ease of synthesis. Films can be formed on the order of 20&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; Electrochemical polymerization (electrochemical deposition) is performed using a three-electrode configuration in a solution of the monomer of the desired polymer, a solvent, and an electrolyte (dopant). In the case of depositing a polymer coating onto electrode a common dopant used is poly (styrene sulfonate) or PSS because of its stability and biocompatibility.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;  Two common conductive polymers being investigated for coatings use PSS as a dopant to be electrochemically deposited onto the electrode surface (see sections below).

====Specific conducting polymers being researched====

===== Polypyrrole =====
One conducting polymer coating that has shown promising results for improving the performance of neural electrodes is [[polypyrrole]] (PPy). Polypyrrole has great biocompatibility and conductive properties, which makes it a good option for the use in neural electrodes. PPy has been shown to have a good interaction with biological tissues. This is due to the boundary it creates between the hard electrode and the soft tissue. PPy has been shown to support cell adhesion and growth of a number of different cell types including primary neurons which is important in neural implants.&lt;ref name = "PPy/PSS" /&gt; PPy also decreases the impedance of the electrode system by increasing the roughness on the surface. The roughness on the electrode surface is directly related to an increased surface area (increased neuron interface with electrode) which increases the signal conduction. In one paper, polypyrrole (PPy) was doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) to electrochemically deposit a polypyrrole coating on the electrode surface. The film was coated onto the electrode at different thickness, increasing the roughness. The increased roughness (increased effective surface) leads to a decreased overall electrode impedance from about 400&amp;nbsp;kΩ (bare stent) to less than 10&amp;nbsp;kΩ (PPy/PSS coating) at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name = "PPy/PSS" /&gt; This decrease in impedance leads to improved charge transfer from the electrode to the tissue and an overall more effective electrode for recording and stimulating applications.

===== Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) =====
[[Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)]] (PEDOT) is another conducting polymer that is being investigated for coating an electrode surface. Some benefits of PEDOT over PPy is that it is more stable to oxidation and more conductive; however PPy is much cheaper. As with PPy, PEDOT has been shown to decrease the electrical impedance. In one article, a PEDOT coating was electrochemically deposited on to gold recording electrodes.&lt;ref name="PEDOT/PSS"&gt; {{cite journal | title = Electrochemical deposition and characterization of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on neural microelectrode arrays| journal= Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical | author1 = Cui, Xinyan | year = 2003 |pages = 92–102 |display-authors=etal |doi = 10.1016/s0925-4005(02)00448-3 | volume=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that impedance of the electrode decreased significantly when the PEDOT coating was added. The unmodified gold electrodes had an impedance of 500–1000&amp;nbsp;kΩ, while the modified gold electrode with the PEDOT coating had an impedance of 3–6&amp;nbsp;kΩ.&lt;ref name=PEDOT /&gt; The paper also showed that the interaction between the polymer and neurons improved the stability and durability of the electrode. The study concluded that by adding a conductive polymer the impedance of the electrode system decreased, which increased the charge transfer making a more effective electrode. The ease and control of electrochemically depositing conducting coatings onto electrode surfaces makes it a very attractive surface modification for neural electrodes.

=== Growth factors and pharmaceutical agents ===

==== Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) ====
[[File:Contact Angle.png|thumb|The figure on the left shows the original silicon surface with a contact angle of 27.3 degrees ± 1.4 degrees. The figure on the right shows the surface with the laminin that had a contact angle of 85.0 degrees ± 1.6 degrees. Angles can be measured with a contact angle goniometer.]]
Seeding implants with growth factors, such as [[Progenitor cell|neural progenitor cells (NPCs)]], improves the brain-implant interface. NPCs are progenitor cells that have the ability to differentiate into neurons or cells found in the brain. By coating the implant with NPCs, it can reduce the foreign body reaction and improve biocompatibility. To attach the NPCs, prior surface modification of the implant is required; these modifications can be done via the immobilization of [[laminin]] (an [[extracellular matrix]] derived protein) on an implant, such as silicon. To verify the success of surface immobilization, [[Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)]] and an analysis of hydrophobicity can be used. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy can be used to characterize the chemical composition of the surface or a contact angle goniometer can be used to determine the contact angle of water to determine the hydrophobicity. A higher contact angle indicates higher hydrophobicity, showing successful modification of the surface via the laminin protein. The laminin immobilized surface promotes the attachment and growth of the NPCs and also allows for their differentiation, thereby reducing the glial response and foreign body response to the implant.&lt;ref name = seeding /&gt;

==== Nerve growth factors (NGFs) ====
Using [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) as a neurotrophic co-dopant could induce ideal cell responses ''in vivo''. NGF is a water-soluble protein that promotes the survival and differentiation of neurons. The addition of NGF into polymeric films can induce biological interactions without compromising the conductive properties or the morphology of the polymeric film. Various polymers such as PPy, PEDOT, as well as collagen, can be used as electrode coatings. Extended neurites for both the PPy and PEDOT show that the NGF is biologically active.&lt;ref name=seeding&gt;{{cite journal | title = Seeding neural progenitor cells on silicon-based neural probes| journal= Neuroscience | author1 = Azemi, E | year = 2010 |pages = 673–681 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.3171/2010.1.jns09313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anti-inflammatory drugs ====
[[File:Dexamethasone structure.svg|thumb|left|Chemical structure of dexmethasone, a glucocorticoid that is used as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent.]] [[File:Nanoparticles.png|thumb|300px|right|The properties of the release mechanism of the encapsulated DEX in the nanoparticles through the pore of the hydrogel network is pictured. Also, the amount of DEX that was loaded into the nano-particles is demonstrated as well as the particle size range (400–600 nm)]]
Dexamethasone (DEX) is a glucocorticoid that is used as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent. PLGA [[nanoparticles]] loaded with DEX via oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation method can be embedded in alginate hydrogel matrices. To quantify the amount of DEX that was successfully seeding into the nanoparticle, UV spectrophotometry can be used. It has been shown that the amount of DEX that can be successfully loaded into the nanoparticles was ≈13 wt% and the typical particle size ranged from 400 to 600&amp;nbsp;nm.

In vitro tests have revealed that the impedance of the nanoparticle-loaded hydrogel-coated electrodes have similar impedance to the non-coated electrode (bare gold). This shows that the nanoparticle-loaded hydrogel coating does not significantly hinder the electrical transport. The ''in vivo'' tests have shown that the impedance amplitude of the DEX-loaded electrodes was maintained at the same level it was at initially. However, non-coated electrodes had an impedance about 3 times greater than its original impedance 2 weeks earlier. This addition of anti-inflammatory drugs via nanoparticles indicates that this form of surface modification does not have a negative effect on the electrodes performance.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

=== Hydrogels ===
[[Hydrogel]] modifications, as with other coatings, are designed to improve the body's response to the implant and thereby improve their consistency and long-term performance. Hydrogel surface modifications achieve this by significantly altering the [[hydrophile|hydrophilicity]] of the neural implant surface to one that is less favorable for [[protein adsorption]].&lt;ref name=hydrogelelectrodes&gt;{{cite journal | title = Polyethylene glycol-containing polyurethane hydrogel coatings for improving the biocompatibility of neural electrodes | journal= Acta Biomaterialia | author1 = Li, Rao | year = 2012 | pages = 2233–2242|display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2012.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, protein adsorption increases with increasing [[hydrophobicity]] as a result of the decreased [[Gibbs energy]] from the energetically favorable reaction (as seen in the equation below)&lt;ref name=420Book /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{ads} G = \Delta_{ads} H - T\Delta_{ads} S&lt;/math&gt;

Water molecules are bonded to both the proteins and to the surface of the implant; as the protein binds to the implant, water molecules are liberated, resulting in an entropy gain, decreasing the overall energy in the system.&lt;ref name=Dietschweiler&gt;{{cite journal | title = Protein adsorption at solid surfaces | author1 = Dietschweiler, Coni | author2 = Sander, Michael | year = 2007 | pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For hydrophilic surfaces, this reaction is energetically unfavorable do to the strong attachment of water to the surface, hence the decreased protein adsorption. The decrease in protein adsorption is beneficial for the implant as it limits the body's ability to both recognize the implant as a foreign material as well as attach potentially deleterious cells such as [[astrocytes]] and [[fibroblasts]] that can create fibrous [[glial scar]]s around the implant and hinder stimulating and recording processes. Increasing the hydrophilicity can also enhance the electrical signal transfer by creating a stable ionic conductance layer. However, increasing the water content of the hydrogel too much can cause swelling and eventually mechanical instability.&lt;ref name=hydrogelelectrodes /&gt; An appropriate water balance must be created to optimize the efficacy of the implant coating.

=== Proteins ===
Significant nonspecific protein adsorption during implantation can cause adverse effects. However, some proteins can be beneficial in stabilizing the implant by reducing micro-motion and implant migration, as well as improving the signal quality through increased neuron connection; improving the long-term performance. Instead of relying on the native cells to secrete these proteins, they can be added to the surface of the material prior to implantation. The [[surface modification of biomaterials with proteins]] has been done with great success in various regions of the body. However since the anatomy of the brain is different from the rest of the body, the types of proteins that must be used in these applications vary from those used elsewhere. Proteins like [[laminin]] that promotes neuronal outgrowth and [[L1 (protein)|L1]] that promotes axonal outgrowth have shown great promise in surface modification applications; L1 more so than laminin because of the decreased attachment associated with astrocytes – the cells responsible for glial scar formation.&lt;ref name=Surfaceimmobilization&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azemi|first1=Erdrin|last2=Stauffer|first2=William R.|last3=Gostock|first3=Mark S.|last4=Lagenaur|first4=Carl F.|last5=Cui|first5=Xinyan Tracy|title=Surface immobilization of neural adhesion molecule L1 for improving the biocompatibility of chronic neural probes: In vitro characterization|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|volume=4|issue=5|year=2008|pages=1208–1217|issn=1742-7061|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2008.02.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Proteins are typically added to the material surface via [[self-assembled monolayer]] (SAM) formation.

'''Tariric acid''' is an [[Alkyne|acetylenic]] fatty acid that can be found in the tallow-wood tree, ''[[Ximenia americana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fatope, Majekodunmi O., Oumar A. Adoum &amp; Yoshio Takeda. (2000) C18 Acetylenic Fatty Acids of ''Ximenia americana'' with Potential Pesticidal Activity. ''J. Agric. Food Chem.'' '''48''' (5): 1872–1874 {{doi|10.1021/jf990550k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon-Albert Arnaud]] (1853–1915) was the first scientist to describe the chemical make-up of tariric acid, an extraction from the [[glucoside]] of the "[[Picramnia|tariri plant]]" found in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NPU4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=tariri+Guatemala+Arnaud&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=leVngQkjUX&amp;sig=zD4swNL5EkCNzfZ5f9d-YRygzsk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3Q5HT5WbMsqMiALJ_aXcDQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tariri%20Guatemala%20Arnaud&amp;f=false] ''Journal of the Chemical Society'' '''82'''(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Tariric acid has been found in several oils and fats of plant origin. It was first isolated in 1892 from the seed oil of a species of ''[[Picramnia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Arnaud (1892) "Sur un novel acide gras non saturé de la série C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n–4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;". ''Compt. Rend.'' '''114''': 79&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in ''[[Picramnia camboita]]'' from Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;B. Grützner (1893) "Ueber einen krystallisirten Bestandtheil der Früchte von ''Picramnia camboita''". ''Chemiker Zeitung'' '''100''': 1851&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Picramnia carpinterae]]'' from Guatemala,&lt;ref&gt;Cl. Grimme (1910) "Über einige seltene Ölfrüchte". ''Chemische Revue über die Fett- und Harzindustrie'' '''17''': 156&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Picramnia lindeniana]]'' from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Cl. Grimme (1912) "Über das Fett von ''Picramnia lindeniana''". ''Chemische Revue über die Fett- und Harzindustrie'' '''19''': 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Tariric acid is biosynthesised from [[petroselinic acid]]; both fatty acids have been found together in ''Picramnia'' and ''[[Alvaradoa]]'' species.&lt;ref&gt;G. F. Spencer, R. Kleiman, F. R.

== Production and chemical behavior ==
Tariric acid can be synthesised from commercially available petroselinic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = T. Stuhlfauth, H. Fock, H. Huber and. K.

In chemical analysis, tariric acid can be separated from other fatty acids by [[gas chromatography]] of methyl esters; additionally, a separation of unsaturated fatty acids is possible by argentation [[thin-layer chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B.

The '''Techa River''' is a river on the eastern flank of the southern [[Ural Mountains]] noted for its nuclear contamination. It is about {{convert|240|km|mi}} long, and its basin covers {{convert|7500|km2|mi2}}. It begins at the formerly secret nuclear-processing town of [[Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast]] about {{convert|80|km|mi}} northwest of [[Chelyabinsk]] and flows northeast to [[Dalmatovo]] on the [[Iset River]], a tributary of the [[Tobol River]]. Its basin is enclosed on the southeast by that of the [[Miass River]], another river that flows northeast into the Iset.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}

The '''tropopause''' is the boundary in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] between the [[troposphere]] and the [[stratosphere]]. It is a thermodynamic gradient stratification layer, marking the end of [[troposphere]]. It lies, on average, at {{convert|17|km}} above equatorial regions, and above {{convert|9|km}} over the polar regions.

==Definition==
[[Image:Earth Atmosphere.svg|thumb|Schematic showing the different layers of the atmosphere (not to scale). The tropopause is located between the troposphere and the stratosphere.]]
[[Image:Jetcrosssection.jpg|thumb|The '''tropopause''' lies higher in the tropics than at the poles.]]
Going upward from the surface, it is the point where air ceases to cool with height, and becomes almost completely dry. More formally, the tropopause is the region of the atmosphere where the [[lapse rate|environmental lapse rate]] changes from positive, as it behaves in the troposphere, to the stratospheric negative one. Following is the exact definition used by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]:

{{Quotation|The boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere, where an abrupt change in lapse rate usually occurs. It is defined as the lowest level at which the lapse rate decreases to 2 °C/km or less, provided that the average lapse rate between this level and all higher levels within 2 km does not exceed 2 °C/km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= International Meteorological Vocabulary|edition= 2nd|date= 1992|publisher= Secretariat of the World Meteorological Organization|location= [[Geneva]]|isbn= 92-63-02182-1|page= 636}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The tropopause as defined above renders as a [[Continuous function|first-order discontinuity]] surface, that is, ''temperature'' as a function of height varies continuously through the atmosphere but the ''temperature gradient'' does not.{{sfn|Panchev|1985|p=129}}

==Location==
{{Technical|section|date=September 2018}}
The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere; it is located right above the [[planetary boundary layer]], and is the layer in which most [[weather]] phenomena take place. The troposphere contains the [[Planetary boundary layer|boundary layer]], and ranges in height from an average of {{convert|9|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} at the poles, to {{convert|17|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} at the [[Equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | last1 = Hoinka | first1 = K.

The tropopause location coincides with the lowest point at which the lapse rate falls below a prescribed threshold.

Since the tropopause responds to the average temperature of the entire layer that lies underneath it, it is at its peak levels over the Equator, and reaches minimum heights over the poles. On account of this, the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17&amp;nbsp;km over the equator. Due to the variation in starting height, the tropopause extremes are referred to as the equatorial tropopause and the polar tropopause.

Given that the lapse rate is not a conservative quantity when the tropopause is considered for stratosphere-troposphere exchanges studies, there exists an alternative definition named ''dynamic tropopause''.{{sfn|Andrews|Holton|Leovy|1987|p=371}} It is formed with the aid of [[potential vorticity]], which is defined as the product of the [[isentropic]] [[density]], i.e. the density that arises from using [[potential temperature]] as the vertical coordinate, and the [[absolute vorticity]], given that this quantity attains quite different values for the troposphere and the stratosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Hoskins|first1= B. J.|last2= McIntyre|first2= M. E.|last3= Robertson|first3= A. W.|date= 1985|title= On the use and significance of isentropic potential vorticity maps|journal= [[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society]]|volume= 111|pages= 877–946|bibcode = 1985QJRMS.111..877H |doi = 10.1002/qj.49711147002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using the vertical temperature gradient as the defining variable, the dynamic tropopause surface is expressed in ''[[potential vorticity unit]]s'' (PVU).{{#tag:ref|1&amp;nbsp;PVU&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|-6}}&amp;nbsp;K&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}}&amp;nbsp;kg{{sup|-1}}&amp;nbsp;s{{sup|-1}}&lt;ref name="Tuck" /&gt;|group="nb"}}  Given that the absolute vorticity is positive in the Northern Hemisphere and negative in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the threshold value should be taken as positive north of the Equator and negative south of it.&lt;ref name="Hoinka" /&gt; Theoretically, to define a global tropopause in this way, the two surfaces arising from the positive and negative thresholds need to be matched near the equator using another type of surface such as a constant [[potential temperature]] surface. Nevertheless, the dynamic tropopause is useless at equatorial latitudes because the isentropes are almost vertical.&lt;ref name="Tuck" /&gt; For the extratropical tropopause in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] the WMO established a value of 1.5 PVU,&lt;ref name="Tuck" /&gt; but greater values ranging between 2 and 3.5 PVU have been traditionally used.&lt;ref name="Zängl&amp;Hoinka" /&gt;

It is also possible to define the tropopause in terms of chemical composition.&lt;ref name="Pan" /&gt; For example, the lower stratosphere has much higher [[ozone]] concentrations than the upper troposphere, but much lower [[water vapor]] concentrations, so appropriate cutoffs can be used.

==Phenomena==
The tropopause is not a "hard" boundary. Vigorous [[thunderstorm]]s, for example, particularly those of tropical origin, will [[convective overshoot|overshoot]] [[overshooting top|into]] the lower stratosphere and undergo a brief (hour-order or less) low-frequency vertical [[oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Shenk|first1= W. E.|date= 1974|title= Cloud top height variability of strong convective cells|journal= [[Journal of Applied Meteorology]]|volume = 13|pages= 918{{ndash}}922|publisher= [[American Meteorological Society]]| doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1974)013&lt;0917:cthvos&gt;2.0.co;2 |bibcode = 1974JApMe..13..917S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such oscillation sets up a low-frequency atmospheric [[gravity wave#Atmosphere dynamics on Earth|gravity wave]] capable of affecting both atmospheric and oceanic currents in the region.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Most commercial aircraft are flown in the lower stratosphere, just above the tropopause, where clouds are usually absent, as also are significant weather perturbations.{{sfn|Petty|2008|p=21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9212">A '''two-dimensional gas''' is a collection of objects constrained to move in a planar or other two-[[dimension]]al space in a [[gas]]eous state.   The objects can be: [[ideal gas]] elements such as rigid [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] undergoing [[elastic collision]]s; [[elementary particle]]s, or any object in [[physics]] which obeys [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].  The concept of a two-dimensional gas is used either because:
* (a) the issue being studied actually takes place in two dimensions (as certain surface [[molecule|molecular]] phenomena); or, 
* (b) the two-dimensional form of the problem is more tractable than the analogous [[mathematics|mathematically]] more complex three-[[dimension]]al problem.

While [[physicist]]s have studied simple [[two body problem|two body interactions]] on a plane for centuries, the attention given to the two-dimensional gas (having many bodies in motion) is a 20th-century pursuit.

Research at [[Princeton University]]  in the early 1960s&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Hogan, ''Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of a two-dimensional gas'', Dissertation, Princeton University, Department of Physics, May 4, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; posed the question of whether the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] and other  thermodynamic laws could be derived from [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian laws applied to multi-body systems rather than through the conventional methods of [[statistical mechanics]].  While this question appears intractable from a three-dimensional [[closed form solution]], the problem behaves differently in two-dimensional space.  In particular an ideal two-dimensional gas was examined from the standpoint of relaxation time to [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] [[velocity]] distribution given several arbitrary initial conditions of the ideal gas.  [[Relaxation time]]s were shown to be very fast: on the order of [[mean free time]] .

In 1996 a computational approach was taken to the classical mechanics non-equilibrium problem of [[heat transfer|heat flow]] within a two-dimensional gas.&lt;ref&gt;D. Risso and P. Cordero, ''Two-Dimensional Gas of Disks: [[Thermal Conductivity]]'', ''[[Journal of Statistical Physics]]'', volume 82, pages 1453–1466, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  This simulation work showed that for N&gt;1500, good agreement with continuous systems is obtained.

==Electron gas==

[[Image:Cyclotron patent.png|right|thumb|260px|left|Diagram of [[cyclotron]] operation from [[Ernest O. Lawrence|Lawrence's]] 1934 patent.]]

While the principle of the [[cyclotron]] to create a two-dimensional array of [[electron]]s has existed since 1934, the tool was originally not really used to analyze interactions among the electrons (e.g. two-dimensional [[gas dynamics]]).  An early research investigation to explore a two-dimensional electron gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = Walter | year = 1961 | title = [[Cyclotron Resonance]] and de Haas–van Alphen Oscillations of an Interacting Electron Gas | url = | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 123 | issue = | pages = 1242–1244 | doi=10.1103/physrev.123.1242| bibcode = 1961PhRv..123.1242K}}&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to [[cyclotron resonance]] behavior and the [[de Haas–van Alphen effect]].  The investigator was able to demonstrate for a two-dimensional gas, the de Haas–van Alphen [[oscillation]] period is independent of the short-range electron [[interaction]]s.

==Later applications to Bose gas==
In 1991 a theoretical proof was made that a [[Bose gas]] can exist in two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderlei Bagnato and  Daniel Kleppner. ''[[Bose–Einstein condensation (network theory)|Bose–Einstein]] [[condensation]] in low-dimensional traps'', [[American Physical Society]], 8 April 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same work an experimental recommendation was made that could verify the hypothesis.

==Experimental research with a molecular gas==
In general, 2D molecular gases are experimentally observed on weakly interacting surfaces such as metals, [[graphene]] etc. at a non-cryogenic temperature and a low surface coverage. As a direct observation of individual molecules is not possible due to fast diffusion of molecules on a surface, experiments are either indirect (observing an interaction of a 2D gas with surroundings, e.g. condensation of a 2D gas) or integral (measuring integral properties of 2D gases, e.g. by diffraction methods).

An example of the indirect observation of a 2D gas is the study of Stranick et al. who used a [[scanning tunnelling microscope]] in [[ultrahigh vacuum]] (UHV) to image an interaction of a two-dimensional [[benzene]] gas layer in contact with a planar solid interface at 77 [[kelvins]].&lt;ref&gt;Stranick, S. J. ; Kamna, M. M. ; Weiss, P. S, ''Atomic Scale Dynamics of a Two-Dimensional Gas-Solid Interface'',  Pennsylvania State University, Park Dept. of Chemistry, 3 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The experimenters were able to observe mobile benzene molecules on the surface of Cu(111), to which a planar monomolecular film of solid benzene adhered.  Thus the scientists could witness the equilibrium of the gas in contact with its solid state.

Integral methods that are able to characterize a 2D gas usually fall into a category of [[diffraction]] (see for example study of Kroger et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kroger|first=I.|date=|title=Tuning intermolecular interaction in long-range-ordered submonolayer organic films|url=http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n2/full/nphys1176.html|journal=Nature Physics|volume=5|pages=153–158|via=|doi=10.1038/nphys1176|year=2009|bibcode=2009NatPh...5..153S}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The exception is the work of Matvija et al. who used a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] to directly visualize a local time-averaged density of molecules on a surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matvija|first=Peter|last2=Rozbořil|first2=Filip|last3=Sobotík|first3=Pavel|last4=Ošťádal|first4=Ivan|last5=Kocán|first5=Pavel|date=|title=Pair correlation function of a 2D molecular gas directly visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b01965|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters|volume=8|pages=4268–4272|doi=10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b01965|via=|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is of special importance as it provides an opportunity to probe local properties of 2D gases; for instance it enables to directly visualize a [[pair correlation function]] of a 2D molecular gas in a real space.

If the surface coverage of adsorbates is increased, a [[Two-dimensional liquid|2D liquid]] is formed,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Thomas Waldmann|Surname2=Jens Klein|Surname3=Harry E. Hoster|Surname4=R.

It was shown that the transition from a 2D gas to a 2D solid state can be controlled by a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] which can affect the local density of molecules via an electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matvija|first=Peter|last2=Rozbořil|first2=Filip|last3=Sobotík|first3=Pavel|last4=Ošťádal|first4=Ivan|last5=Pieczyrak|first5=Barbara|last6=Jurczyszyn|first6=Leszek|last7=Kocán|first7=Pavel|date=|title=Electric-field-controlled phase transition in a 2D molecular layer|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07277-7|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=7|pages=7357|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-07277-7|via=|bibcode=2017NatSR...7.7357M|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for future research==
A multiplicity of theoretical physics research directions exist for study via a two-dimensional gas.  Examples of these are

*Complex [[quantum mechanics]] phenomena, whose solutions may be more appropriate in a two-dimensional environment;
*Studies of [[phase transition]]s (e.g. [[melting point|melting]] phenomena at a [[planar lamina|planar surface]]);
*[[Thin film]] phenomena such as [[chemical vapor deposition]];
*Surface [[excited state|excitations]] of a solid.

He is also known for developing the [[Nernst equation]] in 1887.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Nernst was born in [[Wąbrzeźno|Briesen]] in [[West Prussia]] (now [[Wąbrzeźno]], Poland) to Gustav Nernst (1827–1888) and Ottilie Nerger (1833–1876).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barkan|first=Diana|title=Walther Nernst and the transition to modern physical science|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=052144456X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartel, Hans-Georg, (1999) [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz71086.html "Nernst, Walther"], pp. 66–68 in ''Neue Deutsche Biographie'', Vol. 19&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a country judge. Nernst had three older sisters and one younger brother. His third sister died of cholera. Nernst went to elementary school at [[Grudziądz|Graudenz]]. He studied physics and mathematics at the universities of [[University of Zürich|Zürich]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Graz|Graz]] and [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]], where he received his [[Doctor of Science|doctorate]] 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendelssohn|first1=K.|title=The World of Walther Nernst|date=1973|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=0-8229-1109-4|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1889, he finished his [[habilitation]] at [[Universität Leipzig|University of Leipzig]].

===Personal attributes===
It was said that Nernst was mechanically minded in that he was always thinking of ways to apply new discoveries to industry. His hobbies included hunting and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walther Hermann Nernst|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1920/nernst.html|publisher=foundationNobel Prize|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His friend Albert Einstein was amused by "his childlike vanity and self-complacency"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nernst.de/nernst_einstein1942.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  "His own study and laboratory always presented aspects of extreme chaos which his coworkers termed appropriately 'the state of maximum entropy'".&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn 1973, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family history===
Nernst married Emma Lohmeyer in 1892 with whom he had two sons and three daughters. Both of Nernst's sons died fighting in World War I. He was a friend and colleague of [[Svante Arrhenius]], and suggested setting fire to unused coal seams to increase the global temperature. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} He was a vocal critic of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]], and two of his three daughters married [[Jew]]ish men. After Hitler came to power they emigrated, one to England and the other to Brazil.  Nazism also ended Nernst's career as a scientist.  Nernst had a severe heart attack in 1939. He died in 1941 and is buried near [[Max Planck]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Max von Laue]] in [[Göttingen]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1920/nernst-bio.html Walter Nernst Biography].nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===

[[File:Walther Nernst.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Walther Nernst in 1889.]]
Nernst started university at [[university of Zurich|Zurich]] in 1883, then after an interlude in [[university of Berlin|Berlin]], he returned to Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nernst.de/&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his thesis at [[University of Graz|Graz]] where [[Boltzmann]] was professor, though he worked under the direction of [[Albert von Ettingshausen|Ettinghausen]].  They discovered the [[Nernst effect]]: that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to a metallic conductor in a temperature gradient gives rise to an electrical potential difference.  Next, he moved to [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] under [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Kohlrausch]] where he submitted and defended his thesis. [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]] recruited him to the first department of physical chemistry at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. Nernst moved there as an assistant, working on the thermodynamics of electrical currents in solutions.  Promoted to lecturer, he taught briefly at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and then moved to [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. Three years later, he was offered a professorship in [[University of Munich|Munich]], to keep him in Prussia the government created a chair for him at Göttingen.  There, he wrote a celebrated textbook ''Theoretical Chemistry'', which was translated into English, French, and Russian.  He also derived the [[Nernst equation]] for the electrical potential generated by unequal concentrations of an ion separated by a membrane that is permeable to the ion.  His equation is widely used in cell physiology and neurobiology. 

The [[Incandescent light bulb|carbon electric filament lamp]] then in use was dim and expensive because it required a vacuum in its bulb. Nernst invented a solid-body radiator with a filament of rare-earth oxides, known as the [[Nernst lamp|Nernst glower]], it is still important in the field of [[infrared spectroscopy]]. Continuous [[Joule heating|ohmic heating]] of the filament results in conduction. The glower operates best in wavelengths from 2 to 14 micrometers. It gives a bright light but only after a warm-up period.  Nernst sold the patent for one million marks, wisely not opting for royalties because soon the tungsten filament lamp filled with inert gas was introduced.  With his riches, Nernst in 1898 bought the first of the eighteen automobiles he owned during his lifetime and a country estate of more than a five hundred hectares for hunting. He increased the power of his early automobiles by carrying a cylinder of [[nitrous oxide]] that he could inject into the carburetor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cherwell|first1=F. Simon|title=Walther Nernst, 1864-1941|journal=Obit. Not. Fell. R. Soc. Lond.|date=1942|volume=4|issue=11|page=1022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After eighteen productive years at Göttingen, investigating [[osmotic pressure]] and [[electrochemistry]] and presenting a theory of how nerves conduct, he moved to Berlin, and was awarded the title ''[[Geheimrat]]''

[[File:Nernst, Walther 1912.jpg|left|thumb|Nernst 1912, portrait by [[Max Liebermann]]]]

In 1905, he proposed his "New Heat Theorem", later known as the [[Third law of thermodynamics]]. He showed that as the temperature approached absolute zero, the [[entropy]]  approaches zero {{mdash}}  while the [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] remains above zero. This is the work for which he is best remembered, as it enabled chemists to determine free energies (and therefore equilibrium points) of [[chemical reaction]]s from heat measurements. [[Theodore William Richards|Theodore Richards]] claimed that Nernst had stolen his idea, but Nernst is almost universally credited with the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coffey | first=Patrick  | pages=78–81 | title=Cathedrals of Science: The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern Chemistry | location=Oxford | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-19-532134-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nernst became friendly with [[Wilhelm I|Kaiser Wilhelm]], whom he persuaded to found the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|''Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft'']] for the Advancement of the Sciences with an initial capital of eleven million marks. Nernst's laboratory discovered that at low temperatures [[specific Heat|specific heats]] fell markedly and would probably disappear at absolute zero. This fall was predicted for liquids and solids in a 1909 paper of [[Einstein]]'s on the quantum mechanics of specific heats at cryogenic temperatures.  Nernst was so impressed that he traveled all the way to Zurich to visit Einstein, who was relatively unknown in Zurich in 1909, so people said: "Einstein must be a clever fellow if the great Nernst comes all the way from Berlin to Zurich to talk to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=A. Douglas|title=Einstein and the quantum : the quest of the valiant Swabian|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nernst and Planck lobbied to establish a special professorship in Berlin and Nernst donated to its endowment. In 1913 they traveled to Switzerland to persuade Einstein to accept it; a dream job: a named professorship at the top university in Germany, without teaching duties, leaving him free for research.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 2013, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Nernst and [[Max Planck]] organized the first [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels.  In the following year, the [[impressionist]] painter [[Max Liebermann]] painted his portrait.

In 1914, the Nernsts were entertaining coworkers and students they had brought to their country estate in a private railway car when they learned that war had been declared. Their two older sons entered the army, while father enlisted in the voluntary driver's corps. He supported the German army against their opponent's charges of barbarism by signing the [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]],  On 21 August 1914, he drove documents from Berlin to the commander of the German right wing in France, advancing with them for two weeks until he could see the glow of the Paris lights at night.  The tide turned at the [[First Battle of the Marne|battle of the Marne]].  When the stalemate in the trenches began, he returned home. He contacted Colonel [[Max Bauer]], the staff officer responsible for munitions, with the idea of driving the defenders out of their trenches with shells releasing tear gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Kloot|first1=W.|title=April 1918:  Five Future Nobel prize-winners inaugurate weapons of mass destruction and the academic-industrial-military complex|journal=Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond.|date=2004|volume=58|issue=2|pages=149–160|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/58/2/149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When his idea was tried one of the observers was [[Fritz Haber]], who argued that too many shells would be needed, it would be better to release a cloud of heavier-than-air poisonous gas;  the first chlorine cloud attack on 22 April 1915 was not supported by a strong infantry thrust, so the chance that gas would break the stalemate was irrevocably gone. Nernst was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] second class.  As a Staff Scientific Advisor in the [[Imperial German Army]], he directed research on explosives, much of which was done in his laboratory where they developed [[guanidine]] perchlorate.  Then he worked on the development of trench mortars.  He was awarded the Iron Cross first class and later the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''. When the high command was considering unleashing unrestricted submarine warfare, he asked the Kaiser for an opportunity to warn about the enormous potential of the United States as an adversary.  They would not listen, Ludendorff shouted him down for "incompetent nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn 1973, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;  He published his book ''The Foundations of the New Heat Theorem''.
Both sons had died at the front.

In 1918, after studying [[photochemistry]], he proposed the atomic chain reaction theory. It stated that when a reaction in which free atoms are formed that can decompose target molecules into more free atoms would result in a chain reaction. His theory is closely related to the natural process of [[Nuclear Fission]].

In 1920, he and his family briefly fled abroad because he was one of the scientists on the Allied list of war criminals. Later that year he received the [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]] in recognition of his work on [[thermochemistry]]. He was elected Rector of Berlin University for 1921-1922.  He set up an agency to channel government and private funds to young scientists and declined becoming Ambassador to the United States. For two unhappy years, he was the president of the ''Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt'' (National Physical Laboratory), where he could not cope with the "mixture of mediocrity and red tape".&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn 1973, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, he became director of the ''Institute of Physical Chemistry'' at Berlin. Although the press release described him as "completely unmusical",&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn 1973, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Nernst developed an [[electric grand piano|electric piano]], the "Neo-Bechstein-Flügel" in 1930 in association with the [[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|Bechstein]] and [[Siemens]] companies, replacing the [[sounding board]] with [[Valve amplifier|vacuum tube amplifiers]]. The piano used electromagnetic [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s to produce electronically modified and amplified sound in the same way as an [[electric guitar]].  In fact, he was a pianist, sometimes accompanying Einstein's violin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walther Nernst|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Nernst#F%C3%B6rderer,_Gr%C3%BCnder_und_Organisator}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

In 1927, the decrease in specific heat at low temperatures was extended to gases.  He studied the theories of cosmic rays and cosmology.

In 1933, Nernst learned that a colleague, with whom he had hoped to collaborate, had been dismissed from the department because he was a Jew.  Nernst immediately taxied to see Haber to request a position in his Institute, which was not controlled by the government, only to learn that Haber was moving to England. Soon, Nernst was in trouble for declining to fill out a government form on his racial origins. He retired from his professorship but was sacked from the board of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.  He lived quietly in the country; in 1937 he traveled to Oxford to receive an honorary degree, also visiting his eldest daughter, her husband, and his three grandchildren.

To enhance [[water quality]] monitoring in a [[drinking water]] network, water [[Sample (material)|sampling]] stations are installed at various points along the network's route. These sampling stations are typically positioned at street level, where they connect to a local [[water main]], and are designed as enclosed, secured boxes containing a small sink and spigot to aid in sample collection. Collected samples are analyzed for bacteria, chlorine levels, pH, inorganic and organic pollutants, turbidity, odor, and many other water quality indicators.

In the United States, water sampling stations aid in public infrastructural safety in regards to water quality monitoring, and help municipalities comply with federal and state drinking water regulations. [[New York City]] has 965 sampling stations that are distributed based on population density, water pressure zones, proximity to water mains, and accessibility. The stations rise about 4½ feet above the ground and are made of heavy cast iron. Using these stations, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) collects more than 1,200 water samples per month from up to 546 locations. &lt;ref name=NYCDEP&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC.gov - Drinking Water Sampling Stations|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/drinking_water/sampling.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UC&gt;{{cite web|title=Untapped Cities - Cities 101: What’s the Purpose of NYC’s Drinking Water Sampling Stations?|url=http://untappedcities.com/2013/12/16/cities-101-whats-the-purpose-of-nyc-sampling-stations//}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BKLNER&gt;{{cite web|title=BKLNER - What’s With Those Drinking Water Sampling Stations?|url=http://bklyner.com/whats-with-those-drinking-water-sampling-stations-ditmas-park/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In YIG, the five iron(III) ions occupy two [[octahedral]] and three [[tetrahedral]] sites, with the yttrium(III) ions coordinated by eight oxygen ions in an irregular cube. The iron ions in the two coordination sites exhibit different [[spin (physics)|spins]], resulting in [[magnetic]] behavior.&lt;ref name=Cherepanov/&gt; By substituting specific sites with [[rare earth elements]], for example, interesting magnetic properties can be obtained.&lt;ref name=Goulon&gt;{{cite web | url = http://m.iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/14/6/063001/pdf/1367-2630_14_6_063001.pdf | title = Site-selective couplings in x-ray-detected magnetic resonance spectra of rare-earth-substituted yttrium iron garnets |author1=J Goulon |author2=A Rogalev |author3=F Wilhelm |author4=G Goujon |author5=A Yaresko |author6=Ch Brouder |author7=J Ben Youssef  |last-author-amp=yes | journal = New Journal of Physics | volume = 14 | date = 2012| pages = 1–30 | access-date = April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
