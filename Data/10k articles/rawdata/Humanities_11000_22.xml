'''''A History of Ireland in 100 Objects''''' was a joint project by ''[[The Irish Times]]'', the [[National Museum of Ireland]], and the [[Royal Irish Academy]] to define one hundred archaeological or cultural objects that are important in the [[history of Ireland]]. The objects are single man-made [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s or documents, excluding buildings, ranging in date from about 5,000 BC ([[Mesolithic]]) to the early 21st century. Most of the objects are held in accessible collections in the [[Republic of Ireland]] or [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="an-post-2017"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Ninth Definitive Series 100 Objects | url=https://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/IrishStamps/News+and+events/2017/Ninth+Definitive+Series+100+Objects.htm | publisher=[[An Post]] | date=13 January 2017 | accessdate=30 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of the hundred objects, written by ''Irish Times'' journalist [[Fintan O'Toole]], were initially serialized in ''The Irish Times'' between February 2011 and January 2013. In February 2013 a book about the hundred objects written by O'Toole, entitled ''A History of Ireland in 100 Objects'', was published, and it quickly became a best-seller with 35,000 free downloads.&lt;ref name="irish-times-2017"&gt;{{Cite web | last=McGreevy | first=Ronan | title=The History of Ireland in 100 objects becomes a stamp series | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/the-history-of-ireland-in-100-objects-becomes-a-stamp-series-1.2965671 | publisher=[[The Irish Times]] | date=6 February 2017 | accessdate=30 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 [[An Post]] announced that a selection of the 100 objects would form the subjects for the [[Definitive postage stamps of Ireland#History of Ireland in 100 Objects|9th definitive postage stamp series]] for Ireland, to be issued over a period of five or six years from 2017. The first set of stamps featuring twelve of the objects were issued in January 2017, consisting of eight different SOAR (Stamps on a Roll) stamps with various values (€0.05 to €7.50), a range coil stamps, and a national (N) and an international (W) rate stamp booklet.&lt;ref name="an-post-2017"/&gt;

'''Bernice Johnson Reagon''' (born Bernice Johnson on October 4, 1942) is a song leader, composer, scholar, and [[social activism|social activist]], who in the early 1960s was a founding member of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee's (SNCC) [[The Freedom Singers|Freedom Singers]] in the [[Albany Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/freedom-singers|title=Freedom Singers|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/albany-movement|title=Albany Movement|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Georgia. In 1973, she founded the all-black female ''[[a cappella]]'' ensemble [[Sweet Honey in the Rock]], based in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sweethoneyintherock.org/about/bjr/|title=Message from the Founder - Sweet Honey in the Rock®|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Sweet Honey in the Rock®|language=en-US|quote=First public appearance of Sweet Honey In The Rock at Howard University’s W.C.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“After a song,” Reagon recalled, “the differences between us were not so great. Somehow, making a song required an expression of that which was common to us all.... This music was like an instrument, like holding a tool in your hand.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWLwdOmdy9sC&amp;q=albany+singing#v=onepage&amp;q=albany&amp;f=false|title=When and Where I Enter: The Impact of Black Women on Race and Sex in America|last=Giddings|first=Paula J.|date=2009-10-06|publisher=Harper Collins|year=|isbn=9780061984921|location=|pages=279|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Bernice Johnson was the daughter of Beatrice and J.J. Johnson, a Baptist minister. She was born and raised in southwest Georgia, where church and school were an integrated part of her life, with music heavily intertwined in both of those settings. Reagon began school at the age of three when she was asked by her teacher to attend early, and she passed that first year. By the time she was in the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade, she was requested to tutor students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and she claims it was because there had only been one teacher.&lt;ref name="''Eyes on The Prize'': America's Civil Rights Years (1954-1965)" /&gt; She entered Albany State College in 1959 (since July 1996 [[Albany State University]]) where she began her study of music.  She also became active in the local [[NAACP]] chapter and then the [[SNCC]].  After being expelled from Albany State because of an arrest as an activist, she briefly attended [[Spelman College]].

Later, she returned to Spelman to complete her undergraduate degree in 1970.  She received a [[Ford Foundation]] fellowship to do graduate study at [[Howard University]], where she was awarded the Ph.D. degree in 1975.&lt;ref name=GE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2521 | title=Bernice Johnson Reagon | publisher=Georgia Humanities Council | work=New Georgia Encyclopedia | date=2007-11-28 | accessdate=December 10, 2012 | author=Hatfield, Edward A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Activism===
Bernice Johnson Reagon's first demonstration had been in protest against the arrest of Bertha Gober, and Blanton Hall, organized by SNCC along with the initial arrest of the two individuals, for they planned to be arrested in a discussion during a SNCC meeting.&lt;ref name="''Eyes on The Prize'': America's Civil Rights Years (1954-1965)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Bernice Johnson Reagon|url=http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=rea0015.0155.086|website=Eyes on The Prize Interviews|publisher=Blackside Inc.|accessdate= March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagon was an active participant in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s. She was a member of The Freedom Singers, organized by the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), for which she also served as a field secretary. Reagon explains her first encounter with SNCC as a confusion, for she did not understand the name, or its organization, but she claims that she did understand that they were for freedom and full-time.&lt;ref name="''Eyes on The Prize'': America's Civil Rights Years (1954-1956)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Bernice Johnson Reagon|website=Eyes on The Prize Interviews|accessdate= March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freedom Singers were organized by [[Cordell Reagon]] in 1962. This group was the first of the civil rights singers to travel nationally. The singers realized that singing helped provide an outlet and unifier for protestors struggling with mob behavior and police brutality. Thanks to her roles with SNCC and the Freedom Singers, Reagon became a highly respected song leader during the Civil Rights Movement.

Activist [[James Forman]] later said-"I remember seeing you lift your beautiful black head, stand squarely on your feet, your lips trembling as the melodious words 'Over my head, I see freedom in the air' came forth with an urgency and a pain that brought out a sense of intense renewal and commitment of liberation. And when the call came to protest the jailings, you were up front. You led the line. Your feet hit the dirty pavement with a sureness of direction. You walked proudly onward singing 'this little light of mine, 'and the people echoed, 'shine, shine, shine.'"&lt;ref name="folkways.si.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/2013/05/03/moyers-moment-1991-bernice-johnson-reagon-on-this-little-light-of-mine/|title=Bernice Johnson Reagon on 'This Little Light of Mine'|date=2013-05-03|website=BillMoyers.com|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic===
In 1974, Reagon was appointed as a cultural historian in music history at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], where she directed a program called Black American Culture in 1976,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ida|first1=Jones|title=Guide to the Bernice Johnson Reagon Collection of the African American Sacred Music Tradition, circa 1822-1994|url=http://sova.si.edu/record/NMAH.AC.0653|website=Smithsonian Online Virtual Archives|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later a curator of music history for the [[National Museum of American History]]. Ida Jones from the Smithsonian Institution had stated, "Dr. Reagon collected photographs,sheet music, and other primary and secondary sources chronicling the development of African American sacred music tradition from its birth during the period of slavery through the creation of concert spiritual, gospel music, jazz, and the performance of protest song in the century following Emancipation." on behalf on Reagon's initial job at the museum.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1989, she was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. After Reagon retired in 1993, she continued to work in African American Songs of Protest as a Curator Emeritus.

She held an appointment as Distinguished Professor of History at [[American University]] (AU) in Washington DC from 1993 to 2003. Reagon has since been named Professor Emerita of History at AU, and holds the title of Curator Emeritus at the Smithsonian.&lt;ref name=GE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/368/ |title=Bernice Johnson Reagon |website=MacArthur Foundation |accessdate=2016-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919110225/https://www.macfound.org/fellows/368/ |archivedate=2015-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Bernice Johnson Reagon claimed that she grew up in a church without a piano, so her early music was A cappella, and her first instruments were her hands and feet, and she explains, "that's the only way I can deal comfortably with creating music." When Reagon speaks upon her upbringing in the musical culture, she explains that even her early schooling was heavily involved with music, not just the church. Reagon says that her teacher would lead the students outside to play games that entailed singing with their hands and feet, as well as their voices.There was also competitions among the students, and Reagon won first place as a child when running against the older students reciting Langston Hughes, "I've Known Rivers".&lt;ref name="Eyes on The Prize: America's Civil Rights Years (1954-1965)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Bernice Johnson Reagon|url=http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=rea0015.0155.086|website=Eyes on The Prize Interviews|publisher=Blackside Inc.|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagon is a specialist in [[African-American]] oral history, performance and protest traditions. She has served as music consultant, producer, composer, and performer on several award-winning film projects, notably [[PBS]] television productions such as ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]'' (1987) (in which she also appeared) and [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990). Reagon was also featured in a film, "We Shall Overcome" which was about the song and its placement in the movement, being produced by Ginger Records and made by Henry Hampton, the same creator of Eyes on The Prize.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She was the conceptual producer and narrator of the [[Peabody Award]]-winning radio series, ''Wade in the Water, African American Sacred Music Traditions.''{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Bernice Johnson Reagon claimed, "These days, I come as a 'songtalker', one who balances talk and song in the creation of a live performance conversation with those who gather within the sound of my voice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reagon|first1=Bernice Johnson|url=https://www.facebook.com/Bernice-Johnson-Reagon-188881438633/|title=Bernice Reagon|website=Facebook|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagon joined her first and only gospel choir when she was eleven years old, which was organized by her sister at the Mt. Early Baptist Church. She and the choir would listen to the local radio station WGPC to learn black gospel for the choir to recite. As a child, the Five Blind Guys was her favorite quartet. Reagon states that her role models in terms of music are Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, and Bessie Jones, because they assisted her understanding of traditional singing and the fight for justice. She also sees Deacon Reardon as an importance to her work as a historian studying African American sacred worship traditions, and she states that he impacted both her spiritual and musical development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reagon|first1=Bernice Johnson|title=If You Don't Go, Don't Hinder me The African American Sacred Song tradition|date=1942|publisher=Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press|isbn=1-280-51030-7|pages=100–140|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pierce-ebooks/reader.action?docID=3039267&amp;query=|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagon's work as a scholar and composer is reflected in her publications on African-American culture and history, including: a collection of essays entitled ''If You Don’t Go, Don’t Hinder Me: The African American Sacred Song Tradition'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2001);  ''We Who Believe In Freedom: Sweet Honey In The Rock: Still on the Journey'', (Anchor Books, 1993); and ''We'll Understand It Better By And By: Pioneering African American Gospel Composers'' (Smithsonian Press, 1992).

Reagon has recorded several albums on [[Folkways Records]] including ''Folk Songs: The South,'' ''Wade in the Water,'' and ''Lest We Forget, Vol. 3: Sing for Freedom.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkways.si.edu/searchresults.aspx?sPhrase=bernice%20reagon&amp;sType='phrase'/ Bernice Johnson Reagon Discography on Folkways]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Folkways.si.edu. Retrieved on 2011-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Reagon founded the six-member, all-female [[a cappella]] group entitled 'Sweet Honey in the Rock.' In addition to Reagon, the women in the original group were: Ysaye Maria Barnwell, Nitanju Bolade Casle, Shirley Childress Johnson, Aisha Kahil, and Carol Maillard. The only instrument they used was their voices, along with shekere and tambourine. They have toured internationally, including to Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Australia. The group's fan base is of different ethnic backgrounds, religions, and sexual orientations. Reagon's musical roots come from the rural South Baptist Church. She has advocated "music's informational and transformative power to ask" and the strong effects that music has had on the Civil Rights Movement.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Honors==
*In 1991 Reagon received a [[Candace Award]] from the [[National Coalition of 100 Black Women]].&lt;ref name="nyt91"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Chronicle |date=June 26, 1991 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/26/style/chronicle-949991.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 she won the First National Leeway Laurel Award at the Leeway Foundation in Philadelphia.
*In 1996 Reagon won the Isadora Duncan Award.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1963 she married [[Cordell Reagon]], another member of The Freedom Singers.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkinson, Natalie {{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4081/is_200309/ai_n9297789 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316202930/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4081/is_200309/ai_n9297789 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 16, 2006 |title=Solid Rock |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}. Crisis, The. Sep/Oct 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter [[Toshi Reagon]] is also a singer-songwriter.

Reagon believes that "Life's challenges are not supposed to paralyze you, they're supposed to help you discover who you are." She believes that black people have created their own world. African Americans had to use what ever territory at their disposal to create a people. And that territory wasn't land, it was culture. She also said there was so much done because black culture was the only thing black people could call their own. That is why she feels black culture is the most powerful in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Leonard|title=John Coltrane and Black Americas Quest for Freedom: Spirituality and the Music|date=11 August 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199779740|pages=23–24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzZwGWRRz1UC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=uFfsZq9oD6&amp;dq=black%20culture%20is%20the%20most%20powerful%20in%20the%20world%20bernice%20johnson%20reagon&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20culture%20is%20the%20most%20powerful%20in%20the%20world%20bernice%20johnson%20reagon&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bill Bryson's African Diary''''' is a 2002 book by best-selling travel writer [[Bill Bryson]]. The book details a trip Bryson took to [[Kenya]] in 2002. Bryson describes his experiences there and observations about Kenyan culture, geography, and politics, as well as his visits to poverty-fighting projects run by [[CARE (relief)|CARE International]], to which he donated all royalties for the book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.careinternational.org.uk/news-and-press/press-release-archive-2002/745-bill-bryson-is-this-years-christmas-cracker&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In a review published in the Guardian Lionel Shriver was critical of the book's length, describing it as "less a book than a pamphlet".  Shriver also disliked the book's tone, "a po-faced, gee-whizz sincerity ill-suited to a writer who has made his reputation for being light and wry (and even snide) in droll travel books."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/21/billbryson.travel&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book signing''' is the affixing of a [[signature]] to the [[title page]] or flyleaf of a [[book]] by its [[author]].  '''Book signings''' are events, usually at a [[bookstore]] or [[library]], where an author sits and signs books for a period.

==Book signing==
Book signing is popular because an author's signature increases the value of books for [[book collecting|collectors]]. The author may add a short message to the reader, called a [[dedication]], to each book, which may be personalized with the recipient's name upon request.  A simple author's signature without a dedication is typically more valuable to collectors (exceptions include inscriptions to persons of note, e.g., from [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] to [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], or to persons of significance in the author's life).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Sometimes an author will sign additional copies for future sale. An additional advantage to authors for doing this is that once a book has been signed, it cannot be returned to the publisher for a refund.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Many authors today spend a great deal of time signing their books, and sign many thousands of copies.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} For example, [[John Green (author)|John Green]] signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing of his 2012 novel ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/47821-ya-author-john-green-to-sign-all-first-editions-of-next-novel.html|title = YA Author John Green to Sign All First Editions of Next Novel|website = [[Publishers Weekly]]|date = June 29, 2011|accessdate = June 27, 2017|last = Kirch|first=Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of ebooks and ereading devices has inspired the development of software - such as Authorgraph (formerly known as Kindlegraph and renamed to reflect its expansion to include all ereading platforms)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=GoodEreader.com| title=Feature: Authorgraph Allows Authors to Digitally Sign eBooks |author=Kozlowski, Michael |accessdate=May 12, 2014| url=http://goodereader.com/blog/interviews/feature-authorgraph-allows-authors-to-digitally-sign-ebooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Autography (for [[iOS]] devices) - that allows authors to digitally personalize ebooks, by including autographs, dedications, and photographs, and to provide such personalization remotely as well as at in-person book signings. Such software benefits authors, "who are not obliged to go on long distance promotional tours in order to autograph e-books for their fans",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://portables.about.com/od/ebookreasers/a/E-Book-Autograph.htm |work=About.com Portable Electronics|accessdate=May 12, 2014 |title=Autography Lets Authors Sign Your E-Book Without Vandalizing Your E-Reader|author=Moon, Brad|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those readers who are unwilling or unable to brave crowds and longs lines at onsite book signings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 12, 2014|title=Live Online Ebook Signing via Spreecast Tonight|author=Pilkington, Mercy |work=GoodEreader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before such applications were introduced, efforts to bridge the [[digital divide]] for those who read ebooks included having authors sign the backs of their fan's ereading devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times| title=Would You Sign My Kindle? |author=Rosenbloom, Stephanie| date= April 13, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/fashion/14NOTICED.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sign ebooks via direct stylus input (e.g., on a [[Sony Reader|Sony Reader Touch]] or [[Palm OS|Palm eReader]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://portables.about.com/od/ebookreasers/a/E-Book-Autograph.htm |work=About.com Portable Electronics|accessdate=May 12, 2014 |title=Autography Lets Authors Sign Your E-Book Without Vandalizing Your E-Reader|author=Moon, Brad|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book signings==
Book signings provide more than a just a chance to obtain signatures.  Authors and bookstores are benefited by the fact that many copies of the book being promoted are sold at these events.  Signings also increase public goodwill and allow authors to connect with their fans.  For fans, signings provide a chance to see and meet a favorite author and ask them questions.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The development of social media platforms allows modern day authors to conduct virtual book signings. For example, The GoodEReader and Autography jointly hosted an ebook signing with author HP Mallory, during which Mallory greeted fans via [[Spreecast]], a social connectivity platform that allows users to have up to four guests on [[video chat]] at one time,  to conduct Q&amp;A sessions with even more participants, and to maintain a channel on the site, thereby recording and storing the Spreecast and assigning the recordings a URL for sharing at other outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online Ebook Signing via Spreecast Tonight| author=Pilkington, Mercy | work=GoodEreader.com|accessdate=May 12, 2014|url=http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/live-online-ebook-signing-via-spreecast-tonight}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many authors use the book signing platform LiveSigning to host large-scale, streaming video book signings with their fans. Donald Trump hosted a book signing on this platform during his presidential campaign in December 2015. Book signings on LiveSigning typically consist of the author signing books, answering questions from fans, and making phone calls to some fans. After the event, the signed books are mailed to everyone who purchased a signed copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump Sells Out of His Own Signature at $13 a Copy| author=Frizell, Sam | work=Time.com|accessdate=August 19, 2016|url=http://time.com/4145029/donald-trump-signed-book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8033">[[File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumbnail|Christ Pantocrator from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Sinai]].]]
'''The Christ Pantocrator of St. Catherine’s Monastery at Sinai''' is one of the oldest [[Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] religious [[icon]]s, dating from the sixth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;John Galey, George Forsyth, and Kurt Weitzmann, ''Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine'' (Givatayim, Israel: Massada, 1980), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest known version of the [[Christ Pantocrator|pantocrator style]] that still survives today, and is regarded by historians and scholars to be one of the most important and recognizable works in the study of [[Byzantine art]] as well as [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

For a time the icon was thought to have been dated from the thirteenth century, since it had been almost completely painted over at that time, but it was concluded in 1962 that it is in fact from the mid-sixth century, although the exact date of production is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weitzmann, ''The Monastery of Saint Catherine at Mount Sinai, the Icons'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1976), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Saint Catherine's Monastery|Saint Catherine’s Monastery]] was founded by the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]], late in his reign, between 548 and 565,&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; it enjoyed imperial patronage and donations from Justinian and his court, with the Christ Pantocrator icon having been one of the many possible imperial gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Kōnstantinos A. Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures of the Monastery of Saint Catherine'' (Athens: Ekdotike Athenon, 1990), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it is generally believed to have been produced in the Byzantine capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation and meaning ==
{{see also|Christ Pantocrator}}

[[File:Composite_christ_pantocrator.png|thumb|Mirrored composites of left and right sides of image]]

Many agree that the icon represents the [[Hypostatic union|dual nature of Christ]], illustrating traits of both man and god,&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis and Gerry Walters, “An Encaustic Icon of Christ at Sinai,” ''The Art Bulletin'' 49, No. 3 (1967): 201; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Manaphēs 93; Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps influenced by the aftermath of the [[ecumenical council|ecumenical councils]] of the previous century at [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 84; Robin Cormack, ''Oxford History of Art: Byzantine Art'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Christ’s features on the left side{{clarify |date=March 2018 |reason=Is that *his* left side, or the left side of the painting?}} are supposed to represent the qualities of his human nature, while the right side represents his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His right hand is shown opening outward, signifying his gift of blessing, while the left hand and arm is clutching a thick [[Gospel]] book.&lt;ref&gt;Chatzidakis and Walters, “An Encaustic Icon,” 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested the icon at Sinai could have been a possible representation of the Kamouliana icon of Christ&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, ''Byzantine Art'', 78-9; Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 93.&lt;/ref&gt; or of the famous icon of Christ of the [[Chalke Gate]],&lt;ref&gt;Chatzidakis and Walters, “An Encaustic Icon,” 202.&lt;/ref&gt; an image which was destroyed twice during the first and second waves of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]]{{mdash}}first in 726, and again in 814{{mdash}}and thus its connection with the Christ Pantocrator is difficult to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and production ==

With a height of 84&amp;nbsp;cm, width of 45.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and a thickness of 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm, the icon was originally taller and wider before its top and sides were cut.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise there is only one spot with major damage, a large portion of Christ’s hair on his left side, including his left ear and shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] surface has continually been preserved in excellent condition overall.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many of the early icons from Sinai, the Christ Pantocrator was created by using this technique, known as encaustic—a medium using hot wax paint—that would rarely continue to be utilized in the Byzantine world after the iconoclastic controversies of the eighth and ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, ''Byzantine Art'', 111-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the monastery at Sinai is the only place in the world where a substantial number of these encaustic icons, particularly those dating from as early as the sixth century, have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Period of Byzantine [[Iconoclasm]], the production of Orthodox icons continued at Sinai, whereas they were being destroyed in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survival from Byzantine Iconoclasm and aftermath ==
The Muslim Arabs [[Early Muslim conquests|quickly took control]] of the entire [[Fertile Crescent]] south of the Turkish mountains, including Egypt and Sinai, cutting the monastery’s ties with Constantinople in the year 640.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by the time the era of iconoclasm had been initiated by [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] in 726, the Monastery of Saint Catherine had already been protected under [[caliphate|Muslim rule]] for nearly a century and was able to survive the destruction of iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weitzmann, “The Mosaic in St. Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai,” ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 110, No. 6 (Dec. 1966): 405; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the location of the monastery in the rocky desert of Sinai, far away from any major trade or military route, kept the contents within St. Catherine’s safe from raiders as well as conquering armies.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, “Mosaic in St. Catherine’s,” 392; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Even today the monastery houses more than 2,000 icons, dating from the sixth century to the modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14414">'''Cuban immigration to the United States''', for the most part, occurred in two periods: the first series of [[immigration]] of [[Cuban American]]s from [[Cuba]] to the [[United States]] resulted from Cubans establishing  [[cigar]] factories in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and from attempts to overthrow Spanish colonial rule by the movement led by [[José Martí]], the second to escape from [[Communist state|Communist rule]] under [[Fidel Castro]] following the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Massive [[Cuban migration to Miami]] during the second series led to major demographic and cultural changes in Miami. There was also [[Economic migrant|economic emigration]], particularly during the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.

The [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] of 1819, [[Spanish Florida]], including the present day state of [[Florida]] and, at times, [[Louisiana]] and adjoining territory, was a province of the [[Captaincy General of Cuba]] (Captain General being the Spanish title equivalent to the British colonial Governor).  Consequently, Cuban immigration to the U.S. has a long history, beginning in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial period]] in 1565 when [[St. Augustine, Florida]] was established by [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], and hundreds of Spanish-Cuban soldiers and their families moved from Cuba to St. Augustine to establish a new life.

Thousands of Cuban settlers also immigrated to Louisiana between 1778 and 1802 and [[Texas]] during the period of Spanish rule.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Since 1820 the Cuban presence was more than 1000 people. In 1870 the number of Cuban immigrants increased to almost 12,000, of which 4,500 resided in [[New York City]], 3,000 in [[New Orleans]], and 2,000 in [[Key West, Florida|Key West]]. The causes of these movements were both economic and political, which intensified after 1860, when political factors played the predominant role in emigration, as a result of deteriorating relations with the Spanish metropolis.

The year 1869 marked the beginning of one of the most significant periods of emigration from Cuba to the United States, again centered on Key West. The exodus of hundreds of workers and businessmen was linked to the manufacture of tobacco. The reasons are many: the introduction of more modern techniques of elaboration of snuff, the most direct access to its main market, the United States, the uncertainty about the future of the island, which had suffered years of economic, political and social unrest during the beginning of the Ten Years' War against Spanish rule. It was an exodus of skilled workers, precisely the class in the island that had succeeded in establishing a free labor sector amid a slave economy.

The manufacture of snuff by the Cuban labor force, became the most important source of income for Key West between 1869 and 1900.

Tampa was added to such efforts, with a strong migration of Cubans, which went from 720 inhabitants in 1880 to 5,532 in 1890. However, the second half of the 1890s marked the decline of the Cuban immigrant population, as an important part of it returned to the island to fight for independence. The War accentuated Cuban immigrant integration into American society, whose numbers were significant: more than 12,000 people.&lt;ref name="Cubabloqueo"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130210003916/http://www.cubavsbloqueo.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=2204 Cuba vs Bloqueo] (In Spanish).

== Key West and Tampa, Florida ==
In the mid-to late 19th century, several cigar manufacturers moved their operations to [[Key West]] to get away from growing disruptions as Cubans sought independence from Spanish colonial rule. Many Cuban cigar workers followed. The Cuban government had even established a grammar school in Key West to help preserve Cuban culture. There, children learned folk songs and patriotic hymns such as "[[La Bayamesa]]", the Cuban national anthem.

In 1885, [[Vicente Martinez Ybor]] moved his cigar operations from Key West to the town of [[Tampa, Florida]] to escape labor strife. [[History of Ybor City|Ybor City]] was designed as a modified [[company town]], and it quickly attracted thousands of Cuban workers from Key West and Cuba. [[West Tampa]], another cigar manufacturing community, was founded nearby in 1892 and grew quickly. Between these communities, the [[Tampa Bay area]]'s Cuban population grew from almost nothing to the largest in Florida in just over a decade, and the city as a whole grew from a village of 1,000 residents in 1885 to over 16,000 by 1900.

Both Ybor City and West Tampa were instrumental in Cuba's eventual independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Westfall |first=Loy G. |title=Tampa Bay: Cradle of Cuban Liberty |publisher=Key West Cigar City USA |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-9668948-2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by revolutionaries such as [[Jose Martí]], who visited Florida several times, Tampa-area Cubans and their neighbors donated money, equipment, and sometimes their lives to the cause of ''Cuba Libre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/51ybor/51facts3.htm |title=Ybor City: Cigar Capital of the World-Reading 3 |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish–American War]], some Cubans returned to Cuba, but others chose to stay in the U.S. due to the physical and economic devastation caused by conflicte on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lastra |first=Frank |title=Ybor City: The Making of a Landmark Town |publisher=University of Tampa Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59732-003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early emigration – 1900–59 ==
Several other small waves of Cuban emigration to the U.S. occurred in the early 20th century (1900–59). Most settled in Florida and the northeast U.S. The majority of the 100,000 Cubans came for economic reasons due to (the Great Depression of 1929, volatile sugar prices, and migrant farm labor contracts).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Others included anti-Batista refugees fleeing the military dictatorship, which had pro-U.S. diplomatic ties. During the '20s and '30s, emigration basically comprised workers looking for jobs, mainly in New York and New Jersey. They were classified as labor migrants and workers, much like other immigrants in the area at that time. Thus migrated more than 40,000 in the first decade, encouraged by U.S. immigration facilities at the time and more than 43,000 by the end of the 30s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Subsequently, the flow of Cubans to the United States fluctuated, due to both the domestic situation in the 40s and 50s in Cuba, and U.S. immigration policies, plus intermittent anti-immigrant sentiment. Cuban migration in those years included persons who could afford to leave the country and live abroad.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The Cuban population officially registered in the United States for 1958 was around 125,000 people, including descendants. Of these, more than 50,000 remained in the United States after the revolution of 1959.&lt;ref name="Cubabloqueo"/&gt;

== Post-Castro revolution (1959–)==
After the [[Cuban revolution]] led by [[Fidel Castro]] in 1959, a Cuban exodus began as the new government allied itself with the Soviet Union and began to introduce communism. From 1960 to 1979, hundreds of thousands of Cubans left Cuba. Most came from Cuba's educated upper and middle classes.  Between December 1960 and October 1962 more than 14,000 Cuban children arrived alone in the U.S {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. 

[[Operacion Pedro Pan]] developed when children arrived in Miami and were met by representatives of Catholic Charities. The children were then sent to live with relatives, foster homes, orphanages, or boarding schools. In order to provide aid to the immigrants, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Cuban Adjustment Act]] in 1966. The Cuban Refugee Program provided more than $1.3 billion of direct financial assistance. They also were eligible for [[public assistance]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], free English courses, [[scholarship]]s, and low-interest college [[loan]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Some banks pioneered loans for exiles who did not have collateral or credit but received help in getting a business loan. These loans helped many Cuban Americans to secure funds and start up their own businesses. With their Cuban-owned businesses and low cost of living, [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] and [[Union City, New Jersey]] (dubbed ''[[Havana on the Hudson]])''&lt;ref name=NYTimes2.5.06&gt;Gettleman, Jeffrey (February 5, 2006).

''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Kay. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19770628&amp;id=4kwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4464,3136176 "Little Havana on the Hudson], posted in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' on June 28, 1977. Accessed March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; were the preferred destinations for many immigrants and soon became the main centers for Cuban American culture. According to author Lisandro Perez, Miami was not particularly attractive to Cubans prior to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Grenier, Guillermo J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3XBcqhL_pKEC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=miami+destination+for+cubans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SG9mwO2HvT&amp;sig=LG-gcvjtZAjbJF3gfyQJdUtD0KQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RPMhSu_6OY3htgeoyYHQBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 ''Miami Now!: Immigration, Ethnicity, and Social Change'']. Retrieved March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the exodus of the Cuban exiles in 1959 that Miami became a preferred location. [[Westchester, Florida]] within [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], was the area most densely populated by Cubans and Cuban Americans in the United States, followed by [[Hialeah, Florida]] in second.&lt;ref name=MDFLCuba&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epodunk.com/ancestry/Cuban.html |title=Ancestry Map of Cuban Communities |publisher=Epodunk.com |accessdate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities like Miami, Tampa, and Union City, which Cuban Americans made their home,  experienced a profound cultural impact as a result, as seen in such aspects of their local culture as cuisine, fashion, music, entertainment and [[cigar]]-making.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Lydia (August 9, 1995). "Cuban cool" ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''. pp. 41 and 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juri, Carmen (August 9, 1995). "Jersey's Cuban flavors" ''The Star-Ledger''. p, 41 and 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-1990s to 2000s===
In the mid-1990s, after the implementation of the "[[wet feet, dry feet]]" policy, immigration patterns changed. Many Cuban immigrants departed from the southern and western coasts and arrived at the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] while others landed on [[Isla Mujeres]]. From there they went to the [[Mexico–United States border|Texas–Mexico border]] to request asylum. Many of the Cubans who did not have family in Miami settled in [[Houston]]; this has caused Houston's Cuban American community to increase in size.The term "dusty foot" refers to Cubans emigrating to the U.S. through Mexico. In 2005 the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] had abandoned the approach of detaining every dry foot Cuban who crosses through Texas and began a policy allowing most Cubans to obtain immediate parole.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Cobb and Paul Knight. [http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-01-10/news/immigration-cubans-enter-u-s-at-texas-mexico-border/ "Immigration: Cubans Enter U.S. at Texas-Mexico Border"], ''[[Houston Press]]'', January 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Jorge Ferragut, a Cuban immigrant who founded Casa Cuba, an agency that assists Cuban immigrants arriving in Texas, said in a 2008 article that many Cuban immigrants of the first decade of the 21st century left due to economic instead of political issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Immigration: Cubans Enter U.S. at Texas-Mexico Border." ''[[Houston Press]]''. [http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-01-10/news/immigration-cubans-enter-u-s-at-texas-mexico-border/3 3].&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2008 Mexico and Cuba created an agreement to prevent immigration of Cubans through Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Paul. [http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2008/10/immigration_cuba_mexico.php "Cuba, Mexico Look To Block The Texas Entrance To The U.S."], ''[[Houston Press]]'', October 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Alexandra. [http://www.themonitor.com/articles/mexico_18862___article.html/cuban_cubans.html "Cuba: Mexico to fight illegal migration to US"], [[Associated Press]] via ''[[The Monitor (Texas)|The Monitor]]'', October 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Puerto Rico]] also become a destination for Cubans trying to reach the United States. As a U.S. [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]], Puerto Rico was seen as a stepping stone for emigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominicantoday.com/app/article.aspx?id=16234 "Cubans using Haitian, Dominican soil to reach Puerto Rico concerns the U.S."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112075240/http://www.dominicantoday.com/app/article.aspx?id=16234 |date=2007-11-12 }}, ''Dominican Today'', accessed 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration policy===
Before the 1980s, all refugees from Cuba were welcomed into the United States as political refugees. This changed in the 1990s so that only Cubans who reach U.S. soil were granted refuge status under the "[[wet feet, dry feet policy|wet foot, dry foot policy]]".  While representing a tightening of U.S. immigration policy, the wet foot, dry foot policy afforded Cubans a privileged position relative to other immigrants to the U.S.

According to a U.S. Census 1970 report, Cuban Americans lived in all 50 states. But as later Census reports demonstrated, most Cuban immigrants settled in south Florida. A new trend in the late 1990s showed that fewer immigrants arrived from Cuba than previously. While U.S. born Cuban Americans moved out of their enclaves, other nationalities settled there.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The '''feminist art movement in the United States''' began in the early 1970s and sought to promote the study, creation, understanding and promotion of women's art. 
First-generation feminist artists include [[Judy Chicago]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], [[Judith Bernstein]], [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville|Sheila de Bretteville]], [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Rachel Rosenthal]], and many other women. They were part of the [[Feminist art movement]] in the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thomas Patin  |author2=Jennifer McLerran  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Artwords: A Glossary of Contemporary Art Theory |location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood | year=1997 |page=55 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/27960870 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement spread quickly through museum protests in both New York (May 1970) and Los Angeles (June 1971), via an early network called W.E.B. ([[West-East Bag]]) that disseminated news of feminist art activities from 1971 to 1973 in a nationally circulated newsletter, and at conferences such as the West Coast Women's Artists Conference held at [[California Institute of the Arts]] (January 21–23, 1972) and the [[Conference on Women in the Visual Arts]], at the [[Corcoran School of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (April 20–22, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Moravec | first = Michelle | title = Toward a history of feminism, art, and social movements in the United States | journal = [[Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]] | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 22–54 | doi = 10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022 | date = 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We examined the content of the history of art, and we began to make different kinds of art forms based on our experiences as women. So it was both social and something even beyond; in our case, it came back into our own studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Fine Art Meets Craft: The Accessible Works of Joyce Kozloff|url=http://www.aauw.org/2013/08/28/kozloff/|publisher=American Association of University Women|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feminist Art Movement of the 1970s, within the second wave of feminism, "was a major watershed in women's history and the history of art" and "the personal is political" was its slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s, History and Impact|year=1996|publisher=Harry N.

===Key activities===

====''Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition''====
In 1969 [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]] wrote a manifesto entitled ''Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition'', challenging the domestic role of women and proclaiming herself a "maintenance artist". Maintenance, for Ukeles, is the realm of human activities that keep things going, such as cooking, cleaning and child-rearing and her performances in the 1970s included the cleaning of art galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bird, Michael Newman, ''Rewriting Conceptual Art'', Reaktion Books, 1999, p114-5. {{ISBN|1-86189-052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first performance called ''Touch Sanitation'' was from 1979-80.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moussemagazine.it/mierle-laderman-ukeles-maintenance-art-queens-museum-new-york/|title=Mierle Laderman Ukeles "Maintenance Art" at Queens Museum, New York •Mousse Magazine|website=moussemagazine.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art Workers' Coalition demands equal representation for women====
A demand for equality in representation for female artists was codified in the [[Art Workers' Coalition]]'s (AWC) Statement of Demands, which was developed in 1969 and published in definitive form in March 1970. The AWC was set up to defend the rights of artists and force museums and galleries to reform their practices. While the coalition sprung up as a protest movement following Greek kinetic sculptor [[Takis|Panagiotis "Takis" Vassilakis]]'s physical removal of his work Tele-Sculpture(1960) from a 1969 exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, it quickly issued a broad list of demands to 'art museums in general'.

Alongside calls for free admission, better representation of ethnic minorities, late openings and an agreement that galleries would not exhibit an artwork without the artist's consent, the AWC demanded that museums 'encourage female artists to overcome centuries of damage done to the image of the female as an artist by establishing equal representation of the sexes in exhibitions, museum purchases and on selection committees'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Charles|title=Art in theory|date=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-16575-4|pages=901–2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Initial feminist art classes====
The first women's art class was taught in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College, now [[California State University, Fresno]], by artist [[Judy Chicago]]. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the Spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. 
Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] (FAP) at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

The Fresno Feminist Art Program served as a model for other feminist art efforts, such as [[Womanhouse]], a collaborative feminist art exhibition and the first project produced after the Feminist Art Program moved to the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in the fall of 1971. Womanhouse, like the Fresno project, also developed into a feminist studio space and promoted the concept of collaborative women's art.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"/&gt;

The Feminist Studio Workshop was founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by [[Judy Chicago]], [[Arlene Raven]], and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] as a two-year feminist art program. Women from the program were instrumental in finding and creating the [[Woman's Building]], the first independent center to showcase women's art and culture. Galleries existed there for the entire history of the organization and that was a major venue for exhibiting feminist art.

Art historian [[Arlene Raven]] established the Feminist Art Program in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L. Langer |editor3=Joanna Frueh  |chapter=The Last Essay on Feminist Criticism |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|location=New York | publisher=Icon Editions | year=1991 |pages=229–230 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99908276 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?''====

In 1971, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] published the article "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" in ''Woman in Sexist Society,'' which was later reprinted in ''ArtNews,'' where she claimed that there were no "great" women artists at that time, nor in history. By omission, this inferred that artists like [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and [[Mary Cassatt]] were not considered great. She stated why she felt that there were no great women artists and what organizational and institutional changes needed to take place to create better opportunities for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L. Langer |editor3=Joanna Frueh  |chapter=The Last Essay on Feminist Criticism |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|location=New York | publisher=Icon Editions | year=1991 |pages=41–42 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99908276 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Lucy Lippard]] and others identified three tasks to further the understanding and promotion of works by women:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L. Langer |editor3=Joanna Frueh  |chapter=The Last Essay on Feminist Criticism |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|location=New York | publisher=Icon Editions | year=1991 |page=100 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99908276 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Find and present current and historic art works by women
* Develop a more informal language for writing about art by women
* Create theories about the meanings behind women's art and create a history of their works.

====Approaches====
In California, the approach to improve the opportunities for women artists focused on creating venues, such as the [[Woman's Building]] and the Feminist Studio Workshop (FSW), located with the Woman's Building.  Gallery spaces, feminist magazine offices, a bookstore, and a cafe were some of the key uses of the Feminist Studio Workshop.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

Organizations like [[A.I.R. Gallery]] and [[Women Artists in Revolution|Women Artists in Revolution (WAR)]] were formed in New York to provide greater opportunity for female artists and protest for to include works of women artist in art venues that had very few women represented, like [[Whitney Museum]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 1970 there was a 23% increase in the number of women artists, and the previous year there was a 10% increase, due to [[Whitney Biennial|Whitney Annual]] (later Whitney Biennial) protests.&lt;ref name="Art Story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm# | title=Feminist art movement | publisher=The Art Story Foundation | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Feminist Art Institute]] opened in June 1979 at 325 Spring Street in the Port Authority Building. The founding members and the initial board of directors were [[Nancy Azara]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], Selena Whitefeather, Lucille Lessane, [[Irene Peslikis]] and Carol Stronghilos.&lt;ref name=Rutgers&gt;Fernanda Perrone, Amy Dawson, and Caroline T. Caviness. [http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/ead/manuscripts/nyfaif.html Inventory to the Records of the New York Feminist Art Institute, 1976-1990.] Administrative History. Rutgers. July 2009. Retrieved January 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A board of advisers was established of accomplished artists, educators and professional women.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt; For instance, feminist writer and arts editor at ''Ms. Magazine'' Harriet Lyons was an adviser from its start.&lt;ref name="Love2006"&gt;Barbara J.

====''Three Weeks in May''====
In 1977, [[Suzanne Lacy]] and collaborator Leslie Labowitz, combined performance art with activism in ''[[Three Weeks in May]]'' on the steps of [[Los Angeles City Hall]]. The performance, which included a map of rapes in the city, and [[self-defense]] classes highlighted [[sexual violence]] against women.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Turning Stereotypes Into Artistic Strengths  |author=Karen Rosenberg |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 28, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/arts/design/28toge.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
''[[The Feminist Art Journal]]'' was a feminist art publication that was produced from 1972 to 1977, and was the first stable, widely read journal of its kind. Beginning in 1975 there were scholarly publications about feminism, feminist art and historic women's art, most notably ''Through the Flower: My Struggle as a Woman Artist'' by [[Judy Chicago]]; and ''Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape'' (1975) by [[Susan Brownmiller]]; ''Woman Artists: 1550-1950'' (1976) about [[Linda Nochlin]] and Ann Sutherland Harris's exhibition; ''From the Center: Feminist Essays in Women's Art'' (1976) by [[Lucy Lippard]]; ''Of Woman Born,'' by [[Adrienne Rich]], ''When God Was a Woman'' (1976) by [[Merlin Stone]]; ''By Our Own Hands'' (1978) by [[Faith Wilding]]; ''Gyn/Ecology'' (1978) by [[Mary Daly]]; and ''Woman and Nature'' by [[Susan Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Visions and Re-visions"&gt;{{cite book | author=Moira Roth | chapter=Visions and Re-Visions: Rosa Luxemburg and the Artist's Mother |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology |editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L.

In 1977, both ''[[Chrysalis (magazine)|Chrysalis]]'' and ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]]'' began publication.&lt;ref name="Visions and Re-visions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://helios.hampshire.edu/nomorenicegirls/heretics/#index ''Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics''](1977–92), now the subject of a documentary film, [http://helios.hampshire.edu/nomorenicegirls/heretics/#overview The Heretics].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|''Chrysalis Magazine'' (1977–80), was organized out of the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}|group=nb}}

==1980s==
Feminist art evolved during the 1980s, with a trend away from experiential works and social causes. Instead, there was a trend toward works based upon [[Postmodern theory]] and influenced by [[psychoanalysis]]. Inequal representation in the artworld was a continuing issue.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

===Key activities===

====Guerrilla Girls====
[[Guerrilla Girls]] was formed by 7 women artists in the spring of 1985 in response to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s exhibition "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture", which opened in 1984. The exhibition was the inaugural show in the MoMA's newly renovated and expanded building, and was planned to be a survey of the most important contemporary artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenson|first=Michael|title=A Living Artists Show at the Modern Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/21/arts/a-living-artists-show-at-the-modern-museum.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guerrilla Girls have researched sexism and created artworks at the request of various people and institutions, among others, the [[Istanbul Modern]], Istanbul, Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts, Rotterdam and Fundación Bilbao Arte Fundazioa, Bilbao. They have also partnered with [[Amnesty International]], contributing pieces to a show under the organization's "Protect the Human" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |title=Press Releases &amp;#124; Amnesty International UK |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mass communication====
[[Mass communication]] is "the process by which a person, group of people, or large organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Media and Mass Communication Theories|date=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=624–628|last1=Pearce|first1=K.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women such as [[Barbara Kruger]] and [[Jenny Holzer]] used forms of graphic mass communication such as refined slogans and graphics to increase awareness of the inequity faced by women artists.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

'''Kiki Smith'''

During the 1970s [[Kiki Smith]] was one of the many artists involved in the collaborative projects. As the art scene became more politicized in the 1980s, Kiki Smith's art work also became more political as well. Her work started "involving issues like abortion, race and AIDS." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/16/arts/art-view-kiki-smith-the-body-as-political-battleground.html&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if she considered herself a feminist artist, Smith responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, I would say that generationally I am, and I would say that without the feminist movement I wouldn't exist; and an enormous amount of the artwork that we take for granted wouldn't exist; and a lot of the subject matter that we assume can be encompassed by art wouldn't exist.  The feminist movement exponentially expanded what art is, and how we look at art, and who is considered to be included in the discourse of art-making. I think that it caused a tremendous, radical change. You don't want to have a cultural notion that one specific gender embodies creativity. All humanity – and all aspects of gender and sexuality and how people define themselves – are inherently creative. It's against the interests of the culture at large not to embrace feminism as a model, just like many other models of liberation, because they don't only liberate women, they liberate everybody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askyfilledwithshootingstars.com/wordpress/?p=1128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Sister Serpents ====
[[Sister Serpents]] was a radical [[Feminism|feminist]] art collective that began as a small group women in Chicago in the summer of 1989, as a direct response to the [[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]] Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SisterSerpents: A Radical Feminist Art Collective|last=Margolin|first=Victor|date=1992|work=AIGA Journal of Graphic Design|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=2|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal as a collective was to empower women and to increase awareness of women's issues through radical art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Hissing with anger: SisterSerpents exhibit art|last=George|first=Erika|date=March 12, 1991|work=The Chicago Maroon|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to use art as a weapon to battle misogyny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Serpentine artists hiss at misogyny|last=Bradley|first=Amanda|date=February 26, 1991|work=The Daily Northwestern|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art curatorial practices===

====History====

Feminist art curating practices are within a museumism genre, which is a deconstructing of the museum space by curator/artist where the museum looks at itself or the artist/curator looks at the museum.

"If artists as curators of their own exhibition is no longer uncommon, neither is the artist-created museum or collection ... These artists use museological practices to confront the ways in which museums rewrite history through the politics of collecting and presentation ... However, their work often inadvertently reasserts the validity of the museum" (Corrin, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref&gt;CORRIN, L. G. (1993). Mining the museum: An installation confronting history. [[Curator: The Museum Journal]], 36(4), 302-313. doi:10.1111/j.2151-6952.1993.tb00804.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klebesadel, Helen (2005). Reframing studio art production and critique. In Janet Marstine (Ed.), New museum theory and practice an introduction (pp. 247-265). Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Katy Deepwell]] documents feminist curating practice and feminist art history with a theoretical foundation that feminist curating is not biologically determinate.&lt;ref&gt;Deepwell, Katy (2005). Feminist curatorial strategies and practices since the 1970s. In Janet Marstine (Ed.), New museum theory and practice an introduction (pp. 64-84). Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Characteristics====

Feminist art curatorial practices are collaborative and reject the notion of an artist as an individual creative genius.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, R., &amp; Pollock, G. (1981). Old mistresses: Women, art and ideology. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curatorial Collectives and Feminist Politics in 21st Century Europe: An Interview with Kuratorisk Aktion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedlin Hayden, Malin &amp; Sjoholm Skrubbe, Jessica (Eds.).

== Feminist Art Movement in 2018 ==

=== #metoo movement represented in Feminist Art Movement ===
Carnegie Mellon art galleries director Elizabeth Chodos and assistant director Margaret Cox put up a gallery for Faith Wilding's artwork, who was a prominent artist who studied art in the 70's when issues like rape and sexual abuse were too taboo to discuss. She learned to be open with her artwork focusing on female bodies working alongside other female art students. She did however, criticize the fact that most art teachers were male.  The ideas explored in her work offered influence for key elements of the #metoo movement but also recognizes that we still have a long way to go in terms of equality and respect. Wilding's artwork addressed social issues relating to sexual assault that are just now beginning to emerge culturally through #metoo.

The '''Fort Walton Mound''' ([[Smithsonian trinomial|8OK6]]) is an [[archaeological site]] located in present-day [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]], [[United States]]. The large [[platform mound]] was built about 850 [[Common Era|CE]] by the [[Pensacola culture]], a local form of the [[Mississippian culture]].&lt;ref name=GIBBON&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0u2y_SVnmoC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=Fort+Walton+Site+and+Culture+gibbon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U8WLT8KWIob22gXD_uHQCQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|encyclopedia=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia|editor1= By Guy E. Gibbon|editor2= Kenneth M. Ames|title=Fort Walton Site and Culture|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its significance, the mound was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.

Still reduced by time, the massive mound is still {{convert|12|ft|m}} high and {{convert|223|ft|m}} wide at the base. It was an expression of a complex culture, built by a hierarchical society whose leaders planned and organized the labor of many workers for such construction. The mound served combined ceremonial, political and religious purposes.  At the center of the village and its supporting agricultural lands, the mound served as the platform for the temple and residence of the [[tribal chief|chief]]. Successive leaders were buried in the mound and additional layers were added over time.

This is one of three surviving mound complexes in the panhandle, the others being [[Letchworth Mounds]] and [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds]] state parks.

==History==
The Fort Walton Mound was probably built around 800 AD, although [[Charles H. Fairbanks]] who excavated the mound in 1960 believed it was built between 1500 and 1650 based on pottery sherds he uncovered and analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, Charles, "Excavations at the Fort Walton Temple Mound, 1960," Florida Anthropologist, Vol. XVIII, No. 4, December 1965, pg. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The mound served as the ceremonial and political center of their chiefdom and probably the residence of the chief. It was also the burial ground of the elites in the society. Archaeological evidence suggests that several buildings once stood on top of the mound, perhaps at different times throughout its use. These buildings were probably done in the typical [[wattle and daub]] construction common among Southeastern Native American groups. By sometime in the late 1600s the mound was abandoned by its original builders and lay dormant in use until the area was reinhabited by white settlers in the mid 19th century.

The Confederate soldiers established "Camp Walton" at the base of Fort Walton Mound in 1861 during the Civil War to guard Santa Rosa Sound and Choctawhatchee Bay. As with many of Florida's mound structures, the Fort Walton Mound was first excavated by antiquarians and amateur archaeologists. The Walton Guard soldiers are the first recorded group to have excavated the mound. John Love McKinnon, an officer with the Walton Guards at the time, wrote a description of their excavation in his book "History of Walton County."&lt;ref name="McKinnon"&gt;McKinnon, John, "History of Walton County," pg. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; McKinnon noted that several human remains the soldiers unearthed were from large individuals and probably belonged to warriors as indicated by damage they observed on the skulls, thighs and arms bones consistent with hacking and blunt force trauma. He speculated that the area they dug into was once a [[charnel house]].&lt;ref name="McKinnon"/&gt; A couple decades after the Civil War, in 1883 S.T. Walker wrote a report about excavating the mound for the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, S.T., "Annual report of the Smithsonian Institution for the year 1883".&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|854}} Walker surveyed several mounds in the Florida Panhandle and noted that many curiosity seekers had dug into the mound over the years. Walker noted that Dr. S.S. Forbes from [[Milton, Florida]], had excavated the mound previously and discovered bones and several clay effigies which he later donated to the Smithsonian.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;{{rp|862}}

[[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] also excavated the mound in 1901 and brought many before unseen ceramic vessels and burial items to light.&lt;ref&gt;Brose, David and Nancy White, "The Northwest Florida Expedition of Clarence Bloomfield Moore," University of Alabama Press, 1999, pgs. 61-81.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 the highly respected archaeologist Gordon Willey and Richard Woodbury rexamined the Fort Walton Mound and other sites Moore had visited.&lt;ref&gt;http://140.247.102.177/Willey/grw.html#June6&lt;/ref&gt; Their work here was mentioned in Willey's highly acclaimed work "Archaeology of the Florida Gulf Coast," which he completed when he worked for the Bureau of American Ethnology Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Gordon, "Archaeology of the Florida Gulf Coast," Washington, Smithsonian Institution, 1949, pg. 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; By 1960 Dr. Charles Fairbanks, an archaeologist and professor at Florida State University, was contacted by the city and he excavated the mound to determine the original size, shape, and construction method of the mound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= |author= |journal= |jstor=25615551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the Fort Walton Mound was excavated by members of the museum staff under the guidance of William and Yulee Lazarus.&lt;ref&gt;White, Nancy Marie, "Grit-Tempered: Early Women Archaeologists in the Southeastern United States," pg. 163-177&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971-1973 with the help of Depauw University's Robert J. Fornaro the mound was excavated to locate post holes and recover ceramic material that might fit vessels found earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Yulee, "Fort Walton Temple Mound (8OK6M): Further Test Excavations, DePauw 1973," Florida Anthropologist, vol. 28, no. 4, December 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The last excavation of the Fort Walton Mound occurred in 1976 by then FSU graduate student Nina Thanz (Borremans). Thanz was tasked with making sure the reconstruction of a temple building being planned for the top of the mound would not disturb any human remains or artifacts during construction. She found several post holes from different structures built on top of the mound and evidence for a charnel house. Her findings of post holes became one source of the dimensions to the building structure that stands on the mound today. According to the first curator of the Indian Temple Mound Museum Yulee Lazarus the reconstruction of the temple building that currently stands on top of the mound was never intended on being a "replica," but rather to "bolster the imagination and interpretation of the Indians' use of the temple mound."&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Yulee, "A Temple-Style Shelter on the Fort Walton Temple Mound," Florida Journal of Anthropology, pg. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Walton Culture==
The mounds were built by the people of the [[Pensacola culture]], a regional variation of the [[Mississippian culture]].&lt;ref name=GIBBON/&gt; The [[Fort Walton culture]] was named for the site by archaeologist [[Gordon Willey]], but later work in the area has led archaeologists to believe the Fort Walton site was actually built and used by people of the contemporaneous Pensacola culture. The peoples of the Fort Walton culture used mostly sand, grit, [[Grog (clay)|grog]], or combinations of these materials as [[wikt:temper|tempering]] agents in their pottery, whereas the Pensacola culture peoples used the more typical Mississippian culture [[Shell tempered pottery|shell tempering]] for their pottery.&lt;ref name=MARRINAN2007&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rochelle A. Marrinan|author2=Nancy Marie White|url=http://www.trailoffloridasindianheritage.org/pdf/fw1.pdf|title=Modeling Fort Walton Culture in Northwest Florida|journal=Southeastern Archaeology|volume=26|number=2-Winter|year=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403084151/http://www.trailoffloridasindianheritage.org/pdf/fw1.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was abandoned by 1500 A.D. but the exact reason for the abandonment is unknown. It has been speculated that this was due to the arrival of European settlers, but this statement is unproven because the sites were already found abandoned by Spanish explorers years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Dale|title=Explore Southern History|url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/fortwaltonmound.html|work=Fort Walton Mound|accessdate=04/08/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people are recognized as being one of the most successful pre-Columbian cultures in regards to agriculture. A number of crops were successful including corn, beans, and squash. The mound itself appears in a common architectural fashion for the period with features such as a pyramidal base with a truncated top. The flat top was used for ceremonies, temples, and residences for high-ranking officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Worlds|url=http://www.lostworlds.org/fort_walton_mound.html|work=Florida: Fort Walton Mound|publisher=Lost Worlds|accessdate=04/08/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Walton Beach Heritage Park &amp; Cultural Center==
Fort Walton Mound is now protected as part of the '''Fort Walton Beach Heritage Park &amp; Cultural Center''', which features several museums included with admission: the '''Indian Temple Mound Museum''', '''Camp Walton Schoolhouse Museum''', '''Garnier Post Office Museum''' and '''Civil War Exhibits Building'''.

===Indian Temple Mound Museum===
The city-owned and operated Indian Temple Mound Museum features [[pre-Columbian]] artifacts found on site and from other locations, as well as a variety of exhibits on later Native American and Floridian history including artifacts from the European Explorers, local pirates and early settlers. The address is 139 Miracle Strip Pkwy SE, near the intersection of [[State Road 85 (Florida)|State Road 85]] and [[U.S. Route 98 in Florida|U.S. Route 98]], in the [[Florida Panhandle]].  The museum was first opened in 1962 and the current location was opened in 1972.

===Camp Walton Schoolhouse Museum===
The Camp Walton Schoolhouse Museum was the original one-room schoolhouse built in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fwb.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=109 Camp Walton Schoolhouse Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; It opened for use for the community children from 1912 to 1936.  Opened in 1976, the museum features early-20th-century desks and education items.

===Garnier Post Office Museum===
The Garnier Post Office Museum is an original small rural post office that displays the postal history of Camp Walton and Fort Walton with emphasis from 1900 to the 1950s.  The site also served as a voting location.  The museum opened in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fwb.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=113 Garnier Post Office Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War Exhibits Building===
Opened in 2010, the Civil War Exhibits Building features displays about Florida's history during the [[American Civil War]].

Calling „'''Helga!'''“ is a [[running gag]] at German concerts and festivals.

== Ritual==

The background is unknown, some reports point to a rather rainy [[Hurricane Festival]] in [[Scheeßel]], where a high pressure cyclone called Helga was called for but didn't arrive in time.

'''''Hercules and Cacus''''' is a white sculpture to the right of the entrance of the Palazzo Vecchio in the [[Piazza della Signoria]], Florence, Italy.

[[File:Hercule et Cacus Bandinelli Florence Signoria.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Hercules and Cacus'' by Baccio Bandinelli, Piazza della Signoria, Florence]]
This work by the Florentine artist [[Baccio Bandinelli]] (1525–1534) was commissioned as a pendant to [[Michelangelo's David|David]], which had been commissioned by the republican council of Florence, under Piero Soderini (''gonfaloniere'' for life), to commemorate the victory over the [[Medici]].

The ''colossus'' (height: 5.05 m) was originally given to Michelangelo and meant to complement the ''David'' but later appropriated by the Medici family as a symbol of their renewed power after their return from exile in 1512, and again in 1530. Although descriptions of its unveiling in 1534 provided verbal and written criticisms of the marble, most were instead aimed at the Medici family for dissolving the Republic and were not aesthetic.&lt;ref name="Morford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morford|first1=Michael|title=Carving for a Future: Baccio Bandinelli Securing Medici Patronage Through His Mutually Fulfilling and Propagandistic Hercules and Cacus|date=2009|publisher=PhD diss., Case Western Reserve University|location=Cleveland, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A few of the writers of these hypercritical verses were imprisoned by Alessandro de'Medici, further suggesting a political commentary. The two harshest critics were Giorgio Vasari and Benvenuto Cellini, both of whom were champions of Michelangelo and rivals of Bandinelli for Medici patronage. Vasari lamented the change of hands from Michelangelo to Bandinelli, and the change of design. Cellini referred to the emphatic musculature as "a sack full of melons", forgetting that Michelangelo had received similar deprecation previously by Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;ref name="Morford"/&gt;{{italic title}} Neither Vasari nor Cellini can be viewed as unbiased resources due to their rivalries. The patrons (Medici family) were quite satisfied and rewarded Bandinelli greatly for his efforts with land, money, and he was later placed in charge of all sculptural and architectural programs for the Medici under Cosimo I.

Here, the demi-god [[Hercules]], who killed the fire-belching monster [[Cacus]] during his [[Labours of Hercules#Tenth labour: Cattle of Geryon|tenth labor]] for stealing cattle, is the symbol of physical strength, which juxtaposed nicely with David as a symbol of spiritual strength, both symbols desired by the Medici. This marble group shows the basic theme of the victor (the Medici) and the vanquished (the republicans). The pause suggests the leniency of the Medici to those who would concede to their rule, and served as a warning to those who would not, as this pause can be indefinite or simply temporary.&lt;ref name="Morford"/&gt;{{italic title}}

[[File:Hercules by Baccio Bandinelli.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Hercules (detail)]]
The commission for the ''Hercules and Cacus'', as mentioned, was appropriated by the pope [[Clement VII]] (Giulio de'Medici), some time during or before 1523. He was shown a wax ''bozzetto'' by Bandinelli, who received the commission. The quarried block of white [[Carrara]] marble arrived in Florence in 1525. It has been suggested that the block of marble was not large enough for Bandinelli's design and he was to make a new one, however, the reason for the change may have been purely for symbolic reasons. His first design was extremely active and violent, and it is likely that the Medici did not want such a harsh reminder of their brutal return to power.&lt;ref name="Morford"/&gt;{{italic title}} Vasari stated that Bandinelli had already carved the sculpture as far as the abdomen of Hercules when, in 1527, the pope was taken prisoner in Rome during its sacking, and the Medici were exiled once again from Florence. Meanwhile, in Florence, the republican enemies of the Medici took advantage of the chaos to expel [[Ippolito de' Medici]] from the city and return the marble to Michelangelo. Vasari stated a change in subject, which is substantiated by a terracotta ''bozzetto'', as a ''Samson Slaying the Philistines''. This was probably to separate the project from the Medici and was allowed due to Bandinelli, as a supporter of the Medici, having to leave the city. In 1530, Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] assisted the Medici in retaking possession of Florence after a long siege. Pope Clement VII subsequently installed his illegitimate son [[Alessandro de Medici]] as duke of Florence. Bandinelli then returned and continued his work on the statue. Finally in 1534 the work on the statue was finished transported from his studio to the Piazza della Signoria and placed on its marble [[pedestal]] as part of the ''ringiera''.

The statue was restored between February 1994 and April 1994. It was then discovered that the club in the hand of Hercules was not the original club, but was made of aluminum instead of the original bronze.

In May, a member from the [[Canadian Special Operations Forces Command|Canadian Special Forces]] [[Joint Task Force 2]] disrupted a Daesh attack on Iraqi security forces. The target was successfully hit at 3,540 metres from a high-rise, setting the world's longest recorded sniper kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadian-elite-special-forces-sniper-sets-record-breaking-kill-shot-in-iraq/article35415651/|title=Canadian elite special forces sniper makes record-breaking kill shot in Iraq|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2017–present)}}
Although the civil war was declared over, ISIL continued a lower-scale [[insurgency]].

Months of relative calm in Baghdad ended with over 27 people killed by suicide bombers over a period of 3 days in mid-January 2018. Although there were no immediate claims of responsibility, it was reported that such attacks had usually been the work of the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the past, and that elements of the group were still active north of the city despite the government's claim of victory in December 2017.&lt;ref name=CNN2018-01-15a&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/15/middleeast/baghdad-suicide-bombing/index.html|title=27 dead, dozens injured, in Baghdad double suicide bombing |author1=Euan McKirdy|author2=Hamdi Alkhshali |publisher=CNN |date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018|quote=Monday marked the second deadly attack to hit the city in just three days. ... the city has experienced a period of relative calm for months.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RTE2018-01-15a&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2018/0115/933344-baghdad-bomb-blast/|title=27 killed, 64 wounded in Baghdad bomb blast |publisher=[[RTÉ]] |date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018|quote=There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but most such attacks in Iraq are the work of the so-called Islamic State militant group. ...

''[[The Times]]'' meanwhile reported on 16 January that the Iraqi Army had launched an operation to oust ISIL from the Bosifian islands, a stronghold being used as a militant hideout. The hideout, located in [[Saladin governorate]], was discovered in December and is one of the 10 patches where the group is still active.

Despite these efforts, ISIL continued to hold out in the western desert&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-iraqi-border-completely-isis-free-first-time-years-map/ Syrian-Iraqi border is completely ISIS free for first time in years – map]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/iraqi-troops-destroy-is-arms-depot-three-missile-launchers-in-western-iraq/ Iraqi troops destroy IS arms depot, three missile launchers in western Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/400-is-militants-planning-to-resume-terrorist-activities-from-anbar-source/ 400 IS militants planning to resume terrorist activities from Anbar — source]&lt;/ref&gt; and wage an insurgency campaign against government forces in northern Iraq by mid-2018, most notably in [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]] and [[Kirkuk Governorate]]s. As the military could not protect the isolated hinterland of these regions, ISIL forces would repeatedly attack remote villages, defeating their self-defense groups, kidnap people for ransom and forcing local civilians to flee. Sometimes, ISIL fighters would even openly flaunt their presence, placing their flag at well visible points and driving around with motorcycles, cars, and technicals.&lt;ref name="new insurgency"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/iraqi-villagers-flee-their-homes-amid-new-islamic-state-insurgency/4437739.html |title=Iraqis Flee Homes Amid New IS Insurgency |author=Dilshad Anwar  |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=13 June 2018 |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also targeted followers of [[Yarsanism]] (called Kaka'i in Iraq) around Kirkuk, whom the militants consider unbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-islamic-state-kakai-minority/4455712.html |title=IS Attacks Drive Members of Iraqi Kakai Minority From Their Villages |author=Dilshad Anwar  |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In course of one notable attack, ISIL fighters raided a house in a village to the south of Shirqat on 11 March 2018, killing a tribal sheikh who led a Sunni militia against the group as well as three others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/islamic-state-attacks-kill-10-in-northern-iraq---police-10036882|title=Islamic State attacks kill 10 in northern Iraq - police |date=March 12, 2018|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the Iraqi Army, Popular Mobilization Forces and Peshmerga launched Operation "Vengeance for the Martyrs" to destroy ISIL remnants in Diyala and Kirkuk Governorates, supported by the Iraqi Air Force and US-led coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/contents/afp/2018/07/iraq-conflict-jihadists.html |title=Iraq launches major anti-IS operation after killings |author=[[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[al-Monitor]] |date=4 July 2018 |accessdate=4 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2018, hundreds of ISIS fighters were still located in the Anbar desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1224591/iraqi-forces-kill-%E2%80%98isis-slaughterer%E2%80%99-anbar-desert |title=Iraqi Forces Kill ‘ISIS Slaughterer’ in Anbar Desert &amp;#124; Asharq AL-awsat |publisher=Aawsat.com |date=2018-04-02 |accessdate=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ISIL's defeat, the group has regardless continued an insurgency. However they have been greatly weakened and violence in Iraq has been sharply reduced in 2018. Only 95 people lost their lives during the month of May, the lowest figure in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdobs.com/archive/featured/violence-in-iraq-at-lowest-level-in-10-years/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Joe Cinque’s Consolation: A True Story of Death, Grief and the Law''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by Australian [[author]] [[Helen Garner]], and published in 2004. It is an account of Garner's presence at the separate trials of [[Death of Joe Cinque#Anu_Singh|Anu Singh]] and her friend Madhavi Rao, who were accused of [[Death of Joe Cinque|murdering Singh's boyfriend Joe Cinque]] and Garner's attempts to understand the preceding events that led to his death as well as the legal and personal responses to the crime. The book was adapted into a 2016 [[Joe Cinque's Consolation (film)|film of the same name]].

A national bestseller, the book has sold 100,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/truly-helen/news-story/b78356cab63e9b5752d2cb89970f51a7|title=Truly Helen|date=29 March 2008|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joe Cinque's death ==

{{main article|Death of Joe Cinque}}

Anu Singh, a law student at Canberra's [[Australian National University]], killed her boyfriend Joe Cinque on 26 October 1997 with a lethal dose of heroin after she laced his coffee with [[Rohypnol]]. A number of her friends and acquaintances had been informed of her intent to kill him and some were present at parties she held in which he was drugged; none of these friends alerted authorities or police. She was subsequently found guilty of his [[manslaughter]]. The most involved of the friends, Madhavi Rao, was acquitted of all charges. Rao moved abroad and adopted a new identity after the conclusion of the trials, while Singh was released from prison in 2001.

== Summary ==

''Joe Cinque's Consolation'' begins with Garner being informed of Singh's second 1999 trial and its circumstances, when it was already in progress. She becomes interested and travels from her [[Sydney]] residence to attend the hearings in [[Canberra]]. She relates her impressions of the trial, including her negative reactions to Singh and her mystification at Rao's and others' lack of shock at and complicity in Singh's plans, which she determines to be a state of [[apathy]] and abandonment of compassion. As the trial progresses she becomes acquainted with Cinque's mother Maria and feels that the court system is not distributing sufficient justice to the victim or his family. 

After the trial Garner interviews Singh's family and attempts to interview Singh and Rao, but both refuse or are uncontactable. Because of Singh's refusal to be interviewed or contacted, Garner bases most of her information about the woman from erstwhile friends, anecdotal evidence and court transcripts. Singh is portrayed as somewhat [[Narcissism|narcissistic]], with significant self-esteem issues. Additionally, Garner notes the accused kept diaries about her interactions with men as a teen in which she treated them as disposable commodities, wore high heels to high school, and according to anecdotal evidence from her former best friend, treated Cinque with an element of derision&amp;ndash;sometimes mocking him and making jibes about what she thought was a lack of intellect to her friends. Many of Singh's former friends thought her to be shallow and self-obsessed. 

As the book progresses, Garner becomes interested in [[Victims' rights group|victim's rights]], interviews the presiding judge and repeatedly visits and becomes a friend of Cinque's family, and eventually concludes that the purpose of the book is to be consolation for Joe Cinque, as the trial proceedings could not be. 

===Themes===
Garner uses the case to explore far-reaching themes of human behaviour, culpability and responsibility, [[duty of care]], [[victims' rights]] and crime/punishment. She also touches on issues that range from the nature of human memory, including how it is not explicitly clear or cohesive, nor is it linear, and thus under cross-examination in a courtroom, any kind of lapse in memory, or contradiction of a preceding statement, may portray a person as a liar or an unworthy witness. 

Class and cultural clashes are drawn between the working class Italian-Australian family of the Cinques, compared to the "professional class" Indian-Australian family of the Singhs. That comparison starkly juxtaposes the [[blue-collar]] or [[working class]] Cinques (although Joe Cinque had a degree in engineering) with the [[middle class]] status of the Singhs. 

Furthermore, the use of [[psychiatry]] in law, is alluded to various times. Garner questions whether a "psychological sophistication" that has developed in light of modern [[behavioural science]] overrides the fact that some actions are plainly wrong and should be punishable, regardless of the [[mental illness|pathology]] of the person who commits them. She poses [[culpability|this question]] in reference to Anu Singh. Singh's defence team used her "abnormality of mind" (a diagnosis of [[borderline personality disorder]] and psychotic depression was referenced in the court proceedings) as an explanation for her killing Cinque, akin to the [[insanity defense]]. 

Finally, Garner laments on the perfunctory decision that the Crown psychiatrist would not be given direct access to Singh, and her diagnosis would be made instead on the basis of transcripts and interviews with [[mental health]] professionals in the past – Garner admits this "floored" her. Additionally, one reviewer writing for the ''Australian Book Review'' opined that it was Maria Cinque who called out the "flaky [[moral relativism]]" of the ANU students who were indifferent to Singh's plans, as well as the Canberra courts, the defence lawyers and the judge who handled the case.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Rose reviews 'Joe Cinque's Consolation' by Helen Garner|date=September 2004|accessdate=30 August 2017|url=https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/abr-online/archive/2004/september/2209-joe-cinque-s-consolation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complicity of the students, and whether or not they played a role in Cinque's death by not alerting authorities, was also a topic debated extensively throughout the text.

''Joe Cinque's Consolation'' was reviewed in a number of major newspapers and magazines. It was praised for its writing&lt;ref name="dever"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dever | first =Maryanne |date=February 2004  | title =  Hanging Out for Judgement? | journal = Hecate's Australian Women's Book Review | url = http://www.emsah.uq.edu.au/awsr/awbr/issues/138/dever.html | accessdate = 2008-05-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723085551/http://emsah.uq.edu.au/awsr/awbr/issues/138/dever.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its positioning as Joe Cinque's story.&lt;ref name="fraser"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fraser|first=Morgan|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/11/1092102517082.html|title=Joe Cinque's Consolation|date=14 August 2004|accessdate=2008-05-24|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of the book centered on it failing to tell the story it set out to tell, particularly its inability to explain Singh or her actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewitson|first=Michelle|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/6/story.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10365872|title=Helen Garner: Joe Cinque's Consolation|date=30 January 2006|accessdate=2008-05-24|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitzgerald|first=Michael|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,679925,00.html|title=Everything But the Truth|date=11 August 2004|accessdate=2008-05-24|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her failure to engage with the purpose of the adversarial justice system.&lt;ref name="dever"/&gt; Some saw this as a deliberate attempt by Garner as an author angle she chose to pursue&amp;ndash;to honour Cinque, whose family had been not given a voice or adequate justice by the court. In his review for the ''[[Australian Book Review]]'', [[Peter Rose (poet)|Peter Rose]] remarked that "books such as Joe Cinque’s Consolation often dignify the parents’ agony and indignation. In Maria Cinque we have one of the great stalwarts in this literature of loss. She is always there in court – listening, occasionally hissing and weeping, raging when she must. ‘They were keeping vigil,’ Garner says, marvelling at the Cinques’ stamina. Which is what Garner becomes conscious of doing." He further commented on the book being Garner's conscious testament to the injustice dealt to Joe Cinque and his family: "For what are these books but tributes to the dead, swipes at our forgetfulness, minor consolations for the living: the parents and siblings and friends who feel devastated and betrayed? One thinks of all the unattested lives, the little murders".&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;

Elisabeth Hanscombe, writing for Academia, wrote that Garner's writing, and her depiction of Anu Singh, addressed the notion that for a layperson it "may perhaps be difficult to understand that someone can be extremely intelligent, can function well academically, be beautiful and at the same time be seriously disturbed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helen Garner and the desire for revenge|url=https://www.academia.edu/10881969/Helen_Garner_and_the_desire_for_revenge|first=Elisabeth|last=Hanscombe|work=Academia|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reviewer compared it with ''[[The First Stone]]'' (1995), noting that it was less about the underlying debates and more about the story.&lt;ref name="fraser"/&gt; Another, Maryanne Dever (writing for the ''Australian Women's Book Review'') criticised similarities in the themes of both books, particularly Garner's perceived hostility to the women subjects and their physical appearance.&lt;ref name="dever"/&gt;

The cover of the re-printed edition from 2006 contains a blurb extracted from a review in ''[[The Bulletin]]'', which reads: "A book which functions at one level as a psychological mystery, but at deeper levels is an exploration of the adequacy of the law to dispense justice, and the responsibility that human beings have to each other...It is told with compassion, a singular kind of honesty, and unadorned intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Joe Cinque's Consolation: A True Story of Death, Grief and the Law|work=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=D-ZcUL4_wH8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=joe+cinque%27s+consolation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=joe%20cinque's%20consolation&amp;f=false|page=front cover|publisher=Picador Australia|year=2004|isbn=9780330421782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media response ==

Both Singh herself and Cinque's parents gave interviews shortly after the book's release. Singh recounted her own memories of the killing and her feelings about it after her release and expressed regret at not agreeing to an interview by Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyndham|first=Susan|title=On death and madness|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/08/1091903447496.html|date=9 August 2004|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told interviewers that she wished to redress some of the book's imbalance towards her.&lt;ref name="latenightlive"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Joe Cinque is Dead |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2004/1205918.htm|credits=Anne Delaney (producer) and Phillip Adams (interviewer)|series=Late Night Live|serieslink=Late Night Live|network=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |station=[[Radio National]]|airdate=2004-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maria Cinque said that she would never forgive Singh for killing her son and did not believe her defence against the murder charge.&lt;ref name="latenightlive"/&gt; Garner also stated that she still did not understand or empathise with Singh, although some aspects of her behaviour resonated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Garner on murder and the justice system |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1165020.htm |series=The 7:30 Report |serieslink=The 7:30 Report |credits=Kerry O'Brien (interviewer) |network=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |station=ABC  |airdate=2004-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:West_Kennet_Long_Barrow_-_HDR.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[West Kennet Long Barrow]], a striking example of the long barrow structure]]  
'''Long barrows''', also known as '''chambered tombs''', were a style of monument constructed across [[Western Europe]] in the fifth and fourth millennia BCE, during the [[Neolithic Europe|Early Neolithic]] period. Typically constructed from earth and either timber or stone, those using the latter material represent the oldest widespread tradition of stone construction in the world.

The [[long barrow]]s consist of an earthen [[tumulus]], or "barrow", sometimes with a timber or stone chamber in one end. These monuments often contained human remains interred within their chambers, and as a result, are often interpreted as [[tomb]]s, although there are some examples where this appears not to have happened. The choice of whether to use timber or stone may have had more to do with the availability of local materials than any cultural differences.

The earliest examples developed in Iberia and western France during the mid-fifth millennium BCE. The tradition then spread northwards, into the British Isles and then the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. Each area developed its own regional variations of the long barrow tradition, often exhibiting their own architectural innovations. The purpose and meaning of such barrows remains an issue of debate among archaeologists. One argument is that they are [[religion|religious]] sites, perhaps erected as part of a system of [[ancestor veneration]] or as a religion spread by missionaries or settlers. An alternative explanation views them primarily in [[economics|economic]] terms, as territorial markers delineating the areas controlled by different communities as they transitioned toward farming.

Around 40,000 chambered long barrows survive today. Many have been excavated by archaeologists, from whom our knowledge about them derives.

==Terminology and definition==

[[File:Kitscoty, Blue Bell Hill.jpg|thumb|right|In cases such as [[Kit's Coty House]], [[Kent]], the earthen mound of a long barrow has been removed, exposing a stone chamber within. In this case, the surviving chamber represents a trilithon that it commonly called a ''dolmen'']]

Given their dispersal across Western Europe, long barrows have been given different names in the various different languages of this region.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}} 
The term "barrow" is a southern English dialect word for an earthen tumulus, and was adopted as a scholarly term for such monuments by the 17th century English antiquarian [[John Aubrey]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=44}} Synonyms found in other parts of Britain included ''low'' in [[Cheshire]], [[Staffordshire]], and [[Derbyshire]], ''tump'' in [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Hereford]], ''howe'' in Northern England and Scotland, and ''cairn'' in Scotland.{{sfn|Daniel|1950|p=6}}
Another term to have achieved international usage has been "[[dolmen]]", a [[Breton language|Breton]] word meaning "table-stone"; this is typically used in reference to the stone chambers found in some, although not all, long barrows.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}}

The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] suggested that such sites could also be termed "tomb-shrines" to reflect the fact that they appear to have often been used both to house the remains of the dead and to have been used in ritualised activities.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}}

===Chambered and earthen===

The decision as to whether a long barrow used wood or stone appears to have been based largely on the availability of resources.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=9}}
 
Some of the long barrows contained stone-lined chambers within them. Early 20th century archaeologists began to call these monuments ''chambered tombs''.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}} The archaeologists Roy and Lesley Adkins referred to these monuments as ''megalithic long barrows''.{{sfn|Adkins|Adkins|Leitch|2008|p=46}} In most cases, local stone was used where it was available.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=107}} The style of the chamber falls into two categories. One form, known as ''grottes sepulchrales artificielles'' in French archaeology, are dug into the earth.{{sfn|Daniel|1950|p=5}} The second form, which is more widespread, are known as ''cryptes dolmeniques'' in French archaeology and involved the chamber being erected above ground.{{sfn|Daniel|1950|p=5}} Many chambered long barrows contained side chambers within them, often producing a cruciform shape.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Pearce|2005|p=181}} Others had no such side alcoves; these are known as ''undifferentiated tombs''.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Pearce|2005|p=181}}

The term ''earthen long barrow'' was coined by the British archaeologist [[Stuart Piggott]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=44}}
These long barrows might have used timber because stone was not available.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}}

===Design and architecture===

The construction of long barrows in the Early Neolithic would have required the co-operation of a number of different individuals and would have represented an important investment in time and resources.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|pp=5–6}}

Many were altered and restyled over their long period of use.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=107}}
Ascertaining at what date a chambered long barrow was constructed is difficult for archaeologists as a result of the various modifications that were made to the monument during the Early Neolithic.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=108}} Similarly, both modifications and later damage can make it difficult to determine the nature of the original long barrow design.{{sfn|Daniel|1950|p=7}}

Enviro-archaeological studies have demonstrated that many of the long barrows were erected in wooded landscapes.{{sfn|Malone|2001|pp=107–108}} In Britain, these chambered long barrows are typically located on prominent hills and slopes,{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=106}} in particular being located above rivers and inlets and overlooking valleys.{{sfn|Malone|2001|pp=106–107}} In Britain, long barrows were also often constructed near to [[causewayed enclosure]]s, a form of earthen monument.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=107}}

==Distribution and chronology==

[[File:Distribution of long barrows.png|thumb|right|The distribution of known Early Neolithic long barrows and related funerary monuments]]

Across Europe, about 40,000 long barrows are known to survive from the Early Neolithic.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}} They are found across much of Western Europe; stretching from southeast Spain up to southern Sweden and taking in the British Isles to the west.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}} The long barrows are not the world's oldest known structures using stone—they are predated by [[Göbekli Tepe]] in modern Turkey—but they do represent the oldest widespread tradition of using stone in construction.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=41}} The archaeologist Frances Lynch has described them as "the oldest built structures in Europe" to survive.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=5}} Although found across this large area, they can be subdivided into clear regionalised traditions based on architectural differences.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}}

Excavation has revealed that some of the long barrows in the area of modern Spain, Portugal, and western France were erected in the mid-fifth millennium BCE, making these older than those long barrows further north.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=41}} Although the general area in which the oldest long barrows were built is therefore known, archaeologists do not know exactly where the tradition started nor which long barrows are the very first ones to have been built.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=41}} It therefore appears that the architectural tradition developed in this southern area of Western Europe before spreading north, along the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=41}} The tradition had reached Britain by the first half of the fourth millennium BCE, either soon after farming or in some cases perhaps just before it.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=41}}
It later spread further north on mainland Europe, for instance arriving in the Netherlands in the second half of the fourth millennium BCE.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=41}}

Later in the Neolithic, burial practices tended to place greater emphasis on the individual, suggesting a growing social hierarchy and a move away from collective burial.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=103}}
One of the last chambered tombs erected was [[Bryn Celli Ddu]] in [[Anglesey]], Wales, built long after people stopped building them across most of Western Europe. The conscious anachronism of the monument led excavators to suggest that its construction was part of a deliberate attempt by people to restore older religious practices that were extinct elsewhere.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Pearce|2005|p=186}}

Hutton suggested that this tradition "defines the Early Neolithic of Western Europe" more than any other.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}} For the archaeologist [[Caroline Malone]], the long barrows are "some of the most impressive and aesthetically distinctive constructions of prehistoric Britain".{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=103}} Her fellow archaeologist Frances Lynch stated that these long barrows "can still inspire awe, wonder and curiosity even in modern populations familiar with Gothic cathedrals and towering skyscrapers."{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=5}} 

===Regional variation===

In the area of southern Spain, Portugal, southwestern France, and Brittany, the long barrows typically include large stone chambers.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=5}}

[[File:Jacket's Field Long Barrow I.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Jacket's Field long barrow, one of the earthen long barrows that are clustered around the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]] in Kent.]]

In Britain, earthen long barrows predominate across much of the southern and eastern parts of the island.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=5}}
Around 300 earthen long barrows are known from across the eastern side of Britain, from [[Aberdeenshire]] in the north down to the [[South Downs]] in the south, with two projections westward into [[Dorset]] and [[Galloway]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=44}} Excavation has suggested that these earthen long barrows were likely constructed between 3800 and 3000 BCE.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=44}}

Another prominent regional tradition in Britain is the [[Cotswold-Severn Group]] found in the west of the island.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=46}} These are typically chambered long barrows, and contained human bone in comparatively large quantities, averaging between 40 and 50 people in each.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=46}}

The long barrows found in the Netherlands and northern Germany also used stone in their construction where it was available.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=9}}
The examples of long barrows found in parts of Poland are also typically earthen rather than megalithic.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=5}}
Further north, in Denmark and southern Sweden, the long barrows typically used stone in their construction.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=5}}

== Function ==

The purpose and meaning of Early Neolithic long barrows are not known, however, archaeologists can make suggestions on the basis of recurring patterns that can be observed within the tradition.{{sfn|Darvill|2004|p=13}} Archaeologists, however, have not agreed upon the most likely meaning and purpose of these monuments, with various different interpretations being put forward.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=42}} Lynch suggested that the long barrows likely had "broad religious and social roles" for the communities who built and used them, comparing them in this way to the [[Church (building)|churches]] of medieval and modern Europe.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=11}}

===Funerary spaces===
Many of the long barrows were used as tombs in which to place the remains of deceased individuals.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=40}} For this reason, archaeologists like Malone have referred to them as "houses of the dead".{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=103}} Conversely, many of the long barrows do not appear to have been used as tombs; various examples that have been excavated by archaeologists have shown no evidence of having had human remains deposited there.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=40–41}} The archaeologists [[David Lewis-Williams]] and David Peace, however, noted that these long barrows were more than tombs, also being "religious and social foci", suggesting that they were places where the dead were visited by the living and where people maintained relationships with the deceased.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Pearce|2005|p=179}}

In some cases, the bones deposited in the chamber may have been old when placed there.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=108}} In other instances, they may have been placed into the chamber long after the long barrow was built.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=108}} In some instances, collections of bone originally included in the chamber might have been removed and replaced during the Early Neolithic itself.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=14}}

The human remains placed in long barrows often included a mix of men, women, and children.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=11}} 
The bones of various individuals were often mixed together.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=11}} This may have reflected a desire to obliterate distinctions of wealth and status among the deceased.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=11}}
Not all of those who died in the Early Neolithic were buried in these long barrows, although what criteria was used to determine whose remained were interred there and whose were not remains unknown.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=12}}
Large sections of the Early Neolithic population were not buried in them, although how their bodily remains are dealt with is not clear.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=103}} It is possible that they were left in the open air.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=103}} 

It is also not known where the act of excarnation took place prior to the deposition of bones within the chambers.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=14}} Some human bones have been found in the ditches of [[causewayed enclosure]]s, a form of Early Neolithic earthen monument, while evidence for the Early Neolithic outdoor exposure of corpses has also been found at [[Hambledon Hill]].{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=14}} The [[postholes]] found in front of many long barrows may also have represented the bases of platforms on which excarnation took place.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=14}}

When entering the chambers to either add or remove new material, individuals would likely have been exposed to the smell of decaying corpses.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=50}} It is unknown if entering this area was therefore seen by Early Neolithic Europeans as an ordeal to be overcome or an honourable job to be selected for.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=50}}

In some chambers, human remains were arranged and organised according to the type of bone or the age and sex of the individual that they came from, factors that determined which chamber they were placed in.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=108}}
Lynch noted that "the bulk of our surviving evidence suggests that collectivity became and remained the norm until the late neolithic".{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=14}}

Comparatively rarely, grave goods have been found interred alongside human bone inside the long barrows.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=15}} Where these have been found, archaeologists have typically interpreted them as the remains of funerary ceremonies or of feasts.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=15}} The choice of grave goods included reflects regional variation.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=15}} In the Cotswold-Severn Group in southwestern England, cattle bones were commonly found within the chambers, where they had often been treated in a manner akin to the human remains.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Pearce|2005|p=182}}

Sometimes human remains were deposited in the chambers over many centuries.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=108}} For instance, at [[West Kennet Long Barrow]] in [[Oxfordshire]], Southern England, the earliest depositions of human remains were [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to the early-to-mid fourth millennium BCE, while a later deposition of human remains was found to belong to the [[Beaker culture]], thus indicating a date in the final centuries of the third millennium BCE; this meant that human remains had been placed into the chamber intermittently over a period of 1500 years.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=108}}
This indicates that some chambered long barrows remained in sporadic use until the Late Neolithic.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=112}}

In various cases, archaeologists have found specific bones absent from the assemblages within the chambers. For instance, at [[Fussell's Lodge]] in [[Wiltshire]], southern England, a number of skeletal assemblages were found to be missing not just small bones but also long bones and skulls.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=13}} It is therefore possible that some bones were deliberately removed from the chambers in the Early Neolithic for use in ritualistic activities.{{sfnm|1a1=Lynch|1y=1997|1p=15|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2p=48}}

===Origins of the design===

The source of inspiration for the design of the chambered long barrows remains unclear.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=41}} Suggestions that have proved popular among archaeologists is that they were inspired either by natural rock formations or by the shape of wooden houses.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=41—42}} It has been suggested that their design was based on the wooden long houses found in central Europe during the Early Neolithic, however there is a gap of seven centuries between the last known long houses and the first known chambered long barrows.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=42}}

===Religious sites===

According to one possible explanation, the long barrows served as markers of place that were connected to Early Neolithic ideas about [[cosmology]] and [[spirituality]], and accordingly were centres of ritual activity mediated by the dead.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=43}} The inclusion of human remains has been used to argue that these long barrows were involved in a form of [[ancestor veneration]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=43}} Malone suggested that the prominence of these barrows suggested that ancestors were deemed far more important to Early Neolithic people than their Mesolithic forebears.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=103}} In the early twentieth century, this interpretation of the long barrows as religious sites was often connected to the idea that they were the holy sites of a new religion spread by either settlers or missionaries. This explanation has been less popular with archaeologists since the 1970s.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=42}}

Adopting an approach based in [[cognitive archaeology]], Lewis-Williams and Pearce argued that the chambered long barrows "reflected and at the same time constituted... a culturally specific expression of the neurologically generated tiered cosmos", a cosmos mediated by a system of symbols.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Pearce|2005|p=171}} They suggested that the entrances to the chambers were viewed as transitional zones where sacrificial rituals took place, and that they were possibly spaces for the transformation of the dead using fire.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Pearce|2005|p=182}}

===Territorial markers===

A second explanation is that these long barrows were intrinsically connected to the transition to farming, representing a new way of looking at the land. In this interpretation, the long barrows served as territorial markers, dividing up the land, signifying that it was occupied and controlled by a particular community, and thus warning away rival groups.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=42}} In defending this interpretation, Malone noted that each "tomb-territory" typically had access to a range of soils and landscape types in its vicinity, suggesting that it could have represented a viable territorial area for a particular community.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=107}} Also supporting this interpretation is the fact that the distribution of chambered long barrows on some Scottish islands shows patterns that closely mirror modern land divisions between farms and crofts.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=107}} This interpretation also draws [[ethnography|ethnographic]] parallels from recorded communities around the world, who have also used monuments to demarcate territory.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=43}}

This idea became popular among archaeologists in the 1980s and 1990s, and—in downplaying religion while emphasising an economic explanation for these monuments—it was influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas then popular in the European archaeological establishment.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=42, 43}} In the early twenty-first century, archaeologists began to challenge this idea, as evidence emerged that much of Early Neolithic Britain was forested and its inhabitants were likely [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]]s rather than [[agriculturalist]]s. Accordingly, communities in Britain would have been semi-nomadic, with little need for territorial demarcation or clear markings of land ownership.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=43}} Also, this explanation fails to explain why the chambered long barrows should be clustered in certain areas rather than being evenly distributed throughout the landscape.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=43}}

==Later history==

Many of the chambered long barrows have not remained intact, having been damaged and broken up during the millennia.{{sfn|Daniel|1950|p=6}} In some cases, most of the chamber has been removed, leaving only the three-stone dolmen.{{sfn|Daniel|1950|p=7}}

===Antiquarian and archaeological investigation===

The first serious study of chambered long barrows took place in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the mounds that covered chambers were removed by agriculture.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=8}}
By the nineteenth century, antiquarians and archaeologists had come to recognise this style of monument as a form of tomb.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=8}} In the latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, archaeologists like [[V. Gordon Childe]] held to the [[cultural diffusionism|cultural diffusionist]] view that such Western European monuments had been based on tombs originally produced in parts of the eastern Mediterranean region, suggesting that their ultimate origin was either in Egypt or in Crete.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|pp=8–9}} In this view, the tradition was seen as having spread westward as part of some form of "megalithic religion".{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=9}}

A seminal study of the long barrows authored by the Welsh archaeologist [[Glyn Daniel]] was published in 1958 as ''The Megalith Builders of Western Europe''.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=9}}
In 1950, the archaeologist [[Glyn Daniel]] stated that about a tenth of known chambered long barrows in Britain had been excavated,{{sfn|Daniel|1950|p=3}} while regional field studies helped to list them.{{sfn|Daniel|1950|p=3}}
Few of the earlier excavations recorded or retained any human remains found in the chamber.{{sfn|Malone|2001|p=108}}
From the 1960s onward, archaeological research increasingly focused on examining regional groups of long barrows rather than the wider architectural tradition.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=9}} From this decade onward, the meticulous excavation of various long barrows also led to the widespread recognition that long barrows were often multi-phase monuments which had been changed over time.{{sfn|Lynch|1997|p=9}}

Up until the 1970s, archaeologists widely believed that the long barrows of Western Europe were based on Near Eastern models.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=41}}

The archaeologists Lewis-Williams and Pearce opined that the emphasis on classification of these monuments into sub-types could be a self-defeating aim for archaeologists, as it distracted them from the task of explaining the meaning and purpose behind them.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Pearce|2005|p=181}}

In 2015 the first long barrow in thousands of years, the [[Long Barrow at All Cannings]], inspired by those built in the Neolithic, was built on land just outside the village of [[All Cannings]]. The project was instigated by Tim Daw, a local farmer and steward of [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/11227351/Stonehenge-steward-builds-his-own-burial-chamber.html|title=Stonehenge steward builds his own burial chamber|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barrow was designed to have a large number of private niches within the stone and earth structure to receive cremation urns.

The structure received significant media attention, with national press writing extensively about the revival of the structures, and various episodes of filming, for example by [[BBC]] ''[[Countryfile]]'' as it was being built. It was fully subscribed within eighteen months.

This was followed soon after by new barrows at:

[[File:4 Gift Bringers of Otto III.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An early example of National personification in a [[Gospels of Otto III|gospel book]] dated 990: [[Sclavinia]], [[Germania]], [[Gallia]], and [[Roman Empire|Roma]], bringing offerings to Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]].]]

A '''national personification''' is an [[anthropomorphism]] of a [[nation]] or its people. It may appear in [[editorial cartoon]]s and [[propaganda]].

Some early personifications in the Western world tended to be national manifestations of the majestic wisdom and war goddess [[Minerva]]/[[Athena]], and often took the [[Latin]] name of the ancient [[Roman province]]. Examples of this type include [[Britannia (emblem)|Britannia]], [[Germania (personification)|Germania]], [[Hibernia (personification)|Hibernia]], [[Helvetia]] and [[Polonia (personification)|Polonia]]. Examples of personifications of the [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]] include [[Marianne]], the [[Statue of Liberty]] (''Liberty Enlightening the World''), and many examples of United States coinage. Another ancient model was [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], a female [[deity]] who personified the city of [[Rome]] and more broadly, the Roman state, and who was revived in the 20th Century as the personification of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s "[[New Roman Empire]]". Examples of representations of the [[everyman]] or citizenry in addition to the nation itself are [[Deutscher Michel]], [[John Bull]] and [[Uncle Sam]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "Mass-Producing Traditions: Europe, 1870-1914," in Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger, eds., ''The Invention of Tradition'' (Cambridge, 1983), 263-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cupandring.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A replica of an unusual cup-and-ring-marked stone from [[Museum of Ayrshire Country Life and Costume|Dalgarven]], North Ayrshire, Scotland.]]
In the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[British Isles]], [[rock art]] was produced across various parts of the islands. [[Petroglyph]]ic in nature, the majority of such carvings are [[Abstraction|abstract]] in design, usually [[cup and ring mark]]s, although examples of spirals or figurative depictions of weaponry are also known. Only one form of [[rock art in Europe]], this late prehistoric tradition had connections with others along [[Atlantic Europe]], particularly in Galicia.

The study of rock art in the British Isles was largely initiated by amateur researchers rather than academic or other professional [[archaeology|archaeologists]].

Surviving examples of rock art in the British Isles are believed to represent only a small sample of that which had been produced in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many examples of petroglyphs would have eroded away, thereby being lost to contemporary scholarship.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=5}} In other examples, images might have been painted onto rock, or marked onto less permanent surfaces, such as wood, livestock or the human body, thereby also failing to survive into the present.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=5}}

==Chronology==
Rock art had first appeared in Atlantic Europe by the late fourth millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=65}}
In Britain, rock art had ceased by the time of the agricultural intensification in the Late Bronze Age, the first millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=65}}

==Distribution==
===Northern Britain===
Within Britain, the majority of recorded Neolithic and Bronze Age rock art comes from the northern part of the island.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} Cup-and-ring marks are particularly common in this area.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=33}}

Cup-and-ring marks are usually attributed to the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages,{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=23}} while attempts at building a relative chronology have been tried in [[Dumbartonshire]].{{sfn|Mackie|Davis|1989}}

===South West Britain===
Over 70 examples of late prehistoric rock art have been identified in the [[South West England|South West of Britain]],{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} being far sparser than those found in the North.{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=83}} This may in part be due to the harder nature of the natural rock in the area, which is largely plutonic granite, alongside a lack of research focused in this region.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} Rock art specialist George Nash considered the petroglyphs of this region to constitute a distinct artistic tradition from that in the North.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}}
The majority of petroglyphs in South West Britain are cup marks, engraved both onto the rock face and on boulders, as at the Castallack Menhir.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=176}}

[[File:Rockyvalleycarving2.JPG|thumb|left|One of the Rocky Valley labyrinths.]]

Archaeologists are aware of three instances in South West Britain where weapons are depicted in petroglyphs: at [[Boscawen-un]] stone circle in [[Cornwall]], at [[Badbury Rings]] Barrow in [[Devon]], and at [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=183}} Using relative dating, the weapons depicted on Boscawen-un have been tentatively dated to ''circa'' 2000 BCE, while those at Badbury Rings and Stonehenge have been dated to ''c''. 1800 BCE.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=183&amp;ndash;184}}

Several petroglyphic [[labyrinth]]s have also been discovered in South West Britain. The best known of these are a neighbouring pair that have been found engraved onto a [[shale]] outcrop at [[Rocky Valley]], Cornwall.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}} Apparently incised using a metal implement, Nash suggested that the southern labyrinth had previously been engraved using a stone tool.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}} Publicly revealed in 1948,{{sfn|Saward|2001}} it has been suggested that they are Bronze Age in date, due to similarities with Bronze Age petroglyphs in Galicia and [[Valcamonica]].{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=186}} Conversely, many rock art researchers do not consider them to be prehistoric, with Saward arguing that they were created between the 16th and 18th-centuries, when the neighbouring Trewethett Mill was operational. As evidence, she noted that labyrinths were a popular motif in folk customs at the time, and that the good state of preservation would not be present if they had prehistoric origins.{{sfn|Saward|2001}}

===Ireland===
[[File:Newgrange, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|Engravings at the entrance to [[Newgrange]].]]
Cup-and-ring marks are particularly common in this area.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=33}}

Petroglyphs can be found carved onto Early Neolithic passage tombs, such as [[Newgrange]].

==Research==
Throughout the British Isles, most of the research into rock art has been undertaken by amateurs rather than professional archaeologists, to varying degrees of quality.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=7}}

In 1997, archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] of the [[University of Reading]] published ''[[Rock Art and the Prehistory of Atlantic Europe]]'', the first study of such petroglyphs across Atlantic Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|1997}} In 1999, Stan Beckensall published ''British Prehistoric Rock Art'', the first regional overview of the island's rock art.{{sfn|Beckensall|1999}}

==Purpose==
The purposes of Neolithic and Bronze Age petroglyphs in the British Isles have long been debated, with amateur rock art researcher Ronald Morris listing 104 different proposals that he had encountered, ranking them according to what he believed to be their plausibility.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}}{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=8}}
It has been noted that the meanings and usage of such rock art might have changed over time, as they came to be encountered by communities unaware of their original purpose.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=55}}

===Directional signs===
Smith and Walker suggested that British cupmarks may have acted as directional signs, being placed alongside pathways to guide those travelling along them.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=21}}

===Entoptic phenomenon and altered states of consciousness===
One suggestion is that the motifs found in the rock art of the British Isles are depictions of [[phosphene]]s, [[entoptic phenomenon]] produced through the disturbance of the [[optic nerve]] that result from [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Bradley|1997|pp=51&amp;ndash;54}} Such altered states might have been induced by the use of [[hallucinogens|hallucinogenic drugs]], evidence for which exists from Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

This idea was first applied to the petroglyphs on the Neolithic monuments of the British Isles by [[David Lewis-Williams]] and T. Dowson. They noted that the depiction of phosphenes could appear independently in different areas due their common basis in the human nervous system.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Dowson|1993|pp=61&amp;ndash;62}} Lewis-Williams and David Pearce expanded on this idea in their book ''[[Inside the Neolithic Mind]]''.
Bradley extended these ideas to suggest that the circular designs on open air petroglyphs might have represented a pathway that led into the rock.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

Dronfield defended the entoptic explanation by way of ethnographic comparison. Examining art produced by a society that placed great emphasis on altered states of consciousness with another that did not, he highlighted that the former contained motifs identified as phosphenes while the latter did not.{{sfn|Dronfield|1995}} Although believing that it represents "a helpful clue to the roots of Atlantic rock art", Bradley noted that even if the earliest instances of rock art were based upon entoptic phenomenon, they may have become divorced from their original inspiration as they were more copied elsewhere.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

===Water symbolism===
Smith and Walker also suggested that cup-and-ring marks were symbolically linked to water, having sacred associations in late prehistoric society. As evidence, they noted that a number of the larger cups, which they refer to as basins, would have collected rain water.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=23}} They believed that cup-and-ring markings looked like the ripples produced when raindrops hit water.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=29}}

'''Nominative determinism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that people tend to gravitate towards [[vocation|areas of work]] that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting [[surname]]s. These included a book on polar explorations by [[Daniel Snowman]] and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation that some sort of psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in ''New Scientist'', as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept [[aptronym]], and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. "Aptronym" merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about why it has come to fit.

The idea that people are drawn to professions that fit their name was suggested by psychologist [[Carl Jung]], citing as an example [[Sigmund Freud]] who studied pleasure and whose surname means "joy". A few recent empirical studies have indicated that certain professions are disproportionately represented by people with appropriate surnames (and sometimes given names), though the methods of these studies have been challenged. One explanation for nominative determinism is ''[[implicit egotism]]'', which states that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. An alternative explanation is [[genetic determinism|genetic]]: a person might be named Smith or Taylor because that was originally their occupation, and they would pass on their genes to their descendants, including an aptitude for activities involving strength in the case of Smith, or dexterity in the case of Taylor.

==Background==
Before people could gravitate towards areas of work that matched their names, many people were given names that matched their area of work.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=2}} The way people are named has changed over time.{{sfn|Fowler|2012| p=11}} In pre-urban times people were only known by a single name &amp;ndash; for example, the Anglo-Saxon name Beornheard.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{efn-ua|Even the Romans, whose [[Roman naming conventions|naming system]] is generally assumed to have used three names, started out with a single name, e.g., Romulus. Over the course of fourteen centuries this then first evolved to two names, to three names (e.g., [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], where Marcus is the [[praenomen]], Tullius the [[nomen gentilicium]], and Cicero the [[cognomen]]), back to two names, and finally one name again.{{sfn|Salway|1994|p=124–126}}}} Single names were chosen for their meaning or given as [[nickname]]s.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=71}} In England it was only after the [[Norman conquest]] that surnames were added, although there were a few earlier [[Epithet|bynames]] that were not hereditary,{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{sfn|McKinley|1990|pp=25–34}}  such as [[Edmund Ironside]].{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}} Surnames were created to fit the person, mostly from [[patronymic|patronyms]] (e.g., John son of William becomes John Williamson), [[occupational name|occupational descriptions]] (e.g., John Carpenter), character or traits (e.g., John Long), or location (e.g., John from Acton became John Acton).{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=2}} Names were not initially hereditary; only by the mid-14th century did they gradually become so.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=viii}} Surnames relating to trades or craft were the first to become hereditary, as the craft often persisted within the family for generations.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=143}}{{efn-ua|Ancient Roman fathers passed on their cognomen to their children as well.{{sfn|Salway|1994|p=127}} According to Gaius Plinius Secundus, better known as [[Pliny the Elder]], cognomina derived from occupations were initially taken from agriculture &amp;ndash; for example, Cicero means chickpea. Ergo, Marcus Tullius Cicero, the orator, was a descendent of a grower of chickpeas,{{sfn|Wilson|2003|p=10}} although it is also said the cognomen was given for the shape of the nose being similar to that of a chickpea.{{sfn|McKeown|2010|p=22}}}} The appropriateness of occupational names has decreased over time, because tradesmen did not always follow their fathers:{{sfn|Fowler| 2012|p=11}} an early example from the 14th century is "Roger Carpenter the pepperer".{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=143}}

Another aspect of naming was the importance attached to the wider meaning contained in a name. In 17th-century England it was believed that choosing a name for a child should be done carefully. Children should live according to the message contained in, or the meaning of their names.{{sfn|Smith-Bannister|1997|p=11}} In 1652 [[William Jenkyn]], an English clergyman, argued that first names should be "as a thread tyed about the finger to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our Master".{{sfn|Jenkyn|1652|p=7}} In 1623, at a time when [[Puritans|Puritan]] names such as Faith, Fortitude and Grace were appearing for the first time, English historian [[William Camden]] wrote that names should be chosen with "good and gracious significations", as they might inspire the bearer to good actions.{{sfn|Camden|1984|p=43}}{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=14}} With the rise of the [[British Empire]] the English naming system and English surnames spread across large portions of the globe.{{ sfn|American Council of Learned Societies|1998|p=180}}

By the beginning of the 20th century, Smith and Taylor were two of the three most frequently occurring English surnames; both were occupational, though few smiths and tailors remained.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=43–44}}{{efn-ua|Over time many surnames in patrilineal systems go extinct, sometimes leaving a few to dominate, depending on factors such as number of male children, immigration and merging women's surnames with their spouses upon marriage. A [[Korean surnames|Korean surname]] has a 43% chance of being either Kim, Lee or Park. The [[Galton–Watson process]] models mathematically how much chance a surname has to survive. Under constant assumptions of 1 in 3 chance of 0, 1 or 2 sons, there is a 67% chance that by the fourth generation the surname has died out.{{sfn|Ratzan|2004|p=120–122}}}} When a correspondence between a name and an occupation did occur, it became worthy of note. In an 1888 issue of the ''[[Kentish Note Book]]'' magazine a list appeared with "several carriers by the name of Carter; a hosier named Hosegood; an auctioneer named Sales; and a draper named Cuff".{{sfn|Feedback|2000}}  Since then, a variety of terms for the concept of a close relationship between name and occupation have emerged. The term ''[[aptronym]]'' is thought to have been coined in the early 20th century by the American newspaper columnist [[Franklin Pierce Adams|Franklin P. Adams]].{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=18}} Linguist Frank Nuessel coined ''aptonym'', without an "r", in 1992.{{sfn|Nuessel|1992}} Other synonyms include ''euonym'',{{sfn|Room|1996|p=40}} ''Perfect Fit Last Name'' (PFLN),{{sfn|Levey|1985}} and ''namephreak''.{{sfn|Conrad|1999|p=16}} In [[literary science]] a name that particularly suits a character is called a ''charactonym''.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|1995|p=229}} Notable authors who frequently used charactonyms as a stylistic technique include [[Charles Dickens]] (e.g., [[Gradgrind|Mr. Gradgrind]], the tyrannical schoolmaster){{sfn|Lederer|2010|p=67}} and [[William Shakespeare]] (e.g., the lost baby [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]] in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'').{{sfn|Cavill|2016|p=365}} Unlike nominative determinism, the concept of aptronym and its synonyms do not say anything about causality, i.e. why the name has come to fit.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=16}}

Because of the potentially humorous nature of aptronyms a number of newspapers have collected them. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] reported irregularly on reader-submitted gems, including substitute teacher Mr. Fillin, piano teacher Patience Scales, and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s spokesman on the evils of rock 'n roll, Cardinal Rapsong.{{sfn|Conrad|1999|p=16–17}} Similarly, the journalist Bob Levey on occasion listed examples sent in by readers of his column in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': a food industry consultant named Faith Popcorn, a lieutenant called Sergeant, and a tax accountant called Shelby Goldgrab.{{sfn|Levey|1985}}{{sfn|Levey|2000}} Dutch newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'' had an irregularly featured column called "Nomen est omen" with Dutch examples.{{sfn|Hoekstra|2011|p=45}} Individual name collectors have also published books of aptronyms.{{sfn|Dickson|1996}}{{sfn|Hoekstra|2001}} [[Onomastics|Onomastic]] scholar R.M. Rennick called for more verification of aptronyms appearing in newspaper columns and books.{{sfn|Rennick|1982|p=193}} Lists of aptronyms in science, medicine, and law are more reliable as they tend to be drawn from easily verifiable sources.{{sfn| Keaney|Groarke|Galvin|McGorrian|2013}}{{sfn|Bennett|1992}}

==Definition==
Nominative determinism, literally "name-driven outcome",{{sfn|Alter|2013|p=7}} is the [[hypothesis]] that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work which reflect their names. The name fits because people, possibly subconsciously, made themselves fit. Nominative determinism differs from the concept of aptronyms in that it focuses on causality.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=16}}

The term has its origin in the "Feedback" column of the British magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1994. A series of events raised the suspicion of its editor, John Hoyland, who wrote in the 5 November issue:

{{quote|We recently came across a new book, ''Pole Positions—The Polar Regions and the Future of the Planet'', by [[Daniel Snowman]].{{sfn|Snowman|1993}} Then, a couple of weeks later, we received a copy of ''London Under London—A Subterranean Guide'', one of the authors of which is Richard Trench.{{sfn|Trench|1993}} So it was interesting to see Jen Hunt of the [[University of Manchester]] stating in the October issue of ''[[The Psychologist (publication)|The Psychologist]]'': "Authors gravitate to the area of research which fits their surname."{{sfn|Hunt|1994|p=480}} Hunt's example is an article on incontinence in the ''[[British Journal of Urology]]'' by A. J. Splatt and D. Weedon.{{sfn|Splatt|Weedon|1977}}

We feel it's time to open up this whole issue to rigorous scrutiny. You are invited to send in examples of the phenomenon in the fields of science and technology (with references that check out, please) together with any hypotheses you may have on how it comes about.{{sfn|Feedback|1994a}}}}

Feedback editors John Hoyland and Mike Holderness subsequently adopted the term ''nominative determinism'' as suggested by reader C. R. Cavonius. The term first appeared in the 17 December issue.{{sfn|Alter|2013|p=230}} Even though the magazine tried to ban the topic numerous times over the decades since,{{sfn|Feedback|2015}} readers kept sending in curious examples. These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], one Lieutenant Mike Kafka;{{sfn|Feedback|2004}} authors of the book ''The Imperial Animal'' Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox;{{sfn|Feedback|2005}} and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.{{sfn|Feedback|2007}}

As used in ''New Scientist'' the term nominative determinism only applies to work.{{sfn|Feedback|1994a}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994b}}{{sfn|Feedback|2000}}{{sfn|Feedback|2015}} In contributions to other newspapers ''New Scientist'' writers have stuck to this definition, with the exception of editor Roger Highfield in a column in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', in which he included "key attributes of life".{{sfn|Highfield|2011}}{{sfn|Colls|2011}}{{sfn|Telegraph staff|2011}}{{efn-ua|Others have extended the area of influence; for example researchers Keaney ''et al.'' entitled their study into the relationship between people called Brady and those who had pacemakers inserted for [[bradycardia]] "The Brady Bunch? New evidence for nominative determinism in patients' health".{{sfn| Keaney|Groarke|Galvin|McGorrian|2013}}}}

Prior to 1994 other terms for the suspected psychological effect were used sporadically. ''Onomastic determinism'' was used as early as 1970 by [[Roberta Frank]].{{sfn|Frank|1970|p=25}} German psychologist [[Wilhelm Stekel]] spoke of "Die Verpflichtung des Namens" (the obligation of the name) in 1911.{{sfn|Stekel|1911|p=110}} Outside of science, ''cognomen syndrome'' was used by playwright [[Tom Stoppard]] in his 1972 play ''[[Jumpers (play)|Jumpers]]''.{{sfn|Stoppard|1972|p=52}} In [[Ancient Rome]] the predictive power of a person's name was captured by the Latin proverb "nomen est omen", meaning the name is a sign.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}} This saying is still in use today in English{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}} and other languages such as French,{{sfn|Fibbi|Kaya|Piguet|2003|p=0}} German,{{sfn|Schaffer-Suchomel|2009|p=1}} Italian,{{sfn|Gerber|2006|p=0}} Dutch,{{sfn|Hoekstra|2001|p=1}} and Slovenian.{{sfn|Duša|Kenda|2011|p=0}}

''New Scientist'' coined the term ''nominative contradeterminism'' for people who move away from their name, creating a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine,{{sfn|Feedback|2014b}} would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently changed his name to Jirgensohn,{{sfn|Slovenko|1983|p=227}} and the Archbishop of Manila, [[Jaime Sin|Cardinal Sin]].{{sfn|Feedback|1996}}{{efn-ua|Over the years ''New Scientist'' has reported on other variations on the theme, including ''onomatopoeic nominative determinism'' (e.g., [[European Space Agency]] chief mission scientist Bernard Foing),{{sfn|Feedback|2006}} ''nominative indeterminism'' (to explain the existence of hundreds of scientific articles whose authors include a Wong and a Wright),{{sfn|Feedback|2014a}} and ''occupational preferentialism'' (the hypothesis that one's work influences one's taste, for example policemen liking [[John Constable|Constable]]'s paintings).{{sfn|Feedback|1999}}}} The synonym ''inaptronym'' is also sometimes used.{{sfn|Nunn|2014}}

==Research==
===Theoretical framework===
The first scientists to discuss the concept that names had a determining effect were early 20th-century German psychologists.{{sfn|Flugel|1930|p=208}} Wilhelm Stekel spoke of the "obligation of the name" in the context of compulsive behaviour and choice of occupation;{{sfn|Stekel|1911|p=110}} [[Karl Abraham]] wrote that the determining power of names might be partially caused by inheriting a trait from an ancestor who was given a fitting name. He made the further inference that families with fitting names might then try to live up to their names in some way.{{sfn|Abraham|1979|p=31}} In 1952 [[Carl Jung]] referred to Stekel's work in his theory of [[synchronicity]] (events without causal relationship that yet seem to be meaningfully related):{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=27}}

{{Quote|We find ourselves in something of a quandary when it comes to making up our minds about the phenomenon which Stekel calls the "compulsion of the name". What he means by this is the sometimes quite gross coincidence between a man's name and his peculiarities or profession. For instance&amp;nbsp;... Herr Feist (Mr Stout) is the food minister, Herr Rosstäuscher (Mr Horsetrader) is a lawyer, Herr Kalberer (Mr Calver) is an obstetrician&amp;nbsp;... Are these the whimsicalities of chance, or the suggestive effects of the name, as Stekel seems to suggest, or are they "meaningful coincidences"?{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=15}}}}

Jung listed striking instances among psychologists—including himself: "Herr [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] (Joy) champions the [[Beyond the Pleasure Principle|pleasure principle]], Herr [[Gerhard Adler|Adler]] (Eagle) the will to power, Herr Jung (Young) the idea of rebirth&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=15}}

In 1975 psychologist Lawrence Casler called for empirical research into the relative frequencies of career-appropriate names to establish if there is an effect at work or whether we are being "seduced by [[Fortuna|Lady Luck]]". He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics – attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.{{sfn|Casler|1975|p=472}}

In 2002 the researchers Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing that people have a basic desire to feel good about themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the [[self]]. Given the ''[[endowment effect|mere ownership effect]]'', which states that people like things more if they own them, the researchers theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name.{{efn-ua|Studies have shown that most people like the name given to them.{{sfn|Joubert|1985|p=983}} Extensive research also has found a strong effect called the [[name-letter effect]]: when given the choice between letters, people significantly prefer the ones from their own name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=353}}}} They called this unconscious power ''[[implicit egotism]]''.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}} Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011|p=46}} Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.{{sfn|Smeets|2009|p=11}}

===Empirical evidence===
[[File:Igor Judge 2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a man|[[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Igor Judge]], a former judge]]
Those with fitting names give differing accounts of the effect of their name on their career choices. [[Igor Judge]], former [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=18}} Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision.{{sfn|Silverman|Light|2011}} Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force.{{sfn|Nelson}} Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms,{{sfn|Cole|2001}} was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said "That had never occurred to me."{{sfn|Nevid|Rathus|2009|p=202}} [[Church of England]] vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers had anything to do with him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".{{sfn|Colls|2011}}

While reports by owners of fitting names are of interest, some scientists have questioned their value in deciding whether nominative determinism is a real effect.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=18}}{{sfn|Smeets|2009|p=14}} Instead, they argue that the claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}} To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed.{{sfn|Bateson|Martin|2001|p=124}} In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479–480}} However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham ''et al.'' for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham ''et al.'' to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011|p=23}}{{efn-ua|Confounding variables have also played a role in research into ''monogrammic determinism'': in 1999 Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive monograms (e.g., ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g., PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999}} Morrison &amp; Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artifact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. Indeed when grouping the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005}}}}

Aware of Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Mauricio published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds.{{efn-ua|Initially Pelham and colleagues defended their methods in a rebuttal Simonsohn assessed as also lacking in diligence.{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2011|p=25}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=31}}}} In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations whose titles matched their surnames, for example, baker, carpenter, and farmer.{{sfn|Pelham|Mauricio|2015|p=692}}

In 2009 Michalos reported the results of an analysis of the occurrences of people with the surname Counsell registered as independent barristers in England and Wales versus those with the name in England and Wales as whole. Given the low frequency of the name in England and Wales as a whole he expected to find no one registered, but three barristers named Counsell were found.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}}

In 2015 researchers Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb published a paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the [[General Medical Council]], and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an [[orthopedic surgery|orthopaedic surgeon]], and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided a wide range of alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were [[genitourinary medicine]] (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and [[urology]] (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). [[Neurology|Neurologists]] had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables.{{sfn|Limb|Limb|Limb|Limb|2015|p=24–26}} In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, "doc", "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds were more likely to be [[radiology|radiologists]] than [[dermatology|dermatologists]].{{sfn|Abel|2010|p=65}} Two separate studies by Krajick and Neimi in 2005, both analysing large samples of names of scientists, showed 1.35% of geologists having names referring to their field, and in political science, 1.26%.{{sfn|Krajick|2005|p=15}}{{sfn|Neimi|2005|p=13}}

As for Casler's third possible explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, but it was not statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5433">'''Parity of esteem''' is a concept which can be applied in a variety of contexts.

==As a political philosophy==
Parity of esteem can be used to establish a theory to overcome inter-communal conflict. Promoters of the theory argue that ''"parity of esteem"'' "offers a language for negotiation of a post-conflict equilibrium". This negotiation begins with the communities recognising the stalemate of their position. Rather than continue trying to out-do each other, the communities should attempt to negotiate a peaceful coexistence in a shared physical space despite their cultural differences.

''"Parity of esteem"'' can be described as a [[Age of Enlightenment|post-Enlightenment]] theory as it differs drastically from classical [[Liberalism|liberal]] or [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[rationalism]] and is contrary to 20th-century ideas of "[[self-determination]]" or the 19th-century idea of the [[nation-state]]. Many of these anticipated a "withering away of [[nationalism]]" once minorities were brought within the nation-state. These concepts are today the most dominant within contemporary political theory. As [[Ernest Gellner]] writes, "the idea that political boundaries must be congruent with ethnic ones, that rulers must not be ethnically distinguishable from the ruled now has a salience and authority which it has never possessed in the previous history of mankind". Where Enlightenment theories addressed issues of inter-communal conflict, it did so either by promoting "non-sectarianism" against "tribalism" (liberalism) or emphasising "class politics" against "[[bourgeois nationalism]]" (Marxism). Neither of these approaches recognised the traditions of belligerents in inter-communal conflicts. ''"Parity of esteem"'' on the other hand can accepts various nationalist traditions within one state.

Interest in ''"parity of esteem"'' approaches emerged during the mid-1980s and accelerated following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the early 1990s. It was recognised that while there were 184 independent states, there were more than 600 living [[Language family|language groups]] and more than 5,000 [[ethnic groups]]. Simply put, without enough [[Geo-politics|geo-political space]], slogans such as the Serb nationalist claim for "All Serbs in One State" were simply unworkable. Since the end of the 1990s, ''"Parity of esteem"'' is a core concept to the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].

==Health care==
''"Parity of Esteem for Mental Health"'' is an issue for many [[healthcare system]]s because of the pervasive [[Mental disorder#Stigma and discrimination|stigma of mental illness]]. People with diagnosed mental illness die on average around 20 years earlier than those without such a diagnosis, some because of suicide, but mostly because of poorly treated physical illness. Mental illness has been assessed as constituting around a quarter of the [[disease burden]] in developed countries.  There is much bigger [[Global mental health#Treatment gap|treatment gap]] for mental illness than for physical illness.  

In the USA legislation was enacted in 2006 which attempted to achieve equality in health insurance coverage between surgical treatment and mental health treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parity of Esteem for Mental Health|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-485/POST-PN-485.pdf|accessdate=13 September 2015|issue=485|publisher=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the UK [[Norman Lamb]] campaigned for mental health to be given parity of esteem with physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norfolk MP Norman Lamb defeated by Tim Farron in his bid to lead the LiberalD emocrats|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/norfolk_mp_norman_lamb_defeated_by_tim_farron_in_his_bid_to_lead_the_liberal_democrats_1_4156211|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] proposed that parity of esteem should be defined as "Valuing mental health equally with physical health". In practice most arguments have been centred on levels of funding.  Expenditure on mental health services provided by NHS trusts fell by around 8.25% between 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health trust funding down 8% from 2010 despite coalition’s drive for parity of esteem|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/03/20/mental-health-trust-funding-8-since-2010-despite-coalitions-drive-parity-esteem/|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Community Care|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr Phil Moore chair of the Mental Health Commissioners Network at NHS Clinical Commissioners discussions in 2016 had degenerated into a funding dispute.  He wanted to see discussions about the degree to which mental health is embedded into other services, including the integration of psychological services with general practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal||title=\CCG deputy chair urges commissioners to refocus 'parity of esteeem'talks|journal=Commissioning Review|issue=Summer 2016|pages=36-38|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9833">A '''perennial calendar''' is a [[calendar]] that applies to any [[year]], keeping the same [[Calendar date|date]]s, [[weekdays]] and other features.

Perennial calendar systems differ from most widely used calendars which are [[annual calendar]]s. Annual calendars include features particular to the year represented, and expire at the year's end. A perennial calendar differs also from a [[perpetual calendar]], which is a tool or reference to compute the weekdays of dates for any given year, or for representing a wide range of annual calendars.

For example, most representations of the [[Gregorian calendar]] year include weekdays and are therefore annual calendars, because the weekdays of its dates vary from year to year. For this reason, proposals to perennialize the Gregorian calendar typically introduce one or another scheme for fixing its dates on the same weekdays every year.

== History and background ==
The term ''perennial calendar'' appeared as early as 1824, in the title of
[[Thomas Ignatius Maria Forster]]'s ''Perennial calendar and companion to the almanack.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ignatius M. Forster, 
Perennial calendar and companion to the almanack
(London: Harding, Mavor and Lepard, 1824)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In that work he compiled "the events of every day in the year, as 
connected with history, chronology, botany, natural history, astronomy, 
popular customes and antiquities, with useful rules of health, 
observations on the weather, explanations of the feasts and festivals
of the church and other miscellaneous useful information." The data listed there for each date in the calendar apply in every year, and supplement data to be found in annual almanacs. Often printed in perennial-calendar format also are book blanks for diaries, ledgers and logs, for use in any year. Entries on the blank pages of these books are organized by calendar dates, without reference to weekdays or year numbers.

== Calendar reform ==
A goal of modern [[calendar reform]] has been to achieve universal acceptance of a 
perennial calendar, with dates fixed always on the same weekdays, so the same calendar table serves year after year. 
Advantages claimed for a perennial over an annualized calendar like the Gregorian are simplicity
and regularity. Scheduling is simplified for institutions and industries 
with extended production cycles. School terms and breaks, for example, can fall annually
on the same dates. Month-based ordinal dating ("Fourth Thursday in November",
"Last Monday in May") will be obsolete. Two methods favored for perennializing the calendar are the introduction of so-called "blank days," and of a periodic "leap week."

=== Blank-day calendars ===
Blank-day calendars remove a day or two (the latter for leap years) from the weekday cycle, resulting in a year length of 364 weekdays. Since this number is 
evenly divisible by 7, every year can begin on the same weekday. In the twelve-month plan of [[The World Calendar]], for example, the Gregorian year-end date of December 31 is sequestered from the cycle of the week and 
celebrated as "Worldsday." December 30 falls on a Saturday, Worldsday follows next, and then January 1 begins every new year on a Sunday. The extra day in [[leap year]] is treated similarly. Blank-day calendars with thirteen months have also been developed. Among them are: The Georgian calendar, by Hirossa Ap-Iccim (=[[Hugh Jones (reverend)|Rev. Hugh Jones]]) (1745);&lt;ref&gt;Hirossa Ap-Iccim, 
[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=1&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1745.7.x.15.x.x.377 "An Essay on the British Computation of  Time, Coins, Weights, and Measures, and a Proposal for a New Georgian &amp;#198;ra, not to Err a  Day in 10,000 Years,"] ''The Gentleman’s Magazine,'' 15 (1745): 377-379&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Positivist calendar]], by [[Auguste Comte]] (1849); and the [[International Fixed Calendar]], 
by [[Moses B. Cotsworth]] (1902),&lt;ref&gt;Moses B. Cotsworth, 
''The rational almanac: tracing the evolution of modern almanacs from ancient ideas of time, and suggesting improvements'' (Acomb, England:Cotsworth, 1905)&lt;/ref&gt; and championed by [[George Eastman]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Parker Stockbridge, "New Calendar by 1933 -- Eastman," ''Popular Science Monthly'' (June 1929): 32&lt;/ref&gt; Blank-day reform proposals face a religious objection, however. [[Seventh-day Sabbatarianism|Sabbatarians]], who are obliged to regard every seventh day as a day of rest and worship, must observe their holy day on a different weekday each year.

=== Leap-week calendars ===
[[Leap week calendar]] plans often restrict common years to 364 days, or 
52 weeks, and expand leap years to 371 days, or 53 weeks. The added week 
may extend an existing month, or it may stand alone as an inserted seven-day 
month.

The leap-week calendar may have been conceived originally by  [http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/Searle.html Rev. George M. Searle] (1839-1918), around 1905. In 1930, James A. Colligan, S.J. proposed a thirteen-month reform, the [[Pax Calendar]]. By 1955, Cecil L. Woods proposed the twelve-month Jubilee Calendar which inserts an extra week called "Jubilee" before
January in specified years.&lt;ref&gt;
Elisabeth Achelis, [http://www.TheWorldCalendar.org/Leap-WeeksNotPractical.pdf "OCCASIONAL  LEAP-WEEKS NOT PRACTICAL,"] ''The Journal of Calendar Reform,'' 25 (Dec. 1955-Jan. 1956): 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]] (2003) inserts an extra year-end month of seven 
days called "Xtra," and the [[Symmetry454]] calendar (circa 2004) lengthens the month of December by one week on leap years.

==== Easter in Leap-week calendars ====
The Christian celebration of [[Easter#Date|Easter]] is [[Computus|historically calculated]] to occur on the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon falling on or after 21 March. In leap-week calendars, March 21 is less likely to match astronomical spring equinox than in the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Cohen, 
"Adoption and Reform of the Gregorian Calendar,"
in Deanna Haunsperger, Stephen Kennedy, eds., 
''The edge of the universe: celebrating 10 years of Math horizons'' 
(Washington, D.C.: Mathematical Association of America, 2006), pp. 129-134&lt;/ref&gt; The Symmetry454 calendar proposes Sunday, April 7 as a permanently fixed date for Easter, based on the median date of the Sunday after the day of the astronomical lunar opposition that is on or after the day of the astronomical northward equinox, calculated for the meridian of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bromberg|first1=Irv|title=The Symmetry010 Calendar|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/classic.htm|website=Symmetry454 and Symmetry010 Calendars, Kalendis Calculator, and more|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 the Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican declared:

{{Quote|text="[The Vatican] would not object if the feast of Easter were assigned to a particular Sunday of the Gregorian Calendar... [and] does not oppose efforts designed to introduce a perpetual calendar into civil society." |author=Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican |source=''CONSTITUTION  ON THE SACRED LITURGY  SACROSANCTUM CONCILIUM  SOLEMNLY PROMULGATED BY  HIS HOLINESS POPE PAUL VI  ON DECEMBER 4, 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montini|first1=Giovanni|title=CONSTITUTION  ON THE SACRED LITURGY  SACROSANCTUM CONCILIUM  SOLEMNLY PROMULGATED BY  HIS HOLINESS POPE PAUL VI  ON DECEMBER 4, 1963|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html|website=Sacrosanctum concilium - La Santa Sede|publisher=Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' }}

==== Determining Leap Weeks ====
In the Pax Calendar, the extra week is added in every year having its last number, or its last 
two numbers, divisible by 6, and in every year ending with the number 99, 
and every centennial year not divisible by 400. The Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar's leap week occurs every year that either begins or ends in a Thursday on the corresponding Gregorian calendar. The Symmetry454 calendar's leap week formula was chosen over others based on 10 criteria, including smoothest distribution of weeks, minimal "jitter" and predicted accuracy of 4-5 millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bromberg|first1=Irv|title=Solar Calendar Leap Rules|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/leap/index.htm|website=Symmetry454 and Symmetry010 Calendars, Kalendis Calculator, and more|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Objections ====
Objections to leap weeks include the inconvenience of a periodic extra week
for billing and payment cycles, and for dividing the leap year into 
halves and quarters. Another objection is that anniversaries, such as birthdays, are more likely on average to occur on a leap week than a leap day.

=== Other options ===
Besides blank-day and leap-week reforms only a few other options
for achieving a perennial calendar have been suggested. [http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/lspc.html The Long-Sabbath Calendar],
by Rick McCarty (1996), extends to thirty-six hours the last Saturday of the year and 
the subsequent first Sunday of the new year. Seventy-two hours are thereby
covered with two weekdays instead of the usual three, which shortens the year  
to 364 calendar days without interrupting the weekday cycle. Another option would trim every year to exactly 364 days, allowing the calendar 
months to drift relative to the seasons. January would move from mid-winter 
to mid-summer, in the northern hemisphere, after approximately 150 
years. The calendar year can be reckoned to drift though all the seasons once every 294 calendar years equal to 293 years of 365.2423208... days.

{{IPA notice}}
'''Phonotactics''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''phōnḗ'' "voice, sound" and ''tacticós'' "having to do with arranging")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|fwnh/|φωνή}}, {{LSJ|taktiko/s|τακτικός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of [[phonology]] that deals with restrictions in a [[language]] on the permissible combinations of [[phoneme]]s. Phonotactics defines permissible [[syllable]] structure, [[consonant cluster]]s and [[vowel]] sequences by means of ''phonotactic constraints''.

Phonotactic constraints are highly language specific. For example, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], consonant clusters like {{IPA|/st/}} do not occur. Similarly, the clusters {{IPA|/kn/}} and {{IPA|/ɡn/}} are not permitted at the beginning of a word in Modern English but are in [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (in which the latter appears as {{IPA|/ɣn/}}) and were permitted in [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]]. In contrast, in some [[Slavic languages]] /l/ and /r/ are used alongside vowels as syllable nuclei.

Syllables have the following internal segmental structure:
* [[Syllable onset|Onset]] (optional)
* [[Syllable rhyme|Rhyme]] (obligatory, comprises nucleus and coda):
** [[Syllable nucleus|Nucleus]] (obligatory)
** [[Syllable coda|Coda]] (optional)

Both onset and coda may be empty, forming a vowel-only syllable, or alternatively, the nucleus can be occupied by a [[syllabic consonant]]. Phonotactics is known to affect [[second language]] [[vocabulary acquisition]].{{sfn|Laufer|1997}}

==English phonotactics==
{{main article|English phonology#Phonotactics}}

The English syllable (and word) ''twelfths'' {{IPA|/twɛlfθs/}} is divided into the onset {{IPA|/tw/}}, the nucleus {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and the coda {{IPA|/lfθs/}}; thus, it can be described as CCVCCCC (C = consonant, V = vowel). On this basis it is possible to form rules for which representations of phoneme classes may fill the cluster. For instance, English allows at most three consonants in an onset, but among native words under standard accents (and excluding a few obscure learned words such as ''sphragistics''), phonemes in a three-consonantal onset are limited to the following scheme:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal |first=David |authorlink=David Crystal |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-53033-0 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{IPA|/s/}} + [[stop consonant|stop]] + [[approximant consonant|approximant]]:
:*{{IPA|/s/}} + {{IPA|/m/}} + {{IPA|/j/}}
:*{{IPA|/s/}} + {{IPA|/t/}} + {{IPA|/ɹ/}}
:*{{IPA|/s/}} + {{IPA|/t/}} + {{IPA|/j/}} (not in most accents of [[American English]])
:*{{IPA|/s/}} + {{IPA|/p/}} + {{IPA|/j ɹ l/}}
:*{{IPA|/s/}} + {{IPA|/k/}} + {{IPA|/j ɹ l w/}}

This constraint can be observed in the pronunciation of the word ''blue'': originally, the vowel of ''bl'''ue''''' was identical to the vowel of ''c'''ue''''', approximately {{IPA|[iw]}}. In most dialects of English, {{IPA|[iw]}} shifted to {{IPA|[juː]}}. Theoretically, this would produce **{{IPA|[bljuː]}}. The cluster {{IPA|[blj]}}, however, infringes the constraint for three-consonantal onsets in English. Therefore, the pronunciation has been reduced to {{IPA|[bluː]}} by [[elision]] of the {{IPA|[j]}} in what is known as [[yod-dropping]].

Not all languages have this constraint: compare [[Spanish language|Spanish]] '''''pli'''egue'' {{IPA|[ˈpljeɣe]}} or [[French language|French]] '''''plu'''ie'' {{IPA|[plɥi]}}.

Constraints on English phonotactics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harley |first1=Heidi |authorlink1=Heidi Harley |title=English Words: A Linguistic Introduction |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year=2003 |isbn=0631230327 |pages=58–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* All syllables have a nucleus
* No [[geminate]]s
* No onset {{IPA|/ŋ/}}
* No {{IPA|/h/}} in the [[syllable coda]]
* No [[affricate]]s in complex onsets
* The first consonant in a complex onset must be an [[obstruent]]
* The second consonant in a complex onset must not be a voiced obstruent
* If the first consonant in a complex onset is not an /s/, the second must be a [[Liquid consonant|liquid]] or a [[Glide consonant|glide]]
* Every subsequence contained within a sequence of consonants must obey all the relevant phonotactic rules (the substring principle)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harley |first1=Heidi |authorlink1=Heidi Harley |title=Understanding Morphology |publisher=[[Hodder Education]] |year=2010 |isbn=0340950013 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No glides in codas
* If there is a complex coda, the second consonant must not be {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, or {{IPA|/ð/}}
* If the second consonant in a complex coda is voiced, so is the first
* Non-alveolar nasals must be [[Homorganic consonant|homorganic]] with the next segment
* Two obstruents in the same coda must share [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]]

==Sonority Sequencing Principle==
{{main|Sonority Sequencing Principle}}
Segments of a syllable are universally distributed following what is called the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP), which states that, in any syllable, the nucleus has maximal sonority and that sonority decreases as you move away from the nucleus. Sonority is a measure of the amplitude of a speech sound. The particular ranking of each speech sound by sonority, called the [[sonority hierarchy]], is language-specific, but, in its broad lines, hardly varies from a language to another,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jany|first=Carmen|last2=Gordon|first2=Matthew|last3=Nash|first3=Carlos M|last4=Takara|first4=Nobutaka|date=2007-01-01|title=HOW UNIVERSAL IS THE SONORITY HIERARCHY?: A CROSS-LINGUISTIC ACOUSTIC STUDY|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242234684_HOW_UNIVERSAL_IS_THE_SONORITY_HIERARCHY_A_CROSS-LINGUISTIC_ACOUSTIC_STUDY|journal=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means all languages form their syllables in approximately the same way with regards to sonority.

To illustrate the SSP, the [[voiceless alveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[s]}} is lower on the sonority hierarchy than the [[alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l]}}, so the combination {{IPA|/sl/}} is permitted in onsets and {{IPA|/ls/}} is permitted in codas, but {{IPA|/ls/}} is not allowed in onsets and {{IPA|/sl/}} is not allowed in codas. Hence ''slips'' {{IPA|/slɪps/}} and ''pulse'' {{IPA|/pʌls/}} are possible English words while ''*lsips'' and ''*pusl'' are not.

The SSP expresses a very strong cross-linguistic tendency, however, it does not account for the patterns of all complex syllable margins.{{explain|What is a "margin"?|date=August 2018}} It may be violated in two ways: the first occurs when two segments in a margin have the same sonority, which is known as a ''sonority plateau''. Such margins are found in a few languages, including English, as in the words ''sphinx'' and ''fact''.

The second instance of violation of the SSP is when a peripheral segment of a margin has a higher sonority than a segment closer to the nucleus. These margins are known as reversals and occur in some languages including English (''steal''  {{IPA|[stiːɫ]}}, ''bets''  {{IPA|/bɛts/}}) or French (''dextre'' {{IPA|/dɛkstʁ/}}, ''strict'' {{IPA|/stʁikt/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlisle|first=Robert S.|date=2001-06-01|title=Syllable structure universals and second language acquisition|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27338244_Syllable_structure_universals_and_second_language_acquisition|journal=ResearchGate|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.6018/ijes.1.1.47581|issn=1578-7044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">A '''radio latino''' is a measuring instrument used in surveying and military engineering starting in the 16th century.  It gets its name from the inventor, [[Latino Orsini (diplomat)|Latino Orsini]].  The radio latino can be considered a kind of [[geometric square]].&lt;ref&gt;Daumas, Maurice,  ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a general purpose instrument that could be used for a variety of angular measurements as well as depth and inside dimension measures.

==Usage==
[[File:radio latino.png|thumb|Drawing of a radio latino. The red lines represent viewing angles from the outermost components and the green lines are viewing angles from the end to the outer points on the frame. The diagram leaves out the handle on the free end of the main rod.]]

The slider (blue in the adjacent diagram) could move along the central rod, causing the [[Kite (geometry)|deltoid]] formed by four other rods to change shape symmetrically.  The end points of the rods had sights on them, allowing various sight lines to be defined.  The central rod was [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] with various scales.  These scales allowed the angles between the end rods (represented by the red lines in the diagram) to be determined as well as the angle with its [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] at one end of the main rod and sides (represented by the green lines in the diagram) through the outer joints of the rods.

With different graduations, one could determine or lay out:
*angles between sight lines with a degree scale.
*internal angles of [[regular polygon]]s with polygon scales.
*internal diameters and dimensions (such as the inside bore of a cannon) using the distance between the outer joints (represented by the grey dimension lines in the diagram) using a length scale.
*gun elevations for cannon.
*heights of objects by measuring angles.
*[[shadow square]] calculations.
*depths from the free end of the main rod to the slider.

When folded, the radio latino would resemble a sword and was stored in a sheath or [[scabbard]].

==Construction==
The radio latino was usually constructed of [[brass]].  The central, main rod was graduated with multiple scales.  The free end of the main rod had a handle attached.  Within the handle, a small compass was mounted.

The two end-most side rods were shorter than the two attached to the slider.  This permitted the end rods to be set to any angle up to 180°.  The slider could move along the main rod and was used as an index for reading the engraved scales.

Each hinged vertex had a sighting vane.  This permitted the instrument to be used to measure or lay out angles or other dimensions visually.

'''Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media''' ('''RRCHNM'''), formerly the '''Center for History and New Media''' ('''CHNM''') is a research institution in the [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] specializing in history and information technology. It was established by [[Roy Rosenzweig]] in 1994 to research and use [[digital media]] and [[information technology]] in [[history|historical]] research, education, digital tools and resources, [[digital preservation]], and outreach.

== Digital preservation ==
[[File:Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media F.jpg|thumb|right|Center for History and New Media Offices]]
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the Center for History and New Media in partnership with the American Social History Project at the [[City University of New York]] organized the September 11 Digital Archive with funding from the [[Alfred P. Sloan]] Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| dead-url     = no

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the September 11 Digital Archive, CHNM and ASHP utilized electronic media to collect, preserve, and present the past, with a digital repository of material including more than 150,000 first-hand accounts, emails, images, and other digital materials.  This project has inspired a new project, the Hurricane Digital Memory Bank, which is collecting the stories and digital artefacts related to the [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]], and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| dead-url     = no

}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHNM continues to explore methods, tools, and technologies for archiving and preserving information, data, and documents digitally.

== Educational resources ==
The Center for History and New Media worked in partnership with the American Social History Project (ASHP) at the City University of New York, to develop an online resource directed at [[History of the United States|American History]] teachers, along with online resources about the [[French Revolution]].  More recent projects have focused on developing online educational resources about [[World History]], and a project on historical thinking, in partnership with the [[Smithsonian Institution]]’s [[National Museum of American History]].  CHNM is also involved with educational outreach with teachers in [[Virginia]] school districts.

CHNM has also developed a number of online databases and other resources for historians and history teachers, including a listing of 1,200 history departments worldwide, a practical guide to Digital History, a collection of essays on history and new media.  Another online database is Making the History of 1989, which chronicles the fall of [[communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| archive-date = June 28, 2011
| dead-url     = no

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created in collaboration with the [[German Historical Institute]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the 1989 Project is powered by CHNM's [[Omeka]] software, and includes resources for teachers and students, ranging from lesson plans to an [[archive]] of [[primary source]] materials.

CHNM collaborated with the [[Jewish Women's Archive]] on Katrina's Jewish Voices, a virtual archive of stories, images, and reflections about the New Orleans and Gulf Coast Jewish communities before and after Hurricane Katrina.

== Software resources ==
[[File:Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media A - Stierch.jpg|thumb|right|Community area of the center]]
CHNM is responsible for the development of two notable [[Open-source software|open source]] software projects: [[Zotero]] and [[Omeka]]. [[Zotero]] is [[reference management software]] which is used by [[academia|academics]] to read and cite the [[Academic publishing|academic literature]]. [[Omeka]] is a [[content management system]] that uses the [[Dublin Core]] metadata standard to build digital collections and publish digital exhibits. Both projects are free, and reflect CHNM's dedication to democratizing the practice of history.

The Center for History and New Media also distributes a set of free additional digital tools for historians and teachers, including Web Scrapbook, Survey Builder, Scribe (a note taking application designed with historians in mind), Poll Builder, H-Bot (an automated historical fact finder), and Syllabus Finder, which allows you to find and compare syllabi from thousands of universities and colleges on any topic, using the [[Google]] search engine.

In 2017, with financial support of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], CHNM released Tropy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship ==
Projects like Zotero provide tools for historians to research and analyze the past. But will digital media change the nature of scholarly argument, communication, and publication? In order to encourage experimentation in this arena, American Quarterly in collaboration with the American Studies Crossroads Project and CHNM organized an experiment in hypertext publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Imaging the French Revolution is another experiment in digital scholarship. In a series of essays, seven scholars analyze forty-two images of crowds and crowd violence in the French Revolution. Offering the most relevant examples and comments from an on-line forum, those same scholars consider issues of interpretation, methodology, and the impact of digital media on scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Sanganakallu''' ({{Lang-kn | ಸಂಗನಕಲ್ಲು  }}) is an ancient archaeological site from the Neolithic period (circa 3000 BC). It is approximately 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bellary]] in [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is a group of hills south of a horseshoe shaped valley, with Kupgal to the north.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stone Age Cultures of Bellary|last=Subbarao|first=Bendapudi|publisher=Dr. S. M. Katre|year=1948|isbn=|location=Deccan College Postgraduate and Research Institute|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest settlements in [[South India]], spread over 1,000 acres.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a layer of red-brown [[Fossil|fossilized]] soil spread over Sanganakallu and Kupgal that can be dated back to 9000 BC.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Prehistory and Protohistory of India and Pakistan|last=Sankalia|first=H. D.|publisher=|year=1974|isbn=|location=Deccan College Postgraduate and Research Institute, Poona|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is considered to be a [[neolithic]] factory site due to the surface excavation revealing large numbers of pottery, stone axes, and other [[Stone tool|stone tools]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The site was first majorly excavated in 1946, by Bendapudi Subbarao, on Sannarasamma hill.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Subbarao divided their culture into 3 phases:&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Pre-[[Mesolithic]], the phase when Sanganakallu was first settled, had little pottery, and the people made crude [[Microlith|microliths]].
* [[Mesolithic]], the phase when pottery was handmade and stone axes were mass produced.
* [[Neolithic]], the phase when pottery and tools became more sophisticated.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
Sanganakallu was excavated again in 1964.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Excavation at Sangankallu, 1964-65|last=Ansari|first=Zainuddin|last2=Rao|first2=M. S.|publisher=|year=1969|isbn=|location=Poona|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
The earliest tools excavated were hundreds of [[patinated]] [[Lithic flake|flakes]] made of [[basalt]], and [[quartz]] [[Lithic flake|flakes]].&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; In the later Mesolithic phase is when tool making became more abundant.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Stone axes, [[Hammerstone|hammer stones]], [[Chisel|chisels]], picks, slick-stones, and [[Sling (weapon)|sling stones]] were excavated.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The axes were found in many different shapes. There were oval shaped, triangular shaped, or rectangular shaped axes and some were axes were rounded and some were thin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The sheer number of [[Microlith|microliths]] is the reason Sanganakallu is considered a factory site.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Pottery ==
The first pottery started showing up in Mesolithic phase. The pottery was usually dull brown or black, and hand-made out of course clay.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Pale-gray pots made of fine clay mixed with [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[mica]] were also excavated.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The pottery from the later [[Megalith|Neolithic]] period were more fine, thin, and polished.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They were all burnt and wheel turned.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The ornamental pottery was decorated in a finger groove pattern and a few shards were found painted purple.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; A few pots were perforated and the significance of that is not yet known.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== 1964 excavation ==
In this excavation, a one room Neolithic circular house was excavated.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The wall was made with bamboo and clay and the floor was covered in potholes.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; There was a hearth in the center of the house, and there is evidence of it being burned.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Other than the house structure, a few [[terracotta]] figurines in the shape of birds or bulls were also found as well as more [[Stone tool|stone tools]] and pottery.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Animal remains were also collected, the majority of which were cow bones.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Earliest agriculturists==
The people who settled at Sanganakallu were early agriculturists, who cultivated small [[Millet|millets]] and [[Legume|pulses]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They kept sheep, cattle, and had separate areas for dumping dung ([[Neolithic ashmounds (India)|ash mounds]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Writer==

Hutin was a writer of many books on the occult and esoteric, he wrote about [[Freemasonry]], [[secret societies]], [[Rosicrucianism]], [[alchemy]] and [[astrology]] and many other occult topics.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Stavish, Freemasonry: Rituals, Symbols &amp; History of the Secret Society, 2007, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Birksted, Le Corbusier and the occult, 2009, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Hutin wrote about the [[Kabbalah]] and claimed that [[Isaac Newton]] was a Christian Kabbalist.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Goldish, Judaism in the theology of Sir Isaac Newton, 1998 p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutin is most well known in [[UFO]] circles for his [[ancient astronaut]] book called ''Alien Races and Fantastic Civilizations'' (1975) in which he claimed ancient civilizations across the earth were colonial outposts built by [[extraterrestrials]]. The book was similar to books by other authors of the time such as [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Jean Sendy]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana G. Tumminia, Alien worlds: social and religious dimensions of extraterrestrial contact, 2007, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan J. Palmer, Aliens adored: Raël's UFO religion, 2004, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Hutin also wrote about [[Atlantis]] and gave a lot of credit to [[Plato]] for writing about it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25877">'''Sociotechnical  systems''' ('''STS''') in [[organizational development]] is an approach to complex organizational [[work design]] that recognizes the interaction between [[people]] and [[technology]] in [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]s. The term also refers to the interaction between society's complex infrastructures and human behaviour. In this sense, society itself, and most of its substructures, are complex sociotechnical systems. The term sociotechnical systems was coined by [[Eric Trist]], Ken Bamforth and [[Fred Emery]], in the World War II era, based on their work with workers in English coal mines at the [[Tavistock Institute]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Susan Long|title=Socioanalytic Methods: Discovering the Hidden in Organisations and Social Systems|isbn=1780491328}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sociotechnical systems pertains to theory regarding the social aspects of [[people]] and [[society]] and technical aspects of organizational structure and processes. Here, technical does not necessarily imply material technology. The focus is on procedures and related knowledge, i.e. it refers to the ancient Greek term ''[[techne]]''. "Technical" is a term used to refer to structure and a broader sense of technicalities.  Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of ''social'' and ''technical'' aspects of an [[organization]] or the [[society]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;For the latter, see the use of ''sociotechnical'' in the works of sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]] and philosopher [[Günter Ropohl]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sociotechnical theory therefore is about ''joint optimization'', with a shared emphasis on achievement of both excellence in technical performance and quality in people's work lives.  Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimisation. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organisation, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing.

==Overview==
Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of ''social'' and ''technical'' aspects of an [[organization]].  Sociotechnical theory is founded on two main principles:
* One is that the [[Social interaction|interaction]] of social and technical factors creates the conditions for successful (or unsuccessful) organizational [[performance]].  This interaction consists partly of [[linear]] "cause and effect" relationships (the relationships that are normally "designed") and partly from "[[non-linear]]", [[Complexity|complex]], even unpredictable relationships (the good or bad relationships that are often unexpected).  Whether designed or not, both types of interaction occur when socio and technical elements are put to work.
* The corollary of this, and the second of the two main principles, is that optimization of each aspect alone (socio or technical) tends to increase not only the quantity of unpredictable, "un-designed" relationships, but those relationships that are injurious to the system's performance.

Therefore, sociotechnical theory is about ''joint optimization'',&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R., &amp; Foster, M. (1971). Sociotechical systems. American Psychologist, 26, 467-474. &lt;/ref&gt; that is, designing the social system and technical system in tandem so that they work smoothly together.  Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimization. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organization, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing, rather than the all too often case of new technology failing to meet the expectations of designers and users alike.

The scientific literature shows terms like ''sociotechnical'' all one word, or ''socio-technical'' with a hyphen, ''sociotechnical theory'', ''sociotechnical system'' and ''sociotechnical systems theory''. All of these terms appear ubiquitously but their actual meanings often remain unclear. The key term "sociotechnical" is something of a [[buzzword]] and its varied usage can be unpicked.  What can be said about it, though, is that it is most often used to simply, and quite correctly, describe any kind of organization that is composed of people and technology. But, predictably, there is more to it than that.

==Principles==
Some of the central principles of sociotechnical theory were elaborated in a seminal paper by [[Eric Trist]] and [[Ken Bamforth]] in 1951{{Human Relations; Feb1951, Vol. 4 Issue 1, p3-38, 36p}}. This is an interesting case study which, like most of the work in sociotechnical theory, is focused on a form of 'production system' expressive of the era and the contemporary technological systems it contained.  The study was based on the paradoxical observation that despite improved technology, productivity was falling, and that despite better pay and amenities, absenteeism was increasing.  This particular rational organisation had become irrational.  The cause of the problem was hypothesized to be the adoption of a new form of production technology which had created the need for a bureaucratic form of organization (rather like classic command-and-control).  In this specific example, technology brought with it a retrograde step in organizational design terms.  The analysis that followed introduced the terms "socio" and "technical" and elaborated on many of the core principles that sociotechnical theory subsequently became.

===Responsible autonomy===
Sociotechnical theory was pioneering for its shift in emphasis, a shift towards considering teams or groups as the primary unit of analysis and not the individual.  Sociotechnical theory pays particular attention to internal supervision and leadership at the level of the "group" and refers to it as "responsible autonomy".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The overriding point seems to be that having the simple ability of individual team members being able to perform their function is not the only predictor of group effectiveness.  There are a range of issues in team cohesion research, for example, that are answered by having the regulation and leadership internal to a group or team.&lt;ref&gt;Siebold, G. L. (1991). "The evolution of the measurement of cohesion". In: ''Military Psychology'', 11(1), 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

These, and other factors, play an integral and parallel role in ensuring successful teamwork which sociotechnical theory exploits.
The idea of semi-autonomous groups conveys a number of further advantages.  Not least among these, especially in hazardous environments, is the often felt need on the part of people in the organisation for a role in a small primary group.  It is argued that such a need arises in cases where the means for effective communication are often somewhat limited.  As Carvalho&lt;ref&gt;P.V.R. Carvalho (2006). "Ergonomic field studies in a nuclear power plant control room". In: ''Progress in Nuclear Energy'', 48, pp. 51-69&lt;/ref&gt;  states, this is because "...operators use verbal exchanges to produce continuous, redundant and recursive interactions to successfully construct and maintain individual and mutual awareness...". The immediacy and proximity of trusted team members makes it possible for this to occur. The [[coevolution]] of technology and organizations brings with it an expanding array of new possibilities for novel interaction.  Responsible autonomy could become more distributed along with the team(s) themselves.

The key to responsible autonomy seems to be to design an organization possessing the characteristics of small groups whilst preventing the "silo-thinking" and "stovepipe" neologisms of contemporary management theory.  In order to preserve "...intact the loyalties on which the small group [depend]...the system as a whole [needs to contain] its bad in a way that [does] not destroy its good".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; In practice,&lt;ref&gt;A. Rice (1958). ''Productivity and social organisation: The Ahmedabad experiment''.  London: Tavistock.&lt;/ref&gt; this requires groups to be responsible for their own internal regulation and supervision, with the primary task of relating the group to the wider system falling explicitly to a group leader.  This principle, therefore, describes a strategy for removing more traditional command hierarchies.

===Adaptability===
Carvajal&lt;ref&gt;R. Carvajal (1983). "Systemic netfields: the systems' paradigm crises. Part I". In: ''Human Relations'' 36(3), pp.227-246.&lt;/ref&gt; states that "the rate at which uncertainty overwhelms an organisation is related more to its internal structure than to the amount of environmental uncertainty". Sitter in 1997 offered two solutions for organisations confronted, like the military, with an environment of increased (and increasing) complexity:
"The first option is to restore the fit with the external complexity by an increasing internal complexity. ...This usually means the creation of more staff functions or the enlargement of staff-functions and/or the investment in vertical information systems".&lt;ref&gt;Sitter, L. U., Hertog, J. F. &amp; Dankbaar, B., ''From complex organizations with simple jobs to simple organizations with complex jobs'', in: Human Relations, 50(5), 497-536, 1997. p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical information systems are often confused for "network enabled capability" systems (NEC) but an important distinction needs to be made, which Sitter et al. propose as their second option:
"...the organisation tries to deal with the external complexity by 'reducing' the internal control and coordination needs. ...This option might be called the strategy of 'simple organisations and complex jobs'". This all contributes to a number of unique advantages.
Firstly is the issue of "human redundancy"&lt;ref&gt;D.M. Clark (2005). "Human redundancy in complex, hazardous systems: A theoretical framework". In: ''Safety Science''. Vol 43. pp. 655-677.&lt;/ref&gt;  in which "groups of this kind were free to set their own targets, so that aspiration levels with respect to production could be adjusted to the age and stamina of the individuals concerned".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; Human redundancy speaks towards the flexibility, ubiquity and pervasiveness of resources within NEC.

The second issue is that of [[complexity]]. Complexity lies at the heart of many organisational contexts (there are numerous organizational paradigms that struggle to cope with it).  Trist and Bamforth (1951) could have been writing about these with the following passage: "A very large variety of unfavourable and changing environmental conditions is encountered ... many of which are impossible to predict.  Others, though predictable, are impossible to alter."&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many type of organisations are clearly motivated by the appealing "industrial age", rational principles of "factory production", a particular approach to dealing with complexity: "In the factory a comparatively high degree of control can be exercised over the complex and moving "figure" of a production sequence, since it is possible to maintain the "ground" in a comparatively passive and constant state".&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt; On the other hand, many activities are constantly faced with the possibility of "untoward activity in the 'ground'" of the 'figure-ground' relationship"&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt; The central problem, one that appears to be at the nub of many problems that "classic" organisations have with complexity, is that "The instability of the 'ground' limits the applicability ... of methods derived from the factory".&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt;

In Classic organisations, problems with the moving "figure" and moving "ground" often become magnified through a much larger social space, one in which there is a far greater extent of hierarchical task interdependence.&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt;  For this reason, the semi-autonomous group, and its ability to make a much more fine grained response to the "ground" situation, can be regarded as "agile".  Added to which, local problems that do arise need not propagate throughout the entire system (to affect the workload and quality of work of many others) because a complex organization doing simple tasks has been replaced by a simpler organization doing more complex tasks.  The agility and internal regulation of the group allows problems to be solved locally without propagation through a larger social space, thus increasing tempo.

===Whole tasks===
Another concept in sociotechnical theory is the "whole task".  A whole task "has the advantage of placing responsibility for the ... task squarely on the shoulders of a single, small, face-to-face group which experiences the entire cycle of operations within the compass of its membership."&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; The Sociotechnical embodiment of this principle is the notion of minimal critical specification.  This principle states that, "While it may be necessary to be quite precise about what has to be done, it is rarely necessary to be precise about how it is done".&lt;ref&gt;A. Cherns (1976). "The principles of sociotechnical design". In: ''Human Relations''. Vol 29(8), pp.783-792. p.786&lt;/ref&gt;  This is no more illustrated by the antithetical example of "working to rule" and the virtual collapse of any system that is subject to the intentional withdrawal of human adaptation to situations and contexts.

The key factor in minimally critically specifying tasks is the responsible autonomy of the group to decide, based on local conditions, how best to undertake the task in a flexible adaptive manner. This principle is isomorphic with ideas like [[effects-based operations]] (EBO). EBO asks the question of what goal is it that we want to achieve, what objective is it that we need to reach rather than what tasks have to be undertaken, when and how. The EBO concept enables the managers to "...manipulate and decompose high level effects. They must then assign lesser effects as objectives for subordinates to achieve. The intention is that subordinates' actions will cumulatively achieve the overall effects desired".&lt;ref&gt;J. Storr (2005). ''A critique of effects-based thinking''. RUSI Journal, 2005. p.33&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the focus shifts from being a scriptwriter for tasks to instead being a designer of behaviours. In some cases, this can make the task of the manager significantly less arduous.

===Meaningfulness of tasks===
Effects-based operations and the notion of a "whole task", combined with adaptability and responsible autonomy, have additional advantages for those at work in the organization.  This is because "for each participant the task has total significance and dynamic closure"&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; as well as the requirement to deploy a multiplicity of skills and to have the responsible autonomy in order to select when and how to do so.  This is clearly hinting at a relaxation of the myriad of control mechanisms found in more classically designed organizations.

Greater interdependence (through diffuse processes such as globalisation) also bring with them an issue of size, in which "the scale of a task transcends the limits of simple [[spatio-temporal pattern|spatio-temporal structure]].  By this is meant conditions under which those concerned can complete a job in one place at one time, i.e., the situation of the face-to-face, or singular group". In other words, in classic organisations the "wholeness" of a task is often diminished by multiple group integration and spatiotemporal disintegration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The group based form of organization design proposed by sociotechnical theory combined with new technological possibilities (such as the internet) provide a response to this often forgotten issue, one that contributes significantly to joint optimisation.

==Topics==
===Sociotechnical system===
A sociotechnical system is the term usually given to any instantiation of socio and technical elements engaged in goal directed behaviour. Sociotechnical systems are a particular expression of sociotechnical theory, although they are not necessarily one and the same thing. Sociotechnical systems theory is a mixture of sociotechnical theory, joint optimisation and so forth and general systems theory. The term sociotechnical [[system]] recognises that organizations have boundaries and that transactions occur within the system (and its sub-systems) and between the wider context and dynamics of the environment. It is an extension of Sociotechnical Theory which provides a richer descriptive and conceptual language for describing, analysing and designing organisations.  A Sociotechnical System, therefore, often describes a 'thing' (an interlinked, systems based mixture of people, technology and their environment) .

===Autonomous work teams===

Autonomous work teams also called self-managed teams, are an alternative to traditional assembly line methods. Rather than having a large number of employees each do a small operation to assemble a product, the employees are organized into small teams, each of which is responsible for assembling an entire product. These teams are self-managed, and are independent of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J. R., &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1980). Work redesign. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job enrichment===
[[Job enrichment]] in organizational development, human resources management, and [[organizational behavior]], is the process of giving the employee a wider and higher level scope of responsibility with increased decision-making authority. This is the opposite of job enlargement, which simply would not involve greater authority.  Instead, it will only have an increased number of duties.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Steers and Lyman W. Porte, ''Motivation and Work Behavior'', 1991. pages 215, 322, 357, 411-413, 423, 428-441 and 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job enlargement===
[[Job enlargement]] means increasing the scope of a [[Job (role)|job]] through extending the range of its job duties and [[Moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. This contradicts the principles of [[Departmentalization|specialisation]] and the [[division of labour]] whereby work is divided into small units, each of which is performed repetitively by an individual worker. Some motivational theories suggest that the boredom and alienation caused by the division of labour can actually cause efficiency to fall.

===Job rotation===
[[Job rotation]] is an approach to management development, where an individual is moved through a schedule of assignments designed to give him or her a breadth of exposure to the entire operation. Job rotation is also practiced to allow qualified employees to gain more insights into the processes of a company and to increase job satisfaction through job variation. The term job rotation can also mean the scheduled exchange of persons in offices, especially in public offices, prior to the end of incumbency or the legislative period. This has been practiced by the [[German green party]] for some time but has been discontinued

===Motivation===
[[Motivation]] in psychology refers to the initiation, direction, intensity and persistence of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Geen, R. G.  (1995), Human motivation: A social psychological approach. Belmont, CA: Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation is a temporal and dynamic state that should not be confused with personality or emotion.  Motivation is having the desire and willingness to do something. A motivated person can be reaching for a long-term goal such as becoming a professional writer or a more short-term goal like learning how to spell a particular word. Personality invariably refers to more or less permanent characteristics of an individual's state of being (e.g., shy, extrovert, conscientious). As opposed to motivation, emotion refers to temporal states that do not immediately link to behavior (e.g., anger, grief, happiness).

===Process improvement===
Process improvement in organizational development is a series of actions taken to identify, analyze and improve existing processes within an [[organization]] to meet new [[goal]]s and objectives. These actions often follow a specific [[methodology]] or [[strategy]] to create successful results.

===Task analysis===
[[Task analysis]] is the analysis of how a task is accomplished, including a detailed description of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, necessary clothing and equipment, and any other unique factors involved in or required for one or more people to perform a given task. This information can then be used for many purposes, such as [[personnel selection]] and [[training]], tool or equipment design, [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] design (e.g., design of [[checklist]]s or [[decision support systems]]) and [[automation]].

===Job design===
[[Job design]] or work design in organizational development is the application of sociotechnical systems principles and techniques to the humanization of work, for example, through [[job enrichment]]. The aims of work design to improved job satisfaction, to improved through-put, to improved quality and to reduced employee problems, e.g., grievances, absenteeism.

===Deliberations===
[[Deliberations]] are key units of analysis in non-linear, knowledge work. They are 'choice points' that move knowledge work forward. As originated and defined by Cal Pava (1983) in a second-generation development of STS theory, deliberations are patterns of exchange and communication to reduce the equivocality of a problematic issue; for example, for systems engineering work, what features to develop in new software. Deliberations are not discrete decisions--they are a more continuous context for decisions. They have 3 aspects: topics, forums, and participants.

[[File:Spoo Close Up 3 lite.jpg|thumb|right|Spoo close-up.]]&lt;!--Fair use rationale: Image clearly "identifies [...] program and its contents", where the focal point of the scene is the subject of the article --&gt;
'''Spoo''' is a fictional foodstuff that served as a running joke within the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' [[science fiction]] television series. In the series' [[fictional universe]], spoo is made from worm-like creatures of the same name and is generally regarded as the most delicious food in the galaxy; the creature itself, however, is regarded with contempt by most species.&lt;ref name=lane /&gt;{{rp|87}} Despite appearing only in a few episodes, spoo was embraced by fans and became part of the series' [[Expanded Universe|extended mythology]].&lt;ref name=lane /&gt;{{rp|86–88}}

==Origins==
Use of the word "spoo" to denote a foodstuff predates ''Babylon 5'', which began airing in 1993. The show's creator [[J. Michael Straczynski]] was a writer for the 1985 cartoon series ''[[She-Ra|She-Ra Princess of Power]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gateway to Trouble|url=http://www.he-man.org/cartoon/episode_reviews/review.php?episodeNumber=PP035|publisher=He-man.org|accessdate=2008-12-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080307163949/http://www.he-man.org/cartoon/episode_reviews/review.php?episodeNumber=PP035 |archivedate = March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a ''Babylon 5'' fan recalled a possible spoo reference from that show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|author=Humble, Ed|date=1994-02-15|title=Spoo...

A couple of real cute (as in wanna drop a truck on them cute) elf-types offer Skeletor a bowl of Spoo."&lt;ref name=HeMan&gt;{{cite web|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Michael Straczynski|url=http://www.he-man.org/cartoon/cmotu-pop/interview-straczynski.shtml|publisher=He-man.org|accessdate=2008-12-11|year=1995 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912112007/http://www.he-man.org/cartoon/cmotu-pop/interview-straczynski.shtml |archivedate = September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spoo appeared in the first episode of ''Babylon 5'', where it was briefly mentioned by the [[Narn]] [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|Ambassador]], [[G'Kar]].&lt;ref name=lane /&gt;{{rp|86–88}} Straczynski, who wrote the episode in question, was asked about spoo by fans on various internet message boards on which he frequently [[Internet marketing and fan influence on Babylon 5|participated]].&lt;ref&gt;Straczynski's use of internet forums is well known. See, for instance: {{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/j.-michael-straczynski/person/19536/biography.html |title= J. Michael Straczynski Biography|work=[[tv.com]]|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]  |accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Straczynski's responses were terse: "Spoo is."&lt;ref name=SpooIs&gt;{{cite web|date=1994-01-27|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-13771|title=Questions for JMS (some spoile|publisher=JMSNews.com (archived from rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated)|accessdate=2008-12-07|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Served chilled."&lt;ref name=MeatJello&gt;{{cite web|date=1996-12-18|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-6932|title=Spoo taste?|publisher=JMSNews.com (archived from [[CompuServe]])|accessdate=2008-12-07|last=Straczynski|first=J. Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of speculation from ''Babylon 5'' [[fandom|fans]], Straczynski finally offered an extensive explanation of the origins and nature of spoo. He said spoo are tiny, pasty, [[mealworm]]-like creatures that travel slowly in herds. Their main behavior is sighing, which "can reportedly induce unparalleled bouts of depression"&lt;ref name=lane /&gt;{{rp|87}} in other creatures. They are raised on ranches and harvested through "whacking". Spoo are regarded with contempt by most [[Civilizations in Babylon 5|species in ''Babylon 5'']]; they "are the only creatures of which the Interstellar Animal Rights Protection League says, simply, 'Kill 'em.'"&lt;ref name=lane /&gt;{{rp|87}} Despite this, they are "generally considered the most delicious food in all of known space".&lt;ref name=lane /&gt;{{rp|87}}

This near-universal delight in the taste of spoo apparently doesn't include human tastes.  In the episode "A View from the Gallery", neither of the two maintenance men, Mack and Bo, find spoo to their liking, despite the high price of the delicacy.

Although mostly relegated to a background role, spoo was a key plot point in the season 5 episode "[[A Tragedy of Telepaths]]". The fact that Narn prefer fresh spoo while the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] prefer it aged was the clue that [[G'Kar]] used to figure out that there was another Narn in the Centauri Royal Palace.&lt;ref name=lane2 /&gt;{{rp|148}} Spoo is referenced in the Straczynski-authored [[open gaming license]]d ''[[Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game|Babylon 5: The Roleplaying Game]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.

The '''Srebarna Nature Reserve''' ({{lang-bg|Природен резерват Сребърна}}, transliterated as ''Priroden rezervat Srebarna'') is a [[nature reserve]] in northeastern [[Bulgaria]] ([[Southern Dobruja]]), near the village of the same name, 18&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Silistra]] and 2&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[Danube]]. It comprises Lake Srebarna and its surroundings and is located on the [[Via Pontica]], a bird migration route between [[Europe]] and [[Africa]].

The reserve embraces 6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of protected area and a buffer zone of 5.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The lake's depth varies from 1 to 3 m. There is a museum constructed, where a collection of stuffed species typical for the reserve is arranged.

== History ==
While Lake Srebarna was studied many times in the past by foreign biologists, the first Bulgarian scientist to take an interest in the area was Aleksi Petrov, who visited the reserve in 1911. In 1913, the whole of Southern Dobrudja was incorporated in [[Romania]], but was returned to Bulgaria in 1940, when the area was visited once again by Petrov to examine the colonies of birds that nest there.

[[Image:Srebarna-lake-Svik.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;View towards the Srebarna reserve&lt;/center&gt;]]
The area was proclaimed a nature reserve in 1948 and is a [[Ramsar site]] since 1975. The reserve was recognized as World Natural Heritage Site under the 1972 Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage and included in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in 1983.

== Legends ==
There are several legends about the origin of the lake's name. The one is about a [[Khan (title)|khan]] named ''Srebrist'', who died in the neighbourhood whilst engaging in an unequal battle with the [[Pechenegs]]. A second one tells about a boat full of silver (''srebro'' in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) along the shores of the lake. According to a third one, which is regarded as most plausible, the name comes from the silvery reflections on the lake's surface during full moon.

== Environment ==

=== Flora ===
[[Image:Stuffed-Pelicans-Srebarna.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pelicans in the museum]]
There are hydrophyte species such as [[Phragmites|reed]] in and around the lake. The reserve is home to 139 plant species, 11 of them are in danger of extinction outside the territory of Srebarna.

=== Fauna ===

A wide variety of fauna exists in the area. 39 mammal, 21 reptile and amphibian and 10 fish species inhabit the reserve, which is most famous for the 179 bird species that nest on its territory, some of which include the [[Dalmatian pelican]], the [[mute swan]], the [[greylag goose]], the [[marsh harrier]], the [[bluethroat]], [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s.

[[File:The Drunkard's Progress - Color.jpg|thumb|{{largethumb}}|The Drunkard's Progress: A lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] supporting the temperance movement, January 1846.]]
The '''Temperance movement in the United States''' is a movement to curb the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. It had a large influence on American politics and society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Today, there are organizations that continue to promote the cause of temperance.&lt;ref name="AckerTracy2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acker|first1=Caroline Jean|last2=Tracy|first2=Sarah W.|title=Altering American Consciousness: The History of Alcohol and Drug Use in the United States, 1800-2000|year=2004|publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]]|language=English|isbn=9781558494251|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Temperance: 1784–1861 ==
[[File:John Jr Wiltberger, Temperance Map, 1838 Cornell CUL PJM 1049 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.4|An early allegorical map of temperance by John Jr Wiltberger, 1838.]]
[[File:Stedman Wright; Rudd, Nathaniel Hanks, Black Valley Rail Road, 1863, Cornell, CUL, PJM 1066 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.4|An allegorical map on temperance, based on the notion of alcohol as a train ride to destruction, the "Black Valley Rail Road" by the Massachusetts Temperance Alliance, 1863.]]
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, various factors contributed to an epidemic of alcoholism that went hand-in-hand with spousal abuse, family neglect, and chronic unemployment. Americans used to drinking lightly alcoholic beverages like cider "from the crack of dawn to the crack of dawn" began ingesting far more alcohol as they drank more of strong, cheap beverages like rum (in the colonial period) and whiskey (in the post-Revolutionary period).&lt;ref name=Rorabaugh&gt;{{cite book|last=W.J.|first=Rorabaugh|title=The Alcohol Republic: An American Tradition |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Alcoholic-Republic-American-Tradition/dp/0195029909|accessdate=October 28, 2012|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-1950-2990-1|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular pressure for cheap and plentiful alcohol led to relaxed [[local ordinance|ordinances]] on alcohol sales.

The Temperance movement sparked to life with [[Benjamin Rush]]'s 1784 tract, ''An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon the Human Body and Mind'', which judged the excessive use of alcohol injurious to physical and psychological health. Apparently influenced by Dr. Rush's ''Inquiry'', about 200 farmers in a [[Connecticut]] community formed a temperance association in 1789 to ban the making of [[whiskey]]. Similar associations were formed in [[Virginia]] in 1800, and [[New York State]] in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade, other temperance organizations were formed in eight states, some being statewide organizations. The young movement allowed for temperate or moderate drinking.  Many leaders of the movement expanded their activities and took positions on observance of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] and other moral issues, and by the early 1820s political in-fighting had stalled the movement.

Some leaders persevered in pressing their cause forward. Americans such as [[Lyman Beecher]], who was a Connecticut minister, had started to lecture his fellow citizens against all use of liquor in 1825. The [[American Temperance Society]] was formed in 1826 and benefited from a renewed interest in religion and morality. Within 12 years it claimed more than 8,000 local groups and over 4,500,000 members. By 1839, 18 temperance journals were being published. Simultaneously, some [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church leaders were beginning to promote temperance. The movement split along two lines in the late 1830s: between moderates allowing some drinking and radicals demanding total abstinence, and between voluntarists relying on moral suasion alone and prohibitionists promoting laws to restrict or ban alcohol. Radicals and prohibitionists dominated many of the largest temperance organizations after the 1830s, and temperance eventually became synonymous with prohibition. In 1838, temperance activists pushed the Massachusetts legislature to pass a law restricting the sale of alcohol in quantities less than fifteen gallons. In the 1840s, numerous states passed laws allowing local voters to determine whether or not liquor licences would be issued in their towns or counties. In the 1850s, 13 states and territories passed statewide prohibitory laws (known as "Maine Laws"). Throughout this period, temperance reformers also tended to support Sunday laws the restricted the sale of alcohol on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy|last=Volk|first=Kyle G.|publisher=Oxford|year=|work=Oxford University Press|isbn=0190609494|location=New York|pages=69–100, 167–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil War dealt the movement a crippling blow. Temperance groups in the South were then weaker than their Northern counterparts and too voluntarist to gain any statewide prohibition law, and the few prohibition laws in the North were repealed by the war's end. Both sides in the war made alcohol sales a part of the war effort by taxing brewers and distillers to finance much of the conflict. The issue of slavery crowded out temperance and temperance groups petered out until they found new life in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;"Yours for the Oppressed": The Life of Jehiel C. Beman

===Temperance Theatre===
Temperance birthed an entire genre of theatre. This was first seen in 1895{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}, as ''The Forgers'', a dramatic poem written by John Blake White, premiered at the Charleston Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina. The next significant temperance drama to debut was titled "Fifteen Years of a Drunkard's Life", written by [[Douglas William Jerrold|Douglas Jerrold]] in 1841. As the movement began to grow and prosper, these dramas became more popular among the general public. ''[[The Drunkard]]'' by W.H. Smith premiered in 1841 in Boston, running for 144 performances before being produced at [[P.T. Barnum]]'s American Museum on lower Broadway. The play was wildly popular and is often credited with the entrance of the temperance narrative into mainstream American theatre. It continued to be a staple of New York's theatre scene all the way until 1875. "The Drunkard" follows the typical format of a temperance drama: the main character has an alcohol-induced downfall, and he restores his life from disarray once he denounces drinking for good at the play's end. Temperance drama continued to grow as a genre of theatre, fostered by the advent of the railroad as a form of transportation. This enabled theatre companies to be much more mobile, traveling from city to city. Temperance drama would even reach as far as the West Coast, as [[David Belasco|David Belasco's]] adaptation of [[Émile Zola]]'s novel "Drink" premiered at the Baldwin Theatre in San Francisco in 1879. The image titled ''The Drunkards Progress'' shown in the top of the article, gives us a representation of the temperance movement. This image depicts the progress of a drunk man, slowly the woman disappears, and the mans night ends in death. This picture shows us that drinking is social but also brings poverty upon people as well as death and loneliness.

===Early victories in Maine===
Maine was an early hotbed of the temperance movement. The world's first '''Total Abstinence Society''' was formed in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] in 1815, and a statewide temperance group formed in 1834.&lt;ref name=PortlandHerald&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bouchard|first1=Kelley|title=When Maine went dry|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2011/10/02/when-maine-went-dry_2011-10-02/|accessdate=January 4, 2016|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups won a major victory in 1838 when they pressured the state legislature to pass the '''Fifteen Gallon Law''', which prohibited the sale of spirits in quantities of less than that amount.&lt;ref name=Gately261&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Ian|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2009|publisher=Gotham Books|location=London|isbn=978-1592404643|pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its practical effect was to make hard liquor available to the wealthy, who were the only ones who could afford such quantities.&lt;ref name=Gately261 /&gt; It was repealed within two years.&lt;ref name=Gately261 /&gt; However, in 1851 the so-called [[Maine law]] passed, which banned the production and sale of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name=PortlandHerald /&gt; Thus Maine became the first "dry" state. However, the law's exception for "medicinal, mechanical and manufacturing purposes" meant that liquor was still available for some.&lt;ref name=PortlandHerald /&gt;

== Second Wave Temperance: 1872–1893 ==
As [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] came to a close in the 1870s, most white reformers grew uninterested in racial equality and invested more energy into temperance.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001), ''Grant'', p. 547&lt;/ref&gt; This period produced various temperance organizations including the prohibitionist [[Women's Christian Temperance Union|Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU, f. 1874) and the voluntarist [[Catholic temperance movement|Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America]] (CTAU, f. 1872). Prohibitionist temperance grew popular in the South as it embraced the "Southern" values of racial hierarchy, gender roles, and honor.&lt;ref name=Coker&gt;{{cite book |last=Coker |first=Joe L. |title=Liquor in the Land of the Lost Cause: Southern White Evangelicals and the Prohibition Movement|location=Lexington, KY |publisher= University of Kentucky Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=Michael A.|title='As Gold Is Tried In The Fire, So Hearts Must Be Tried By Pain': The Temperance Movement in Georgia and the Local Option Law of 1885|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2009|volume=93|issue=1|pages=30–54|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=38120326&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national movement enlisted more religious support throughout the country, especially from evangelicals.

===Temperance education===
In 1873, the WCTU established a [[Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction]] in Schools and Colleges, with [[Mary Hunt]] as National Superintendent. The WCTU was an influential organization with a membership of 120,000 by 1879.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] led the group under the motto "Do Everything" to protect women and children. Some of the changes the WCTU sought included property and custody rights for women, women's suffrage, raising the age of consensual sex, peace arbitration, women's education, and advocacy for working rights of women.&lt;ref name=Christianity1998&gt;Howard Clark Kee, Emily Albu, Carter Lindberg, J. William Frost, Dana L. Robert (1998). ''Christianity: A Social and Cultural History''. 2nd edition. Prentice Hall, River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harriman temperance university abt1906.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard depicting Temperance Hall]]
Because of the correlation between drinking and domestic violence—many drunken husbands abused family members—the temperance movement existed alongside various [[feminism|women's rights]] and other movements, including the [[progressivism|Progressive]] movement, and often the same activists were involved in multiple movements. Many notable voices of the time, ranging from [[Lucy Webb Hayes]] to [[Susan B. Anthony]], were active in temperance. In [[Canada]], [[Nellie McClung]] was a longstanding advocate of temperance. As with most social movements, there was a gamut of activists running from violent ([[Carrie Nation]]) to mild ([[Neal S. Dow]]).

The [[American Temperance University]] opened in 1893 in the planned town of [[Harriman, Tennessee]], which was developed as a community with no alcoholic beverages permitted. In its second year of operation the institution enrolled 345 students from 20 states. However, it closed in 1908.

===Temperance fountains===
{{main|Temperance fountain}}
Muddied and ill-tasting drinking water encouraged many Americans to drink alcohol for health purposes, so temperance groups constructed public drinking fountains throughout the United States following the Civil War. The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (NWCTU)'s organizing convention of 1874 strongly encouraged its attendees to erect the fountains in the places that they had come from. The NWCTU advocated public temperance fountains as a means to discourage males from entering drinking establishment for refreshment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCTU Drinking Fountains – Then and Now|url=http://www.wctu.org/fountains.html|work=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|publisher=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|accessdate=June 9, 2012|author=Staff|year=1996–2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014112806/http://wctu.org/fountains.html|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cast-stone statues of [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] were marketed for use in temperance fountains. In [[Union Square Park]]{&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park/monuments/797|title=Union Square Park Monuments – Union Square Drinking Fountain : NYC Parks|publisher=nycgovparks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (New York City) the James Fountain (1881), is a Temperance fountain with the figure of Charity who empties her jug of water, aided by a child; it was donated by Daniel Willis James and sculpted by [[Adolf Donndorf]]. In Washington DC "the" [[Temperance Fountain]] was donated to the city in 1882 by Temperance crusader [[Henry D. Cogswell]]. This fountain was one of a series of fountains he designed and commissioned in a belief that easy access to cool drinking water would keep people from consuming alcohol. Under its stone canopy the words "Faith," "Hope," "Charity," and "Temperance" are chiseled. Atop this canopy is a life-sized [[heron]], and the centerpiece is a pair of entwined heraldic scaly [[dolphin]]s. Originally, visitors were supposed to freely drink ice water flowing from the dolphins' snouts with a [[brass]] cup attached to the fountain and the overflow was collected by a [[Trough (food)|trough]] for [[horse]]s, but the city tired of having to replenish the ice in a reservoir underneath the base and disconnected the supply pipes. Other Cogswell fountains include one still standing in New York City's Tompkins Square Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevillager.com/2012/09/20/history-lessons-flow-from-two-temperance-fountains/|title=History lessons flow from two temperance fountains – The Villager Newspaper|publisher=thevillager.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/tompkins-square-park/history|title=Tompkins Square Park Highlights : NYC Parks|publisher=nycgovparks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Benson]], an Oregon lumberman, was a tee-totaler who wanted to discourage his workers from drinking alcohol in the middle of the day. In 1912, Benson gave the [[Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]] USD$10,000 for the installation of twenty bronze drinking fountains. As of May 2012, these fountains, known as [[Benson Bubbler|"Benson Bubblers"]], continue to be used as functional public drinking devices in downtown Portland; two Portland "Benson Bubbler" locations are Eastbank Esplanade and the corner of "3rd and Burnside".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Water Bureau: Benson Bubbler bowl was stolen|url=http://www.kptv.com/story/17649428/water-bureau-reports-benson-bubbler-bowl-was-stolen|accessdate=June 9, 2012|newspaper=FOX 12 Oregon|date=May 20, 2012|author=Jolie Wolfe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benson Bubbler, 3rd and Burnside.

== Third Wave Temperance: 1893–1933 ==
The last wave of temperance in the United States saw the rise of the Anti-Saloon League (ASL), which successfully pushed for [[Prohibition in the United States|National Prohibition]] from its enactment in 1920 to its repeal in 1933. This heavily prohibitionist wave attracted a diverse coalition: doctors, pastors, and eugenicists; Klansmen and liberal internationalists; business leaders and labor radicals; conservative evangelicals and liberal theologians.&lt;ref&gt;"A Nation of Drunkards."

Rev. Howard Hyde Russell founded the [[Anti-Saloon League]] (ASL) in 1893. Under the leadership of [[Wayne Wheeler]] the ASL stressed political results and perfected the art of [[pressure politics]]. It did not demand that politicians change their drinking habits, only their votes in the legislature. Other organizations like the [[Prohibition Party]] and the WCTU soon lost influence to the better-organized and more focused ASL.

The ASL's motto was "the Church in action against the saloon," and it mobilized its religious coalition to pass state (and local) legislation (establishing [[dry state]]s and [[Dry county|dry counties]]).

By the late nineteenth century, most Protestant denominations and the American wing of the Catholic Church supported the movement to legally restrict the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. These groups believed that alcohol consumption led to [[corruption]], [[prostitution]], [[spousal abuse]] and other criminal activities. Brewers and distillers resisted the reform movement, which threatened to ruin their livelihood, and also feared women having the vote, because they expected women to vote for prohibition.&lt;ref name=Christianity1998/&gt;

Energized by the anti-German sentiment during World War I, the ASL achieved its main goal of passage on December 18, 1917—the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]]. Upon ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures by January 16, 1919, established National Prohibition. (the Amendment came into effect on January 16, 1920)
Prohibition banned "the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages in the United States and its possessions." However, Prohibition did not outlaw the private possession or consumption of alcohol products.

== Modern Temperance: Post-World War II ==
[[Harvard Medical School]] professors Jack Harold Mendelson and Nancy K Mello, write with regard to temperance sentiment in contemporary America that "rallying cries once structured in terms of social order, home and basic decency are now framed in terms of health promotion and disease prevention."&lt;ref name="MendelsonMello1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendelson|first1=Jack Harold|last2=Mello|first2=Nancy K.|title=The Diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism|year=1985|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780070414778|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original temperance organizations such as the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and [[International Organization of Good Templars]] continue their work today, while new "temperance enterprises found support in a variety of institutional venues" such as the [[Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems]] and [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]].&lt;ref name="AckerTracy2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MartinicLeigh2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martinic|first1=Marjana|last2=Leigh|first2=Barbara C.|title=Reasonable Risk: Alcohol in Perspective|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415946360|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperance organizations focus their efforts on "promoting increased taxation, reducing [[alcohol advertising]], and monitoring of the beverage industry", as well as the supporting of [[blue law|Sunday blue laws]], which prohibit the sale of alcohol of Sundays.&lt;ref name="AckerTracy2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peck2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peck|first=Garrett|title=Prohibition in Washington|date=25 March 2011|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|language=English|isbn=9781614230892|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius''''' is an [[altarpiece]] by Italian artist [[Carlo Crivelli]] showing an artistic adaptation of the [[Annunciation]]. The altarpiece was painted for the [[Santissima Annunziata, Ascoli Piceno|Church of SS. Annunziata]] in the Italian town of [[Ascoli Piceno]], in the region of [[Marche]], to celebrate the self-government granted to the town in 1482 by [[Pope Sixtus IV]].&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/carlo-crivelli-the-annunciation-with-saint-emidius|title=The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius|publisher=[[The National Gallery]]| accessdate =26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was removed to the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in Milan in 1811, but passed to [[Auguste-Louis de Sivry]] in 1820, and had reached England by the mid-19th century.  It has been housed in the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]] since it was donated by [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton]] in 1864.&lt;ref name="ng"/&gt;

'''''The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty''''' is an unauthorized biography of the [[Bush family]] by the American [[investigative journalist]] [[Kitty Kelley]]. It was published on September 14, 2004, less than two months before the [[2004 US Presidential election]]. Reviews of the book were mixed, with some of the "accusations," according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "[standing] up better than others."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/books/review/the-family-here-comes-the-son.html|title='The Family': Here Comes the Son|last=Widmer|first=Ted|date=2004-10-10|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glynn Wilson, a free-lance journalist from [[Alabama]], sued Kelley for plagiarism claiming passages from the book have the exact wording as his online article.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/books/a-writer-is-suing-the-author-of-a-hit-book-on-the-bushes.html|title=A Writer Is Suing the Author of a Hit Book on the Bushes|last=Wyatt|first=Edward|date=2004-11-17|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The House of the Dead''''' ({{lang-ru|Записки из Мёртвого дома}}, ''Zapiski iz Myortvogo doma'') is a semi-autobiographical [[novel]] published in 1860–2&lt;ref&gt;The first part was published in 1860 and the second one in 1862. The novel's first complete appearance was in book form in 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; in the journal ''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Frank, Introduction to The House of the Dead and Poor Folk, Barnes and Noble, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; by Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], which portrays the life of convicts in a [[Siberia]]n prison camp. The novel has also been published under the titles '''''Memoirs from the House of The Dead''''', '''''Notes from the Dead House''''' (or '''''Notes from a Dead House'''''), and '''''Notes from the House of the Dead'''''. The book is a loosely-knit collection of facts, events and [[philosophy|philosophical]] discussion organised by "theme" rather than as a continuous story. Dostoevsky himself spent four years in exile in such a camp following his conviction for involvement in the [[Petrashevsky Circle]]. This experience allowed him to describe with great authenticity the conditions of prison life and the characters of the convicts.

==Background==
After his [[mock execution]] on 22 December 1849, Dostoevsky's life was spared in exchange for four years of imprisonment in one of Siberia’s ''[[katorga]]'' labor camps. Though he often was met with hostility from the other prisoners due to his noble status of ''[[dvoryanin]]'', his views on life changed. After his time in the camps Dostoevsky returned to write ''The House of the Dead''. The novel incorporates several of the horrifying experiences he witnessed while in prison. He recalls the guards’ brutality and relish performing unspeakably cruel acts, the crimes that the convicted criminals committed, and the fact that blended amid these great brutes were good and decent individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Fyodor Dostoevsky." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 23 Oct.2011&lt;/ref&gt;
However, he is also astonished at the convicts’ abilities to commit murders without the slightest change in conscience. It was a stark contrast with his own heightened sensitivity. During this time in prison he began experiencing the epileptic seizures that would plague him for the rest of his life. ''House of the Dead'' led Dostoevsky to include the theme of murder in his later works, a theme not found in any of his works preceding ''House of the Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;Dostoyevsky, Fedor. ''Memoirs From the House of the Dead''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The narrator, Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov, has been sentenced to penalty deportation to Siberia and ten years of hard labour for murdering  his wife. Life in prison is particularly hard for Aleksandr Petrovich, since he is a "gentleman" and suffers the malice of the other prisoners, nearly all of whom belong to the peasantry. Gradually Goryanchikov overcomes his revulsion at his situation and his fellow convicts, undergoing a [[spiritual awakening|spiritual re-awakening]] that culminates with his release from the camp.  It is a work of great humanity; Dostoevsky portrays the inmates of the prison with sympathy for their plight, and also expresses admiration for their energy, ingenuity and talent. He concludes that the existence of the prison, with its absurd practices and savage corporal punishments is a tragic fact, both for the prisoners and for Russia.

==Characters==
Many of the characters in the novel were very similar to the real-life people that Dostoevsky met while in prison. While many of the characters do mirror real-life people, he has also made some of the characters appear more interesting than their real-life counterparts.

==Reception==
''The House of the Dead'' was Dostoevsky’s only work that [[Leo Tolstoy]] revered.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rayfield |first1=Donald |title=The House of the Dead by Daniel Beer review – was Siberia hell on earth? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/29/house-of-dead-siberian-exile-under-tsars-daniel-beer-review |accessdate=24 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=29 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2582">A '''threshold stone''' or '''sill stone''' ({{lang-de|Schwellenstein}}) is a rectangularly dressed stone slab that forms part of the [[Megalithic entrance|entrance]] of [[megalith]]ic tombs of the [[Funnelbeaker culture]], normally those with a passage. The [[Bunter sandstone|red sandstone]] slab, up to 0.1-metre-thick,  was buried in the ground to a depth of 0.2 metres at the entrance to the chamber. Cultural sites of other types, such as [[Domus de Janas]], also have a clear partition between the passage and the ante-chamber or main chamber.
[[File:Megawal1.jpg|300px|thumb|No. 7 = the threshold stone of a [[passage grave]]]]

Threshold stones are typical of [[dolmen]]s, [[gallery grave]]s and [[passage grave]]s, etc. Whilst in most [[simple dolmen]]s the blocking stone (''Verschlussstein'') of the entrance side was replaced by a threshold stone of varying height, the entrance to [[rectangular dolmen|extended dolmens]] and [[great dolmen]]s was narrowed axially or coaxially usually to about half the width of the chamber and the lower threshold stone marked the transition in the open doorway between the passage and the chamber. In simple dolmens with no passage and an entrance opening, the threshold reaches almost half the height of the chamber and protrudes 0.5 m above the hallway floor in Grave 9 in the northern part of the Everstorf Forest. Usually, however the upper edge of the threshold is not generally higher than 0.1 metres above the level of the hall floor in dolmens. The length of the threshold in [[polygonal dolmen]]s and gallery and passage graves is also the width of the entrance which, in the Funnelbeaker culture, rarely exceeds 0.7 metres.

As well as separating the sacral chamber from the profane passage, the threshold stone also serves to support a door slab or sealing slab. If the passageway was used, e.g. in connexion with [[secondary burial]]s, for cultic purposes, it was given a covering of flagstones and a second, outer threshold stone.

In [[US Income tax|United States federal income tax]], a '''Vacation home deduction''' is a [[tax deduction]] to be claimed on an individual taxpayer's [[vacation home]].

This deduction is limited under law.  Generally, a taxpayer may not deduct expenses related to a vacation home since the owner uses the property for personal enjoyment.&lt;ref name="IRC § 280A(a)."&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280A-|title=US CODE: Title 26,280A. Disallowance of certain expenses in connection with business use of home, rental of vacation homes, etc.|date=Sep 26, 2008|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a taxpayer may claim limited deductions on a vacation home if the taxpayer uses the property as both a vacation home and [[rental property]].&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 280A(d).&lt;/ref&gt;

If the taxpayer uses the property for the greater of 14 days or 10% of the number of days the
property is rented, the taxpayer may deduct some of the property-related expenses.&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 280A(e)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; These deductions are limited to the gross income from the rent less the general expenses attributable to the rental use of the property.&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 280A(c)(5).&lt;/ref&gt; The taxpayer may deduct the expenses related to the property limited to (i) the number of days the property was rented at fair market rental value over (ii) the total number of days the property was used.&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 280A(e).&lt;/ref&gt;

If the taxpayer rents the property for less than 15 days, the taxpayer may not deduct any
property-related expenses.&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 280A(g)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in this case, the taxpayer does not have to include as income any rent attributable to the property.&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 280A(g)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
