An '''adversarial process''' is one that supports conflicting one-sided positions held by individuals, groups or entire societies, as inputs into the conflict resolution situation, typically with rewards for prevailing in the outcome. Often in the form of the process assumes a game-like appearance.

==Adversarial politics==
The use of a [[voting system]] to choose candidates to hold political and military [[power (sociology)|power]] is often necessarily adversarial. This process requires each candidate to convince voters that they are more trustworthy in the expected future circumstances, than their opponent.

Adversarial politics takes place when one party (usually not in government) takes the opposite (or at least a different) opinion to that of the other (usually the government) even when they may personally agree with what the government is trying to do.

Those opposed to adversarial politics believe that politicians should state what they actually think rather than following the 'party line'. They consider adversarial politics to be cynical and intolerant, with ‘winning’ the driving  principle versus attempting to establish the truth. Politicians captivated by the ‘struggle for victory’ corrupt the ideals that brought them into politics in the first place.

Adversarial politics is often blamed for turning the electorate away from politics and their right to participate in the democratic process of their country through voting at elections.

In the US, huge fundraising for presidential elections increasingly results in campaigns focused on personalities versus honest debate, and trading insults versus addressing substantive issues.

In the UK the most obvious example is [[Prime Minister's Questions]], a weekly session where the two main party loudly confront each other.

==Adversarial legal process==
{{main|Adversarial system}}
The use of an adversarial process by the [[criminal procedure|criminal]] or [[Civil procedure|civil court]] to decide the social attitude to an alleged wrongdoing of a [[defendant]], penalties to be imposed, and restitution to be awarded to their deemed victim often depends on the adversarial witness questioning.&lt;ref&gt;p.54, MacNeil&lt;/ref&gt;  This is adversarial as the opposing attorneys are competing to convince the judge to include or exclude evidence or witnesses, and competing to convince the judge or jury of the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and severity of the impact of the actions (if guilty) on the plaintiff or victim. Lawyers must be held to rather specific [[ethical code]]s, e.g. [[rules of civil procedure]], to ensure that their tactics do not cause an undue burden on larger society, e.g. freeing defendants who have admitted that they are not only guilty but intend to offend again. Lawyers differ on whether the process should be seen as strictly adversarial, in order to ensure they retain the trust of clients and the overall process retains the trust of society, or whether the ethics of the larger society should play a role in their behavior.

==Other examples==
A third example of an adversarial process is the operation of [[market system]]s, e.g. [[commodity markets]]. In these, bid and ask prices are constantly compared, with sellers representing goods as being valuable and buyers haggling and claiming they are less valuable. Product markets tend to focus on the comparison of sellers' products with other sellers' products—the adversarial process itself making trustworthy information, e.g. as published in [[Consumer Reports]] or the [[Better Business Bureau]], hard to compile and to obtain.  Health advocates{{who|date=November 2010}} often claim that market systems are very difficult to reconcile with food, nutrition, agriculture or medicine's need to work well with living systems—a key complaint of the [[anti-globalization movement]].

==Alternative systems==
The alternatives, including [[consensus decision making]] and [[deliberative democracy]] (which tend to alternate adversary, discussion, and voting over a longer period of time allocated to make the decision and explore implications), are ancient. However, they are less well studied in [[political science]] and [[economics]]. Most commentators{{who|date=November 2010}} are suspicious of the utopian goals of the advocates of such non-adversarial processes, viewing competition as essential to a good result.

Other activists argue that adversarial process works well and should probably be expanded to areas that are presently less adversarial.  For instance they advocate "[[science court]]s" and "[[prediction market]]s" that would force the scientist, economist and technologist to put reputations and money on the line, rather than trusting them based on reputation without a disciplined follow-up to see if they were right or wrong.  These ideas are increasingly popular in part because such alternative courts and markets can be easily started up on the Internet.

'''''Arctic Tale''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Wii]]. The game is about trying to survive as a polar bear (adult or young), a walrus, a killer whale, or an Arctic fox.  It is loosely based on the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] documentary about Arctic wildlife also called ''[[Arctic Tale]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55946">'''Athelstan Braxton Hicks''' (19 June 1854  - 17 May 1902) was a [[Coroner]] in London and Surrey for two decades at the end of the 19th century. He was given the nickname "The Children's Coroner" for his conscientiousness in investigating the suspicious deaths of children, and especially baby-farming and the dangers of child life insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6dFzCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;ots=eyJuIvW84I&amp;dq=Athelstan+Braxton+Hicks&amp;pg=PA178&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Braxton%20Hicks&amp;f=false|title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800-1939|last=Rose|first=Lionel|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later publish a study on [[infanticide]].

He was the son of [[John Braxton Hicks|Dr John Braxton Hicks]], the well-known obstetrician, born in [[Tottenham]], London.

==Career==
He was a [[Barrister|Barrister at law]] who entered the [[Middle Temple]] in 1872&lt;ref&gt;Email from the Archivist, The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple. 2 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1875. He was a special pleader on the Western Circuit and at the Middlesex Sessions. He was for some time a student at [[Guy's Hospital]], where he gained considerable knowledge of [[Medical jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ELECTION OF CORONER|last=|first=|date=18 July 1885|work=Surrey Comet|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Deputy Coroner of the City of London and Borough of Southwark, the City of Westminster and the West London District. He was appointed Coroner in 1885 for the South-Western District of London and the [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] Division of Surrey. For a time he served on the Joint Committee of the [[British Medical Association]] and the [[Coroners Society of England and Wales|Coroners Society]], of which he was honorary Secretary.

He wrote a pamphlet entitled "Hints to Medical Men Concerning the Granting of Certificates of Death." (London: William Clowes, 1889).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=10 August 1889|title=Mr. Braxton Hicks On Certificates Of Death|jstor=20220551|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=2 |issue=1493|pages=316–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made several reforms, notably that inquests were no longer held in public houses, and an improvement in providing local mortuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=FOR THE DEAD AND THE LIVING|last=|first=|date=7 August 1901|work=Surrey Comet|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He insisted that a full post-mortem be carried out on bodies. In 1898 he took a doctor, James Mackay, to court for perjury; Mackay had claimed to have performed a post mortem on a 17 week child but when two other doctors examined the body they found no evidence that Mackay had done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/bncn/infomark.do?docType=LTO&amp;docLevel=FASCIMILE&amp;prodId=BNCN&amp;tabID=T012&amp;type=multipage&amp;version=1.0&amp;retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;docPage=article&amp;docId=R3214030996&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;source=gale|title=CORONER AND MAGISTRATE|last=|first=|date=23 December 1898|work=The Standard (London, England)|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=23241|page=7|via=British Library Newspapers, Part II: 1800-1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS168485782&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The Charge Of Perjury Against A Surgeon|last=|first=|date=22 December 1898|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=10|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=14 January 1899|title=‘Post-Mortem’ Examinations|jstor=20259227|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1 |issue=1985|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his more unusual inquests were the [[Pimlico Mystery|Pimlico poisoning]] by chloroform,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS167955024&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The Pimlico Poisoning Case|last=|first=|date=16 February 1886|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|page=10|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS185649747&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The Pimlico Poisoning Case|last=|first=|date=19 February 1886|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|page=11|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inquest on a [[Home Office Baby|body of a baby]] sent to the Home Secretary,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000051/18841113/011/0002|title=THE SENDING OF A CORPSE TO THE HOME SECRETARY|last=|first=|date=13 November 1884|work=London Daily News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=2|via=British Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Thomas Neill Cream|'Lambeth Poisoning Case']],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS202036974&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The Lambeth Poisoning Case|last=|first=|date=14 July 1892|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 'Tooting Horror',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Murder Houses of South London|last=Bondeson|first=Jan|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|year=2015|isbn=978-1784623340|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS201776235&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The Murder Of A Family At Tooting|last=|first=|date=11 March 1895|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Railway Murder" of Miss Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unsolved Murders in Victorian and Edwardian London|last=Oates|first=Jonathan|publisher=Wharncliffe Books|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=124–131|chapter=The Railway Murder 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://charlespearce.org/pub/unsolved-murder-mysteries/chapter-4.4|title=Elizabeth Camp.

One of his inquests, [[Thames Torso Murders of 1887–1889|Elizabeth Jackson]], has been linked, probably incorrectly, with the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casebook.org/victims/jackson.html|title=The murder of Elizabeth Jackson|last=Arif|first=Debra|date=|website=Casebook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the 'Lambeth Gangs' he dealt with the murder of Henry Mappin by a street gang, the original [[Hooliganism|Hooligans]], who threatened witnesses and himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001112/18980722/043/0004|title=THE LAMBETH GANGS.

In the 'Battersea Cancer Cure' inquest he dealt with an unqualified "Dr Ferdinand" who advertised his claim to be able to cure cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=THE BATTERSEA CANCER "CURE"|last=|first=|date=29 Oct 1896|work=The Sheffield &amp; Rotherham Independent|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=British Library Newspapers, Part II: 1800-1900|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS152231773&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The 'Cure' Of Cancer|last=|first=|date=29 Oct 1896|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the [[Cancer Act 1939]] that advertisements for cancer cures were made illegal.

At the end of the 19th century there were more suicides from [[Phenol|carbolic acid]] than from any other poison because there was no restriction on its sale. Braxton Hicks and other coroners called for its sale to be prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS169270073&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=Mr. A.

He gave evidence in 1890 and 1896 to the [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] on Infant Life Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kar.kent.ac.uk/62866/|title=Bastards, Baby Farmers, and Social Control in Victorian Britain|last=Pearman|first=Joanne|date=2017|website=University of Kent|type=Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis, University of Kent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 Braxton Hicks wrote to the [[Home Secretary]], [[Matthew White Ridley, 1st Viscount Ridley|Sir Matthew White Ridley]], about the Police Order issued by the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Commissioner of Police]], [[Sir Edward Bradford, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Bradford]], and the [[Kew Mortuary#Recovery of bodies in the Thames|recovery of bodies in the Thames]].&lt;ref name=A60405&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4741756|title=POLICE - METROPOLITAN: Revised General Order re dead bodies found in tidal or navigable waters approved.|last=|first=|date=1900|website=The National Archives, Kew|others=HO 45/9755/A60405|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|ref=|subscription=|registration=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 he succeeded in a reform of coroners being notified of the deaths of lunatics held in Poor Law Institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=24 November 1900|title=Deaths of Lunatics in Poor-Law Institutions|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2464158/pdf/brmedj08586-0050a.pdf|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2 |issue=2082|pages=1534|via=PMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kingston District in 1901 he held 201 inquests: 121 males and 79 females with one case of treasure trove.

===Infanticide===
[[Infanticide#United Kingdom|Infanticide]] was common in the Victorian period for social reasons, such as illegitimacy, and the introduction of child life insurance additionally encouraged some women to kill their children for gain. Examples are [[Mary Ann Cotton]], who murdered many of her 15 children as well as 3 husbands, [[Margaret Waters]], the 'Brixton Baby Farmer', a professional baby-farmer who was found guilty of infanticide in 1870, Jessie King hanged in 1889, and [[Amelia Dyer]], the 'Angel Maker', who murdered over 400 babies in her care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/babyfarm.html|title="Baby Farming" – a tragedy of Victorian times.|last=|first=|date=|website=Capital Punishment U.K.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding the dead bodies of murdered babies on the streets was common; 276 were recorded in London in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://richardjohnbr.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/infanticide-case-study.html|title=Infanticide: a case study|last=|first=|date=|website=Looking at History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braxton Hicks held many inquests for bodies of children found in the street or on the banks of the Thames. For example 'The Battersea Mystery', where the body of a baby was found by the Thames after being thrown into the water alive. The father was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jack-the-ripper-tour.com/generalnews/the-battersea-mystery/|title=The Battersea Mystery|last=Jones|first=Richard|date=29 March 2017|website=Jack The Ripper Tour|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000079/18880422/045/0007|title=THE SUPPOSED MURDER OF AN INFANT|last=|first=|date=22 April 1888|work=Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was unusual, for example in the inquest of new born baby that died of head injuries the jury concluded that there was not sufficient evidence on its cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000684/18930909/104/0007|title=SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF A CHILD|last=|first=|date=9 September 1893|work=Surrey Comet|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001003/18931007/126/0007|title=Mysterious death at Wimbledon|last=|first=|date=7 October 1893|work=Croydon Guardian and Surrey County Gazette|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obtaining convictions for the manslaughter of infants was difficult. For example, the case of Matilda Muncey, a registered baby farmer, who had had 36 children of whom 12 had died. She had an unregistered child, Evelina Marsh, who died of  malnutrition. She was acquitted of manslaughter and was only fined £5 for neglecting to register the child and sent to prison for a month for not giving information to the coroner. The judge commented "that nothing was more likely to kill or more difficult of proof than the improper way of feeding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000072/18900628/013/0002|title=A BABY FARMER COMMITTED|last=|first=|date=28 June 1890|work=Illustrated Police News|access-date=|via=British Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000072/18900628/013/0002|title=Police Intelligence|last=|first=|date=24 September 1890|work=London Evening Standard|access-date=|via=British Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overlaying====
[[Overlaying]], where the child is accidentally smothered in bed, was common especially in overcrowded conditions or where the parents had been drinking. Braxton Hicks announced that he would disallow the expenses of the parents where he thought that the parents had been careless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=5 January 1895|title=A Thousand Infants Overlain|jstor=20231099|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1 |issue=1775|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an inquest in 1895 on the death by over-laying of a second child to a couple who had earlier received a caution, when the jury returned a verdict of accidental death he said &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vDHRGB42UpMC&amp;lpg=PT29&amp;dq=Athelstan%20Braxton%20Hicks%20born&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q=Braxton%20Hicks&amp;f=false|title=Songs of Innocence: The Story of British Childhood|last=Abrams|first=Fran|publisher=Atlantic Books Ltd|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ACCIDENTS and INQUESTS|last=|first=|date=12 October 1895|work=South London Press|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been "during the last ten months no less than 500 cases had occurred in which children had been suffocated while in bed with their parents, in London alone." He estimated that a third of the allegedly accidental deaths of children were due to suffocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=FORBES|first=THOMAS R.|date=April 1986|title=Deadly Parents: Child Homicide in Eighteenth– and Nineteenth–Century England|jstor=24633624|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=41 |issue=2|pages=175–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However he operated a poor box and could be generous when confronted with poverty: "it was no use reading the father a lesson on sleeping in a crowded room, for he was hard-up and could not pay for large apartments.

====Friendly Societies Act====
In 1889 Mr Braxton Hicks wrote a letter to the Times about the dangers of child life insurance, as outlined in the [[Friendly Societies Act 1875]] which provided for payments on death of children, denouncing the practice of insuring children's lives to pay the expenses of their burial. He wrote that the insurances act as a temptation to the parents to neglect them, or feed them with improper food, and sometimes even to kill them, as in the excessively numerous cases of "over-laying" or suffocating in bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS219861070&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=Infantile Insurance|last=|first=|date=14 Feb 1889|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=13|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

!Infantile Insurance 
|-
|
Some people assert, rather rashly, that the deaths of a great number of infants are directly due to the fact of their being insured, or, in other words, that children are deliberately murdered for the insurance money; but, except in a few cases, insurance is only one of the possible causes which lead to the deaths of infants.

If parents are negligent to their children, the fact that they are insured must naturally act upon an evil mind as a direct inducement for further negligence. Or, if an infant is sickly, there is an inducement to allow "nature to take its course," which it does, if the child is insured, in a very speedy manner.

The industrial insurance companies allow policies to be effected by people who have no insurable interest (properly so called) in the lives of the insured. They are effected by persons who have a direct interest in the death of the insured—such as illegitimate children, children of poor people who have large families, and aged people whose life is a burden to those who have the care of them.

As regards illegitimate children, I am informed that it is the rule in some offices not to take such lives; but I know of my own knowledge that this rule is almost invariably broken.

Children are often insured whose lives are in a precarious state, and insurances are effected by people who have the charge of such children to nurse for a weekly payment; but such insurances are not effected until there seems a reasonable chance of the child dying and the payments of the mother are in arrear, so that on its death—and the sooner that occurs the better it will be—the nurse will be able to recoup herself for the loss out of the insurance money. 
Again, the agents for the companies are paid by commission, and though, no doubt, that is the only practicable mode of payment, commercially speaking, yet it has a direct inducement for their taking insurances with very little inquiry. 
A frequent cause of death in children is what is called "Exhaustion from malnutrition," and the method by which this is brought about is so simple that it is no wonder it often occurs. All the parents have to do is to stuff the child with improper food; the more they give it the weaker it gets; and then, when it can eat nothing liquid,  they tell you that they give it what they have themselves, beef, pork, &amp;c., and are then surprised, or pretend to be surprised, that the child dies.

It is impossible in such a case to determine absolutely it such feeding is done purposely or from ignorance; but the impression in my mind, formed from such cases, is that in the majority there is a great deal of method, as, although these people may be uneducated, they are quite cunning enough to know that such a treatment can be carried out with impunity, and I have known them to continue such a course of treatment even after being warned by a medical man as to the probable results.

Another frequent cause of death in infants is from "Suffocation while in bed with the parents." Out of 103 inquests held last year in which a verdict of "Accidental death" was returned, 32 were on children who had so died. 
This is clearly a preventible cause, and with a little extra care from the parents the majority would not have occurred. Yet several of these children were insured, and the parents were enabled to take advantage of their own carelessness by receiving the insurance money.

There are many cases where children are insured and die from the results of malnutrition and general carelessness and neglect in their bringing up who, when they are nearly approaching death, are brought to a medical man, who sees them, often only once, but who gives a certificate of death because he is satisfied that they have died from what is improperly termed a natural cause, without any inquiry as to how they were allowed to get into that condition. 
Such cases are stated by medical men to be marasmus or wasting, inanition, want of vitality, malnutrition.

All these are vague terms and are utterly valueless in such cases, unless the medical man states whether such a cause is brought about from constitutional weakness or from want of proper care. If a medical man has no knowledge of the primary cause he should state on the certificate of death that be does not know, and then the Registrar would refer the matter for inquiry.

In many of such cases the child is simply taken to a doctor to obtain the certificate of death, and so buried, without any further inquiry. It is this practice which allows an opportunity to parents to hide their neglect, and therefore any statistics based upon coroners' returns would be wholly fallacious. In fact, any statistics in the matter of infantile insurance are apt to mislead and draw the attention of the public away from the main question - as to whether infant insurance in its present state is a good or bad thing.

The strongest statement in favour of infant insurance is that it encourages thrift and induces parents to spend more money in the care of a child while alive, if it is insured, than they would do if it was not insured. 
But where is the evidence of the thrift? The parent is putting by money for which he can get no return unless the child dies, and then the amount paid is wholly out of proportion to the amount invested, and the matter, commercially, assumes a gambling aspect, the stake in this game being the life of the child.

It is urged in favour that the parent is more likely to provide extra food and delicacies for a child who is insured, as he knows that if it dies he will be able to reimburse himself somewhat by the insurance money. But surely the argument tends directly against the policy of the system, for it would be patent to any thinking person if a parent argued upon the matter at all he would argue in this manner:---My child's life is insured; if I spend extra money on medical advice and proper food I may keep my child alive, and so I shall have no benefit from my insurance and shall have spend my money and premiums for no advantage; but if I neglect to get proper food and advice the child will die, and I shall have saved my money and be in pocket from the insurance.

The reason that so many children who are insured do not die is not because insurance is a good thing but because the majority of parents do not argue the matter at all but do their duty by their children to the  best of their ability without any reference to insurance. So it is not really a question of thrift in parents that causes them to insure, but because they have been told by the insurance agents that it would be a good thing to insure in case the child dies, and as they can do so for Id. per week they often insure; but with the evil-disposed it would be a direct inducement to neglect and kill their children, and, to quote be words of the Hon. E. L. Stanley, in his evidence before the Commission, speaking of canvassers, he says, "I do not think the work could be done without them. I think it is a sort of canvassing work among the poor; they go among these people and persuade them; they say you ought to be economical and thrifty; you ought to provide for your family." They carry on a propaganda which I should call extravagant thrift.

He then listed eleven proposals for amending the Act:-
#That no child should be insured under the age of at least five years, or, if insured, that no money should be paid if it died under the age of five years. 
#That the amount to be paid on such deaths should be commensurate with the expenses of the burial. 
#That in no case should the amount to be paid for burial exceed the sum of £2 10s. 
#That only parents should be allowed to insure, and then only when the child is in their care and charge. 
#That if the child attains the age of 16 years it should be compulsory on insurance companies to give a surrender value for the policy. This would encourage thrift in the parent, for by the time the child was 16 years it would, presumably, be able to contribute towards its own keep, and the parent could then recoup himself for the expenses he might have been put to in insuring against the possible death of his child, or, should he be so minded, he might use the money for furthering the child's interests.
#That after the age of 16 years the child might be allowed to continue the policy for his own benefit (if it has not been surrendered) for the same or an increased amount. 
#Should the child die under the age of five years, the insurers should be allowed, if they desire it, to receive back a certain proportion of the premiums. This would be no greater loss to the companies than the present system of paying in full the insurance money at any age. 
#That in each district the insurance companies should appoint an undertaker, who should conduct the funeral of all children insured on behalf of the company, and  themselves defray all such expenses and account to the company for the same, thus preventing any cash payments being made the friends.
#That the deaths of all children whose lives are insured should be reported to the coroner in the same way as under the Infant Life Protection Act, not of necessity that an inquest should be held, but that an inquiry should be made by the coroner's officer as to the circumstances surrounding the death, who should report the matter to the coroner for his decision as to the necessity of holding any further inquiry, and that no such death should be registered without the authority in writing of the coroner.
#That where the coroner and his jury consider that the child has been improperly treated, though such treatment may not amount in law to negligence sufficient to maintain manslaughter, the coroner shall be empowered to endorse the same upon his certificate of death, and thus give notice to the insurance companies that no money was to be paid upon such death. 
#That the present rules as regards the certificate of the registrar to the insurance companies to prevent multiple insurances should be retained.

He gave evidence in 1890 to the Committee of the House of Lords investigating Child Life Insurance. The recent Deptford poisoning case, where Mrs Winters had poisoned three people and set up multiple insurance policies, was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unknownmisandry.blogspot.com/2011/09/amelia-winters-ambitious-plan-to-murder.html|title=Amelia Winters' Ambitious Plan to Murder Relatives Interrupted After 5 Successes, Deptford, England - 1889|last=|first=|date=22 September 2011|website=The Unknown History of MISANDRY|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Friendly Societies Act 1896]] subsequently did bring in limitations on the amount payable on the death of a child.

===Baby Farming===
He was active against the practise of [[Baby farming|baby-farming]]. The [[Infant Life Protection Act 1872|Infant Life Protection Act, 1872]] had made registration with the local authority obligatory for any person taking in two or more infants under one year of age for a period greater than 24 hours. Also the Coroner had to be informed of the deaths of such infants.

In a reported case of baby farming Braxton Hicks said "Any child that dies in your quarter, where the cause is not as plain as a pike-staff, shall have an inquest held, and I'll have this case brought before the Children's Society." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH18931216.2.68.18 |title=LONDON'S MYSTERIES. A Morning with the Coroner |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |volume=XXX, |issue=9385 |date=16 December 1893 |accessdate=26 March 2018 |via=Papers Past, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with the 1872 Act was that there were widespread exemptions, including relatives, day-nurses, hospitals and foster women. There was no 'authentification' of contracts between parent and baby-farmer. This was highlighted by the Arnold baby-farming inquest. He wrote to the Home Secretary about the case and in 1896 gave evidence to the Select Committee on Infant Life Protection Bill, with the Arnold case as one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niph.go.jp/toshokan/koten/Britain/PDF/100718760003.pdf|title=Minutes of Evidence Taken Before The Select Committee on Infant Life Protection Bill|last=|first=|date=1896|website=|pages=43–59|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Arnold Baby-Farming Case====
Mrs Jane Arnold of Wolverton had been 'sweating' infants legally by doing so one at a time. She would take a lump sum for adoption and then pass the child on. She left a child with Mrs Saunders of Richmond and used her address for replies. Her activities came to light in an inquest in 1888 on the death of Isaac Arnold (alias John Bailey), aged 6 months, who died in Tooting. Arnold had placed the boy with Mrs Jessie Chapman of Tooting, who was licensed under the Infant Life Protection Act, and had already received another child, Edward Alexander Lovell, from her. Mrs Chapman notified the coroner. The jury returned a verdict of death from natural causes, but the activities of Mrs Arnold had been reported and were influential in leading to a change in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18880928/061/0006|title=THE ALLEGED BABY FARMING CASE|last=|first=|date=28 September 1888|work=Morning Post [London]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=British Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braxton Hicks noted that she had had at least 25 infants and in his summing up he said:{{block indent |text="[[Metropolitan Board of Works|The Metropolitan Board of Works]], who had the carrying out of the Act, had found the section did not go far enough. It was suggested in 1884 that the operations of the Act should be extended to infants under five years of age, and that parents should not be relieved of their responsibility by the payment of sums of money to the people who undertook to adopt their children. In his opinion, then, it was desirable to amend the [[Infant Life Protection Act 1872|Infant Life Protection Act, 1872]], in the manner suggested by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and in addition to make it an offence to take for hire or reward any infant under the age of seven years, unless such person was registered under the Act, or unless the particulars of the agreement or undertaking entered into between the parties to the transaction were registered by the local authority under such Act.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS84463429&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The Alleged Baby Farming|last=|first=|date=5 Oct 1888|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1889 Mrs Arnold was again involved in the inquest of Edward Alexander Lovell, aged 2½, who died in an emaciated state at Newport Pagnell. The child had been received from a Mrs Wlliams of High Holborn, London when a month old with a payment of £30 for a year's keep. The boy was then handed over to Chapman in Thornton Heath, London, but when she did not receive her payments she returned the boy to Mrs Arnold. The jury were of the "opinion that there has been gross neglect in the case" but were unable to allocate responsibility. They added the rider that "The jury are strongly of opinion that further legislation in what are usually known as baby farming cases is greatly needed, and particularly that the required legislation should extend to the care of one infant only, and that the age of the infant should not be limited to one year, but rather to five years and that it should be an offence for any person undertaking the care of such infant to sub farm it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000317/18890518/133/0011|title=THE BABY FARMING CASE AT NEWPORT PAGNELL.

The [[Infant Life Protection Act 1897|Infant Life Protection Act of 1897]] finally empowered local authorities to control the registration of nurses responsible for more than one infant under the age of five for a period longer than 48 hours. Under the [[Children Act 1908|Children’s Act of 1908]] "no infant could be kept in a home that was so unfit and so overcrowded as to endanger its health, and no infant could be kept by an unfit nurse who threatened, by neglect or abuse, its proper care and maintenance."

===Stillbirth===
He also commented on the lack of recording of [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] babies. Under British law stillborn babies were not registered and were not required to be buried in public burial grounds. Recording a birth as stillborn saved on funeral expenses and was a way of concealing infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rentoul|first=Robert Reid|date=1893|title=Proposed Registration of Still-Born Children|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5172209/pdf/indmedgaz71219-0012.pdf|journal=The Indian Medical Gazette|volume=28 |issue=2|pages=44-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rentoul|first=Robert Reid|date=1893|title=Proposed Registration of Still-Born Children Paper read before Manchester Medl.

{{block indent |text="He subsequently had the coffin re-opened to enable the doctor to carry out his orders, and then it was discovered that the bodies of two newly-born children were also in the coffin — one at the head of the man, and the other at his feet — both being in a very bad state of decomposition. He ordered the bodies to be detained with a view to ascertaining who was responsible. It now appeared that it was the common practice of undertakers to receive the bodies of newly-born children, and to keep them in their shops for some considerable time, and the man in question had had these bodies for a month. If undertakers' shops were to continue to be the receptacles for newly-born children, it would become a public scandal and a nuisance to the neighbourhood; and of course it was a most horrible practice. Then there was another danger. How was an undertaker always to know that they were newly-born children? He had known undertakers receive the bodies of children on the "rough scribble" of some midwife, and they would take and bury them on the strength of that piece of paper and nothing more. He had convinced himself in this case, on the certificates of two medical men, that these children ware both stillborn. It seemed to him that public attention should be called to the hiatus in the Registration Act which did not require stillborn children to be registered. So far as the Act was concerned, stillborn children could be deposited at any corner and buried without any inquiry at all. He had known children from three to six days old to die and to be called stillborn, and then some midwife had explained that she thought any child dying within a week of its birth was to be regarded as stillborn. When they dealt with people as ignorant as that, they must expect a good deal of crime to go on under tho cloak of ignorance. He had insisted on the undertaker being present, and the man would now have to bury the bodies and to satisfy him that they had been buried. In his opinion the State should cause still-births to be registered, and some record should be kept. Unless a medical man could certify that the child was stillborn, the matter should be reported to the coroner. Then they would have some check on the large number of child murders committed in England." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article174036051|title=Undertakers and Babies.|last=|first=|date=3 February 1892|newspaper=The Telegraph (Brisbane)|accessdate=26 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=6020|location=Queensland, Australia|page=6|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mr Braxton Hicks held inquests for two babies that were delivered by Amelia Hollis, a midwife, that were shown to have been suffocated after birth.

Obtaining manslaughter convictions for suffocating babies, which were then passed off as stillborn, was very difficult, as in the case of the death of Ernest Davy where Hollis was only found to have infringed the Registration Act by recording a stillbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS51176043&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=Central Criminal Court, March 10|last=|first=|date=11 March 1898|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often women would have the charge reduced to [[Concealing birth|concealment of birth]].

====Massacre of the Innocents====
In 1895 [[The Sun (1893–1906)|the Sun (London)]] published an article "Massacre of the Innocents" highlighting the dangers of baby-farming, in the recording of stillbirths and quoting Braxton-Hicks on lying-in houses. "I have not the slightest doubt that a large amount of crime is covered by the expression `still-birth’. There are a large number of cases of what are called newly-born children, which are found all over England, more especially in London and large towns, abandoned in streets, rivers, on commons, and so on.  My opinion is that a great deal of that crime is due to what are called lying-in houses, which are not registered, or under the supervision of that sort, where the people who act as midwives constantly, as soon as the child is born, either  drop it into a pail of water or smother it with a damp cloth. It is a very common thing,  also, to find that they bash their heads on the floor and break their skulls. And it is a peculiar coincidence in these matters that at certain times we will have a concurrence of new-born children found, and their deaths all arising during a certain period of time in exactly the same way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secret Commissions: An Anthology of Victorian Investigative Journalism|last=Donovan|first=Stephen|last2=Rubery|first2=Matthew|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2012|isbn=9781551113302|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=232–269|chapter=Herbert Cadett. Massacre of the Innocents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration was finally required by the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1926]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=G|date=2009|title=Stillbirth registration and perceptions of infant death, 1900–60: the Scottish case in national context|url=http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00478.x|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=62 |issue=3|pages=629–654|via=PMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidental Death===
Other causes of death were also dealt with. {{block indent |text="Dr. Wynn Westcott said that in 1889 records showed that 620 children were burned to death through being unattended. The Coroners' Society had appealed to the Home Secretary for assistance, and the Government was considering the advisability of legislation to enable a fine or term of imprisonment to be imposed on any person who left a child alone, if that child was thereby burned to death. The jury returned a verdict of "accidental death," and expressed their concurrence with the coroner. The mother was censured for her "thoughtless want of care."

"Recently Mr. Braxton Hicks, at Kingston-on-Thames, inquired into the death of a little girl who was severely burnt at school owing to the want of a proper fireguard. Commenting on the circumstances, the coroner remarked that during the last couple of years he has held inquests on 1683 children, whose death was due to burns, and in 1426 of these cases there were no fireguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article214177335 |title=A Year's Record of Children Burned to Death. |newspaper=[[The Evening Telegraph (Charters Towers)|The Evening Telegraph]] |volume=1, |issue=273 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=25 January 1902 |accessdate=26 March 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Children Act 1908|1908 Children's Act]] introduced legislation for the use of domestic fireguards.

!DEATH OF MR BRAXTON HICKS 
|-
|
We regret to announce the death of Mr Athelstan Braxton Hicks, coroner for the South-Western district of London and the Kingston Division of Surrey, who passed away on Saturday afternoon at his residence, 20 Lupus-street, S.W., from pneumonia, after an illness of less than a week's duration. Mr Hicks, who was in his forty-eighth year, was the son of the late Dr John Braxton Hicks, the famous obstetric surgeon, and was called to the Bar in Trinity term, 1875. For some time he was special pleader on the Western Circuit and at the Middlesex Sessions. Prior to his appointment as coroner seventeen years ago he was deputy coroner for the City of London and borough of Southwark, the City of Westminster, and the West London District. He had for some years been hon. Secretary of the Coroners' Society of England and Wales. Mr Hicks held many notable inquests, including the [[Pimlico Mystery|Pimlico poisoning case]], the case in which a clergyman sent the dead body of a child to [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], the then Home Secretary, to call his attention to the [[Home Office Baby|local burial scandal]]; the murder of Miss Camp on the South-Western Railway, the murder of Mr Pearson on the South-Western Railway, and the cancer case at Battersea. Mr Hicks held his last inquest at Lambeth on Saturday week, when he complained of the chilliness of the court, and two days previous to that he had a long sitting at Battersea to conclude the case in which a Lincolnshire farmer was alleged to have ill-treated his wife. He will be greatly missed by the poor, for whose benefit he had a fund and a clothes-box, and no needy person ever came before him without being assisted. Recently he was instrumental in inducing the Home Secretary to issue a public warning to parents on the subject of fireguards, and in not a few instances he has supplied them to poor people at his own expense. He never allowed an act of bravery to go unrewarded. To some extent the marked diminution in cases of baby-farming is due to Mr Hicks's searching inquiries, while he was also in a great measure responsible for the licensing of small boats and the alteration in the law restricting the sale of carbolic acid. Mr Hicks leaves a widow and a son and daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=DEATH OF MR BRAXTON HICKS|last=|first=|date=24 May 1902|work=Richmond Herald|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, when a standardized uniform did not yet exist in the [[U.S. Navy]], some sailors adopted a style of wide trousers ending in bell-shaped cuffs.&lt;ref name="ohl"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ohl, Bob|url=http://history.navy.mil/library/online/uniform_bell.htm|title=Have Bell Bottoms...Will Travel|journal=All Hands|volume=460|date=June 1955|pages=28–30.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430000106/http://history.navy.mil/library/online/uniform_bell.htm|archivedate=2007-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dervis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dervis|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409134729/http://www.madetomeasuremag.com/features/pre2003/953843329.html|archivedate=2006-04-09|url=http://www.madetomeasuremag.com/features/pre2003/953843329.html|title=Bell Bottom Blues|work=Made to Measure Magazine|date=March 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mil"/&gt; In 1813, one of the first recorded descriptions of [[sailor]]s' uniforms, written by [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Stephen Decatur]], noted that the men on the frigates ''United States'' and ''Macedonia'' were wearing "glazed [[canvas]] [[hat]]s with stiff brims, decked with streamers of [[ribbon]], blue jackets buttoned loosely over [[waistcoat]]s, and blue trousers with bell bottoms."&lt;ref name="ohl"/&gt;

The British [[Royal Navy]] had often been a leader in nautical fashion, but bell-bottoms did not become part of the standard uniform until the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="dervis"/&gt; These "bell-bottoms" were often just very wide-legged trousers, rather than shaped trousers that flared below the knee.&lt;ref name="dervis"/&gt; They continued in use as a distinctive feature of the RN rating's "[[square rig]]" uniform until replaced by more conventionally flared trousers in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial War Museum http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30090214&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the trousers of the present-day uniform of the [[United States Navy]] are still referred to as "bell-bottomed", they simply have large straight legs. The wearer's thigh fills the upper trouser leg, making the bottom of the pants leg appear flared. This style has been popular for many years, perhaps originally because the trouser leg can be rolled up easily, allowing the wearer to work in bare feet, but there is no reliable documentation that confirms a specific timeline or reason for the popularity of bell-bottomed trousers in naval apparel.&lt;ref name="dervis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mil"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Department of the Navy Bureau of Naval Personnel|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/uniform_history.htm|title=History of U.S. Navy Uniforms: Appendix 2|work=United States Navy Uniform Regulations|location=                  Washington, DC|publisher=US Government Printing Office|year=1981}} NavPers 15665D.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s===
In the 1960s, bell-bottoms became fashionable for both men and women in Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news|author=Cobb, Nathan|title=Bell-bottoms back, but the thrill is gone|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often made of denim, they flared out from the bottom of the calf, and had slightly curved hems and a circumference of {{convert|18|in|cm}} at the bottom of each leg opening. They were usually worn with [[High-heeled footwear#Men and heels|Cuban-heeled]] shoes, [[Clog (shoe)|clogs]], or [[Chelsea boot]]s. [[Toni Basil]], who was a [[go-go dancing|go-go dancer]] when the 1964 concert film the ''[[T.A.M.I. Show]]'' was released, appeared in the film wearing bell-bottoms with a baby doll blouse.

[[Image:Redhead Beach Bell Bottoms.jpg|thumb|upright|1970s bell-bottoms]]
Bell-bottoms are mentioned in the popular 1971 music single "[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]" by blues-rock group [[Derek and the Dominos]].

In the 1970s, bell-bottoms moved back into mainstream fashion;&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; [[Sonny and Cher]] helped popularize bell-bottoms in the US by wearing them on [[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour|their popular television show]].&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; The pants were typically flared from the knee down, with bottom leg openings of up to twenty-six inches. Made from denim, bright cotton and satin polyester, they were so popular that they became a symbol of the outlandish and colorful style of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Bell-Bottoms.aspx |title=Bell-Bottoms Facts |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Loon pants'' (shortened from "balloon pants") were a variant on bell-bottomed trousers, with an increased flare. They were worn occasionally by go-go dancers on the British television music variety show ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' in 1966.

''Elephant bells'', popular in the mid-to-late 1970s, were similar to loon pants, but were typically made of [[denim]]. Elephant bells had a marked flare below the knee, often covering the wearer's shoes. The preferred shoes were [[platform shoes]] with [[sole (shoe)|soles]] at least {{convert|2|in|cm}} thick and heels {{convert|4|to|5|in|cm}} to keep the pants' hems off the ground.

After the rise of [[punk rock]] in the late 1970s, bell-bottoms began to become less-fashionable as the decade drew to a close. By 1979, skin-tight trousers or 1950s-style drain pipes were much more in vogue, with bell-bottoms been seen as having had their day, remaining in fashion circa 1968-78.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/jan/24/the-history-of-flares-in-pictures The Guardian - the history of flares]&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival of bell-bottoms occurred after bands such as [[The Stone Roses]], [[Happy Mondays]] and [[The Charlatans (UK band)|The Charlatans]] re-introduced them in late 1989 and the early 1990s.

===Mid-1990s to 2000s===
In 1996, women's bell-bottoms were reintroduced to the mainstream public, under the name "boot-cut" ("boot-fit") trousers as the flare was slimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020162359/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171385/Fashions-Year-In-Review-1996/ |title=Fashions: Year In Review 1996 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999,  flare jeans had come into vogue among women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrowaste.com/1990s/fashion-in-the-1990s/ |title=Fashion in the 1990s |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a wider, more exaggerated flare than boot-cuts (boot-fits). The boot-cut (boot-fit) style ended up dominating the fashion world for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2011254_2014381_2014372,00.html |title=Skinny Jean |work=Time |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By around 2006, the bell-shaped silhouette started to fade as the skinny jean rose in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinny legs and all: Jeans get slender|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-04-16-skinny-jeans_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharon Haver]], the founder and editor-in-chief of [[Online magazine|online fashion magazine]] ''FocusOnStyle.com'', commented "It's as if all the girls wearing premium boot-cut (boot-fit) jeans threw them away one day, and the next day began wearing skinny jeans and flats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/living/2003051369_fashjeans.html |title=Wearer beware of "mom jeans" |accessdate=19 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214019/http://seattletimes.com/html/living/2003051369_fashjeans.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, boot-cuts (boot-fits) and flare jeans never entirely went away, and both of these styles remain relatively popular today{{when|date=February 2018}} both in denim fashion and higher-quality office wear.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Bell-bottomed jeans remain popular today{{when|date=January 2018}} among modern Scandinavian youth.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Women's boot-cut jeans are tighter at the knee than men's, and flare out from knee to hem. Men's styles are traditionally straight-legged, although the pants came in a more flared style in the early and mid 2000s, but this was optional. The bell-bottoms of the 1960s and 1970s can be distinguished from the flare or boot-cut (boot-fit) of the 1990s and 2000s by the tightness of the fabric at the knee.

Friar '''Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro''' ({{IPA-es|beˈnito xeˈɾonimo feiˈxoo}}; 8 October 1676{{snd}}26 September 1764) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[monk]] and scholar who led the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Spain.  He was an energetic popularizer noted for encouraging scientific and empirical thought in an effort to debunk myths and superstitions.

==Biography==
He joined the [[Benedictine]] order at the age of 14, and had taken classes in Galicia, [[León, Spain|León]], and [[Salamanca]]. He later taught [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Oviedo|University]], where he earned a professorship in theology.

He was appalled by the superstition and ignorance in his country, and his works aimed at combating the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''History of Spain and Portugal'' (1973) 2:367-71&lt;/ref&gt; His fame spread quickly throughout Europe. His revelations excited considerable opposition in certain quarters in Spain, for example from [[Salvador José Mañer]] and others; but the opposition was futile, and Feijóo's services to the cause of education and knowledge were universally recognized long before his death in [[Oviedo]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Feijóo y Montenegro, Benito Jerónimo|volume=10|pages=237-238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later [[Alberto Lista]] said that a monument should be erected to Feijóo, at the foot of which all his works should be burned. He was not a great genius, nor a writer of transcendent merit; his name is connected with no important discovery, but his literary style is clear and not without distinction. He tried to uproot many popular errors, awakened an interest in [[scientific method]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2012/10/feijoo-and-his-magisterio-de-la-experiencia-lessons-of-experience/ |title=Feijoo and his ‘Magisterio de la experiencia’ (lessons of experience) – Early Modern Experimental Philosophy, University of Otago, New Zealand |publisher=Blogs.otago.ac.nz |date=2012-10-29 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is justly regarded as the initiator of educational reform in Spain.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Works==
His two famous works, ''Teatro crítico universal'' (1726–1739) and ''Cartas eruditas y curiosas'' (1742–1760), are multi-volume collections of essays that cover a range of subjects, from natural history and the then known sciences, education, history, religion, literature, philology, philosophy and medicine, down to superstitions, wonders and salient points of contemporary journalistic interest. In the edition of 1777 they occupy nine and five volumes respectively, to which three supplementary volumes must be added. A reprint occurs in volume 56 of the ''Biblioteca de autores españoles'', with an introduction by Vicente de la Fuente. As learning advanced, his writings were relatively relegated to a place of historical and literary interest. The majority of his works were translated into English by Captain [[John Brett (Royal Navy officer)|John Brett]] (3 vols., 1777-1780).

The [[bronze]] '''centenionalis''' [[coin]]s (plural: '''centenionales''') were the attempts of [[Constans]] and [[Constantius II]] to reintroduce a large bronze coin between 320 and 340&amp;nbsp;AD, as the [[follis]] had by then shrunk dramatically. The type of coin it was is uncertain, but numismatists have categorized large bronze coins of the above date under this denomination. The centenionalis, however, did not last long. By the end of [[Theodosius I|Theodosius the Great]]'s rule, only [[Constantinian bronzes|smaller varieties of bronze coins]] were minted (AE3 and AE4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadromans.com/coins/default.htm#Common%20Denominations/ Denominations of Roman coins]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tsezarskaya zabava.JPG|thumb|"Caesar's Joy" by Vasiliy Polenov]]

'''''Damnatio ad bestias''''' ([[Latin]] for "condemnation to beasts") was a form of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[capital punishment]] in which the condemned  person was killed by wild animals. This form of execution, which first came to [[ancient Rome]] around the 2nd century BC, was part of the wider class of [[blood sports]] called ''[[Bestiarii]]''. 

The act of ''damnatio ad bestias'' was considered entertainment for the [[Plebs|lower classes of Rome]]. Killing by wild animals, such as [[lion]]s, formed part of the [[inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre]] in 80 AD. Between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, this penalty was also applied to the worst criminals, runaway slaves, and [[Early Christianity|Christians]].

==History==

The exact purpose of the early ''damnatio ad bestias'' is not known and might have been a religious sacrifice rather than a legal punishment,&lt;ref name="blo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alison Futrell|title=Blood in the Arena: The Spectacle of Roman Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vn3bIZqKB4AC&amp;pg=PA177|accessdate=29 January 2011|date=November 2000|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-72523-2|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the regions where lions existed naturally and were revered by the population, such as Africa and parts of Asia. For example, Egyptian mythology had a chimeric Underworld demon, [[Ammit]], who devoured the souls of exceptionally sinful humans, as well as other lion-like deities, such as [[Sekhmet]], who, according to legend, almost devoured all of humanity soon after her birth. There are also accounts of feeding lions and crocodiles with humans, both dead and alive, in [[Ancient Egypt]] and Libya.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Similar condemnations are described by historians of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] campaigns in Central Asia. A Macedonian named [[Lysimachus]], who spoke before Alexander for a person condemned to death, was himself thrown to a lion, but overcame the beast with his bare hands and became one of Alexander's favorites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoliolib.info/philol/gasparov/zgrec/604.html Гаспаров М.Л. Занимательная Греция]. Infoliolib.info.

General History of I 82, 2&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Hannibal]] forced Romans captured in the [[Punic Wars]] to fight each other, and the survivors had to stand against elephants.&lt;ref name="pliniy"&gt;''[[Pliny the Elder]]''. Natural history. VIII, Sec. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bestiarii.jpg|thumb|Gladiators in the circus arena, [[Zliten mosaic]], 1st century AD]]
Lions were rare in Ancient Rome, and human sacrifice was banned there by [[Numa Pompilius]] in the 7th century BC, according to legend. ''Damnatio ad bestias'' appeared there not as a spiritual practice but rather a spectacle. In addition to lions, other animals were used for this purpose, including bears, [[leopard]]s, [[Caspian tiger]]s, and [[black panther]]s. It was combined with gladiatorial combat and was first featured at the [[Roman Forum]] and then transferred to the [[amphitheater]]s.

===Terminology===
Whereas the term ''damnatio ad bestias'' is usually used in a broad sense, historians distinguish two subtypes: ''objicĕre bestiis'' {{fact|reason=Cyrillic mixed with Latin|date=August 2018}}(to devour by beasts) where the humans are defenseless, and ''damnatio ad bestias'', where the punished are both expected and prepared to fight.&lt;ref name="tir"&gt;Тираспольский Г. И. Беседы с палачом. Казни, пытки и суровые наказания в Древнем Риме (Conversations with an executioner. Executions, torture and harsh punishment in ancient Rome). Moscow, 2003. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were professional beast fighters trained in special schools, such as the Roman Morning School, which received its name by the timing of the games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invictory.org/lib/2004/05/gladiatory.html Библиотека]. Invictory.org. Retrieved 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These schools taught not only fighting but also the behavior and taming of animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4ygeca.com/gladiators.html Гладиаторы]. 4ygeca.com. Retrieved 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The fighters were released into the arena dressed in a tunic and armed only with a spear (occasionally with a sword). They were sometimes assisted by [[Venator (gladiator type)|venators]] (hunters),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/gladiatr/venatio1.htm|title=Venatio I|author=|date=|website=cuny.edu|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used bows, spears and whips. Such group fights were not human executions but rather staged animal fighting and hunting. Various animals were used, such as [[hyena]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[wild boar]]s, [[Cape Buffalo|buffalo]]es, [[bear]]s, [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[bull]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], and [[leopard]]s. The first such staged hunting ({{lang-la|venatio}}) featured lions and panthers, and was arranged by [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Nobilior]] in 186 BC at the [[Circus Maximus]] on the occasion of the Greek conquest of [[Aetolia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Livy]]''.

===History and description===

He ordered that a young fair Christian woman be put to death in the same way as part of the games at the amphitheatre.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Emperor Nero's wish, the woman, like mythological [[Dirce]], was tied to a wild bull and dragged around the arena.]]

The custom of submitting criminals to lions was brought to ancient Rome by two commanders, [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus]], who defeated the Macedonians in  186 BC, and his son [[Scipio Aemilianus]], who conquered the African city of [[Carthage]] in 146 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Livy]]''.

Rome reserved its earliest use for non-Roman military allies found guilty of defection or desertion.&lt;ref name="blo"/&gt; The sentenced were tied to columns or thrown to the animals, practically defenseless (i.e. ''objicĕre bestiis'').

Some documented examples of ''damnatio ad bestias'' in Ancient Rome include the following: [[Strabo]] witnessed&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, VI, II, 6&lt;/ref&gt; the execution of the rebel slaves' leader Selur.&lt;ref name="serg"/&gt; The bandit Laureolus was crucified and then devoured by an eagle and a bear, as described by the poet [[Martial]] in his ''Book of Spectacles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martialis|title=Liber spectaculorum|url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost01/Martialis/mar_spec.html|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martialis.net/index.xps?2.15.1180 MARTIALIS.NET, М.

===Execution of Christians===

[[File:Herbert schmalz28.jpg|300px|thumb|"Faithful Unto Death" by [[Herbert Schmalz]]]]
The use of ''damnatio ad bestias'' against Christians began in the 1st century AD. [[Tacitus]] states that during the first persecution of Christians under the reign of [[Nero]] (after the [[Fire of Rome]] in 64), people were wrapped in animal skins (called ''[[tunica molesta]]'') and thrown to dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus. Annals, XV, 44&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was followed by other emperors who moved it into the arena and used larger animals. Application of ''damnatio ad bestias'' to Christians was intended to equate them with the worst criminals, who were usually punished this way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murders.ru/Kistyacovsky_4.html Murders]. Murders.ru. Retrieved 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a widespread view among contemporary specialists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/secrets-of-the-colosseum-75827047/?no-ist|title=Secrets of the Colosseum|author=|date=|website=smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the prominence of Christians among those condemned to death in the Roman arena was greatly exaggerated in earlier times. There is no evidence for Christians being executed at the [[Colosseum]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=Hopkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=Keith|title=The Colosseum|date=2011|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=978-1846684708|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roman law]]s, Christians were:&lt;ref name="brok"&gt;[http://www.ateismy.net/content/spravochnik/history/gonenija_rim.html Гонения на христиан в Римской империи]. Ateismy.net. Retrieved 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
# Guilty of high treason ''(majestatis rei)''
## For their worship Christians gathered in secret and at night, making [[unlawful assembly]], and participation in such ''collegium illicitum'' or ''coetus nocturni'' was equated with a riot.
## For their refusal to honor images of the emperor by [[libation]]s and incense
# Dissenters from the state gods (άθεοι, ''sacrilegi'')
# Followers of magic prohibited by law (''magi, malefici'')
# Confessors of a religion unauthorized by the law  (''religio nova, peregrina et illicita''), according to the [[Twelve Tables]]).

The spread of the practice of throwing Christians to beasts was reflected by the Christian writer [[Tertullian]] (2nd century). He states that the general public blamed Christians for any general misfortune and after natural disasters would cry "Away with them to the lions!" This is the only reference from contemporaries mentioning Christians being thrown specifically to lions. Tertullian also wrote that Christians started avoiding theaters and circuses, which were associated with the place of their torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.biblion.realin.ru/soft/1_BibleQuote/BibleQuote/Christian30-1000/Tertullian.htm О прескрипции против еретиков]&lt;/ref&gt; ''"[[The Passion of St. Perpetua, St. Felicitas, and their Companions]]"'', a text which purports to be an eyewitness account of a group of Christians condemned to ''damnatio ad bestias'' at Carthage in 203, states that the men were required to dress in the robes of a priest of the Roman god [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], the women as priestesses of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and were shown to the crowd as such. The men and women were brought back out in separate groups and first the men, then the women, exposed to a variety of wild beasts. The victims were chained  to poles or elevated platforms. Those who survived the first animal attacks were either brought back out for further exposure to the beasts or executed in public by a [[gladiator]].&lt;ref name=Bomgardner&gt;{{cite book|last=Bomgardner|first=D.L.|title=The Story of the Roman Amphitheatre|date=10 October 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415301855|pages=141–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The persecution of Christians ceased by the 4th century. The [[Edict of Milan]] (313) gave them freedom of religion.

===Penalty for other crimes===
Roman laws, which are known to us through the Byzantine collections, such as the [[Code of Theodosius]] and [[Code of Justinian]], defined which criminals could be thrown to beasts (or condemned by other means). They included:
*Deserters from the army&lt;ref name="yust3"/&gt;

*Political criminals. For example, after the overthrow and assassination of [[Commodus]], the new emperor threw to lions both the servants of Commodus and [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]] who strangled him.

The '''Day of the Dead''' ({{lang-es|Día de Muertos}}&lt;!-- Please do not change "Día de Muertos&amp;nbsp;— it is correct, it does not need the word "los". --&gt;) is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] holiday celebrated throughout Mexico, in particular the Central and South regions, and by people of Mexican heritage elsewhere. The multi-day holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their spiritual journey. In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00054 |title= Indigenous festivity dedicated to the dead |publisher= UNESCO |accessdate= October 31, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141011212818/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00054# |archive-date= October 11, 2014 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly celebrated in Mexico where the day is a [[public holiday]]. Prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century, the celebration took place at the beginning of summer. Gradually, it was associated with October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the Western Christianity [[triduum]] of [[Allhallowtide]]: [[All Saints' Eve]], [[All Saints' Day]], and [[All Souls' Day]].&lt;ref name=Latina-p72&gt;{{cite book | title = Latina and Latino Voices in Literature | first = Frances Ann | last = Day | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2003 | page = 72 | isbn = 978-0313323942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | work = The Bread Basket | publisher = Rex Bookstore, Inc. | pages = 23-23 | title = All Soul's Day | first = Weely A. | last = Lumaban | volume = V | number = 3 | date = October–November 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CZF7U1c4zRgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ''[[ofrenda]]s'', honoring the deceased using [[calavera]]s, [[Tagetes erecta|aztec marigolds]], and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/media/dia-de-los-muertos/|title=Dia de los Muertos|publisher=National Geographic Society|access-date=November 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102180955/http://nationalgeographic.org/media/dia-de-los-muertos/#|archive-date=November 2, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors also leave possessions of the deceased at the graves.

Scholars trace the origins of the modern Mexican holiday to indigenous observances dating back hundreds of years and to an [[Aztec]] [[festival]] dedicated to the [[goddess]] [[Mictecacihuatl]]. The holiday has spread throughout the world, being absorbed into other deep traditions in honor of the dead. It has become a national symbol and as such is taught (for educational purposes) in the nation's schools. Many families celebrate a traditional "[[All Saints' Day]]" associated with the Catholic Church.

Originally, the Day of the Dead as such was not celebrated in northern Mexico, where it was unknown until the 20th century because its indigenous people had different traditions. The people and the church rejected it as a day related to [[Syncretism|syncretizing]] pagan elements with Catholic Christianity. They held the traditional '[[All Saints' Day]]' in the same way as other Christians in the world. There was limited [[Mesoamerican]] influence in this region, and relatively few indigenous inhabitants from the regions of Southern Mexico, where the holiday was celebrated. In the early 21st century in northern Mexico, Día de Muertos is observed because the Mexican government made it a national holiday based on educational policies from the 1960s; it has introduced this holiday as a unifying national tradition based on indigenous traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stacy|last=Lee|title=Mexico and the United States|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|date=2002|isbn=0761474021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariocultura.mx/2012/11/dia-de-muertos-en-nuevo-leon/|title=Día de Muertos en Nuevo León|work=Diario Cultura|first=Eduardo|last=Cazares|date=November 2, 2015|publisher=Diario Cultura.mx|access-date=November 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101013136/http://www.diariocultura.mx/2012/11/dia-de-muertos-en-nuevo-leon/#|archive-date=November 1, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/monterrey/velorio-penas-pan_0_182981745.html|title=Hasta en el velorio, las penas con pan son menos|first=Gustavo|last=Mendoza|work=Milenio|access-date=November 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025091235/http://www.milenio.com/monterrey/velorio-penas-pan_0_182981745.html#|archive-date=October 25, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican Day of the Dead celebration is similar to other societies' observances of a time to honor the dead. The Spanish tradition, for instance, includes festivals and parades, as well as gatherings of families at cemeteries to pray for their deceased loved ones at the end of the day.&lt;ref name=donQuijote&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.donquijote.org/culture/spain/society/holidays/dia-de-todos-los-santos |title= Dia de Todos los Santos: All Saints' Day in Spain |work= don Quijote |publisher= Ideal Education Group S.L. |access-date= September 29, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170929184224/http://www.donquijote.org/culture/spain/society/holidays/dia-de-todos-los-santos# |archive-date= September 29, 2017 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Mixquic Mágico 17.jpg|thumb|Woman lighting [[copal]] incense at the cemetery during the "Alumbrada" vigil in [[San Andrés Mixquic]] ]]
The Day of the Dead celebrations in [[Mexico]] developed from ancient traditions among its pre-Columbian cultures. Rituals celebrating the deaths of [[ancestor worship|ancestors]] had been observed by these civilizations perhaps for as long as 2,500–3,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The festival that developed into the modern Day of the Dead fell in the ninth month of the [[Aztec calendar]], about the beginning of August, and was celebrated for an entire month. The festivities were dedicated to the goddess&lt;ref name="Salvador"&gt;{{cite book

By the late 20th century in most regions of Mexico, practices had developed to honor dead children and infants on November 1, and to honor deceased adults on November 2. November 1 is generally referred to as ''Día de los Inocentes'' ("Day of the Innocents") but also as ''Día de los Angelitos'' ("Day of the Little Angels"); November 2 is referred to as ''Día de los Muertos'' or ''Día de los Difuntos'' ("Day of the Dead").&lt;ref name="MexConnect"&gt;{{cite web

In the 2015 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', the opening sequence features a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City. At the time, no such parade took place in Mexico City; one year later, due to the interest in the film and the government desire to promote the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic]] Mexican culture, the federal and local authorities decided to organize an actual "Día de Muertos" parade through [[Paseo de la Reforma]] and [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro Historico]] on October 29, 2016, which was attended by 250,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37813562|title=Mexico City stages first Day of the Dead parade|date=October 29, 2016|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=November 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030142729/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37813562#|archive-date=October 30, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/comunidad/2016/10/30/1125178#imagen-3|title=Fotogalería: Desfile por Día de Muertos reúne a 250 mil personas|date=October 29, 2016|work=[[Excélsior]]|language=spanish|accessdate=November 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031150523/http://www.excelsior.com.mx/comunidad/2016/10/30/1125178%23#imagen-3#imagen-3|archive-date=October 31, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticieros.televisa.com/fotos/mexico/2016-10-29/desfile-dia-muertos-cdmx.photo-1/|title=Galerías Archivo|publisher=Televisa News|access-date=November 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103235844/http://noticieros.televisa.com/fotos/mexico/2016-10-29/desfile-dia-muertos-cdmx.photo-1/#|archive-date=November 3, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frances Ann Day summarizes the three-day celebration, the Day of the Dead:
{{Centered pull quote|On October 31, All Hallows Eve, the children make a children's altar to invite the ''angelitos'' (spirits of dead children) to come back for a visit. November 1 is All Saints Day, and the adult spirits will come to visit. November 2 is All Souls Day, when families go to the cemetery to decorate the graves and tombs of their relatives. The three-day fiesta is filled with marigolds, the flowers of the dead; ''muertos'' (the bread of the dead); sugar skulls; cardboard skeletons; tissue paper decorations; fruit and nuts; incense, and other traditional foods and decorations.|author= Frances Ann  Day|source = ''Latina and Latino Voices in Literature''&lt;ref name=Latina-p72 /&gt;}}
People go to cemeteries to be with the souls of the departed and build private altars containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them. Celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about the departed.&lt;ref name="MexConnect" /&gt;

{{Multiple image|image1 = Cempasuchil.jpg|image2 = Catrina 3.jpg|caption1 = Mexican [[Tagetes erecta|cempasúchil]] (marigold) is the traditional flower used to honor the dead.|caption2 = Cempasúchil, [[alfeñique]]s and [[papel picado]] used to decorate an altar|width1 = 165|width2 = 165|align = left}}
Plans for the day are made throughout the year, including gathering the goods to be offered to the dead. During the three-day period families usually clean and decorate graves;&lt;ref name="Salvador" /&gt; most visit the cemeteries where their loved ones are buried and decorate their graves with ''[[ofrenda (ritual offering)|ofrendas]]'' (altars), which often include orange Mexican marigolds (''[[Tagetes erecta]]'') called ''cempasúchil'' (originally named ''cempoaxochitl'', [[Nahuatl language|Nāhuatl]] for "twenty flowers"). In modern Mexico the marigold is sometimes called ''Flor de Muerto'' (Flower of Dead). These flowers are thought to attract [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] of the dead to the offerings. It is also believed the bright petals with a strong scent can guide the souls from cemeteries to their family homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://insider.si.edu/2016/10/5-facts-dia-de-los-muertos-day-dead/|title=5 Facts About Día de los Muertos (The Day of the Dead)|publisher=Smithsonian Insider|date=30 October 2016|access-date=August 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829175320/https://insider.si.edu/2016/10/5-facts-dia-de-los-muertos-day-dead/#|archive-date=August 29, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toys are brought for dead children (''los angelitos'', or "the little angels"), and bottles of ''[[tequila]], [[mezcal]]'' or ''[[pulque]]'' or jars of ''[[atole]]'' for adults. Families will also offer trinkets or the deceased's favorite candies on the grave. Some families have ''ofrendas'' in homes, usually with foods such as candied pumpkin, ''[[pan de muerto]]'' ("bread of dead"), and [[sugar skull]]s; and beverages such as ''atole''. The ''ofrendas'' are left out in the homes as a welcoming gesture for the deceased.&lt;ref name="Salvador" /&gt; Some people believe the spirits of the dead eat the "spiritual essence" of the ''ofrendas'' food, so though the celebrators eat the food after the festivities, they believe it lacks nutritional value. Pillows and blankets are left out so the deceased can rest after their long journey. In some parts of Mexico, such as the towns of [[San Andrés Mixquic|Mixquic]], [[Pátzcuaro]] and [[Janitzio]], people spend all night beside the graves of their relatives. In many places, people have picnics at the grave site, as well.

[[File:CemetarioAlmoloyaRio1995.jpg|thumb|Families tidying and decorating graves at a cemetery in [[Almoloya del Río]] in the [[State of Mexico]], 1995]]
Some families build [[altar]]s or small [[shrine]]s in their homes;&lt;ref name="Salvador" /&gt; these sometimes feature a [[Christian cross]], statues or pictures of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], pictures of deceased relatives and other people, scores of candles, and an ''ofrenda''. Traditionally, families spend some time around the altar, praying and telling anecdotes about the deceased. In some locations, celebrants wear shells on their clothing, so when they dance, the noise will wake up the dead; some will also dress up as the deceased.

Public schools at all levels build altars with ''ofrendas'', usually omitting the religious symbols. Government offices usually have at least a small altar, as this holiday is seen as important to the Mexican heritage.

Those with a distinctive talent for writing sometimes create short poems, called ''calaveras'' (skulls), mocking [[epitaph]]s of friends, describing interesting habits and attitudes or funny anecdotes. This custom originated in the 18th or 19th century after a newspaper published a poem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future, "and all of us were dead", proceeding to read the tombstones. [[Newspaper]]s dedicate ''&lt;span lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;calaveras&lt;/span&gt;'' to public figures, with [[cartoon]]s of [[skeleton]]s in the style of the famous ''[[calavera]]s'' of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], a Mexican illustrator. [[Theatre|Theatrical]] presentations of ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' by [[José Zorrilla y Moral|José Zorrilla]] (1817–1893) are also traditional on this day.

[[File:Catrinas 2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Modern representations of [[La Calavera Catrina|La Catrina]]]]
José Guadalupe Posada created a famous print of a figure he called ''[[La Calavera Catrina|&lt;span lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;La Calavera Catrina&lt;/span&gt;]]'' ("The Elegant Skull") as a parody of a Mexican upper-class female. Posada's striking image of a costumed female with a skeleton face has become associated with the Day of the Dead, and Catrina figures often are a prominent part of modern Day of the Dead observances.

A common [[symbol]] of the holiday is the skull (in Spanish ''[[calavera]]''), which celebrants represent in [[mask]]s, called ''[[calaca]]s'' (colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as sugar or chocolate skulls, which are inscribed with the name of the recipient on the forehead. Sugar skulls can be given as gifts to both the living and the dead. Other holiday foods include ''pan de muerto'', a sweet [[egg (food)|egg]] bread made in various shapes from plain rounds to skulls and [[rabbit]]s, often decorated with white frosting to look like twisted bones.

The traditions and activities that take place in celebration of the Day of the Dead are not universal, often varying from town to town. For example, in the town of [[Pátzcuaro]] on the [[Lago de Pátzcuaro]] in [[Michoacán]], the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult. On November 1 of the year after a child's death, the [[godparents]] set a table in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, ''&lt;span lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;pan de muerto&lt;/span&gt;'', a cross, a rosary (used to ask the Virgin Mary to pray for them) and candles. This is meant to celebrate the child's life, in respect and appreciation for the parents. There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped masks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town. At midnight on November 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called ''mariposas'' (butterflies) to Janitzio, an island in the middle of the lake where there is a cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.

In contrast, the town of [[Ocotepec, Cuernavaca, Morelos|Ocotepec]], north of [[Cuernavaca]] in the State of [[Morelos]], opens its doors to visitors in exchange for ''&lt;span lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;veladoras&lt;/span&gt;'' (small wax candles) to show respect for the recently deceased. In return the visitors receive [[tamales]] and ''atole''. This is done only by the owners of the house where someone in the household has died in the previous year. Many people of the surrounding areas arrive early to eat for free and enjoy the elaborate altars set up to receive the visitors.

In some parts of the country (especially the cities, where in recent years other customs have been displaced) children in costumes roam the streets, knocking on people's doors for a ''&lt;span lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;calaverita&lt;/span&gt;'', a small gift of candies or money; they also ask passersby for it. This relatively recent custom is similar to that of [[Halloween|Halloween's]] [[trick-or-treating]] in the United States. Another peculiar tradition involving kids is La Danza de los Viejitos (the dance of the old men) when boy and young men dressed as granpas crouch and then jump in an energetic dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/mexico/dia-de-los-muertos-or-day-of-the-dead|title=Día de los Muertos or Day of the Dead|access-date=August 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829175333/https://rove.me/to/mexico/dia-de-los-muertos-or-day-of-the-dead#|archive-date=August 29, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people believe possessing Day of the Dead items can bring good luck. Many people get tattoos or have dolls of the dead to carry with them. They also clean their houses and prepare the favorite dishes of their deceased loved ones to place upon their altar or ''ofrenda''.

===Food===
During Day of the Dead festivities, food is both eaten by living people and given to the spirits of their departed ancestors as ''ofrendas'' ("offerings").&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Day of the Dead Sweets and Treats | url = http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/day-of-the-dead-sweets-and-treats | accessdate = July 1, 2015 | work = History Stories | first = Gayle | last = Turim | date = November 2, 2012 | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150606104432/http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/day-of-the-dead-sweets-and-treats# | archive-date = June 6, 2015 | dead-url = no | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tamales]] are one of the most common dishes prepared for this day for both purposes.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godoy|first1=Maria|title=Sugar Skulls, Tamales And More: Why Is That Food On The Day Of The Dead Altar?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/11/01/500242132/sugar-skulls-tamales-and-more-why-is-that-food-on-the-day-of-the-dead-altar|publisher=NPR|accessdate=October 25, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043035/http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/11/01/500242132/sugar-skulls-tamales-and-more-why-is-that-food-on-the-day-of-the-dead-altar#|archive-date=October 28, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Pan de muerto]]'' and [[calavera]]s are associated specifically with Day of the Dead. ''Pan de muerto'' is a type of sweet roll shaped like a bun, topped with sugar, and often decorated with bone-shaped phalanges pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castella|first1=Krystina|title=Pan de Muerto Recipe|url=http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pan-de-muerto-361449|accessdate=July 7, 2015|publisher=[[Epicurious]]|date=October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708165548/http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pan-de-muerto-361449#|archive-date=July 8, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calaveras, or sugar skulls, display colorful designs to represent the vitality and individual personality of the departed.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

In addition to food, drink is also important to the tradition of Day of the Dead. Historically, the main alcoholic drink was [[pulque]] while today families will commonly drink the favorite beverage of their deceased ancestors.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Other drinks associated with the holiday are [[atole]] and [[champurrado]], warm, thick, non-alcoholic [[masa]] drinks.

Jamaican iced tea is a popular herbal tea made of the flowers and leaves of the Jamaican hibiscus plant (''[[Hibiscus sabdariffa]]''), known as ''flor de Jamaica'' in Mexico. It is served cold and quite sweet with a lot of ice. The ruby-red beverage is called [[hibiscus tea]] in English-speaking countries and called ''agua de Jamaica'' (water of [[Jamaica]]) in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamaica iced tea|url=http://cookinginmexico.com/2011/09/28/jamaica-iced-tea/|publisher=Cooking in Mexico|accessdate=October 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104072645/http://cookinginmexico.com/2011/09/28/jamaica-iced-tea/|archivedate=November 4, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
====Belize====
In [[Belize]], Day of the Dead is practiced by people of the [[Yucatec Maya]] ethnicity. The celebration is known as ''Hanal Pixan'' which means "food for the souls" in their language. Altars are constructed and decorated with food, drinks, candies, and candles put on them.

====Bolivia====
''&lt;span lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;Día de las Ñatitas&lt;/span&gt;'' ("Day of the Skulls") is a festival celebrated in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], on May 5. In [[pre-Columbian]] times indigenous Andeans had a tradition of sharing a day with the bones of their ancestors on the third year after burial. Today families keep only the skulls for such rituals. Traditionally, the skulls of family members are kept at home to watch over the family and protect them during the year. On November 9, the family crowns the skulls with fresh flowers, sometimes also dressing them in various garments, and making offerings of cigarettes, coca leaves, alcohol, and various other items in thanks for the year's protection. The skulls are also sometimes taken to the central cemetery in La Paz for a special Mass and blessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guidi |first=Ruxandra |title=Las Natitas |publisher=BBC |date=November 9, 2007 |url=http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/13922&amp;answer=true |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206010457/http://www.theworld.org/?q=node%2F13922&amp;answer=true |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Fiona | title = Bolivians Honor Skull-Toting Tradition | agency = Associated Press | date = November 8, 2005 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/bolivia/skulls.htm | accessdate = December 30, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218053817/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/bolivia/skulls.htm# | archive-date = February 18, 2008 | dead-url = no | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Bolivia Line (May 2005) | title = All Saints day in Bolivia&amp;nbsp;– "The skull festival" | accessdate = December 20, 2007 | url = http://www.bolivialine.com/bolivia/newsletter/Newsletter200511.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081023143422/http://www.bolivialine.com/bolivia/newsletter/Newsletter200511.htm# | archive-date = October 23, 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
The [[Brazil]]ian public holiday of ''Finados'' (Day of the Dead) is celebrated on November 2. Similar to other Day of the Dead celebrations, people go to cemeteries and churches with flowers and candles and offer prayers. The celebration is intended as a positive honoring of the dead. Memorializing the dead draws from indigenous, African and European Catholic origins.

====Guatemala====
[[Guatemala]]n celebrations of the Day of the Dead, on November 1, are highlighted by the construction and flying of giant kites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Betsy |last1=Burlingame |first2=Joshua |last2=Wood |url=http://www.expatexchange.com/lib.cfm?networkID=159&amp;articleID=1793 |title=Visit to cemetery in Guatemala |publisher=Expatexchange.com |accessdate=August 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014090440/http://expatexchange.com/lib.cfm?networkID=159&amp;articleID=1793# |archive-date=October 14, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the traditional visits to grave sites of ancestors. A big event also is the consumption of ''[[fiambre]]'', which is made only for this day during the year.

====Ecuador====
In [[Ecuador]] the Day of the Dead is observed to some extent by all parts of society, though it is especially important to the indigenous [[Kichwa]] peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. ''Indigena'' families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include ''[[colada morada]]'', a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the [[Rubus|Andean blackberry]] and purple maize. This is typically consumed with ''[[guagua de pan]]'', a bread shaped like a swaddled infant, though variations include many pigs—the latter being traditional to the city of [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]]. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with [[masa]] in the [[pre-Columbian]] era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of [[guava paste]]. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both ''colada morada'' and ''gaugua de pan'' to their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gonzalo |last=Ortiz |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=53407 |title=Diversity in Remembering the Dead |publisher=InterPress Service News Agency |date=October 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104043236/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=53407 |archivedate=November 4, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Old Town San Diego, California annually hosts a traditional two-day celebration culminating in a candlelight procession to the historic El Campo Santo Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sddayofthedead.org/|title=Old Town San Diego's Dia de los Muertos|accessdate=October 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107110640/http://sddayofthedead.org/#|archive-date=November 7, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival also is held annually at historic Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood. Sponsored by Forest Hills Educational Trust and the folkloric performance group La Piñata, the Day of the Dead festivities celebrate the cycle of life and death. People bring offerings of flowers, photos, mementos, and food for their departed loved ones, which they place at an elaborately and colorfully decorated altar. A program of traditional music and dance also accompanies the community event.

The [[Smithsonian Institution]], in collaboration with the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] and [[Second Life]], have created a Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum and accompanying multimedia e-book: ''Día de los Muertos: Day of the Dead''. The project's website contains some of the text and images which explain the origins of some of the customary core practices related to the Day of the Dead, such as the background beliefs and the ''offrenda'' (the special altar commemorating one's deceased loved one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Día de los Muertos: Day of the Dead |author=Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum |url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/dia-de-los-muertos/id930169569?mt=11 |edition=Version 1.2 |access-date=October 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222045935/https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/dia-de-los-muertos/id930169569?mt=11# |archive-date=December 22, 2014 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Made For [[iTunes]] multimedia e-book version provides additional content, such as further details; additional photo galleries; pop-up profiles of influential Latino artists and cultural figures over the decades; and video clips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Ustream|title=Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum|url=http://www.ustream.tv/channel/smithsonian-latino-virtual-museum|access-date=October 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031140943/http://www.ustream.tv/channel/smithsonian-latino-virtual-museum#|archive-date=October 31, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; of interviews with artists who make ''Día de Muertos''-themed artwork, explanations and performances of Aztec and other traditional dances, an animation short that explains the customs to children, virtual poetry readings in English and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=Theater of the Dead| url=http://www.latino.si.edu/DayoftheDead/| author=Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum| title=Day of the Dead| access-date=October 31, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112194321/http://latino.si.edu/dayofthedead/#| archive-date=November 12, 2014| dead-url=no| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum Press Release |url=http://www.latino.si.edu/education/LVMDayoftheDeadFestival.htm |title=Smithsonian-UTEP Día de los Muertos Festival: A 2D and 3D Experience! |author=Smithsonian Institution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106113057/http://latino.si.edu/education/LVMDayoftheDeadFestival.htm |archivedate=November 6, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other communities, interactions between Mexican traditions and American culture are resulting in celebrations in which Mexican traditions are being extended to make artistic or sometimes political statements. For example, in [[Los Angeles, California]], the [[Self Help Graphics &amp; Art]] Mexican-American cultural center presents an annual Day of the Dead celebration that includes both traditional and political elements, such as altars to honor the victims of the [[Iraq War]], highlighting the high casualty rate among Latino soldiers. An updated, intercultural version of the Day of the Dead is also evolving at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-dead28oct28,1,2576906.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-california "Making a night of Day of the Dead"] ''Los Angeles Times'' October 18, 2006. Retrieved November 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; There, in a mixture of [[Indigenous peoples of California|Native Californian]] art, Mexican traditions and Hollywood hip, conventional altars are set up side-by-side with altars to [[Jayne Mansfield]] and [[Johnny Ramone]]. Colorful native dancers and music intermix with [[performance art]]ists, while sly [[prank]]sters play on traditional themes.

Similar traditional and intercultural updating of Mexican celebrations are held in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. For example, the [[Galería de la Raza]], SomArts Cultural Center, Mission Cultural Center, [[de Young Museum]] and altars at [[Garfield Square]] by the Marigold Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dayofthedeadsf.org|title=Dia de los Muertos [Day of the Dead] – San Francisco|accessdate=October 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017054851/http://www.dayofthedeadsf.org/#|archive-date=October 17, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakland is home to ''Corazon Del Pueblo'' in the Fruitvale district. ''Corazon Del Pueblo'' has a shop offering handcrafted Mexican gifts and a museum devoted to Day of the Dead artifacts. Also, the Fruitvale district in Oakland serves as the hub of the ''Día de Muertos'' annual festival which occurs the last weekend of October. Here, a mix of several Mexican traditions come together with traditional Aztec dancers, regional Mexican music, and other Mexican artisans to celebrate the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-10-27/news/17664863_1_el-corazon-muertos-altar | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Vicky | last=Elliott | title=Lively Petaluma festival marks Day of the Dead | date=October 27, 2000 | access-date=August 6, 2010 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708031913/http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-10-27/news/17664863_1_el-corazon-muertos-altar# | archive-date=July 8, 2012 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
As part of a promotion by the Mexican embassy in [[Prague, Czech Republic]], since the late 20th century, some local citizens join in a Mexican-style Day of the Dead. A theatre group produces events featuring masks, candles, and sugar skulls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/84857 Day of the Dead in Prague] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024162521/http://www.radio.cz/en/article/84857# |date=October 24, 2007 }}, Radio Czech.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===
Mexican-style Day of the Dead celebrations occur in major cities in [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], and [[Indonesia]]. Additionally, prominent celebrations are held in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, complete with altars celebrating the deceased with flowers and gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0710/S00273.htm |title=Day of the Dead in Wellington, New Zealand |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=October 27, 2007 |accessdate=August 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604023301/http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0710/S00273.htm# |archive-date=June 4, 2009 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Philippines]] "Undás", "Araw ng mga Yumao" (Tagalog, Day of those who have passed away), coincides with the Roman Catholic's celebration of [[All Saint's Day]] and continues on to the following day of [[All Soul's Day]]. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs.

{{Culture of Bolivia}}

The '''Ekeko''' is the [[Tiwanaku|Tiwanakan]] (pre Columbian civilization) god of abundance and prosperity in the [[mythology]] and [[folklore]] of the people from the Andean [[Altiplano]]&lt;ref name="Andean row"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8240248.stm | work=BBC News | title=Andean row over 'good luck' doll | date=6 September 2009 | accessdate=1 May 2010 | first=Dan | last=Collyns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its chief importance in popular culture is as the main figure of the annual [[Alasitas]] fair, a cultural event that happens every January 24th in La Paz, Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alasitas: Bolivia's festival of miniatures|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25949151|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=30 January 2014|author=Paulette Dear}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ekeko is a traditional god of luck and prosperity, popular in [[Bolivia]], [[Cochabamba]], and neighboring regions, like southeast of [[Peru]], northern [[Argentina]] and northern [[Chile]].

==Etymology==
The name '''Ekeko''' comes from the alteration of the original term ''Ekhako'' or ''Eqaqo'', popularized as ''Ekhekho'' which was the ancient god of fortune and prosperity in the [[Qullasuyu]]. The ''Ekhako'' was often invoked when a disgrace disturbed their homes.&lt;ref name="CaceresTerceros"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naya.org.ar/congreso2002/ponencias/fernando_caceres.htm |title=Adaptación y cambio cultural en la feria de Alasitas |author=Cáceres Terceros, Fernando |date=August 2002 |publisher=Ciudad Virtual de Antropologia y Arqueologia, Equipo NAyA |location=Buenos Aires, Argentina |language=Spanish |trans-title=Adaptation and cultural change in the Alasitas fair |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012232229/http://www.naya.org.ar/congreso2002/ponencias/fernando_caceres.htm |archivedate=2009-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Pre-Columbian references===
The scholar [[Ernesto Cavour]] in his book ''Alasitas'', makes reference to [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] stone, mud and gold figures that were found in the areas belonging to the [[Bolivia]]n departments of [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz]], [[Oruro Department|Oruro]] and [[Potosí Department|Potosí]]. Cavour considers that these figures were made using [[basalt]]—extracted from the [[pre-Columbian]] mines in the shores of the [[Lake Poopó]]—and [[andesite]] from the [[Copacabana, Bolivia|Copacabana peninsula]].&lt;ref name="CaceresTerceros" /&gt;

[[Carlos Ponce Sanginés]], for his part, focus his researches in the anthropomorphic figures with [[phallic]] elements and prominent humps which, in his opinion, go back to the [[Inca civilization]] and, according to his observations, they would correspond to the predecessors of  the colonial ''Ekeko''.&lt;ref name="CaceresTerceros" /&gt;

The historian [[Antonio Paredes Candia]] considers that these figures would be the remains of ancient sacred festivities during the [[summer solstice]] in the [[southern hemisphere]]. [[Arthur Posnansky]] also observes that in dates near the 22 December, in the [[Tiwanaku culture]], the population used to worship their deities to ask for good luck, offering miniatures of what they wished to have or achieve.&lt;ref name="CaceresTerceros" /&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Depiction===
[[File:Equeko.jpg|thumb|right|''Ekeko'' figurine attached with a [[United States dollar]] to attract wealth.]]
The '''Ekeko''' is depicted as a man with a mustache wearing traditional Andean clothes (especially the poncho) and completely loaded with bags and baskets with grain and food, (compare with the [[cornucopia]] of some Greco-Roman deities), household objects, and currency bills, and basically anything that a person is thought to want or need to have a comfortable and prosperous life; he is commonly found as a little statue to be put in some place of the house, preferably a comfortable one, but also as an [[amulet]] attached to key rings; modern statues of the god include a circular opening in his mouth in which to place a cigarette for Ekeko's pleasure.  Latest tradition has the Ekeko "smoke" a lit cigarette once a year to ensure a full year of prosperity.

''Ekeko'' should be placed in a place of honor at home. Some versions can be carried in necklaces or key chains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=elc5YDyY4eoC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=Ekeko+Peru&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sTjDTYT4FJK3tweWytTZBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ekeko%20Peru&amp;f=false Page 184]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===
''Ekeko'' brings monetary wealth to its worshippers. An offering is generally required before he provides his services. Banknotes are often clipped to the ''Ekeko'' as offerings, but some statuettes allow for a cigarette to be lit as an offering. The figurines which allow for cigarette offerings have mouth openings large enough for cigarettes to be inserted. ''Ekeko'' additionally provides good harvests when offered grain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=elc5YDyY4eoC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=Ekeko+Peru&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sTjDTYT4FJK3tweWytTZBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ekeko%20Peru&amp;f=false Pages 183-184]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend of Ekeko ==
The legend of the Ekeko, as narrated by [[Antonio Díaz Villamil]], dates around 1781 in La Paz, Bolivia.&lt;ref name="DiazVillamil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bolivian.com/alasitay2k/leyenda.html |title=Leyendas de mi tierra |author=Díaz Villamil, Antonio  |authorlink=Antonio Díaz Villamil |year=2000 |publisher=Ediciones Puerta del Sol |location=La Paz, Bolivia |language=Spanish |trans-title=Legends of my homeland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At this time, the city of La Paz was under siege by indigenous people, who were still at war with Spanish forces.

The story of the origin of the Ekeko starts with Paulita Tintaya, an Indian girl who worked for Doña Josefa Ursula de Rojas Foronda, in La Paz.

The girl was in love with Isidoro Choquewanca. Years before, she had left the hacienda where they both had grown up. Before her departure, Isidoro gave her a small statue to protect her. This small statue was the Ekeko, which was known to Andean people to be a god of fortune and luck.

At the time of the siege, people were starving to death. Isidoro was enrolled in the indigenous army, and he manage to reach Paulina's house. Every week, he left her food near the statue, which was placed outside the house, but nobody knew he was doing it. Both Paulina and her boss, Doña Josefa, were able to survive the siege because of the food left near the statue by Isidoro. That is the origin of the beliefs of Ekeko's powers in providing abundance.

== Central role in the Alasitas festival ==
[[File:Ekeko Bolivia.JPG|200px|right]]
The [[Alasitas]] festival is held for, and hosted by, the Ekeko, each January 24 in La Paz.&lt;ref name="BBCpopfair"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bolivia's popular fairs |author=Estefania, Rafael  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/07/americas_bolivia0s_popular_fairs/html/1.stm |agency=BBC Mundo |accessdate=27 January 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; People attend the event from all over the city and even travel from other cities inside Bolivia to buy miniature versions of goods to give to others, in the hope that the recipient will receive the real item during the coming year. 

Throughout other regions the festival for the Ekeko is held in October and known by the name ''Calvario''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rojo|first=Hugo Boero|title=Bolivia mágica|year=1977|publisher=Editorial Los Amigos del Libro}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009 Bolivia asked the [[United Nations]] to recognize the Bolivian cultural roots of the Alasitas festival, celebrating the figure of the Ekeko, something Peru also claims. However, the Bolivian ambassador in Peru, [[Franz Solano]], acknowledged that the doll was present in both countries.&lt;ref name="Andean row"/&gt;

'''Ezra Rumstick''' is a fictional character created by [[James L. Nelson]] for his ''[[Revolution at Sea Saga]]''. He is the best friend of [[Captain Isaac Biddlecomb|Isaac Biddlecomb]] and a fierce [[revolutionary]]. He first appears in ''[[By Force of Arms]]'' when [[Captain Isaac Biddlecomb|Isaac]] comes across him [[tar]] and [[feather]]ing, not to mention burning, a [[mannequin]] dressed like a [[Great Britain|British]] soldier. He and [[Captain Isaac Biddlecomb|Isaac]] are captured soon after by the British police and face death by [[hanging]]. But they escape, and eventually are pressed into labour on board the ''H.M.S. Icarus'' (See ''[[By Force of Arms]]'').

== Character description ==
Rumstick is described in ''[[By Force of Arms]]'' as a great, "jolly bear of a man." He is very large and very strong, and shows it in the first ''[[Revolution at Sea Saga|Revolution]]'' book when he picks up the ''[[H.M.S. Icarus|Icarus']]'' [[Edward Longbottom|boatswain's mate]] and tosses him overboard after seeing how he brutalises the crew members.

Rumstick once mentioned his mother and that she hadn't failed in her duties to read him the [[Bible]], but no other mention is made of her, or the rest of his family. He met [[Captain Isaac Biddlecomb|Isaac Biddlecomb]] in 1764 when he signed aboard [[William Stanton (fictional character)|William Stanton's]] ship the ''Providence'', on which Isaac had been working for a year, following the death of his father. (See [[Captain Isaac Biddlecomb]])

Ezra Rumstick has a quick temper and a strong sense of justice. He is one of the biggest [[United States|American]] revolutionaries, and always wants to be in the middle of the action, especially when it involves fighting off [[Great Britain|British]] soldiers. He is very disappointed in ''[[The Continental Risque]]'' when he is sent to help [[Lieutenant Roger Tottenhill]] aboard the ''[[Charlemagne]]'', thus missing all the action involved in being on the [[Bahamas|Bahamian]] [[schooner]] with [[Captain Isaac Biddlecomb|Isaac]].

A '''feud''' {{IPAc-en|f|juː|d}}, referred to in more extreme cases as a '''blood feud''', '''vendetta''', '''faida''', '''beef''', '''clan war''', '''gang war''', or '''private war''', is a long-running argument or fight, often between [[social group]]s of people, especially [[family|families]] or [[clan]]s. Feuds begin because one party (correctly or incorrectly) perceives itself to have been attacked, insulted or wronged by another. Intense feelings of [[resentment]] trigger the initial [[Retributive justice|retribution]], which causes the other party to feel equally aggrieved and [[revenge|vengeful]]. The dispute is subsequently fuelled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory [[violence]]. This continual cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it extremely difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members or associates, can last for [[generation]]s, and may result in extreme acts of [[violence]]. They can be interpreted as an extreme outgrowth of social relations based in [[family honor]].

Until the [[early modern period]], feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manaraefan.co.uk/index_files/Page3400.htm |title=Revenue, Lordship, Kinship &amp; Law |publisher=Manaraefan.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were regulated to some degree. For example, [[Serbs|Serb]] culture calls this ''krvna osveta'', meaning "blood revenge", which had unspoken{{dubious|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- if people didn't talk about the rules of ''krvna osveta'', how did they know about them? --&gt; but highly valued rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=Christopher|title=Blood Revenge: The Anthropology of Feuding in Montenegro and Other Tribal Societies|year=1984|publisher=The University of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kansas|isbn=0-7006-0245-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tribal societies, the blood feud, coupled with the practice of [[blood money (term)|blood wealth]], functioned as an effective form of social control for limiting and ending conflicts between individuals and groups who are related by [[kinship]], as described by anthropologist [[Max Gluckman]] in his article "The Peace in the Feud"&lt;ref&gt;Gluckman, Max. "The Peace in the Feud". ''Past and Present'', 1955, 8(1):1-14&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955.

== Blood feuds ==
{{Redirect|Blood feud||Blood Feud (disambiguation)}}
A '''blood feud''' is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or [[honor|dishonored]] seeking vengeance by killing or otherwise physically punishing the culprits or their relatives. In the [[English-speaking world]], the Italian word '''''vendetta''''' is used to mean a blood feud, but in reality it means (personal) "vengeance" or "revenge", originating from the [[Latin]] ''vindicta'' ([[wikt:vengeance|vengeance]]), while the word ''[[:wiktionary:faida|faida]]'' would be more appropriate for a blood feud. In the English-speaking world, "vendetta" is sometimes extended to mean any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed. Sometimes, it is not mutual, but rather refers to a prolonged series of hostile acts waged by one person against another without reciprocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vendetta |title=Definition of vendetta |work=Merriam-Webster dictionary online|publisher=Merriam-Webster.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Blood feuds were common in societies with a weak rule of law (or where the state does not consider itself responsible for mediating this kind of dispute), where family and kinship ties are the main source of [[authority]]. An entire family is considered responsible for the actions of any of its members. Sometimes two separate branches of the same family have even come to blows, or worse, over some dispute.

[[File:1673 Heintz Wettstreit auf der Ponte dei Pugni in Venedig anagoria.JPG|thumb|Ponte dei Pugni ("Bridge of Fists") in [[Venice]] was used by rival clans to stage fist fights]]
The practice has mostly disappeared with more centralized societies where [[law enforcement]] and [[criminal law]] take responsibility for punishing lawbreakers.

In [[Homeric]] [[ancient Greece]], the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: "Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vengeance... Feud is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of revenges; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John Gwyn |last=Griffiths |title=The Divine Verdict: A Study of Divine Judgement in the Ancient Religions |year=1991 |page=90 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-09231-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ancient Israel|ancient Hebraic]] context, it was considered the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil on behalf of God. The executor of the law of blood-revenge who personally put the initial killer to death was given a special designation: ''[[go'el haddam]]'', the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer ([[Book of Numbers]] 35: 19, etc.). Six [[Cities of Refuge]] were established to provide protection and [[due process]] for any unintentional manslayers. The avenger was forbidden from harming the unintentional killer if the killer took refuge in one of these cities. As the ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' states: "Since life was viewed as sacred ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9.6), no amount of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be [[lex talionis|'life for life']] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21.23; [[Deuteronomy]] 19.21)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible |first1=Bruce M. |last1=Metzger |first2=Michael D. |last2=Coogan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=68 |isbn=0-19-504645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Marc Bloch]]:
{{bquote|
The [[Middle Ages]], from beginning to end, and particularly the [[feudal]] era, lived under the sign of private [[revenge|vengeance]]. The [[Blame|onus]], of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the ''faide'' (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe — 'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call ''faida''', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a [[chieftain]], took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Bloch]], trans. L. A. Manyon, ''Feudal Society'', Vol. I, 1965, p. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:hoher atlas dadestal.jpg|thumb|A [[kasbah]] in the Dades valley, [[High Atlas]]. Historically, tribal feuding and banditry were a way of life for the [[Berber people|Berbers]] of Morocco.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} As a result, hundreds of ancient kasbahs were built.]]
[[Rita of Cascia]], a popular 15th-century Italian saint, was canonized by the [[Catholic Church]] due mainly to her great effort to end a feud in which her family was involved and which claimed the life of her husband.

The blood feud has certain similarities to the ritualized warfare found in many [[pre-industrial]] tribes. Thus, for instance, more than a third of [[Ya̧nomamö]] males, on average, died from [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the [[enslavement]] of neighboring tribes such as the [[Marueta people|Macu]] before the arrival of European settlers and government.&lt;ref name="Keeley"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. ''[[War Before Civilization|War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage]]'' Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan's feudal past, the [[samurai]] class upheld the honor of their family, clan, and their lord by ''katakiuchi'' ({{lang|ja|敵討ち}}), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the [[Forty-seven Ronin]], others were given official permission with specific targets.

At the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s [[Diet of Worms (1495)|''Reichstag'' at Worms in 1495 AD]], the right of waging feuds was abolished. The [[Imperial Reform]] proclaimed an "eternal [[public peace]]" (''[[Ewiger Landfriede]]'') to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]]s, and it defined a new [[standing army|standing imperial army]] to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted.&lt;!-- non-reliable source &lt;ref&gt;{{NNDB|id=399/000096111|name=Maximilian I|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed a family rival in [[Prague]], and the town councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed.

Konrad Schott von Schottenstein|Nuremberg-Schott]] feud, in which Maximilian was forced to step in to halt the damages done by robber knight Schott.

In Greece, the custom of blood feud is found in several parts of the country, for instance in [[Crete]] and [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]]. Throughout history, the [[Maniots]] have been regarded by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice [[Maniots#Vendettas|blood feuds]], known in the Maniot dialect of Greek as "Γδικιωμός" (Gdikiomos). Many vendettas went on for months, some for years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and, when they got the chance, would murder members of the opposing family. The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} it has led to entire family lines being wiped out. The last vendetta on record required the [[Greek Army]] with [[artillery]] support to force it to a stop. Regardless of this, the Maniot Greeks still practice vendettas even today. Maniots in America, Australia, Canada and [[Corsica]] still have on-going vendettas which have led to the creation of [[Mafia]] families known as "Γδικιωμέοι" (Gdikiomeoi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta |publisher=Mani.org.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Vathia Mani Greece.jpg|thumb|[[Vatheia]], a typical Maniot village famous for its towers]]

In [[Corsica]], vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no less than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.&lt;ref&gt;Gregorovius, Ferdinand. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=udhEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Wanderings in Corsica: Its History and Its Heroes]''. (1855). p.&amp;nbsp;196. Retrieved 2015-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] was ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In [[Navarre]], these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In [[Biscay]], the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. (''Cf.'' the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] in Italy). High defensive structures ("towers") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, and sometimes by royal decree.

Leontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the [[Caucasus]], wrote in the mid-19th century: "Among the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|mountain people]] the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion." In the [[Dagestan]]i ''[[aul]]'' of Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/russian-federation/chechen-society-and-mentality |title=Chechen society and mentality |author=Souleimanov, Emil Aslan |work=Prague Watchdog |date=2003-05-25 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ushguli1.JPG|thumb|The defensive towers built by feuding clans of [[Svaneti]], in the [[Caucasus]] mountains]]

The [[Celts|Celtic]] phenomenon of the ''blood feud'' demanded "an eye for an eye," and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between [[clan]]s might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland.

Due to the Celtic heritage of many people living in [[Appalachia]], a series of prolonged violent engagements in late nineteenth-century [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]] were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]], both of whom had written [[historical fiction|semihistorical]] accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]], were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the [[Reconstruction Era]] and the early twentieth century, and are seen by some as linked to a [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|Southern culture of honor]] with its roots in the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] forebears of the residents of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' (2008), Chapter 6, citing, for example, [[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent example is the [[Regulator–Moderator War]], which took place between rival factions in the [[Republic of Texas]]. It is sometimes considered the largest blood feud in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/AllThingsHistorical/The-Worst-Feud-BB1006.htm |title=The Worst Feud |publisher=TexasEscapes.com |author=Bowman, Bob|date=2006-10-15 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to feud was ''[[blood money (term)|blood money]]'' (or ''[[weregild]]'' in the [[Norsemen|Norse]] culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death, even an accidental one. If these payments were not made, or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would ensue.

===Feuds in modern times===
Blood feuds are still practised in some areas in:
* France (especially [[Corsica]] and within [[Sinti|Manush]] communities)
* Ireland (especially [[Dublin]] and [[Limerick]])
* In Northern Ireland between [[Republican movement (Ireland)|Irish republican]] and [[Loyalist|Ulster loyalism]] communities; particularly during [[The Troubles]]
* [[Southern Italy]] (especially [[Sicily]],  [[Campania]], [[Calabria]], [[Apulia]] and other areas of the same territory)&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/police-search-calabrian-village-as-murders-are-linked-to-clan-feud-461917.html Police search Calabrian village as murders are linked to clan feud]", ''The Independent'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226231852/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/police-search-calabrian-village-as-murders-are-linked-to-clan-feud-461917.html |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood feuds within [[Russian people|Russian]] communities do exist (mostly related to criminal gangs), but are neither as common nor as pervasive as they are in the [[Caucasus]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the United States, blood feuds are also not as pervasive or common, but do exist within the [[African-American]] and [[Chicano]] communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGBsoIz8KncC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=chicano+++++feuds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UU_Wayz1N5&amp;sig=KM2jXLtITX1UXZhy59sUKucIXDU&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-oRZUPGwMcm0hAfP_4HICw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chicano%20%20%20%20%20feuds&amp;f=false|title=Chicano Timespace: The Poetry and Politics of Ricardo Sánchez|author=López, Miguel R.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes gang-related, but not necessarily).

This has resulted in gun violence and murders in cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], [[Ciudad Juarez]], [[Medellin]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Cape Town]], [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], [[Liverpool]], and [[Glasgow]], to name just a few.

Blood feuds also have a long history within the White [[Southern United States|Southern]] population of the U.S., where it is called the "[[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]]", and still exist to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://untpress.unt.edu/catalog/3376|author=Parsons, Chuck|title=The Sutton-Taylor Feud: The Deadliest Blood Feud in Texas|publisher=University of North Texas Press|year=2013|pages=400|accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Albania====
{{main|Gjakmarrja}}
In [[Albania]], ''[[gjakmarrja]]'' (blood feuding) is a tradition. They have returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by [[Enver Hoxha]], and more than 3000 Albanian families are currently engaged in them.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There are now more than 1,600 families who live under an ever-present death sentence because of them, and since 1992, at least 10,000 [[Albanians]] have been killed in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2008/0625/p01s02-woeu.html |title=Peacemaker breaks the ancient grip of Albania's blood feuds |work=The Christian Science Monitor |author=White, Jeffrey|publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood feuds in Albania trace back to the Kanun, this custom is also practiced among the Albanians of Kosovo

A feud may develop into a vicious circle of further [[murder|killings]], retaliation, [[counterattack]]s, and all-out [[war]]fare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====Kosovo====
Blood feuds have also been part of a centuries-old tradition in [[Kosovo]], tracing back to the [[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]], a 15th-century codification of Albanian customary rules. In the early 1990s, most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by [[Anton Çetta]].&lt;ref name="BJC2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjc/azx002/2990197 |title=Did Nonviolent Resistance Fail in Kosovo? |last1=Marsavelski |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Sheremeti |first2=Furtuna |last3=Braithwaite |first3=John |website=British Journal of Criminology |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="BJC2017"/&gt;

====Republic of Ireland====
Criminal gang feuds also exist in [[Dublin]], Ireland and in the Republic's third-largest city, [[Limerick]]. [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] feuds are also common in towns across the country. Feuds can be due to personal issues, money, or disrespect, and grudges can last generations. Since 2001, over 300 people have been killed in feuds between different drugs gangs, [[dissident republican]]s, and [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/garda%C3%AD-suspect-dublin-drug-feud-link-in-double-killing-1.477711 |title=Gardaí suspect Dublin drug feud link in double killing |author=Lally, Conor |work=The Irish Times |publisher=IrishTimes.com |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}

====Philippines====
Family and clan feuds, known locally as ''[[rido]]'', are characterized by sporadic outbursts of retaliatory violence between families and kinship groups, as well as between communities. It can occur in areas where the government or a central authority is weak, as well as in areas where there is a perceived lack of justice and security. ''Rido'' is a [[Maranao language|Maranao]] term commonly used in [[Mindanao]] to refer to clan feuds. It is considered one of the major problems in Mindanao because, apart from numerous casualties, ''rido'' has caused destruction of property, crippled local economies, and displaced families.

Located in the southern Philippines, Mindanao is home to a majority of the country’s Muslim community, and includes the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]]. Mindanao "is a region suffering from poor infrastructure, high poverty, and violence that has claimed the lives of more than 120,000 in the last three decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiafoundation.org/2007/10/31/in-the-philippines-conflict-resolution-in-mindanao/ |title=In the Philippines: Conflict in Mindanao |author=Wilfredo Magno Torres III |accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a widely held stereotype that the violence is perpetrated by armed groups that resort to terrorism to further their political goals, but the actual situation is far more complex. While the Muslim-Christian conflict and the state-rebel conflicts dominate popular perceptions and media attention, a survey commissioned by [[The Asia Foundation]] in 2002 — and further verified by a recent [[Social Weather Stations]] survey — revealed that citizens are more concerned about the prevalence of ''rido'' and its negative impact on their communities than the conflict between the state and rebel groups.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007" /&gt; The unfortunate interaction and subsequent confusion of ''rido''-based violence with [[secession]]ism, [[communist]] [[insurgency]], banditry, military involvement and other forms of armed violence shows that violence in Mindanao is more complicated than what is commonly believed.

''Rido'' has wider implications for conflict in Mindanao, primarily because it tends to interact in unfortunate ways with separatist conflict and other forms of armed violence. Many armed confrontations in the past involving insurgent groups and the military were triggered by a local ''rido''. The studies cited above investigated the dynamics of ''rido'' with the intention of helping design strategic interventions to address such conflicts.

=====Causes=====
The causes of ''rido'' are varied and may be further complicated by a society's concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|honor and shame]], an integral aspect of the social rules that determine accepted practices in the affected communities. The triggers for conflicts range from petty offenses, such as theft and jesting, to more serious crimes, like homicide. These are further aggravated by land disputes and political rivalries, the most common causes of ''rido''. Proliferation of firearms, lack of law enforcement and credible mediators in conflict-prone areas, and an inefficient justice system further contribute to instances of ''rido''.

=====Statistics=====
Studies on ''rido'' have documented a total of 1,266 ''rido'' cases between the 1930s and 2005, which have killed over 5,500 people and displaced thousands. The four provinces with the highest numbers of ''rido'' incidences are: [[Lanao del Sur]] (377), [[Maguindanao]] (218), [[Lanao del Norte]] (164), and [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] (145). Incidences in these four provinces account for 71% of the total documented cases. The findings also show a steady rise in ''rido'' conflicts in the eleven provinces surveyed from the 1980s to 2004. According to the studies, during 2002–2004, 50% (637 cases) of total ''rido'' incidences occurred, equaling about 127 new ''rido'' cases per year. Out of the total number of ''rido'' cases documented, 64% remain unresolved.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Torres, Wilfredo M. (ed) |year=2007 |title=Rido: Clan Feuding and Conflict Management in Mindanao |location=[[Makati]] |publisher=[[The Asia Foundation]] |pages=348 |isbn=978-971-92445-2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Resolution=====
''Rido'' conflicts are either resolved, unresolved, or reoccurring. Although the majority of these cases remain unresolved, there have been many resolutions through different conflict-resolving bodies and mechanisms. These cases can utilize the formal procedures of the Philippine government or the various indigenous systems. Formal methods may involve official courts, local government officials, police, and the military. Indigenous methods to resolve conflicts usually involve elder leaders who use local knowledge, beliefs, and practices, as well as their own personal influence, to help repair and restore damaged relationships. Some cases using this approach involve the payment of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] to resolve the conflict. Hybrid mechanisms include the collaboration of government, religious, and traditional leaders in resolving conflicts through the formation of collaborative groups. Furthermore, the institutionalization of traditional conflict resolution processes into laws and ordinances has been successful with the hybrid method approach. Other conflict-resolution methods include the establishment of ceasefires and the intervention of youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007"/&gt;

'''Folli Follie''' is a [[Greece|Greek]]-based international company which designs, manufactures and distributes luxury  [[jewellery]], [[watches]] and fashion accessories.

==History==
The company was established in 1986 in Greece by Dimitris Koutsolioutsos ({{lang-el|Δημήτρης Κουτσολιούτσος}}). The first shop was in the commercial district of [[Athens]]. Folli Follie started by manufacturing jewellery and in 1994 launched their watch line. In 1995 the first overseas store opened, in [[Japan]]. It is now ranked amongst the top 10 brands in luxury goods in Japan with 80 points of sale. Folli Follie fully acquired its affiliate in Japan in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Folli Follie buys out Japanese unit for 12.7 mln eur | date=2008-01-29 | publisher=Forbes NY | url =https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2008/01/29/afx4586269.html | work =Thomson Financial | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-26 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Folli Follie was listed in the [[Athens Stock Exchange]]. Capital was used to fund growth and geographic expansion. Folli Follie is currently active in 25 countries, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (London; [[Bond Street]], [[Bond Street|New Bond Street]]) Cardiff &amp; Glasgow; ([[St Enoch Centre]]), Switzerland ([[Geneva]]), Japan ([[Tokyo]]; [[Ginza]] area), France ([[Paris]]), the US (New York; [[Madison Avenue]]), China (more than 120 shops) and Russia (Moscow; [[Red Square]]); it has over 380 points of sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.follifollie.us.com/WHO_WE_ARE/10_11.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930152540/http://www.follifollie.us.com/WHO_WE_ARE/10_11.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folli Follie employs more than 5,900 people.{{when|date=April 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Design==
The company's design team consists of [[Italy|Italian]], [[Switzerland|Swiss]] and [[Greece|Greek]] top designers who work together to present two collections per year: Autumn/Winter and Spring/Summer. The collection's highlight is the "Premium K" collection which includes limited edition jewellery and accessories pieces. Folli Follie's philosophy is to offer a "full fashion concept" of branded, modern jewellery, watches and accessories at affordable prices. The company also offers a men's [[watch]] collection under the brand name Folli Follie (previously Triton).

==Acquisitions==

Hellenic acquired the British jewellery company [[Links of London]] in 2006, with an enterprise value of ₤45 million.&lt;ref name="Moodie"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moodie|first=Martin|title=Hellenic acquires Links of London|url=http://www.moodiereport.com/document.php?c_id=1178&amp;doc_id=11535|publisher=The Moodie Report|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==

On May 4, 2018 Quintessential Capital Management made the fact-based allegation that ''"The image we received from reviewing Folli Follie’s (OTCPK:FLLIY) financial statements and official declarations over the year is that of a rapidly-growing multinational fashion company led by double-digit growth in its key segment: Asia. Unfortunately, following an extensive investigative and due diligence work, we find it impossible to reconcile that picture with our findings on the ground, which point to an unprofitable, struggling company with materially smaller, and rapidly decreasing revenue, network size, and cash balances. The core of the issue seems to be concentrated in FF’s Asian and, particularly, Chinese subsidiaries." &lt;ref&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4169961-folli-follie-greek-parmalat&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement the FF share price in the Greek stock market tumbled and after a few weeks trading was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketall.eu/markets/13149-upd-trading-in-folli-follie-shares-suspended-fails-to-provide-financial-data-&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/ff-group-shares-sink-after-short-seller-questions-network-reach&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally on 16.8.2018 a credit event occurred with one of FFs bonds, giving strong indication that Quintessential's allegations are valid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capital.gr/epixeiriseis/3310817/-pistotiko-gegonos-sto-omologo-tis-folli-follie-se-elbetiko-fragko&lt;/ref&gt;

Events unfolded rapidly with Folli Follie Chairman and his wife (both cofounders of the company) quiting the business on September 27th. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsbeast.gr/financial/arthro/4021065/ragdaies-exelixeis-kai-agonia-gia-ti-folli-follie&lt;/ref&gt;. Their son however remained as CEO claiming that his father has all the responsibility for the company's Asian branch misrepresentation of financial figures. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.capital.gr/epixeiriseis/3319003/tzortzis-koutsolioutsos-tin-euthuni-exei-o-pateras-mou&lt;/ref&gt;. Important shareholders like Fosun and Dufry demanded that Mr. Koutsolioutsos resigns his post &lt;ref&gt;http://bankingnews.gr/index.php?id=372121&lt;/ref&gt; as also did the union of employees who have appealed for the Greek courts help in order to place the company under a protective status Vs. its creditors. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dikastiko.gr/%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF/folli-folie-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%84%CF%83%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%84%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%80%CE%BF/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6444">A '''foundation programme''', '''foundation program''', '''foundation year''', '''foundation year programme''' or '''foundation year program''' is a one-year introductory course to a full multi-year degree curriculum offered by many universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and elsewhere. These programmes may be intended for students not yet in a degree program or may form part of a specific degree course. Some programmes are designed specifically for either domestic or international students.

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, foundation year programmes, also known as "year zero" or "gateway programmes", are designed to develop skills and subject-specific knowledge to ensure a student to advance to a degree course. They may be offered as stand-alone one-year courses or integrated into degree programmes. Some programmes are for students who have not received suitable grades at [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]] or [[IB Diploma Programme|IB]] while others are aimed at students who did not have the opportunity to take such qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/what-and-where-study/ucas-undergraduate-what-study|title=UCAS Undergraduate: what to study|at=2.

{{distinguish|Georgian era}}
'''Georgian art''' ({{lang-ka|ქართული ხელოვნება}}) has evolved for millennia. With roots in rich archaic and ethnic tradition, [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] art has grown along with the development of the Georgian statehood, starting from the ancient kingdoms of [[Colchis]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]. The location of Georgia on the crossroads of Asia and Europe has brought travelers, merchants, missionaries and conquerors of all kinds and creeds, and defined the country's cultural and artistic environment throughout its history. Georgian art tradition has thus experienced influences from [[Art of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]], [[Anatolia]]n, [[Greek art|Greek]], [[Persian art|Persian]], [[Roman art|Roman]] and [[Byzantine art]] throughout antiquity. It has further grown within the framework of Christian ecclesiastical and middle-eastern art of the Middle Ages, and ultimately it has evolved in the context of [[European art|European]] and [[Russian art]] from the 19th century onwards.

[[File:BBC_Charter.jpg|right|thumb|The Great Seal attached to the [[BBC Charter]]]]

The '''Great Seal of the Realm''' or '''Great Seal of the United Kingdom''' (known prior to the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Treaty of Union of 1707]] as the '''Great Seal of England'''; and from then until the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union of 1801]] as the '''Great Seal of Great Britain and Ireland''') is a [[Seal (device)|seal]] that is used to symbolise the [[British monarchy|Sovereign]]'s approval of important state documents.  

Scotland has had her [[Great Seal of Scotland|own great seal]] since the 14th century. The [[Acts of Union 1707]], joining the kingdoms of Scotland and England, provide for the use of a single Great Seal for the united kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Article XXIV&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also provides for the continued use of a separate Scottish seal to be used there (this seal continues to be called the "Great Seal of Scotland" though it is not technically one). The [[Welsh Seal]] was introduced in 2011.

[[Sealing wax]] is [[Melting|melt]]ed in a [[metal]] mould or matrix and impressed into a wax figure that is attached by cord or [[ribbon]] to documents that the Monarch wishes to make official.

The formal [[keeper of the seal]] is the [[Lord High Chancellor]].

==History==

[[Edward the Confessor]] sometime before A.D. 1066 started using a "Great Seal" casting in wax of his own visage to signify that a document carried the force of his will.  With some exceptions, each subsequent monarch up to 1603 and the Union of the Crowns which united the crowns of Scotland and England has chosen his or her own design for the Great Seal.

{{anchor|Great Seal of the Commonwealth}}
When opening Parliament, on 3 September 1654, the Lord Protector [[Oliver Cromwell]] was escorted by the three "Commissioners of the Great Seal of the Commonwealth of England", who were Whitelock, Lisle, and Widdrington. This Seal was inscribed with 'The Great Seal of England, 1648', displaying the map of England, Ireland, Jersey, and Guernsey on one side, with the Arms of England and Ireland. On the other side was shown the interior of the House of Commons, the Speaker in the chair, with the inscription, 'In the first year of Freedom, by God's blessing restored, 1648.'
In 1655, Cromwell appointed three Commissioners of the Great Seal of Ireland, [[Richard Pepys]], Chief Justice of the Upper Bench, Sir Gerard Lowther, Chief Justice of the Common Bench; and [[Miles Corbet]], Chief Baron of the Exchequer. But they held the seal only until 1656, when Cromwell nominated [[William Steele (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Steele]], Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer in England, Lord Chancellor of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;James Roderick O'Flanagan, ''The lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland, from the earliest times to the reign of Queen Victoria'', (1870), [http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/chancellors/Chancellors25.htm Chapter XXV. Custody Of The Great Seal During The Commonwealth.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1688, while attempting to flee to France, [[James II of England|James II]] destroyed his Great Seal, apparently by throwing it into the River Thames in the hope that the machinery of government would cease to function. James's successors, [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], used the same seal matrix in their new Great Seal. This may have been a deliberate choice, in order to imply the continuity of government. A new obverse was created, but the reverse was crudely adapted by inserting a female figure beside the male figure. When [[Mary II of England|Mary]] died, the obverse returned to the design used by James II, while the female figure was deleted from the reverse. Thus, [[William III of England|William III]] used a seal that was identical to James II's, except for changes to the lettering and coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenkinson | first1 = Hilary | year = 1943 | title = What happened to the Great Seal of James II? | url = | journal = Antiquaries Journal | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 1–13 | doi=10.1017/s0003581500042189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], who abdicated in order to marry [[Wallis Simpson]] only a few months after succeeding to the throne, never selected a design for his own seal and continued to use that of his predecessor, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. The longer-lived British monarchs have had several Great Seals during their reigns. Only one matrix of the Great Seal exists at a time, and since the wax used for the Great Seal has a high [[melting point]], the silver plates that cast the Seal eventually wear out. [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] had to select four different Great Seal designs during the sixty-three years of her reign.&lt;ref name="victoria"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1322849/New-seal-of-approval-for-Queen.html| title=New seal of approval for Queen| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| last=Davies| first=Caroline| date=16 February 2001| accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current seal matrix was authorised by the Privy Council in July 2001.&lt;ref name="current"&gt;{{cite web| title=Great Seal of the Realm| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Greatsealoftherealm.aspx| publisher=The Royal Household| date=2009| accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by [[James Butler (artist)|James Butler]] and replaced that of 1953, designed by [[Gilbert Ledward]]. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] shows a middle-aged [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] enthroned and robed, holding in her right hand a [[sceptre]] and in her left the [[Sovereign's Orb|orb]]. The circumscription ELIZABETH . II . {{lang|la|D . G . BRITT . REGNORVMQVE . SVORVM . CETER . REGINA . CONSORTIONIS . POPVLORVM . PRINCEPS . F . D .}} is the abbreviated Latin form of the royal title.&lt;ref&gt;In full: {{Lang|la|Elizabeth Secunda Dei Gratia Britanniarum Regnorumque Suorum Ceterorum Regina Consortionis Populorum Princeps Fidei Defensor}}. This is the official [[Latin]] form of the [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II#Royal titles|royal title]]: Elizabeth II by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[obverse and reverse|reverse]] are the full [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms]], including crest, mantling and supporters. This is the first time that the royal arms have provided the main design for one side of the British Great Seal. The reverse of the 1953 version depicted the Queen on horseback, dressed in uniform and riding [[sidesaddle]], as she used to attend the annual [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony for many years until the late 1980s. The seal's diameter is {{convert|6|in}} and the combined weight of both sides of the seal matrix exceeds {{convert|275|ozt|lk=on}}.

==Usage==

The Great Seal is attached to the official documents of state that require the authorisation of the monarch to implement the advice of the [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]].

Under today's usage of the Great Seal, seals of dark [[green]] wax are affixed to [[letters patent]] elevating individuals to the [[peerage]], [[blue]] seals authorise actions relating to the [[Royal family]], and [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] seals appoint bishops and implement various other affairs of state. In some cases the seal is replaced by a wafer version, a smaller representation of the obverse of the Great Seal embossed on coloured paper attached to the document being sealed.  This simpler version is used for royal proclamations, letters-patent granting the [[royal assent]], writs of summons to Parliament and for licences for the election of bishops and commissions of the peace.  It formerly constituted [[treason]] to [[forgery|forge]] the Great Seal.

The Great Seal of the Realm is in the custody of and administered by the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]]. This office has been held jointly with that of [[Lord Chancellor]] since 1761. The current Lord Chancellor is [[David Gauke]]. The [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] reiterates that the Lord Chancellor continues to be the custodian of the Great Seal.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Reform Act 2005, schedule 7, paragraph 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery]], who is also [[Permanent Secretary]] of the [[Ministry of Justice]], heads [[Majesty|Her Majesty]]'s Crown Office, and is responsible for the affixing of the Great Seal. He is assisted by the Deputy Clerk of the Crown. Day-to-day custody is entrusted to the Clerk of the Chamber, and subordinate staff include a Sealer, and two [[Scribe]]s to Her Majesty's Crown Office.

Section 2 of the Great Seal Act 1884 governs the use of the Great Seal of the Realm:

{{cquote|2 - (1) A warrant under Her Majesty’s Royal Sign Manual, countersigned by the Lord Chancellor, or by one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State, or by the Lord High Treasurer, or two of the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, shall be a necessary and sufficient authority for passing any instrument under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, according to the tenor of such warrant; Provided that any instrument which may now be passed under the Great Seal by the fiat or under the authority or directions of the Lord Chancellor or otherwise without passing through any other office may continue to be passed as heretofore.
(2) The Lord Chancellor may from time to time make, and when made revoke and vary, regulations respecting the passing of instruments under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, and respecting the warrants for that purpose, and the preparation of such instruments and warrants, and every such warrant shall be prepared by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.

(3) No person shall make or prepare any warrant for passing any instrument under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, or procure any instrument to be passed under that Seal otherwise than in manner provided by this Act or the Crown Office Act 1877; and any person who acts in contravention of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.}}

==Inscriptions on the Great Seal==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">The term '''hill-slope enclosure''' describes a type of late prehistoric [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] found across South West England and also in Wales. Normally formed from a single bank, or [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] and bank, enclosing an area of less than 1 hectare, and not on the summit of a hill. They are often found on a [[Spur (topography)|spur]] of a larger hill or range of hills.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riley|first=Hazel|title=The Historic Landscape of the Quantock Hills|publisher=English Heritage|isbn=978-1905624294|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original purpose of the hill-slope enclosure is obscure but it is thought that they were not primarily defensive structures. Surveys and excavations have revealed low densities of [[posthole]]s and [[Storage pit (archaeology)|storage pits]] suggesting they functioned as defensible farmsteads and permanent livestock enclosures.&lt;ref name="Riley"/&gt;

They may also have served different purposes at different times and they may have had symbolic and religious significance which is now impossible to determine.&lt;ref name="Riley"/&gt;

{{Educational research}}
The systematic provision of learning techniques to most children, such as literacy, has been a development of the last 150 or 200 years,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gray, "A Brief History of Education" https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/200808/brief-history-education&lt;/ref&gt; or even last 50 years in some countries. Schools for the young have historically been supplemented with advanced training for priests, bureaucrats and specialists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timo Hoyer]]: Sozialgeschichte der Erziehung.

==Education in ancient civilization==

===The development of writing===
{{main article|History of Writing}}

Starting in about 3500 B.C., various writing systems developed in ancient civilizations around the world.  In [[Egypt]] fully developed hieroglyphs were in use at Abydos as early as 3400 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Steven Roger, "A History of Writing", 2004, Reaktion Books, {{ISBN|1-86189-167-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-86189-167-9}}, at page 36&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|oldest known alphabet]] was developed in central Egypt around 2000 B.C. from a [[hieroglyph]]ic prototype. One hieroglyphic script was used on stone monuments,&lt;ref name="Fischer2"&gt;Fischer, Steven Roger, "A History of Writing", 2004, Reaktion Books, {{ISBN|1-86189-167-9}}, at pp. 34, 35, 44&lt;/ref&gt; other cursive scripts were used for writing in ink on [[papyrus]],&lt;ref name="Fischer2"/&gt; a flexible, paper-like material, made from the stems of reeds that grow in marshes and beside rivers such as the River Nile.

The [[Phoenician script|Phoenician writing system]] was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script in around the 11th century BC, which in turn borrowed ideas from [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]]. This script was adapted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greeks]]. A variant of the early Greek alphabet gave rise to the [[Etruscan alphabet]], and its own descendants, such as the [[Latin alphabet]]. Other descendants from the [[Greek alphabet]] include the [[Cyrillic script]], used to write [[Russian language|Russian]], among others.

The Phoenician system was also adapted into the [[Aramaic script]], from which the [[Hebrew script]] and also that of [[Arabic script|Arabic]] are descended.

In [[China]], the early [[oracle bone script]] has survived on tens of thousands of [[oracle bones]] dating from around 1400-1200 B.C. in the [[Shang Dynasty]]. Out of more than 2500 written characters in use in China in about 1200 BC, as many as 1400 are identifiable as the source of later standard Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Steven Roger, "A History of Writing", 2004, Reaktion Books, {{ISBN|1-86189-167-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-86189-167-9}}, at pages 168-170&lt;/ref&gt;

Of several [[pre-Columbian]] scripts in [[Mesoamerica]], the one that appears to have been best developed, and the one to be deciphered the most, is the [[Maya script]]. The earliest inscriptions which are identifiably Maya date to the 3rd century B.C., and writing was in continuous use until shortly after the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century. In Chinese civilization, in school the children were not allowed to scribble. They were not to write slanted or sloppy charterers .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese civilization|last=Buckley|first=Patrica|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=195–198|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other surfaces used for early writing include wax-covered writing boards (used, as well as clay tablets, by the Assyrians), sheets or strips of bark from trees (in Indonesia, Tibet and the Americas),&lt;ref&gt;Article at Cornell University Library, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections [http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/Paper-exhibit/batak.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the thick palm-like leaves of a particular tree, the leaves then punctured with a hole and stacked together like the pages of a book (these writings in India and South east Asia include Buddhist scriptures and Sanskrit literature),&lt;ref&gt;Article at Cornell University Library, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections [http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/Paper-exhibit/palmleaf.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[parchment]], made of goatskin that had been soaked and scraped to remove hair, which was used from at least the 2nd century B.C., [[vellum]], made from calfskin, and [[wax tablet]]s which could be wiped clean to provide a fresh surface (in the Roman times).

===The Middle East===
{{Further information|History of education in ancient Israel and Judah}}
Perhaps the earliest formal school was developed in Egypt's Middle Kingdom under the direction of Kheti, treasurer to Mentuhotep II [http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/educate.htm].
In what became [[Mesopotamia]], the early [[logographic]] system of cuneiform script took many years to master. Thus only a limited number of individuals were hired as [[scribes]] to be trained in its reading and writing. Only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals such as scribes, physicians, and temple administrators, were schooled.&lt;ref&gt;Thomason, Allison Karmel, "Luxury and Legitimation: Royal Collecting in Ancient Mesopotamia", 2005, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., {{ISBN|0-7546-0238-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0238-5}}, at page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed to learn a trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Rivkah Harris|title=Gender and Aging in Mesopotamia|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls stayed at home with their mothers to learn [[housekeeping]] and [[cooking]], and to look after the younger children. Later, when a [[syllabary|syllabic]] script became more widespread, more of the Mesopotamian population became literate. Later still in [[Babylon]]ian times there were libraries in most towns and temples; an old [[Sumer]]ian proverb averred that "he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn."  There arose a whole social class of scribes, mostly employed in agriculture, but some as personal secretaries or lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Steven Roger, "A History of Writing", 2004, Reaktion Books, {{ISBN|1-86189-167-9}}, at page 50&lt;/ref&gt; Women as well as men learned to read and write, and for the Semitic Babylonians, this involved knowledge of the extinct [[Sumerian language]], and a complicated and extensive syllabary.  Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated. The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] from [[Ancient Mesopotamia]] is among the [[ancient literature|earliest known works of literary fiction]]. The earliest [[Sumer]]ian versions of the epic date from as early as the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] (2150-2000 BC) (Dalley 1989: 41-42).

[[Ashurbanipal]] (685 – c. 627 BC), a king of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], was proud of his scribal education.  His youthful scholarly pursuits included oil divination, [[mathematics]], reading and writing as well as the usual [[horsemanship]], [[hunting]], [[chariot]]ry, soldierliness, [[Artisan|craftsmanship]], and royal decorum. During his reign he collected cuneiform texts from all over Mesopotamia, and especially Babylonia, in the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library in Nineveh]], the first systematically organized library in the ancient Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009855/Ashurbanipal|title=Ashurbanipal - king of Assyria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which survives in part today.

In [[ancient Egypt]], literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of [[scribe]]s. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status. The rate of literacy in Pharaonic Egypt during most periods from the third to first millennium BC has been estimated at not more than one percent,&lt;ref&gt;Baines, John "Literacy and ancient Egyptian society", 1983, Man (New Series), 18 (3), 572-599&lt;/ref&gt; or between one half of one percent and one percent.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins K "Conquest by book", 1991, at page 135 in JH Humphrey (ed.) "Literacy in the Roman World" (Journal of Roman Archeology, Supplementary Series No 3, pp133-158), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Israel, the [[Torah]] (the fundamental religious text) includes commands to read, learn, teach and write the Torah, thus requiring literacy and study. In 64 AD the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] caused schools to be opened .&lt;ref name="Compayre"&gt;Compayre, Gabriel; Payne, W. H., "History of Pedagogy (1899)", Translated by W. H. Payne, 2003, Kessinger Publishing; {{ISBN|0-7661-5486-6}}; at page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis was placed on developing good memory skills in addition to comprehension oral repetition. For details of the subjects taught, see [[History of education in ancient Israel and Judah]].  Although girls were not provided with formal education in the [[yeshivah]], they were required to know a large part of the subject areas to prepare them to maintain the home after marriage, and to educate the children before the age of seven. Despite this schooling system, it would seem that many children did not learn to read and write, because it has been estimated that "at least ninety percent of the Jewish population of Roman Palestine [in the first centuries AD] could merely write their own name or not write and read at all",&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, Catherine "[https://books.google.com/books?id=zlrxbYml2ioC Jewish Literacy in Roman Palestine]", 2001, Texts and Studies in Ancient Judaism; 81. Tuebingen: Mohr-Siebeck, at [https://books.google.com/books?id=zlrxbYml2ioC&amp;pg=PA503&amp;dq=%22at+least+ninety+percent+of+the+Jewish+population+of+Roman+Palestine+could+merely+write+their+own+name+or+not+write+and+read+at+all%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zAnNTofeIMav8QPOgonhDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22at%20least%20ninety%20percent%20of%20the%20Jewish%20population%20of%20Roman%20Palestine%20could%20merely%20write%20their%20own%20name%20or%20not%20write%20and%20read%20at%20all%22&amp;f=false page 503].&lt;/ref&gt; or that the literacy rate was about 3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Ilan, M. [http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/illitera.html  "Illiteracy in the Land of Israel in the First Centuries C.E."] in S. Fishbane, S. Schoenfeld and A. Goldschlaeger (eds.), "Essays in the Social Scientific Study of Judaism and Jewish Society", II, New York: Ktav, 1992, pp. 46-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic civilization that spread all the way between China and Spain during the time between the 7th and 19th centuries, Muslims started schooling from 622 in Medina, which is now a city in Saudi Arabia, schooling at first was in the mosques (masjid in Arabic) but then schools became separate in schools next to mosques. The first separate school was the Nizamiyah school. It was built in 1066 in Baghdad. children started school from the age of six with free tuition. The teaches of Quran (the holy book of Muslims) claims that Muslims should learn to read, write and explore the universe. Thus, education and schooling sprang up in the ancient Muslim societies. Moreover, Muslims had one of the first universities in history which is Al-Qarawiyin University in Fez, Morocco. It was originally a mosque that was built in 859.

===Indian Subcontinent===
In ancient India, during the [[Vedic period]] from about 1500 BC to 600 BC, most education was based on the [[Veda]] (hymns, formulas, and incantations, recited or chanted by priests of a pre-Hindu tradition) and later Hindu texts and scriptures.

Vedic education included: proper pronunciation and recitation of the Veda, the rules of sacrifice, grammar and derivation, composition, versification and meter, understanding of secrets of nature, reasoning including logic, the sciences, and the skills necessary for an occupation.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;Gupta, Amita "Going to School in South Asia", 2007, Greenwood Publishing Group; {{ISBN|978-0-313-33553-2}}; at page 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;  Some medical knowledge existed and was taught. There is mention in the Veda of herbal medicines for various conditions or diseases, including fever, cough, baldness, snake bite and others.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

Education, at first freely available in Vedic society, became over time more rigid and restricted as the social systems dictated that only those of meritorious lineage be allowed to study the scriptures, originally based on occupation, evolved, with the Brahman (priests) being the most privileged of the castes, followed by Kshatriya who could also wear the sacred thread and gain access to Vedic education. The Brahmans were given priority even over Kshatriya as they would dedicate their whole lives to such studies.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koenraadelst.blogspot.in/2014/11/true-hindu-greatness.html|title=True Hindu Greatness|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Caste System (Koenraad Elst)|url=http://www.amerika.org/texts/the-caste-system-koenraad-elst/|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest of the [[Upanishads]] - another part of Hindu scriptures - date from around 500 BC.  These texts encouraged an exploratory learning process where teachers and students were co-travellers in a search for truth.  The teaching methods used reasoning and questioning.  Nothing was labeled as the final answer.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

The [[Gurukul]] system of education supported traditional Hindu residential schools of learning; typically the teacher's house or a monastery. Education was free, but students from well-to-do families paid "Gurudakshina," a voluntary contribution after the completion of their studies. At the Gurukuls, the teacher imparted knowledge of Religion, Scriptures, [[Hindu Philosophy|Philosophy]], [[Sanskrit Literature|Literature]], Warfare, Statecraft, [[Ayurveda|Medicine]], Astrology and History.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The corpus of [[Sanskrit literature]] encompasses a rich tradition of poetry and [[Sanskrit drama|drama]] as well as technical [[Science and technology in ancient India|scientific]],  [[Hindu philosophy|philosophical]] and generally [[Hindu scriptures|Hindu religious]] texts, though many central texts of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] have also been composed in Sanskrit.

Two [[Indian epic poetry|epic poems]] formed part of  ancient Indian education.  The [[Mahabharata]], part of which may date back to the 8th century BC,&lt;ref name=Brockington/&gt; discusses human goals (purpose, pleasure, duty, and liberation), attempting to explain the relationship of the individual to society and the world (the nature of the '[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Self]]') and the workings of [[karma]].  The other epic poem, [[Ramayana]], is shorter, although it has 24,000 verses. It is thought to have been compiled between about 400 BC and 200 AD. The epic explores themes of human existence and the concept of [[dharma]].&lt;ref name = Brockington&gt;{{Citation| last = Brockington| first = John | year = 2003| contribution = The Sanskrit Epics | editor-last = Flood| editor-first = Gavin | title = Blackwell companion to Hinduism  | publisher = [[Blackwell Publishing]] | pages = 116–128 | isbn = 0-631-21535-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early center of learning in India dating back to the 5th century BC was [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]] (also known as [[Taxila (ancient)|Takshashila]]), which taught the three [[Vedas]] and the eighteen accomplishments.&lt;ref name=Scharfe&gt;Hartmut Scharfe (2002).

===China===
{{Main article|History of education in China|History of education in Taiwan}}

During the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045 BC to 256 BC), there were five national schools in the capital city, Pi Yong (an imperial school, located in a central location) and four other schools for the aristocrats and nobility, including [[Shang Xiang]]. The schools mainly taught the [[Six Arts]]: rites, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics.  According to the [[Book of Rites]], at age twelve, boys learned arts related to ritual (i.e. music and dance) and when older, archery and chariot driving.  Girls learned ritual, correct deportment, silk production and weaving.&lt;ref name = "HardyG"&gt;Hardy, Grant; Kinney, Anne B; ''The Establishment of the Han Empire and Imperial China'', 2005, Greenwood Publishing Group; {{ISBN|0-313-32588-X}}, 9780313325885; at pp. 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kinney"&gt;Kinney, Anne B; ''Representations of Childhood and Youth in Early China'', 2004, Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|0-8047-4731-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8047-4731-8}} at pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the Zhou dynasty that the origins of native [[Chinese philosophy]] also developed. [[Confucius]] (551 BC – 479 BC) founder of [[Confucianism]], was a Chinese philosopher who made a great impact on later generations of Chinese, and on the curriculum of the Chinese educational system for much of the following 2000 years.

Later, during the [[Qin dynasty]] (246–207 BC), a hierarchy of officials was set up to provide central control over the outlying areas of the empire. To enter this hierarchy, both literacy and knowledge of the increasing body of philosophy was required: "....the content of the educational process was designed not to engender functionally specific skills but rather to produce morally enlightened and cultivated generalists".&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Philip; Purves, Alan: "Literacy and Society with particular reference to the non western world" in ''Handbook of Reading Research'' by Rebecca Barr, P. David Pearson, Michael L. Kamil, Peter Mosenthal 2002, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002; Originally published: New York : Longman, c1984-c1991; at page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 221 AD), boys were thought ready at age seven to start learning basic skills in reading, writing and calculation.&lt;ref name = "HardyG"/&gt;  In 124 BC, the [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wudi]] established the Imperial Academy, the curriculum of which was the [[Five Classics]] of Confucius. By the end of the Han dynasty (220 AD) the Academy enrolled more than 30,000 students, boys between the ages of fourteen and seventeen years. However education through this period was a luxury.&lt;ref name = "Kinney"/&gt;

The [[nine-rank system]] was a [[civil service]] nomination system during the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280 AD) and the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] (420–589 AD) in China.  Theoretically, local government authorities were given the task of selecting talented candidates, then categorizing them into nine grades depending on their abilities. In practice, however, only the rich and powerful would be selected.  The Nine Rank System was eventually superseded by the [[Imperial examination]] system for the civil service in the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618 AD)

===Greece and Rome===
{{main article|Education in ancient Greece|Education in ancient Rome}}

In the [[city-states]] of [[ancient Greece]], most [[education]] was private, except in Sparta. For example, in Athens, during the 5th and 4th century BC, aside from two years military training, the state played little part in schooling.&lt;ref name = "Coulson"&gt;Coulson, Joseph: "[[Market Education|Market Education: The Unknown History]]", 1999, Transaction Publishers; {{ISBN|1-56000-408-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56000-408-0}}; at pages 40-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cordasco"&gt;[[Francesco Cordasco|Cordasco, Francesco]]: "A Brief History of Education: A Handbook of Information on Greek, Roman, Medieval, Renaissance, and Modern Educational Practice", 1976, Rowman &amp; Littlefield; {{ISBN|0-8226-0067-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8226-0067-1}}; at pp. 5, 6, &amp; 9&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone could open a school and decide the curriculum. Parents could choose a school offering the subjects they wanted their children to learn, at a monthly fee they could afford.&lt;ref name = "Coulson"/&gt;  Most parents, even the poor, sent their sons to schools for at least a few years, and if they could afford it from around the age of seven until fourteen, learning gymnastics (including athletics, sport and wrestling), music (including poetry, drama and history) and literacy.&lt;ref name = "Coulson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cordasco"/&gt; Girls rarely received formal education. At writing school, the youngest students learned the alphabet by song, then later by copying the shapes of letters with a stylus on a waxed wooden tablet. After some schooling, the sons of poor or middle-class families often learnt a trade by apprenticeship, whether with their father or another tradesman.&lt;ref name = "Coulson"/&gt; By around 350 BC, it was common for children at schools in Athens to also study various arts such as drawing, painting, and sculpture. The richest students continued their [[education]] by studying with sophists, from whom they could learn subjects such as rhetoric, mathematics, geography, natural history, politics, and logic.&lt;ref name = "Coulson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cordasco"/&gt; Some of Athens' greatest schools of higher education included the [[Lyceum]] (the so-called [[Peripatetic school]] founded by [[Aristotle]] of [[Stageira]]) and  the [[Platonic Academy]] (founded by [[Plato]] of Athens). The [[education]] system of the wealthy ancient Greeks is also called [[Paideia]]. In the subsequent Roman empire, Greek was the primary language of science. Advanced scientific research and teaching was mainly carried on in the [[Hellenistic]] side of the Roman empire, in Greek.

The education system in the Greek city-state of [[Sparta]] was entirely different, designed to create warriors with complete obedience, courage, and physical perfection. At the age of seven, boys were taken away from their homes to live in school dormitories or military barracks.  There they were taught sports, endurance and fighting, and little else, with harsh discipline.  Most of the population was illiterate.&lt;ref name = "Coulson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cordasco"/&gt;

The first schools in Ancient [[Rome]] arose by the middle of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;Michael Chiappetta, "Historiography and Roman Education," ''History of Education Journal'' 4, no. 4 (1953): 149-156.&lt;/ref&gt;  These schools were concerned with the basic socialization and rudimentary education of young Roman children. The literacy rate in the 3rd century BC has been estimated as around one percent to two percent.&lt;ref name="HarrisWV"&gt;Harris W.V. "Ancient literacy", 1989, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., at page 158&lt;/ref&gt; There are very few primary sources or accounts of Roman educational process until the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt; during which there was a proliferation of private schools in Rome.&lt;ref name="HarrisWV"/&gt; At the height of the [[Roman Republic]] and later the [[Roman Empire]], the Roman educational system gradually found its final form.  Formal schools were established, which served paying students (very little in the way of free public education as we know it can be found).&lt;ref name="Ox"&gt;Oxford Classical Dictionary, Edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, Third Edition. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, both boys and girls were educated, though not necessarily together.&lt;ref name="Ox"/&gt;  In a system much like the one that predominates in the modern world, the Roman education system that developed arranged schools in tiers.  The educator [[Quintilian]] recognized the importance of starting education as early as possible, noting that "memory … not only exists even in small children, but is specially retentive at that age".&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''Quintilian on Education'', translated by William M. Smail (New York: Teachers College Press, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman student would progress through schools just as a student today might go from elementary school to middle school, then to high school, and finally college.  Progression depended more on ability than age&lt;ref name="Ox"/&gt; with great emphasis being placed upon a student's ''ingenium'' or inborn "gift" for learning,&lt;ref&gt;Yun Lee Too, ''Education in Greek and Roman antiquity'' (Boston: Brill, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and a more tacit emphasis on a student's ability to afford high-level education.  Only the Roman elite would expect a complete formal education.  A tradesman or farmer would expect to pick up most of his vocational skills on the job. Higher education in Rome was more of a status symbol than a practical concern.

Literacy rates in the Greco-Roman world were seldom more than 20 percent; averaging perhaps not much above 10 percent in the Roman empire, though with wide regional variations, probably never rising above 5 percent in the western provinces.  The literate in classical Greece did not much exceed 5 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Harris,  ''Ancient literacy'' (Harvard University Press, 1989) 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian J.

==Formal education in the Middle Ages (500–1500 AD)==

===Europe===

[[File:Cluny Transept exterior.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Abbey of Cluny]] was one of the most influential]]

During the Early Middle Ages, the monasteries of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were the centers of education and literacy, preserving the Church's selection from Latin learning and maintaining the art of writing. Prior to their formal establishment, many medieval universities were run for hundreds of years as Christian  [[monastic school]]s (''Scholae monasticae''), in which [[monk]]s taught classes, and later as  [[cathedral school]]s; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the early 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): "Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp. 126-7, 282-98&lt;/ref&gt;

The first medieval institutions generally considered to be universities were established in Italy, France, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology.[1] These universities evolved from much older Christian cathedral schools and monastic schools, and it is difficult to define the date on which they became true universities, although the lists of [[studium generale|studia generalia]] for higher education in Europe held by the Vatican are a useful guide.

Students in the twelfth-century were very proud of the master whom they studied under. They were not very concerned with telling others the place or region where they received their education. Even now when scholars cite schools with distinctive doctrines, they use group names to describe the school rather than its geographical location. Those who studied under [[Robert of Melun]] were called the ''Meludinenses''. These people did not study in [[Melun]], but in Paris, and were given the group name of their master. Citizens in the twelfth-century became very interested in learning the rare and difficult skills masters could provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century|last = Southern|first = R.W.|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1982|isbn = |location = |pages = 114, 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland became known as the island of saints and scholars. Monasteries were built all over Ireland and these became centres of great learning (see [[Celtic Church]]).

[[Northumbria]] was famed as a centre of religious learning and arts. Initially the kingdom was [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|evangelized]] by monks from the [[Celtic Church]], which led to a flowering of monastic life, and Northumbria played an important role in the formation of [[Insular art]], a unique style combining Anglo-Saxon, [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]], [[Byzantine]] and other elements.  After the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664 AD, Roman church practices officially replaced the Celtic ones but the influence of the Anglo-Celtic style continued, the most famous examples of this being the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]. The Venerable [[Bede]] (673-735) wrote his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed in 731) in a Northumbrian monastery, and much of it focuses on the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, Walter. ''The Narrators of Barbarian History (A.D. 550-800): Jordanes, Gregory of Tours, Bede, and Paul the Deacon'' (Princeton University Press, 1988) pp. 238ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Charlemagne]], King of the [[Franks]] from 768 – 814 AD, whose empire united most of Western Europe for the first time since the Romans, there was a flowering of literature, art, and architecture known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].  Brought into contact with the culture and learning of other countries through his vast conquests, Charlemagne greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and [[scriptoria]] (centres for book-copying) in [[Francia]]. Most of the surviving works of classical Latin were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars.

Charlemagne took a serious interest in scholarship, promoting the [[liberal arts]] at the court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself under the tutelage of Paul the Deacon, from whom he learned grammar, Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialect and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars), and Einhard, who assisted him in his studies of arithmetic.  The English monk [[Alcuin]] was invited to Charlemagne's court at [[Aachen]], and brought with him the precise classical Latin education that was available in the monasteries of [[Northumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor S. Duckett, ''Alcuin, Friend of Charlemagne: His World and his Work'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  The return of this Latin proficiency to the kingdom of the Franks is regarded as an important step in the development of mediaeval Latin. Charlemagne's chancery made use of a type of script currently known as [[Carolingian minuscule]], providing a common writing style that allowed for communication across most of Europe. After the decline of the Carolingian dynasty, the rise of the [[Saxon Dynasty]] in Germany was accompanied by the [[Ottonian Renaissance]].

[[File:TrinityCollegeCamGreatGate.jpg|thumb|Cambridge and many other universities were founded at this time.]]
Cathedral schools and monasteries remained important throughout the Middle Ages; at the [[Third Lateran Council]] of 1179 the Church mandated that priests provide the opportunity of a free education to their flocks, and the 12th and 13th century renascence known as the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic Movement]] was spread through the monasteries.  These however ceased to be the sole sources of education in the 11th century when [[medieval university|universities]], which grew out of the monasticism began to be established in major European cities. Literacy became available to a wider class of people, and there were major advances in art, sculpture, music and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph W.

In 1120, [[Dunfermline Abbey]] in Scotland by order of [[Malcolm Canmore]] and his Queen, Margaret, built and established the first high school in the UK, [[Dunfermline High School]]. This highlighted the monastery influence and developments made for education, from the ancient capital of Scotland.

Sculpture, paintings and stained glass windows were vital educational media through which Biblical themes and the lives of the saints were taught to illiterate viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Porter, ''Dictionary of biblical criticism and interpretation'' (2007) p 223&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 6th and 7th centuries, the [[Academy of Gundishapur]], originally the intellectual center of the [[Sassanid empire]] and subsequently a Muslim centre of learning, offered training in medicine, philosophy, theology and science. The faculty were versed not only in the Zoroastrian and Persian traditions, but in Greek and Indian learning as well.

Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], the towns of [[Bursa]] and [[Edirne]] became major centers of learning.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the town of [[Timbuktu]] in the West African nation of Mali became an Islamic centre of learning with students coming from as far away as the Middle East. The town was home to the prestigious [[Sankore University]] and other madrasas. The primary focus of these schools was the teaching of the [[Qur'an]], although broader instruction in fields such as logic, astronomy, and history also took place. Over time, there was a great accumulation of manuscripts in the area and an estimated 100,000 or more [[manuscript]]s, some of them dated from pre-Islamic times and 12th century, are kept by the great families from the town.&lt;ref name="Manuscrits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/08/DJIAN/11470|title=Les manuscrits trouvés à Tombouctou|date=1 August 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their contents are didactic, especially in the subjects of astronomy, music, and botany.

===China===
{{main article|History of education in China|History of education in Taiwan}}
Although there are more than 40,000 [[Chinese characters]] in written Chinese, many are rarely used. Studies have shown that full literacy in the [[Chinese language]] requires a knowledge of only between three and four thousand characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askasia.org/teachers/essays/essay.php?no=101|title=Chinese Writing: Transitions and Transformations|last=Norman|first=Jerry|authorlink=Jerry Norman (sinologist)|year=2005|accessdate=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, three oral texts were used to teach children by rote memorization the written characters of their language and the basics of Confucian thought.

The [[Thousand Character Classic]], a Chinese poem originating in the 6th century, was used for more than a millennium as a primer for teaching Chinese characters to children. The poem is composed of 250 phrases of four characters each, thus containing exactly one thousand unique characters, and was sung in the same way that children learning the Latin alphabet may use the "[[alphabet song]]".

Later, children also learn the [[Hundred Family Surnames]], a rhyming poem in lines of eight characters composed in the early [[Song dynasty]]&lt;ref name="KS"&gt;K. S. Tom. [1989] (1989). ''Echoes from Old China: Life, Legends and Lore of the Middle Kingdom''. University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-1285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. in about the 11th century) which actually listed more than four hundred of the common surnames in ancient China.

From around the 13th century until the latter part of the 19th century, the [[Three Character Classic]], which is an embodiment of [[Confucianism|Confucian thought]] suitable for teaching to young children, served as a child's first formal education at home. The text is written in triplets of characters for easy memorization. With illiteracy common for most people at the time, the oral tradition of reciting the classic ensured its popularity and survival through the centuries. With the short and simple text arranged in three-character verses, children learned many common characters, grammar structures, elements of [[Chinese history]] and the basis of [[Confucian]] morality.

After learning Chinese characters, students wishing to ascend in the social hierarchy needed to study the [[Chinese classic texts]].

The early Chinese state depended upon literate, educated officials for operation of the empire. In 605 AD, during the [[Sui dynasty]], for the first time, an examination system was explicitly instituted for a category of local talents. The merit-based [[imperial examination|imperial examination system]] for evaluating and selecting officials gave rise to schools that taught the Chinese classic texts and continued in use for 1,300 years, until the end the [[Qing dynasty]], being abolished in 1911 in favour of Western education methods. The core of the curriculum for the imperial civil service examinations from the mid-12th century onwards was the [[Four Books]], representing a foundational introduction to Confucianism.

Theoretically, any male adult in China, regardless of his wealth or social status, could become a high-ranking government official by passing the imperial examination, although under some dynasties members of the merchant class were excluded. In reality, since the process of studying for the examination tended to be time-consuming and costly (if tutors were hired), most of the candidates came from the numerically small but relatively wealthy land-owning gentry.  However, there are vast numbers of examples in [[Chinese history]] in which individuals moved from a low social status to political prominence through success in imperial examination. Under some dynasties the imperial examinations were abolished and official posts were simply sold, which increased [[Political corruption|corruption]] and reduced morale.

In the period preceding 1040–1050 AD, [[Zhou (country subdivision)|prefectural]] schools had been neglected by the state and left to the devices of wealthy patrons who provided private finances.&lt;ref name="yuan"&gt;Yuan, Zheng. "Local Government Schools in Sung China: A Reassessment", ''History of Education Quarterly'' (Volume 34, Number 2; Summer 1994): 193–213; at pages 196-201.&lt;/ref&gt; The chancellor of China at that time, [[Fan Zhongyan]], issued an edict that would have used a combination of government funding and private financing to restore and rebuild all prefectural schools that had fallen into disuse and abandoned.&lt;ref name="yuan"/&gt; He also attempted to restore all county-level schools in the same manner, but did not designate where funds for the effort would be formally acquired and the decree was not taken seriously until a later period.&lt;ref name="yuan"/&gt; Fan's trend of government funding for education set in motion the movement of public schools that eclipsed private academies, which would not be officially reversed until the mid-13th century.&lt;ref name="yuan"/&gt;

The first millennium and the few centuries preceding it saw the flourishing of higher education at [[Nalanda]], [[Takshashila University]], [[Ujjain]], &amp; [[Vikramshila]] Universities. Amongst the subjects taught were Art, Architecture, Painting, Logic, mathematics, Grammar, Philosophy, Astronomy, Literature, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Arthashastra]] (Economics &amp; Politics), Law, and Medicine. Each university specialized in a particular field of study. Takshila specialized in the study of medicine, while Ujjain laid emphasis on astronomy. Nalanda, being the biggest centre, handled all branches of knowledge, and housed up to 10,000 students at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Suresh Kant Sharma|title=Encyclopaedia of Higher Education: Historical survey-pre-independence period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMwUONSXKocC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2005|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-8324-013-0|pages=4ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vikramashila]] Mahavihara, another important center of Buddhist learning in India, was established by King [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] (783 to 820) in response to a supposed decline in the quality of scholarship at Nālandā.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Radhakumud Mookerji|title=Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjFfqpq7HhkC&amp;pg=PA587|year=1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0423-4|page=587ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{Main article|History of education in Japan}}

The history of [[education in Japan]] dates back at least to the 6th century, when Chinese learning was introduced at the [[Yamato period|Yamato]] court. Foreign civilizations have often provided new ideas for the development of Japan's own culture.

Chinese teachings and ideas flowed into Japan from the sixth to the 9th century. Along with the introduction of [[Buddhism]] came the [[Chinese system of writing]] and its [[Chinese literature|literary tradition]], and [[Confucianism]].

By the 9th century, Heian-kyo (today's [[Kyoto]]), the imperial capital, had five institutions of higher learning, and during the remainder of the [[Heian period]], other schools were established by the nobility and the imperial court. During the medieval period (1185-1600), [[Zen]] Buddhist [[monastery|monasteries]] were especially important centers of learning, and the [[Ashikaga clan|Ashikaga]] School, [[Ashikaga Gakko]], flourished in the 15th century as a center of higher learning.

===Central and South American civilizations===

====Aztec====
{{Main article|Aztec}}

[[Aztec]] is a term used  to refer to certain ethnic groups of central [[Mexico]], particularly those groups who spoke the [[Nahuatl language]] and who achieved political and military dominance over large parts of [[Mesoamerica]] in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, a period referred to as the Late post-Classic period in [[Mesoamerican chronology]].

Until the age of fourteen, the education of children was in the hands of their parents, but supervised by the authorities of their ''calpōlli''. Part of this education involved learning a collection of sayings, called ''huēhuetlàtolli'' ("sayings of the old"), that embodied the Aztecs' ideals. Judged by their language, most of the ''huēhuetlàtolli'' seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.

At 15, all boys and girls went to school. The Mexica, one of the Aztec groups, were one of the first people in the world to have mandatory education for nearly all children, regardless of gender, rank, or station{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}. There were two types of schools: the ''telpochcalli'', for practical and military studies, and the ''[[calmecac]]'', for advanced learning in writing, astronomy, statesmanship, theology, and other areas. The two institutions seem to be common to the Nahua people, leading some experts to suggest that they are older than the Aztec culture.

Aztec teachers (''tlatimine'') propounded a spartan regime of education with the purpose of forming a stoical people.

Girls were educated in the crafts of home and child raising. They were not taught to read or write. All women were taught to be involved in religion; there are paintings of women presiding over religious ceremonies, but there are no references to female priests.

====Inca====
{{Main article|Inca education}}

[[Inca education]] during the time of the [[Inca Empire]] in the 15th and 16th centuries was divided into two principal spheres: education for the upper classes and education for the general population. The royal classes and a few specially chosen individuals from the [[Provinces of Peru|provinces]] of the Empire were formally educated by the '''''Amautas''''' (wise men), while the general population learned knowledge and skills from their immediate forebears.

The Amautas constituted a special class of wise men similar to the [[bards]] of [[Great Britain]]. They included illustrious [[philosophers]], [[poets]], and [[priests]] who kept the oral histories of the Incas alive by imparting the knowledge of their culture, history, customs and traditions throughout the kingdom. Considered the most highly educated and respected men in the Empire, the Amautas were largely entrusted with educating those of [[royal family|royal]] blood, as well as other young members of [[Cultural periods of Peru|conquered cultures]] specially chosen to administer the regions. Thus, education throughout the territories of the Incas was socially discriminatory, most people not receiving the formal education that royalty received.

The official language of the empire was [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], although dozens if not hundreds of local languages were spoken.  The Amautas did ensure that the general population learn Quechua as the language of the Empire, much in the same way the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] promoted [[Latin]] throughout [[Europe]]; however, this was done more for political reasons than educational ones.

==After the 15th century==

===Europe===

====Europe overview====
[[File:Teaching Bucharest 1842.jpg|thumb|left|''Primary School in "open air"''. Teacher with class, from the outskirts of [[Bucharest]], around 1842.]]

Modern systems of education in Europe derive their origins from the schools of the [[High Middle Ages]]. Most schools during this era were founded upon religious principles with the primary purpose of training the clergy. Many of the earliest universities, such as the [[University of Paris]] founded in 1160, had a [[Christianity|Christian]] basis. In addition to this, a number of secular universities existed, such as the [[University of Bologna]], founded in 1088. Free education for the poor was officially mandated by the Church in 1179 when it decreed that every cathedral must assign a master to teach boys too poor to pay the regular fee;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orme|first=Nicholas|title=Medieval Schools|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven &amp; London}}&lt;/ref&gt; parishes and monasteries also established free schools teaching at least basic literary skills. With few exceptions, priests and brothers taught locally, and their salaries were frequently subsidized by towns. Private, independent schools reappeared in medieval Europe during this time, but they, too, were religious in nature and mission.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Jeep, ''Medieval Germany: an encyclopedia'' (2001) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum was usually based around the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and to a lesser extent [[quadrivium]] (the seven [[Artes Liberales]] or [[Liberal arts]]) and was conducted in Latin, the lingua franca of educated Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur A. Tilley, ''Medieval France: A Companion to French Studies'' (2010) p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern Europe this clerical education was largely superseded by forms of elementary schooling following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. In [[Scotland]], for instance, the national [[Church of Scotland]] set out a programme for spiritual reform in January 1561 setting the principle of a school teacher for every parish church and free education for the poor. This was provided for by an Act of the [[Parliament of Scotland]], passed in 1633, which introduced a tax to pay for this programme. Although few countries of the period had such extensive systems of education, the period between the 16th and 18th centuries saw education become significantly more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;William Boyd and Edmund King, ''The History of Western Education'' (10th ed. 1972), pp 183-208&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbart]] developed a system of pedagogy widely used in German-speaking areas.
Mass compulsory schooling started in Prussia c1800 to "produce more soldiers and more obedient citizens" 

====Central and Eastern Europe====
In [[Central Europe]], the 17th century scientist and educator [[John Amos Comenius]] promulgated a reformed system of universal education that was widely used in Europe.
his growth resulted in increased government interest in education. In the 1760s, for instance, [[Ivan Betskoy]] was appointed by the Russian Tsarina, [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], as educational advisor. He proposed to educate young Russians of both sexes in state boarding schools, aimed at creating "a new race of men". Betskoy set forth a number of arguments for general education of children rather than specialized one: "in regenerating our subjects by an education founded on these principles, we will create... new citizens." Some of his ideas were implemented in the [[Smolny Institute]] that he established for noble girls in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Ransel, "Ivan Betskoi and the Institutionalization of the Enlightenment in Russia." ''Canadian-American Slavic Studies'' 14.3 (1980): 327-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland established in 1773 of a [[Commission of National Education]] (Polish: ''Komisja Edukacji Narodowej'', Lithuanian: ''Nacionaline Edukacine Komisija''). The commission functioned as the first government  Ministry of Education in a European country.&lt;ref&gt; Danuta M.

By the 18th century, universities published [[academic journal]]s; by the 19th century, the German and the French university models were established. The French established the [[Ecole Polytechnique]] in 1794 by the mathematician Gaspard Monge during the French Revolution, and it became a military academy under Napoleon I in 1804.  The German university — the Humboldtian model — established by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] was based upon [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]’s liberal ideas about the importance of [[seminar]]s, and [[laboratory|laboratories]].  In the 19th and 20th centuries, the universities concentrated upon science, and served an upper class clientele.  Science, mathematics, theology, philosophy, and ancient history comprised the typical curriculum. 

Increasing academic interest in education led to analysis of teaching methods and in the 1770s the establishment of the first chair of [[pedagogy]] at the [[University of Halle]] in Germany. Contributions to the study of education elsewhere in Europe included the work of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] in Switzerland and [[Joseph Lancaster]] in Britain.


In 1884, a groundbreaking education conference was held in London at the [[International Health Exhibition]], attracting specialists from all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carline, R. (1968). ''Draw they must: A history of the teaching and examining
of art''. London: Edward Arnold, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;
====19th century====
In the late 19th century, most of West, Central, and parts of East Europe began to provide elementary education in reading, writing, and arithmetic, partly because politicians believed that education was needed for orderly political behavior. As more people became literate, they realized that most secondary education was only open to those who could afford it. Having created primary education, the major nations had to give further attention to secondary education by the time of World War I.&lt;ref name=Kagan&gt;Donald Kagan, Steven Ozment, Frank M Turner (2007).

====20th century====
In the 20th century, new directions in education included, in Italy, [[Maria Montessori]]'s [[Montessori method|Montessori schools]]; and in Germany, [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s development of [[Waldorf education]].

====France====
{{Main|History of education in France}}
In the Ancien Régime before 1789, educational facilities and aspirations were becoming increasingly institutionalized primarily in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators. France had many small local schools where working-class children — both boys and girls — learned to read, the better to know, love and serve God. The sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites, however, were given quite distinct educations: boys were sent to upper school, perhaps a university, while their sisters perhaps were sent for finishing at a convent. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] challenged this old ideal, but no real alternative presented itself for female education. Only through education at home were knowledgeable women formed, usually to the sole end of dazzling their salons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/367607 |jstor=367607 |title=Noblesse, Domesticity, and Social Reform: The Education of Girls by Fenelon and Saint-Cyr |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=87–114 |year=1974 |last1=Lougee |first1=Carolyn C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern era of French education begins in the 1790s. The Revolution in the 1790s abolished the traditional universities'' &lt;ref&gt;Howard Clive Barnard, ''Education and the French revolution'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon sought to replace them with new institutions, the Polytechnique, focused on technology.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Bradley,  "Scientific Education for a New Society The Ecole Polytechnique 1795–1830." ''History of Education'' (1976) 5#1 (1976) pp: 11-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The elementary schools received little attention until 1830, when France copied the Prussian system.

[[Jules Ferry]], an anti-clerical politician holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, created the modern Republican school (''l'école républicaine'') by requiring all children under the age of 15—boys and girls—to attend. see [[Jules Ferry laws]] Schools were free of charge and [[secular education|secular]] (''[[Laïcité|laïque]]''). The goal was to break the hold of the Catholic Church and monarchism on young people.  Catholic schools were still tolerated but in the early 20th century the religious orders sponsoring them were shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Chadwick, "Education in secular France:(re) defining laïcité." ''Modern &amp; Contemporary France'' (1997) 5#1 pp: 47-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett B. Singer, "Jules Ferry and the laic revolution in French primary education." ''Paedagogica Historica'' (1975) 15#2 pp: 406-425.&lt;/ref&gt;
====England====
In 1818, John Pounds set up a school and began teaching poor children reading, writing, and mathematics without charging fees. 
In 1820, Samuel Wilderspin opened the first infant school in Spitalfield. In August 1833, Parliament voted to sum money to support poor children's school fees in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=MK|url=http://www.infed.org/youthwork/ragged_schools.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1837, the Whig former Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham presented a bill for public education.

===Japan===
{{Main article|History of education in Japan}}
Japan isolated itself from the rest of the world in the year 1600 under the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] regime (1600–1867). In 1600 very few common people were literate. By the period's end, learning had become widespread. Tokugawa education left a valuable legacy: an increasingly literate populace, a [[meritocratic]] ideology, and an emphasis on discipline and competent performance. Traditional Samurai curricula for elites stressed morality and the martial arts. [[Confucian classics]] were memorized, and reading and recitation of them were common methods of study. Arithmetic and calligraphy were also studied. Education of commoners was generally practically oriented, providing basic 3-Rs, calligraphy and use of the [[abacus]]. Much of this education was conducted in so-called temple schools ([[terakoya]]), derived from earlier Buddhist schools. These schools were no longer religious institutions, nor were they, by 1867, predominantly located in temples. By the end of the Tokugawa period, there were more than 11,000 such schools, attended by 750,000 students. Teaching techniques included reading from various textbooks, memorizing, abacus, and repeatedly copying [[Chinese characters]] and Japanese script. By the 1860s, 40-50% of Japanese boys, and 15% of the girls, had some schooling outside the home. These rates were comparable to major European nations at the time (apart from Germany, which had compulsory schooling).&lt;ref&gt;Bryon K. Marshall, "Universal Social Dilemmas and Japanese Educational History: The Writings of R. P. Dore, ''History of Education Quarterly,'' (1972) 12#1 pp 97-106 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/367151 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Under subsequent [[Meiji period|Meiji]] leadership, this foundation would facilitate Japan's rapid transition from feudal society to modern nation which paid very close attention to Western science, technology and educational methods.

====Meiji reforms====

{{see also|Education in the Empire of Japan}}
After 1868 reformers set Japan on a rapid course of [[modernization]], with a public education system like that of Western Europe.  Missions like the [[Iwakura mission]] were sent abroad to study the education systems of leading Western countries. They returned with the ideas of decentralization, local [[school board]]s, and teacher autonomy. Elementary school enrollments climbed from about 40 or 50 percent of the school-age population in the 1870s to more than 90 percent by 1900, despite strong public protest, especially against school fees.

A modern concept of childhood emerged in Japan after 1850 as part of its engagement with the West. Meiji era leaders decided the nation-state had the primary role in mobilizing individuals - and children - in service of the state. The Western-style school became the agent to reach that goal. By the 1890s, schools were generating new sensibilities regarding childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Platt, "Japanese Childhood, Modern Childhood: The Nation-State, the School, and 19th-Century Globalization," '' Journal of Social History,'' (2005) 38#4  pp 965-985 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790485 « in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1890 Japan had numerous reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and well-educated mothers who bought into the new sensibility. They taught the upper middle class a model of childhood that included children having their own space where they read children's books, played with educational toys and, especially, devoted enormous time to school homework. These ideas rapidly disseminated through all social classes&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen S. Uno, ''Passages to Modernity: Motherhood, Childhood, and Social Reform in Early 20th century Japan'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Jones, ''Children as Treasures: Childhood and the Middle Class in Early 20th century Japan'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1870 school textbooks based on Confucianism were replaced by westernized texts. However, by the 1890s, a reaction set in and a more authoritarian approach was imposed. Traditional Confucian and Shinto precepts were again stressed, especially those concerning the hierarchical nature of human relations, service to the new state, the pursuit of learning, and morality. These ideals, embodied in the 1890 [[Imperial Rescript on Education]], along with highly centralized government control over education, largely guided Japanese education until 1945, when they were massively repudiated.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Nivison and Arthur F. Wright, eds. ''Confucianism in action'' (1959) p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Education was widespread for elite young men in the 18th century, with schools in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion.

The current system of education, with its western style and content, was introduced and founded by the British during the [[British Raj]], following recommendations by [[Lord Macaulay]], who advocated for the teaching of English in schools and the formation of a class of Anglicized Indian interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html|title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay|website=www.columbia.edu|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional structures were not recognized by the British government and have been on the decline since.

Public education expenditures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries varied dramatically across regions with the western and southern provinces spending three to four times as much as the eastern provinces. Much of the inter-regional differential was due to historical differences in land taxes, the major source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Latika Chaudhary, "Land revenues, schools and literacy: A historical examination of public and private funding of education," ''Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review,'' April–June 2010, Vol. 47 Issue 2, pp 179-204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy 1899-1905, made mass education a high priority after finding that no more than 20% of India's children attended school. His reforms centered on literacy training and on restructuring of the university systems. They stressed ungraded curricula, modern textbooks, and new examination systems. Curzon's plans for technical education laid the foundations which were acted upon by later governments.&lt;ref&gt;V. C. Bhutani, "Curzon'S Educational Reform in India," ''Journal of Indian History,'' 1973, Vol. 51 Issue 151, pp 65-92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{Main article|Education in Norway}}

Organized education in Norway dates as far back as [[Middle Ages|medieval times]]. Shortly after Norway became an [[Diocese|archdiocese]] in 1152, [[cathedral school]]s were constructed to educate priests in [[Trondheim]], [[Oslo]], [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] and [[Hamar]].

After the [[Lutheranism|reformation]] of Norway in 1537, (Norway entered a [[Denmark-Norway|personal union]] with [[Denmark]] in 1536) the cathedral schools were turned into Latin schools, and it was made mandatory for all [[market town]]s to have such a school.

In 1736 training in reading was made compulsory for all children, but was not effective until some years later. In 1827, Norway introduced the ''folkeskole'', a primary school which became mandatory for 7 years in 1889 and 9 years in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ''folkeskole'' was abolished, and the ''grunnskole'' was introduced.

In 1997, Norway established a new curriculum for elementary schools and middle schools. The plan is based on ideological nationalism, child-orientation, and community-orientation along with the effort to publish new ways of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christian|first1=Beck|title=EDUCATION OTHERWISE AND HOME EDUCATION IN NORWAY|url=http://folk.uio.no/cbeck/EDUCATION%20OTHERWISE%20IN%20NORWAY.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia, Canada, New Zealand===
{{Main article|History of Education in Australia|History of Education in Canada|History of Education in New Zealand}}
In Canada, education became a contentious issue after Confederation in 1867, especially regarding the status of French schools outside Quebec.

Education in New Zealand began with provision made by the provincial government, the missionary Christian churches and private education. The first act of parliament for education was passed in 1877, and sought to establish a standard for primary education. It was compulsory for children to attend school from the age of 6 until the age of 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaving school before the age of 16|url=https://parents.education.govt.nz/secondary-school/your-child-at-school/leaving-school-before-the-age-of-16/|website=Education.govt.nz|accessdate=1 December 2017|date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, compulsory education was enacted in the 1870s, and it was difficult to enforce. People found it hard to afford for school fees. Moreover, teachers felt that they did not get high salary for what they have done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCreadie|first1=Marion|title=The Evolution of Education in Australia|url=http://www.historyaustralia.org.au/ifhaa/schools/evelutio.htm|publisher=IFHAA Australian Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union===
{{Main article|Education in the Soviet Union}}
[[File:BogdanovBelsky UstnySchet.jpg|thumb|right|Mental Calculations. In the school of S.Rachinsky by [[Nikolay Bogdanov-Belsky]]. 1895.]]

In [[Imperial Russia]], according to the 1897 census, literate people made up 28 percent of the population. There was a strong network of universities for the upper class, but weaker provisions for everyone else.

[[Vladimir Lenin]], in 1919 proclaimed the major aim of the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]] was the abolition of illiteracy. A system of universal compulsory education was established. Millions of illiterate adults were enrolled in special [[literacy school]]s. Youth groups ([[Komsomol]] members and [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneer]]) were utilized to teach.  In 1926, the [[literacy rate]] was 56.6 percent of the population. By 1937, according to [[Soviet Census (1937)|census data]], the literacy rate was 86% for men and 65% for women, making a total literacy rate of 75%.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, S. (1994). ''Stalin's peasants: resistance and survival in the Russian village after collectivization''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 225-6 &amp; fn. 78 p. 363. {{OCLC|28293091}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the early campaign for literacy and education was the policy of "indigenization" ([[korenizatsiya]]).  This policy, which lasted essentially from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s, promoted the development and use of non-Russian languages in the government, the media, and education. Intended to counter the historical practices of Russification, it had as another practical goal assuring native-language education as the quickest way to increase educational levels of future generations.  A huge network of so-called "national schools" was established by the 1930s, and this network continued to grow in enrollments throughout the Soviet era. Language policy changed over time, perhaps marked first of all in the government's mandating in 1938 the teaching of Russian as a required ''subject'' of study in every non-Russian school, and then especially beginning in the latter 1950s a growing conversion of non-Russian schools to Russian as the main medium of instruction.

===Africa===
{{See also|Education in Africa|History of education in Angola|History of education in Chad}}

Education in French controlled West Africa during the late 1800s and early 1900s was different from the nationally uniform compulsory education of France in the 1880s.  "Adapted education" was organized in 1903 and used the French curriculum as a basis, replacing information relevant to France with "comparable information drawn from the African context."  For example, French lessons of morality were coupled with many references to African history and local folklore.  The French language was also taught as an integral part of adapted education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conklin|first=Alice L.|date=1998-01-01|title=Colonialism and Human Rights, A Contradiction in Terms? The Case of France and West Africa, 1895-1914|jstor=2649774|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=103|issue=2|pages=419–442|doi=10.2307/2649774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa has more than 40 million children. According to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Regional overview on sub-Saharan Africa'', in 2000 only 58% of children were enrolled in primary schools, the lowest enrollment rate of any region.  The USAID Center reports as of 2005, forty percent of school-aged children in Africa do not attend primary school.

Today, there is some form of [[compulsory education]] in most countries. Due to population growth and the proliferation of compulsory education, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity'']. TED Talks, 2006, Monterey, CA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Illiteracy and the percentage of populations without any schooling have decreased in the past several decades. For example, the percentage of population without any schooling decreased from 36% in 1960 to 25% in 2000.

Among developing countries, illiteracy and percentages without schooling in 2000 stood at about half the 1970 figures.  Among developed countries, figures about illiteracy rates differ widely. Often it is said that they decreased from 6% to 1%. Illiteracy rates in less economically developed countries ([[LEDC]]s) surpassed those of more economically developed countries ([[MEDC]]s) by a factor of 10 in 1970, and by a factor of about 20 in 2000.  Illiteracy decreased greatly in LEDCs, and virtually disappeared in MEDCs.  Percentages without any schooling showed similar patterns.

Percentages of the population with no schooling varied greatly among LEDCs in 2000, from less than 10% to over 65%.  MEDCs had much less variation, ranging from less than 2% to 17%.

Since the mid-20th century, societies around the globe have undergone an accelerating pace of change in economy and technology.  Its effects on the workplace, and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the workforce, have been significant.  Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing and increasingly digital workplace and society.  '''[[21st century skills]]''' are a series of higher-order [[skills]], abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies.  Many of these skills are also associated with [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], including analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork, compared to traditional knowledge-based academic skills.&lt;ref name="Dede"&gt;[http://sttechnology.pbworks.com/f/Dede_(2010)_Comparing%20Frameworks%20for%2021st%20Century%20Skills.pdf Chris Dede, Comparing Frameworks for 21st Century Skills, Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2009].

The '''Humanities Indicators''' is a project of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] that equips researchers and policymakers, universities, foundations, museums, libraries, humanities councils and other public institutions with statistical tools for answering basic questions about primary and secondary humanities education, undergraduate and graduate education in the [[humanities]], the humanities workforce, levels and sources of program funding, public understanding and impact of the humanities, and other areas of concern in the humanities community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/First-National-Picture-of/1437 ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', "First National Picture of Trends in the Humanities Is Unveiled"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/system/inTheNews.aspx Indicators in the News].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Data from the Humanities Indicators has been widely discussed in recent conversations about a "crisis in the humanities", in light of a national decline in the number of college majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/06/05/analysis-finds-significant-drop-humanities-majors-gains-liberal-arts-degrees|title=Humanities Majors Drop|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|date=June 5, 2017|work=Inside Higher Ed|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/liberal-arts-majors-are-a-dying-breed-2017-06-05|title=Liberal arts majors are a dying breed|last=Berman|first=Jillian|date=July 30, 2017|work=MarketWatch|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address questions about the workforce outcomes of humanities graduates (which are often cited as playing a role in the falling number of majors as of 2015), the Indicators issued [https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/publications/researchpapersmonographs/HI_Workforce-2018.pdf ''The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond''], which examined not only their employment and earnings relative to other fields, but also graduates’ satisfaction with their work after graduation and their lives more generally. The data reveal that despite disparities in median earnings, humanities majors are quite similar to graduates from other fields with respect to their ''perceived'' well-being. The report was widely cited in the media as an important intervention in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/report-busts-myth-of-unemployable-humanities-grads/|title=Report busts myth of unemployable humanities grads|last=Long|first=Katherine|date=February 12, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/07/study-finds-humanities-majors-land-jobs-and-are-happy-them|title=Shocker: Humanities Grads Gainfully Employed and Happy|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|date=February 7, 2018|work=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Over-Time-Humanities-Grads/242461|title=Over Time, Humanities Grads Close the Pay Gap With Professional Peers|last=Carlson|first=Scott|date=February 7, 2018|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Identity''''' is a 2003 [[United States|American]] [[psychological thriller film]] directed by [[James Mangold]] from a screenplay written by Michael Cooney. The film stars [[John Cusack]], [[Ray Liotta]], [[Amanda Peet]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Clea DuVall]] and [[Rebecca De Mornay]].

While it is not a direct adaptation of the 1939 [[Agatha Christie]] [[whodunit]] novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', which was adapted for feature films in [[And Then There Were None (1945 film)|1945]], [[Ten Little Indians (1965 film)|1965]], [[And Then There Were None (1974 film)|1974]], [[Desyat Negrityat|1987]] and [[Ten Little Indians (1989 film)|1989]], the plot draws from the structure the novel first popularized in which 10 strangers arrive at an isolated location which becomes temporarily cut off from the rest of the world, and are mysteriously killed off one by one. Several events which take place in the hours before the characters arrived at the hotel are introduced at key moments during the film using a [[reverse chronology]] structure. 

==Plot==
A convict named Malcolm Rivers awaits execution for several vicious murders that took place at an apartment building. Journals belonging to Malcolm are discovered mis-filed in the case  evidence, not introduced during the trial. Malcolm's psychiatrist, Dr. Malick, and his defense attorney argue that the evidence was intentionally suppressed by the prosecution and move to stay Rivers' execution, contending that Malcolm is legally insane. With this late evidence brought forth, a midnight hearing takes place, to determine if the journal is adequate evidence to grant their motion.

Meanwhile, ten strangers find themselves stranded in the middle of a torrential rainstorm at a remote [[Nevada]] motel, run by Larry Washington. The group consists of an ex-cop, now limousine driver, Ed Dakota; Caroline Suzanne, an actress popular in the 1980s; Officer Rhodes, who is transporting convicted murderer Robert Maine; Paris Nevada, a prostitute; newlyweds Lou and Ginny Isiana; and the York family, George, Alice and their nine-year-old son, Timmy, who are in crisis because Alice has been struck by Ed's car. 

With both ends of the road completely flooded, the group is forced to spend the night at the motel, but an unidentified killer begins to murder them one by one. Sequentially numbered keys are found near each of the first three victim's bodies, leading the group to suspect that they are being targeted in order. They discover that the motel's brochure describes Native Americans being buried next to the motel, and consider that the bizarre deaths could be the work of some supernatural element.

At the hearing, the contents of Malcolm's diaries are revealed, indicating Malcolm suffers from an extreme case of [[dissociative identity disorder]], harboring eleven distinct personalities. His journal contains entries written by his different personalities, each with distinct handwriting and writing style, as if they were the personal thoughts of several different people. His defense attorney argues that Malcolm is completely unaware of the crimes for which he is being executed, which is in violation of existing [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] rulings on capital punishment. Dr. Malick is introducing the concept of integrating the personalities of someone with dissociative identity disorder, when Malcolm arrives, strapped into a wheelchair.

At the hotel, two people die in clear accidents, but numbered keys are still discovered near their bodies. Attempting to flee, two more guests are apparently killed when their car explodes. However, after the fire is extinguished, no bodies are found, and the group then discovers that the bodies of all the previous victims have disappeared. Paris, yelling in hysterics at their unknown assailant, says that her birthday is the next week; it transpires that all eleven people were born on May 10 — which is also Malcolm's birthday, and the day he committed the murders.

Ed hears a voice call out to him, and as he listens he finds himself in different building, strapped to the chair, with Dr. Malick calling out to him. Finding he is at the meeting to argue and postpone Malcolm's execution, confused as to why he's being told of the crimes and Malcolm Rivers' past. Dr. Malick explains that he is in fact one of the personalities that Malcolm Rivers created as a child to cope with the abandonment and abuse he was subjected to. Informed that one of the personalities is the homicidal template that went on a killing spree, Ed is instructed to "go back" to the motel to try and eliminate this identity.

Ed 'awakens' to find himself standing in the rain, looking at the motel from a distance. Paris finds convict-transportation files for both Maine and Rhodes in the police car. A flashback reveals that Rhodes killed the correctional officer transporting him and Maine, putting the officer's body in the trunk, and then assumed his identity. Rhodes attacks Paris, but she is saved by Larry, who is then shot and killed by Rhodes. Believing Rhodes to be the murderous personality, Ed goes after him, and they end up shooting each other fatally, leaving only Paris still alive. 

When Malick demonstrates that the homicidal personality is dead, Malcolm's execution is stayed and he is placed in a [[mental institution]] under Malick's care. In Malcolm's mind, Paris has driven back to her hometown in [[Frostproof, Florida]]. As she tends to some soil in her orange grove, she discovers the room 1 motel key, and finds Timmy behind her. Flashbacks reveal that Timmy orchestrated all of the deaths at the motel, and made it appear that he had been killed with Ginny. Timmy kills Paris, while Malcolm strangles Malick, causing the van to swerve off the road and stop before Timmy's voice repeats the poem one more time, now the sole personality of Malcolm Rivers.

[[Angelo Badalamenti]] was originally signed to score the film, but his music was replaced with a new score by [[Alan Silvestri]] (Silvestri had previously replaced Badalamenti on 1991's ''[[Shattered (1991 film)|Shattered]]'').

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 62%, based on 171 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/identity |title=''Identity'' (2003) |accessdate=16 October 2017|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 points, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/identity |title=''Identity'' (2003) |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote upon the film's release, "Altogether, there are 10 guests. One by one, they die. Agatha Christie fans will assume that one of them is the murderer—or maybe it's the clerk... I think it is possible that some audience members, employing [my] Law of Economy of Characters, might be able to arrive at the solution slightly before the movie does."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger (April 25, 2003). [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/identity-2003 "''Identity'' (2003)"]. ''Chicago Sun-Times''. RogerEbert.com. Retrieved January 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mick LaSalle of ''[[SFGate]]'' reported, "At first, ''Identity'' seems like nothing more than a pleasing and blatant homage (i.e. rip-off) to the Agatha Christie-style thriller where marooned guests realize that a murderer is in their midst ... we've seen it before. Yet make no mistake. ''Identity'' is more than an entertaining thriller. It's a highly original one."&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle, Mick (September 5, 2003).

''[[The Village Voice]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Dennis Lim wrote of the film's premise, "The premise of the one-rainy-night thriller ''Identity'' seems like mothballed Agatha Christie," and of the film's third act twist, "The ultimate cliché of plot-twist implausibility, the crucial revelation is so outlandishly fatuous it might have given [[Adaptation (film)|Donald Kaufman]] pause. But there's nothing self-parodic about ''Identity''—the viewer must not only swallow the nullifying third-act bombshell but actually re-engage with the movie on its new, extremely dubious terms."&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Dennis (April 29, 2003).

Brian Mckay of ''eFilmCritic.com'' wrote, "This film's cardinal sin was not that it had an engrossing but extremely far-fetched setup to a lackluster resolution—a resolution that probably sounded good during the initial script pitch, but which nobody realized was going to be such a misfire until the production was already at the point of no return. No, what ''Identity'' is guilty of most is bad timing—it simply gives away too much, too soon. At about the halfway mark (if not much sooner), the film's big "twist" will finally dawn on you (and if it doesn't, they'll end up coming right out and saying it five minutes later anyway). And once it does, you will no longer care what happens afterward."&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Brian (August 5, 2003).

The '''English Socialist Party''', better known as '''Ingsoc''' ([[Newspeak]] for '''English Socialism'''), is the fictional [[political party]] of the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] in [[George Orwell]]'s [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

== Fictional origins ==
Oceania appears to have emerged as a formal [[political union]] of the [[United States]] and the countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], which later annexed the remainder of the Americas and all of Southern Africa. [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] and [[Emmanuel Goldstein]] led the Party to power in Oceania after a [[revolution]] of some kind. After the Party achieved control of Oceania, Ingsoc became the official governing ideology and other political beliefs were increasingly marginalized. Goldstein and Big Brother later became enemies and differed in their interpretation of Ingsoc. Goldstein was eventually branded a criminal and was used as a symbol of treachery and sedition by the party.

== As political philosophy ==
''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by [[Emmanuel Goldstein]] describes the Party's ideology as an [[Oligarchy|oligarchical]] [[Collectivism|collective]] which "[[Anti-socialism|rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood]], and it does so in the name of [[Socialism]]". It is noteworthy that in the terms of the book this ideology would be a form of [[doublethink]]. This is possibly a parallel to [[National Socialism#Etymology|National Socialism]], the [[Nazi Party]]'s chosen name for [[Nazism|their ideology]].  

[[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] personifies the Inner Party as the ubiquitous face constantly depicted in posters and the [[telescreen]]. Big Brother is constantly watching and Ingsoc demands the complete submission (mental, moral and physical) of the people and will torture to achieve it (see [[Room 101]]). Ingsoc is a masterfully complex system of psychological control that compels confession to imagined crimes and the forgetting of rebellious thought in order to love Big Brother and the Party over oneself. The purpose of Ingsoc is political control and power ''per se''. Glibly, [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] explains to Smith: &lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Nazi Party|German Nazis]] and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communists]] came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== As metaphysical pseudophilosophy ==
In the third part of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', Ingsoc presents a [[Solipsism|solipsist]] and [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] view that the universe and all knowledge, meaning and value exists only in the collective mind of the Party. Reality is what the Party says and is the justification for its historical revisionism (compare [[consensus reality]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} With [[doublethink]], the people believe what they otherwise know is false. In believing the revised (new) past, the new past is what was, hence "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past". The [[Ministry of Love]] (MiniLuv), via brainwashing and torture; and the [[Ministry of Truth]] (MiniTrue), with propaganda, ensure that perpetual infallibility of the Party is instilled in the mind of each Oceanian. The person exists only as part of the collective, therefore for the collective nothing exists beyond the goodness of the Party and the evil of other nations and the Party's power.

== Ingsoc's social class system ==
[[File:1984 Social Classes alt.svg|thumb|Population breakdown]]
In the year 1984, Ingsoc divides Oceanian society into three social classes, the Inner Party, the Outer Party and the Proles.

=== The Inner Party ===
The [[Inner Party]] members make policy, influence decisions and govern. They are known as the Party and constitute the upper class of Oceanian society. Among their upper-class privileges is the ability to shut down their telescreens if they feel like it. However, this may be a lie by [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] as in any case it is only temporary and no Inner Party member has been known to disable the telescreen for more than 30 minutes. They live in spacious, comfortable homes, have good food and drink, personal servants and speedy transportation such as personal helicopters and automobiles (while Outer Party members and Proles are banned from owning any vehicles) and no Outer Party member or Prole may enter an Inner Party neighbourhood without a good pretext.

Despite their insulation and overt privileges, Inner Party members are not exempt from the brutal restriction of thought and behaviour imposed on all Party members, even while lies and propaganda apparently originate from their own ranks. As in the example of the characters [[Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Characters|Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford]], non-conformant members of the Inner Party can be condemned, tortured and erased from memory as any other individual. Inner Party members make up less than 2% of the population of Oceania. Through his creation and explanation of Newspeak, Orwell warns the reader that a government that creates the language and mandates how it is used can control the minds of its citizens.

=== The Outer Party ===
The [[Outer Party]] members work the state's administrative jobs, consisting of the educated workers who are responsible for the direct implementation of the Party's policies while having absolutely no voice in their formulation. They are an artificial middle class, essential to the success of the Party, but who are tolerated only in severely hostile conditions. Outer Party members are allowed "no vices other than cigarettes and [[Victory Gin]]" and they are the citizens most spied upon via telescreens and surveillance. This is because according to history the middle class is the most dangerous as they are the ones whose combination of intellectual ability with limited power means they are most likely to incite revolution against the ruling class. They are therefore expected to sustain a continuous, patriotic frenzy for the Party, blindly accepting every order from remote superiors all while simultaneously being condemned to live in rundown neighbourhoods, use crowded subways as transportation (only Inner Party members are allowed to have vehicles) and to persist in an ongoing state of near starvation with meager rations of poor food and drink. Outer Party members are also expected to abstain completely from sex other than for strictly procreative purposes within marriage since to allow sex in any less restrictive forms would permit self-actualization, individual intimacy and expenditure of personal energy to non-official purposes, all of which are completely antithetical to the Party's agenda.

=== The Proles ===
The [[Proles]] ([[proletariat]]) are the lower class of workers, performing the bulk of manual labour required in Oceania. They live in the poorest conditions, but they may be considered more fortunate than the Outer Party members as they are under less surveillance. The Party keeps them happy and sedates them with alcohol, gambling, sport, sexual promiscuity and [[prolefeed]] (fabricated books and pornography). They are kept uneducated and rendered incapable of gaining any sophisticated view of their own lives or of society, and are therefore considered harmless, lacking any greater will or consciousness than would be typically ascribed to animals. The Proles live in poor yet relatively free conditions. They are not required to install telescreens in their homes (since they cannot even afford one). A few undercover agents of the [[Thought Police]] do work as Proles to mark down and eliminate any Prole individuals deemed capable of becoming dangerous. Proles make up 85% of Oceania's population.

Although the social classes of Oceania interact little, the protagonist [[Winston Smith]] attends an evening at the cinema, where Proles and members of the Outer and Inner Party view the same film program. He visits a Proles pub without attracting notice (or so he thinks). He also visits the flat of Inner Party man [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] on the pretext of borrowing the newest edition of the [[Newspeak]] dictionary. Ingsoc's propaganda proclaims its [[egalitarianism]], yet the Proles and (some) members of the Outer Party are hideously exploited and live in poverty while the ruling elite, the Inner Party, work little and live well and comfortably, yet food and consumer goods are scarcer and more expensive than under capitalism. It is suggested that this is not a result of a deficit of actual produce, but rather a surplus: this surplus is more than taken up by constant warfare between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. If the Party chose, all its people could live in luxury, but they instead choose to lower the quality of living as it is important that the lower classes remain stupefied by poverty and the struggle for mere survival since if they were to become too comfortable, they might learn to think for themselves and rebel against the Party.

== Other political ideologies in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' ==
[[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] and [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] are the other two ideologically-formed and ruled [[superstate]]s that resemble Oceania. [[Neo-Bolshevism]] is the ideology of Eurasia, Soviet-conquered Europe. [[Death Worship]] is described as the translation of the Chinese name for the ideology of Eastasia, but better rendered as [[Obliteration of the Self]]. The ruling oligarchies of the three superstates are aware that their ideologies are philosophically indistinguishable, a fact kept from and denied by their populaces via doublethink. Said denial is practised in each state and the mutual vilification of the enemy state permits [[Nineteen Eighty-Four#The War|perpetual war]] among them. Without said war, the lower classes would have no focus for the hatred of and triumph over the enemy with which their Inner parties dominate them and find excuses for their atrocities.

How Ingsoc gained control of the British Empire and the Americas in a historically short period is not established. In his book, Goldstein says that Oceania was created "with the absorption of [...] the British Empire by the United States" and may have occurred in the aftermath of the nuclear war of the 1950s also referred to in the book. As Goldstein's book itself may have been written by the Party, it may be subject to the same historical revisionism as the Party's other propaganda and so an unreliable source of information. When Winston is being tortured by O'Brien in the Ministry of Love, he asks if "the book" is true. O'Brien replies: "As description, yes. The program it sets forth [...] is nonsense".

An '''interpreter officer''' is a commissioned officer of an armed force, who [[Language interpretation|interprets]] and/or translates to facilitate military operation. Interpreter officers are used extensively in [[Multinational force|multinational]] operations in which two or more countries that do not share a common language are undertaking a joint operation, or expeditionary missions in which the communication with the local population is crucial but limited by lack of language proficiency among the expeditionary force personnel.  Interpreter officers also work in the intelligence gathering and analysis though in many countries, civilian analysts are used instead of the officers in active duty.  
==Examples by country==
===France===
{{Main|Military interpreter (France)}}

===United States===
Interpreting services are provided by personnel from [[223rd Military Intelligence Battalion (United States)]].  The United States Military have used the Arabic linguists in the war in Iraq for example.  
===Republic of Korea===
The [[Republic of Korea]] has a history of continuous presence of United States forces.  Because the [[Soldier|military personnel]] of both countries usually lack proficiency in each other’s language, a corps of interpreter officers were trained to facilitate communication.  Each service branch has its own group of interpreter officers. They participate in meetings, high level conferences or day-to-day informal discussions to offer simultaneous or consecutive translation, usually between [[English language|English]] and [[Korean language|Korean]].  During the military drills such as [[RSOI]] and [[Ulchi-Freedom Guardian]], the demand for rapid translation of the communications among the forces of the combined command peaks and the interpreter officers play a crucial role in the seamless operations of the drills.   

The majority of the interpreter officers work in English to Korean interpretation.  A minor of interpreter officers are also available in Chinese and Japanese though far fewer than those of English.  Many but not all of the interpreter officers have spent many years abroad often in the English speaking countries.  Serving as interpreter officer is a popular way for the Korean nationals studying in North America to do the mandatory military service because of the prestige and networking opportunity despite the length of the service which is slightly less than three years, at 21 months.

The camaraderie among the interpreter officer is relatively strong compare to the class of the officer candidate school because the group is small and culturally homogeneous.  The interpreter officers as a group are western oriented, for the qualification exam requires considerable level of fluency in English and Korean as mandatory languages.  Many interpreter officers pursue careers in the financial services or law after discharge.

[[File:kinemacolor1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A 1911 Kinemacolor recreated from original materials]]
'''Kinemacolor''' was the first successful [[Color motion picture film|colour motion picture process]], used commercially from 1908 to 1914. It was invented by [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]] of [[Brighton]], England in 1906. He was influenced by the work of [[William Norman Lascelles Davidson]] and, more directly, [[Edward Raymond Turner]].&lt;ref name=vc&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=William Norman Lascelles Davidson |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/davidson.htm |quote=... Although his work was ultimately unsuccessful, it played its part in influencing the development of Kinemacolor, the world’s first successful natural colour motion picture system, invented by Davidson’s neighbour in the English south coast town of Southwick, near Brighton, G.A. Smith. ... |publisher=[[Who's Who of Victorian Cinema]] |date= |accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched by [[Charles Urban]]'s Urban Trading Co. of [[London]] in 1908. From 1909 on, the process was known as Kinemacolor. It was a [[RG color space|two-colour]] [[additive colour]] process, photographing and projecting a black-and-white film behind alternating red and green filters.

==Process==

"How to Make and Operate Moving Pictures" published by [[Funk and Wagnalls]] in 1917 notes the following:

{{Quote|Of the many attempts to produce cinematograph pictures... the greatest amount of attention so far has been attracted by a system invented by George Albert Smith, and commercially developed by Charles Urban under the name of "Kinemacolor." In this system (to quote from ''Cassell's Cyclopædia of Photography'', edited by the editor of this present book), only two colour filters are used in taking the negatives and only two in projecting the positives. The camera resembles the ordinary cinematographic camera except that it runs at twice the speed, taking thirty-two images per second instead of sixteen, and it is fitted with a rotating colour filter in addition to the ordinary shutter. This filter is an aluminium skeleton wheel... having four segments, two open ones, G and H; one filled in with red-dyed gelatine, E F; and the fourth containing green-dyed gelatine, A B. The camera is so geared that exposures are made alternately through the red gelatine and the green gelatine. [[Panchromatic film]] is used, and the negative is printed from in the ordinary way, and it will be understood that there is no colour in the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/kinemacolor-book1.htm Widescreen Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Premiere==
[[File:A Visit to the Seaside (1908).webm|thumb|''[[A Visit to the Seaside]]'']]
[[File:The Delhi Durbar 1911.webm|thumb|''With Our King and Queen Through India'', extract]]
The first motion picture exhibited in Kinemacolor was an eight-minute short filmed in Brighton titled ''[[A Visit to the Seaside]]'', which was trade shown in September 1908. On 26 February 1909, the general public first saw Kinemacolor in a programme of twenty-one short films shown at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London.  The process was first seen in the United States on 11 December 1909, at an exhibition staged by Smith and Urban at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=urbanora |url=http://bioscopic.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/colourful-stories-no-11-kinemacolor-in-america |title=Colourful stories no. 11 – Kinemacolor in America « The Bioscope |publisher=Bioscopic.wordpress.com |date=2008-06-15 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Kinemacolor released the first dramatic film made in the process, ''[[Checkmated (film)|Checkmated]]''. The company then produced the [[documentary film]]s ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'' (also known as ''[[Delhi Durbar|The Durbar at Delhi]]'', 1912), and the notable recovery of £750,000 worth of gold and silver bullion from the wreck of P&amp;O's [[SS Oceana (1888)|SS ''Oceana'']] in the [[Strait of Dover]] (1912).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=2360560|title=Salvage Operations of S.S. Oceana|description=Produced by the Natural Colour Kinematograph Co., Brighton}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'' and the dramas ''[[The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1914 film)|The World, the Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1914), and ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1914 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1914) were the first three [[feature films]] made in colour. These latter two features were also among the last films released by Kinemacolor.

==Success and decline==
Kinemacolor enjoyed the most commercial success in the UK where, between 1909 and 1918, it was shown at more than 250 entertainment venues. The system was made available to exhibitors  either by licence or from 1913 through a series of touring companies. Although in most cases the system stayed at licensed venues for only a few months there were instances where it remained at a hall for up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Jackson, "The Distribution and Exhibition of Kinemacolor in the UK and the USA 1909–1916" (University of Bristol, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; 54 dramatic films were produced. Four dramatic short films were also produced by Kinemacolor in the United States in 1912–1913,&lt;ref&gt;''La Tosca'' (1912), ''Mission Bells'' (1913), ''The Rivals'' (1913), and ''The Scarlet Letter'' (1913).&lt;/ref&gt; and one in Japan, ''Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura'' (1914).

However, the company was never a success, partly due to the expense of installing special Kinemacolor projectors in cinemas. Also, the process suffered from "fringing" and "haloing" of the images, an unsolvable problem  as long as Kinemacolor remained a successive frame process. Kinemacolor in the U.S. became most notable for its Hollywood studio being taken over by [[D. W. Griffith]], who also took over Kinemacolor's failed plans to film [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.|Thomas Dixon's]] ''[[The Clansman]]'', which eventually became ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' ([[1915 in film|1915]]).

The first (additive) version of [[Prizma|Prizma Color]], developed by William Van Doren Kelley in the U.S. from 1913 to 1917, used some of the same principles as Kinemacolor. In the UK, [[William Friese-Greene]] developed another additive colour system for film called Biocolour. However, in 1914 George Albert Smith sued Friese-Greene for infringing Kinemacolor's patents, slowing the development of Biocolour by Friese-Greene and his son [[Claude Friese-Greene|Claude]] in the 1920s.

==Predecessor process==
In 2012, the [[National Media Museum]] in [[Bradford]], [[England]] publicized its digital restoration of some very early three-colour alternating-filter test films, dated to 1902, made by [[Edward Raymond Turner]]. They are believed to be the earliest existing colour film footage. Turner's process, for which Charles Urban had provided financial backing, was adapted by Smith after Turner's sudden death in 1903, and this in turn became Kinemacolor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19423951 "World's First Colour Film Discovered", BBC News (12 September 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Les Mots écrits de New Bell''''' is a set of six mural installations created by [[Hervé Yamguen]] and located in [[Douala]] ([[Cameroon]]).

==The artwork==

'''Les Mots Écrits de New Bell''' is a set of six mural installations by [[Hervé Yamguen]]. It is part of "Liquid projects", a program of [[c:Category:SUD Salon Urbain de Douala 2010|SUD2010]] that financed the production of permanent artworks dedicated to the theme of [[water]] in the neighborhoods of residence of four local artists. In New Bell, Yamguen worked in collaboration with two local rappers, Picsou and Moctomoflar, engaging them in the recording (and releasing) of a four songs album about water. During the production process the artist also introduced young people and local residents to the project through night performances and discussion meetings. From the lyrics of rappers, Yamguen extracted text fragments, reproducing them on six façades of Ngangue’s neighborhood that were spontaneously offered by locals.

Les Mots Écrits de New Bell were produced on different supports: [[neon light]]s, tile [[mosaic]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Wrought iron|iron rods]], and painting. The text fragments selected by Yamguen clearly depict the reality of hardship and hope of New Bell's inhabitants.

Here the texts:

# ''Après le temps mort vient le temps vif comme un coup de foudre. Ne pleure pas maman, tous les yeux de la ville pleuvent sur moi. Tranquille papa on ne panique pas'';
# ''La vie saine, la joie de se sentir bien, l’envie de vivre de bonheur'';
# ''Se sentir bien'';
# ''La nuit le bonheur c’est dans les moustiquaires'';
# ''Wash ma life, Lave mon âme; Wash mes ways, Lave mon kwatt'';
# ''Dans les eaux sales du quartier, dans ma ruelle, ma jeunesse rebelle''.

However, two of these installations were removed: the first one – “Wash ma life, Lave mon âme, Wash mes ways, Lave mon kwatt” – for degradation, due to its position on the wall of a car washer; the second one – “Dans les eaux sales du quartier, dans ma ruelle, ma jeunesse rebelle” – was vandalized by the owner of the wall due to hard discussions with the rapper who wrote the sentence.

The inauguration of the artwork took place during [[c:Category:SUD Salon Urbain de Douala 2010|SUD - Salon Urbain de Douala 2010]].

'''Ludomusicology''' (also called '''video game music studies''' or '''video game music research''') is a field of academic research and scholarly analysis focusing on  [[video game music]], understood as the music found in [[video game]]s and in related contexts. It is closely related to the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Sound effect#Video games|interactive and games audio research]], and game music and audio are sometimes studied as a united phenomenon. Ludomusicology is also related to the field of [[game studies]], as music is one element of the wider video game text and some theories on video game functions are directly relevant to music.

Whereas the overarching areas of interactive and game audio research and game studies are highly interdisciplinary (ranging from [[Interface (computing)|interface]] research, [[Neurology|neurological research]], [[psychology]] and [[informatics]] to [[sound studies]], [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]]), ludomusicology as a subfield has been mainly driven by musicologists (albeit with an openness to interdisciplinary inquiry). Ludomusicology not only deals with music in games and music games as its subject matter, but is also interested in the ways in which games and their music have become subjects of playful engagement themselves, e.g. within the frame of fancultural practices. Additionally and more generally, game music challenges the ways in which we think about music, and subsequently how we study it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Elferen|first1=Isabella|title=Ludomusicology and the new drastic (Conference paper, unpublished)|journal=Creativity, Circulation and Copyright: Sonic and Visual Media in the Digital Age|date=28–29 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|title=Playing Games with Music (and Vice Versa): Ludomusicological Perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of anthologies and monographs dealing with the specific subject of game music and music in game culture is steadily increasing. The ludomusicological community now organizes conferences, runs subgroups within the musicological societies, and engages in discourse with scholarly colleagues in a wide range of related fields.

==History==
Academic research on video game music began in the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthew|first1=Belinkie|title=Video game music: not just kid stuff|url=http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|website=Videogame Music Archive|accessdate=26 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613143431/http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|archivedate=16 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed through the mid 2000s. Early research on the topic often involved historical studies of game music, or comparative studies of video game music and film music (see, for instance, Zach Whalen's article "Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music" which includes both).&lt;ref name="whalen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whalen|first1=Zach|date=November 2004|title=Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/0401/whalen/|journal=Game Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of video game music is also known by some as "ludomusicology" — a portmanteau of "[[ludology]]" (the study of games and gameplay) and "[[musicology]]" (the study and analysis of music) — a term coined independently by Guillaume Laroche and Roger Moseley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|editor1-last=Cook|editor1-first=Nicholas|editor2-last=Pettengill|editor2-first=Richard|title=Taking it to the bridge: music as performance|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=283, 308|chapter=Playing games with music (and vice versa): ludomusicological perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karbani|first1=Tasneem|title=Summer research project was music to student's ears|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~publicas/folio/45/01/04.html|website=University of Alberta|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent figure in early video game music and audio research is Karen Collins, who is associate professor at the [[University of Waterloo]] and Canada Research Chair in Interactive Audio at the University of Waterloo Games Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Collins|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/english/people-profiles/karen-collins|website=University of Waterloo|accessdate=2 May 2017|date=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her monograph ''Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design'' (MIT Press 2008)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design|last1=Collins|first1=Karen|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262033787|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a seminal work in the field, and was influential in the subsequent development of video game music studies.

In 2012, the Ludomusicology Research Group held its inaugural conference at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was the first conference in the world to be focused specifically on video game music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2014 the inaugural North American Conference on Video Game Music was held at [[Youngstown State University]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both conferences have since been held annually, at varying locations in Europe and North America respectively.

In late 2016, the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg" /&gt; The SSSMG is the first international society dedicated to the study of video game music. In September 2017, the SSSMG announced the planned launch of a new journal dedicated to video game music and sound research, the ''Journal of Sound &amp; Music in Games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/2017/09/04/announcement/|title=SSSMG Executive Committee Appointments &amp; Journal Announcement|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|date=4 September 2017|website=SSSMG|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of enquiry==
Ludomusicology examines any and all aspects of video game music and audio, some of which are described in brief here.

===Interactivity===
{{see also|Interactivity}}
Interactivity is one of the major differentiating qualities of video game music, distinguishing it from other screen media music through the incorporation of player actions. In interactive gameplay, the sound and music played by the game can respond to the actions of the player within the game.&lt;ref name="whalen" /&gt; Furthermore, as video games frequently feature non-linear or multi-linear timelines, their music can be similarly multi-threaded in both its form and its experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} Because each player takes an independently-chosen path through the game, any player’s experience of a game's music will be different (considered as a whole) to any other player's experience from the same game, even though constructed from the same basic elements. Therefore, the intent and output of the composer and the music's effect on the player (which similarly varies from player to player) must both be considered during analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Iain|title=Meaningful Play: Performativity, Interactivity and Semiotics in Video Game Music|journal=Musicology Australia|date=2014|volume=36|issue=2|pages=273–290|doi=10.1080/08145857.2014.958272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept to that of interactivity is that of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]], which considers the ability of a video game to draw the player into a deep engagement with the game's diegetic space. Isabella van Elferen has developed a model of video game music immersion called "the ALI model", which understands player immersion to be a confluence of "musical affect, musical literacy and musical interaction":
* Affect: "personal investment in a given situation through memory, emotion and identification"
* Literacy: "fluency in hearing and interpreting... music through the fact of our frequent exposure to [it]", which builds on such literacy from other musical media
* Interaction: the player's reactions to music, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Isabella|first=van Elferen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=34–39|chapter=Analysing Game Musical Immersion: The ALI Model|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
{{see also|Video game music|Chiptune}}
Historical studies of video game music usually incorporate examinations of game music technology. Technological limitations of audio chips in early consoles and computer systems were, in many ways, instrumental in shaping the development of both the functions and aesthetics of game music. For example, Karen Collins describes how the [[Television Interface Adaptor|Television Interface Adapter]] in the [[Atari 2600]] created tones that could be out of tune by up to half a semitone; this led to minimal music in games for this platform, and substantial modifications to the music of ported games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|21–23}} Similarly, Melanie Fritsch observes the relative freedoms afforded to game composers by [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]] (higher quality, though limited to 79.8 minutes) and later [[MP3]] (similar quality to CD audio but with compression minimising length restrictions), while also noting the challenges presented by writing increasingly detailed music to accompany hundreds of hours of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Fritsch|first=Melanie|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=24–25|chapter=History of Video Game Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technology that has attracted significant academic attention is [[iMUSE]], a [[MIDI]]-based system developed by [[LucasArts]] that allowed dynamic and smooth musical transitions, which were triggered by game conditions but which would occur at musically expedient (pre-designated) positions in the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|51–57}}

Ludomusicology also investigates muso-technological practices in fields surrounding video games. For example, scholarly attention is turning to [[chiptune]], which is the creation of music using old video game or sound chip hardware (a definition which is sometimes broadened to include the imitation of the resulting aesthetic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Pasdzierny|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=174–175|chapter=Geeks on Stage? Investigations in the World of (Live) Chipmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
{{see also|Video game music}}
Ludomusicology examines the composition of video game music, both in relation to and as distinct from other forms of [[Musical composition|music composition]]. Studies of game music compositional processes are often contributed by active [[composer]]s and industry practitioners (for example, [[Winifred Phillips]]'s book ''A Composer's Guide to Game Music'', and [[Stephen Baysted]]'s chapter "Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' ''Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed''").&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Composer's Guide to Game Music|last=Phillips|first=Winifred|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Baysted|first=Stephen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=152–171|chapter=Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant distinction of video game music composition is the need to incorporate the player's interactivity into the compositional process, and particularly as part of the negotiation of engagement and immersion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|35–36}} Composition is also at the nexus of creative potential and technological possibility, and throughout the development of game music (and particularly in its early phases) this has had significant effects on both compositional processes and game music aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|35}}

===Music video games===
{{see also|Music video game}}
Music video games, which use music as part of a dominant gameplay mechanism, are a focus of many ludomusicological studies. The clear relationship between music and gameplay in games like the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Rock Band]]'' series facilitates the study of performance and performativity within gameplay, and provokes questions of musical ideology, performance practice and multimedia pedagogy. Kiri Miller writes that music video games feature a smaller disparity between the actions of player and avatar than is usually present in video games, and that this can encourage heightened levels of physical and musical engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Playing Along: Digital Games, YouTube, and Virtual Performance|last=Miller|first=Kiri|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Roesner, Anna Paisley, and Gianna Cassidy have examined these phenomena within the classroom context, observing that music video games can inspire not only musical creativity, but the positive self-perception of musicality in students; they suggest that such effects can be used to encourage student engagement and development within both musical and non-musical curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music Video Games: Performance, Politics, and Play|last=Roesner|first=David|last2=Paisley|first2=Anna|last3=Cassidy|first3=Gianna|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Austin|editor-first=Michael|location=New York|pages=213–215|chapter=Guitar Heroes in the Classroom: The Creative Potential of Music Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to music in other screen media===
{{see also|Soundtrack|Film score}}
Because video games are (usually) screen-based media, there are strong links between the study of game music and the study of music in other screen-based media (like film and television). Concepts such as [[Diegesis#In film|diegesis]] and [[Acousmatic sound|acousmatics]], which originate in film and film audio studies, are broadly applicable to video game music analyses, often with minimal adjustment.&lt;ref name=whalen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medina-Gray|first1=Elizabeth|editor1-last=Donnelly|editor1-first=K.J.|editor2-last=Gibbons|editor2-first=William|editor3-last=Lerner|editor3-first=Neil|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=Meaningful Modular Combinations: Simultaneous Harp and Environmental Music in two ''Legend of Zelda'' Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are similarities between video game and film music techniques as varying stages throughout video game music history. For example, Neil Lerner notes a relationship between music in [[Silent film|early/silent cinema]] and game music aesthetics from the 1970s onwards, on the basis of "largely nonverbal communication system[s]" and "continuous musical accompaniment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|last=Lerner|first=Neil|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Donnelly|editor-first=K.J.|location=New York|pages=12|chapter=Mario's Dynamic Leaps: Musical Innovations (and the Specter of Early Cinema) in ''Donkey Kong'' and ''Super Mario Bros.''|editor-last2=Gibbons|editor-first2=William|editor-last3=Lerner|editor-first3=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Gregor Herzfeld compares the use of high energy music in ''[[Gran Turismo (video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' to the use of rock music in action films like ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', due to associations with risky and/or exciting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Herzfeld|first=Gregor|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also well noted within ludomusicological discourse that video games are very different media to film and television due to the player's interaction. Consequently, the application of concepts like diegesis does require a nuanced approach that takes the peculiarities of the video game medium into account. For example, Collins observes that linear approaches to [[musical analysis]] (such as the observation of synchronicity between musical and visual cues) fail to address the non-linear timescales that are typical of video games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} This forms a basis of Collins's reiteration of a warning by video game theorists against "theoretical imperialism".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|5}}

===Research methods===
Several academics have written about the research methods involved in ludomusicology. One of the more comprehensive of these studies is found in Tim Summers's book ''Understanding Video Game Music'', in which Summers describes the process of "analytical play", wherein the analyst is "deliberately subverting the game's expectations of the player's actions.... At moments when game rules are tested, the architecture is often clearest. By playing experimentally (or using 'analytical play') to investigate the musical system in the game and comparing multiple play sessions, the musical mechanics of the game programming can be divined".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|35}} Summers places this analytical method alongside more conventional sources of research data, both from inside the game (e.g., programmatic and musical information, the latter of which frequently involves the application of conventional musicology and music theory to the video game music text) and from texts and communities surrounding the game.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|34–50}}

==Groups and Conferences==

===Ludomusicology Research Group===
The Ludomusicology Research Group is an inter-university research organisation focusing on the study of music in games, music games and music in video game culture, composed of four researchers: Michiel Kamp, Tim Summers, Melanie Fritsch, and Mark Sweeney.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/about/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they organise an annual international conference held in the UK or Europe (at the time of writing, the most recent was the Ludo2017 conference held at Bath Spa University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludo 2017|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/past-events/ludo-2017/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ludo2018 held in Leipzig, Germany, in April 2018, was the biggest Ludo-conference so far, attracting more than 80 participants from all over the world. The group was originally founded by Kamp, Summers and Sweeney in August 2011, who have also edited a collection of essays based around the study of game sound entitled ''Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music'', published in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kamp|editor1-first=Michiel|editor2-last=Summers|editor2-first=Tim|editor3-last=Sweeney|editor3-first=Mark|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Equinox|isbn=9781781791974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludomusicology|url=https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/ludomusicology/|website=Equinox|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also edited a double special issue of [https://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-issue,id=2999/ ''The Soundtrack''] and initiated a new book series called [http://www.ludomusicology.org/2017/04/20/new-book-series-studies-game-sound-music/ ''Studies in Game Sound and Music''] in 2017. In September 2016, Tim Summers' book ''Understanding Video Game Music'' was published by Cambridge University Press.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Tim|title=Understanding Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107116870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritsch officially joined the group in 2016. She had edited the 2nd issue of the online journal [http://www.act.uni-bayreuth.de/en/archiv/2011-02/index.html ''ACT - Zeitschrift für Musik und Performance''], published in July 2011 that included ludomusicological contributions written by Tim Summers, Steven Reale and James Brame. She had been a regular at the conferences since 2012 and published several book chapters on the topic. Whereas Kamp, Summers and Sweeney have a background in Musicology, Fritsch has her background in Performance Studies. Her doctoral thesis and first monograph "Performing Bytes. Musikperformances der Computerspielkultur" is scheduled for publication during 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://uni-bayreuth.academia.edu/mfritsch&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM)===
The North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM) is an international conference on video game music held annually in North America since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, B. I. (2014, January 18). [https://www.wired.com/2014/01/game-music/  There Really Is a Conference Where Nerds Study Videogame Music.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Checkpoint!: The floodgates have opened.

===Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG)===
In late 2016 the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg"&gt;{{cite web|title=About SSSMG|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/about-sssmg/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSSMG has the aim of bringing together both practitioners and researchers from across the globe in order to develop the field's understanding of sound and video game music and audio. Its initial focus is the use of its website as a "hub" for communication and resource centralisation, including a video game music research bibliography (a project initially begun by the Ludomusicology Research Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/bibliography/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMS Ludomusicology Study Group===
The Ludomusicology Study Group of the [[American Musicological Society]] was founded in 2015 and "is dedicated to facilitating academic research on music interactive media", including holding a panel on video game music as part of the annual meetings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gamemusicstudies.org/?page_id=12|title=About|work=Ludomusicology Study Group|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludomusicology Society of Australia (LSA)===
The Ludomusicology Society of Australia was launched in April 2017, during the Ludo2017 conference in Bath, UK; it aims to "offer a centralised and local professional body nurturing game music studies for academics, people in industry and game music fans alike in the Australasian region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LSA is here!|url=http://ludomusicologysociety.com.au/2017/03/07/hello-world/|website=The Ludomusicology Society of Australia|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9391">[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that may develop after an individual experiences a traumatic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.|year=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0890425558|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5|edition=5|quote=A person was exposed to one or more event(s) that involved death or threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threatened sexual violation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Social Security Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] each offer disability compensation programs that provide benefits for qualified individuals with mental disorders, including PTSD. Because of the substantial benefits available to individuals with a confirmed PTSD diagnosis, which causes occupational impairment, the distinct possibility of [[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|Type I errors]] (false positive results) exists, some of which are due to [[malingering]] of PTSD.

==Motivation==
Individuals who malinger PTSD may have several motivations for doing so. First, financial incentives are common. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers substantial annual financial compensation to U.S. veterans who can prove that they suffer from PTSD related to their military service. This potential compensation can create an incentive for veterans to malinger PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frueh, B. C., Grubaugh, A. L., Elhai, J. D., &amp; Buckley, T. C.|title=US Department of Veterans Affairs disability policies for posttraumatic stress disorder: Administrative trends and implications for treatment, rehabilitation, and research |journal=American Journal of Public Health  |volume=97|pages=U2143-2145 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.115436 |pmid=17971542 |pmc=2089098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. Social Security Administration offers social security disability payments to individuals documenting a disorder such as PTSD that impedes their ability to work, which additionally provides an incentive to malinger PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor, S., Frueh, B. C., &amp; Asmundson, G. J. G. |title=Detection and management of malingering in people presenting for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder: Methods, obstacles, and recommendations | journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders| volume=21|pages=22–41 |doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the potential for workers compensation can motivate individuals reporting a traumatic event at their workplace to fabricate PTSD; and finally the potential for personal injury lawsuits can motivate someone to malinger PTSD and sue an individual for causing PTSD as a result of attack, accident or other stressor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guriel, J., &amp; Fremouw, W. |title=Assessing malingered posttraumatic stress disorder: A critical review |journal=Clinical Psychology Review| volume=23 |pages=881–904 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2003.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals are known to malinger PTSD to obtain inpatient hospital treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salloway, S., Southwick, S., &amp; Sadowsky, M.  |title=Opiate withdrawal presenting as posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |volume=41 |pages=666–667 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/citation/41/6/666 |doi=10.1176/ps.41.6.666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons charged in criminal law cases are motivated to malinger PTSD in order to offset criminal responsibility for the crime or mitigate the associated penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=R.

W.|chapter=Malingering of posttraumatic disorders|edition=3rd|pages=109–127|ISBN=978-1-59385-699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals are motivated to malinger PTSD (e.g., related to combat) in order to gain honor and recognition from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkett, B.

==Psychological assessment findings==
The [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]]-2 (MMPI-2) is the most widely used psychological assessment measure that has been used in research to detect malingered PTSD, typically by comparing genuine PTSD patients with individuals trained and instructed to fabricate PTSD on the MMPI-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demakis, G. J., &amp; Elhai, J. D.  |title=Neuropsychological and psychological aspects of malingered posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Psychological Injury and Law| volume=4 |pages=24–31 |doi=10.1007/s12207-011-9099-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies using the MMPI-2 have demonstrated a moderately accurate ability to detect simulated PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elhai, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2729">'''Metroethnicity''' is a portmanteau of ''[[wikt:metropolitan|metropolitan]]'' and ''[[ethnicity]]''. It is an ‘aesthetic’ or ‘lifestyle’ theory of language and [[ethnicity]] proposed by the British sociolinguist [[John C. Maher]].

The theory of Metroethicity rejects cultural [[essentialism]], and ''heroic ethnicity'', in favour of a hybridized form of ethnicity that is utilised for aesthetic effect.

In this perspective, language should not to be viewed as an enduring ethnic essence but a lifestyle ‘accessory.’ It is portable. It functions best as an aspect of personal life-style.  Metroethnicity is linked to ''Cool'' because cool is basically an aesthetic phenomenon. Cool actively disconnects the ‘natural’ linkage that is often made between ethnicity and language. Cool is both an attitude as well as a facet of personal action.

This post-ethnic stance is illustrated by a young Ainu person in northern Japan: “Well, I don’t speak Ainu…be nice to speak it…but..anyway...I speak Italian ‘cause that’s where I want to be..love Italian stuff…I’m training to be an Italian chef.” (Maher 2006). In such person-driven identity traditional language is optional -not rejected but bracketed. This view of language may be confrontational a person who insists language and ethnicity should line up. The ethnic view fosters ethnic allegiance, even orthodoxy. By contrast, "Metroethnicity is a kind of post ethnicity state whereby both we play with ethnicity (not necessarily our own) for aesthetic effect. It involves cultural crossing, self-definition made up of borrowing and bricolage of blurred ‘identities’, what one might term ‘metroethnicity’. The operating system of this metroethnicity is ‘Cool’” (Maher 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maher|first=John C.|date=2005-01-18|title=Metroethnicity, language, and the principle of Cool|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ijsl.2005.2005.175-176.83|journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language|volume=2005|issue=175-176|doi=10.1515/ijsl.2005.2005.175-176.83|issn=0165-2516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyslexia is a complex, lifelong disorder involving difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters and other symbols. Dyslexia does not affect general intelligence, but is often co-diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;ref name="NCLD"&gt;{{cite web|author=NCLD Editorial Team|title=What is Dyslexia|url=http://www.ncld.org/types-learning-disabilities/dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia|publisher=National center for Learning disabilities|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site3074/mainpageS3074P1.html | title = Dyslexia | publisher=Boston Children's Hospital | accessdate = 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least three sub-types of dyslexia that have been recognized by researchers: orthographic, or surface dyslexia, phonological dyslexia and mixed dyslexia where individuals exhibit symptoms of both orthographic and phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name="caplan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caplan|first=David|title=Neurolinguistics and Linguistic Aphasiology|year=1987|publisher=New York: Cambridge University Press|pages=201–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that dyslexia is genetic and can be passed down through families, but it is important to note that, although a genetic disorder, there is no specific locus in the brain for reading and writing. The human brain does have language centers (for spoken and gestural communication), but written language is a cultural artifact, and a very complex one requiring brain regions designed to recognize and interpret written symbols as representations of language in rapid synchronization. The complexity of the system and the lack of genetic predisposition for it is one possible explanation for the difficulty in acquiring and understanding written language.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Wolf, Maryanne. "Part III: When the Brain Can't Learn to Read." Wolf, Maryanne. Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain. New York City: HarperCollins Publisher, 2007. 163-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, recent evidence has found that there are certain genes responsible for causing dyslexia.&lt;ref name="NDS"&gt;"[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm Dyslexia Information Page"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727234247/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm |date=2016-07-27 }}. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 12 May 2010. Retrieved 5 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests a clear genetic basis for developmental dyslexia with abnormalities in certain language areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Witelson"&gt;Witelson, Sandra. "Developmental Dyslexia: TwoRight Hemispheres and None Left." Science, New Series 195.4275(1977): 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there is also evidence that orthography, the correspondence between the language's phonemes (sound units) and its graphemes (characters, symbols, letters), plays a significant role in the type and frequency of dyslexia's manifestations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Paulesu, E, et al.

==Dyslexia and orthographic features==

===Orthographic Dyslexia===
Orthographic dyslexia, a subtype of dyslexia, results in difficulty decoding and encoding skills due to slow and inaccurate rates of storing word and letter formations into memory. Orthographic dyslexics have difficulty in storing mental representation of words, especially phonetically irregular words such as word spellings that end in -ight ("light" and "sight"). The problems underlying this type of dyslexia are related directly to memory and coding skills that allow representation of printed letters and words, not to poor phonological processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhia|first=Roberts|title=Orthographic Dyslexia: The neglected subtype|year=1997|publisher=The Learning Disabilities Research &amp; Practice|pages=236–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of dyslexia is also termed surface dyslexia because people with this type have the inability to recognize words simply on a visual basis. Words that are misspelled cause the readers difficulty because they attempt to sound out the words by looking at each individual letter rather than the word as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, David. 1987. Disturbances of the sound system. In D. Caplan. Neurolinguistics and Linguistic Aphasiology: An Introduction, 201-232. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; So a reader might read the word "cat" and pronounce the "c" as a hard "c" but then read the word "ice" and pronounce the "c" as a hard "c" as well because they are sounding out each individual phoneme rather than just recognizing the word "ice" in its entirety.

Despite intervention, children suffering from orthographic dyslexia continually have lower achievement reading levels when compared to their peers. Additionally, children show a greater difficulty throughout schooling when spelling words with irregular or unusual orthographies when compared to their other children. Research also shows that dyslexic children have primary difficulties in phonological processing and secondary difficulties in orthographic processing, aiding to the distinction of two subtypes.&lt;ref name="Manis et al., 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manis|first=Franklin|first2=Rebecca|last2=Custodio|last3=Szeszulski|first3=Patricia A.|title=Development of phonological and orthographic skill: A 2-year longitudinal study of dyslexic children|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1993|volume=56|issue=1|pages=64–86|doi=10.1006/jecp.1993.1026|pmid=8366326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The effects of orthographic depth on dyslexia===
The complexity of a language's orthography is directly related to the difficulty of learning to read in that language.  Orthographic complexity also contributes to how dyslexia manifests in readers of different languages.&lt;ref name="Wolf1"&gt;[[Maryanne Wolf|Wolf, Maryanne]] (2007). Proust and the squid. Harper Collins. pp. 190-191. {{ISBN|978-0-06-018639-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deep orthographies]] are writing systems, such as those of [[English orthography|English]] and [[Arabic script|Arabic]], that do not have a one-to-one correspondence between sounds ([[phoneme]]s) and the letters ([[grapheme]]s) that represent them.

[[Shallow orthographies]], such as [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], have a close relationship between [[grapheme]]s and [[phoneme]]s, and the spelling of words is very consistent. With shallow orthographies, new readers have few problems learning to decode words and as a result children learn to read relatively quickly. Most dyslexic readers of shallow orthographic systems learn to decode words with relative ease compared to dyslexics using deep orthographies, though they continue to have difficulty with reading fluency and comprehension.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The hallmark system of dyslexia in a shallow orthography is a comparatively slow speed of [[rapid automatized naming]].
[[File:Dislexia.jpg|thumb|198x198px|Writing and drawing performed by a child with dyslexia, displaying common behavioral symptoms.]]
For languages with relatively deep orthographies, such as [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], readers have greater difficulty learning to decode new words than languages with shallow orthographies. As a result, children's reading achievement levels are lower.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;Goswami, Usha (2005-09-06). "Chapter 28: Orthography, Phonology, and Reading Development: A Cross-Linguistic Perspective". in Malatesha, Joshi. Handbook of orthography and literacy. Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc Inc. pp. 463–464. {{ISBN|0-8058-4652-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that the hallmark symptoms of dyslexia in a deep orthography are a deficit in phonological awareness and difficulty reading words at grade level.&lt;ref name="snowling"&gt;Snowling, Margaret J. (2004). "Chapter 4: The science of dyslexia: a review of contemporary approaches. in Turner, Martin and John Rack. The study of dyslexia. Kluwer Academic/Plenum publishers. p. 80. {{ISBN|0-306-48535-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For these dyslexic readers, learning to decode words may take a long time—indeed, in the deepest orthographies a distinctive symptom of dyslexia is the inability to read at the word level—but many dyslexic readers have fewer problems with fluency and comprehension once some level of decoding has been mastered.

Studies between the English and German (which has a shallower orthography than English) languages have shown that the greater depth of the English orthography has a "marked adverse effect on reading skills" among children with dyslexia, though the dyslexics in these studies still mostly underperformed compared to control groups.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landerl |date= 1997 |title=The impact of orthographic consistency on dyslexia: A German-English comparison |journal=Cognition |volume=63 |issue= 3|pages=315–334  |url=  |doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(97)00005-X |pmid=9265873 |first1=K |last2=Wimmer |first2=H |last3=Frith |first3=U }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frith |first=Uta |date= 1998 |title=Differences in Phonological Recoding in German- and English-Speaking Children |journal=Scientific Studies of Reading |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=31–54  |url=  |doi=10.1207/s1532799xssr0201_2 |last2=Wimmer |first2=Heinz |last3=Landerl |first3=Karin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research, however, has suggested that all children with dyslexia still suffer the same reading difficulties despite different orthographies, including reading speed deficit and slow decoding mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These findings suggest that orthographic differences do not significantly impact the main difficulties those with dyslexia experience.

==Dyslexia in different types of orthographies==
There are a number of different types of writing systems, or orthographies, and they do not necessarily depend on the same neurological skill sets.&lt;ref&gt;Cell Press (2009, October 13). Dyslexia Varies Across Languages. ScienceDaily. Retrieved July 26, 2013, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091012121333.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, certain dyslexic deficits may be more pronounced in some orthographies than in others. For example, in alphabetic languages, [[phonological awareness]] is highly predictive of reading ability. But in Chinese (a logographic system), orthographic awareness and [[Fine motor skill|motor programming]] are highly predictive of reading ability.&lt;ref name="pmid15939871"&gt;{{cite journal

===Dyslexia in alphabetic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Alphabet|Managing dyslexia: alphabetic orthography}}
Most of the current research on dyslexia focuses on alphabetic orthography.&lt;ref name="karanth" /&gt;

Alphabetic writing systems vary significantly in the depth of their orthography. [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are considered deep orthographies in comparison to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] which are [[Orthography#Defectiveness|shallow orthographies]]. A deep orthography like English has letters or letter combinations that do not reliably map to specific phonemes/sound units, and so are ambiguous in terms of the sounds that they represent whereas a transparent or shallow orthography has symbols that (more) uniquely map to sounds, ideally in a one-to-one correspondence or at least with limited or clearly signified (as with accent marks or other distinguishing features) variation. Literacy studies have shown that even for children without reading difficulties like dyslexia, a more transparent orthography is learned more quickly and more easily; this is true across language systems (syllabic, alphabetic, and logographic), and between shallow and deep alphabetic languages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In cross-language studies, Aro and Wimmer report differences in developmental reading skills across several alphabetic orthographies.  Among those tested, [[English language|English]] children achieved only 50% accuracy in [[pseudoword]] testing by the end of first grade and did not attain high accuracy until fourth grade. However, in the same test, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] children all achieved scores approaching 85% and 90% in Grade 1 and Grade 4, respectively.&lt;ref name="Aro"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research provides evidence that orthographic irregularities, such as the "complex grapheme-phoneme relations" found in English, present significant difficulties in the reading development of children.&lt;ref name="Aro" /&gt;

However, there is little evidence that a more "regular" orthographic system would significantly diminish the amount of dyslexia cases. Because there is also a visual aspect to dyslexia, affected children often show symptoms such as mirror letter reversal (e.g. confusing "b" and "d"), which can manifest in any language regardless of orthographic depth.

===Dyslexia in logographic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Logogram}}
Logographic writing systems (such as [[Chinese character]]s and [[Cuneiform]]) are significantly different from alphabetic ones. The primary difference is that their basic [[grapheme]]s are [[logogram]]s, a representation based on meaning ([[morpheme]]s), rather than sounds ([[phoneme]]s). Chinese and Japanese Kanji, two languages with logographic orthographies, use sets of one or more characters to represent morphemes. In kanji, there are usually two ways to read a symbol, one that is similar to the original Chinese and one that is for the Japanese word. There are also a greater number of characters for logographic systems like kanji than for alphabetic and syllabic systems (generally): "The Japanese educational system explicitly teaches a set of 1,945 Joyo Kanji (kanji for daily use). However...most Japanese know many more than these and that 3,000 or more kanji are required to read a daily newspaper."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:XiaozhuanQinquan sized.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Archaic Chinese logograms]]

Development of reading and writing skills in logographic systems depends more heavily on visual memorization than for alphabetic systems.  Thus dyslexics, who often rely on grapheme memorization to cope with phonological awareness deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neural Systems in Dyslexics More Tuned to Memory than to Sound|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/PRNT_Research.html|work=The Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaywitz|first2= B.

====Chinese orthographies====
Chinese children can exhibit a more severe form of dyslexia as opposed to those learning literacy using an alphabetic script such as that used in writing English. Not only are they phonologically at a disadvantage, but their visuospatial processing is impaired. When children have a visuospatial disorder, their visual system when looking at Chinese characters will not activate the semantic information to understand what they are reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siok|last2=Spinks|first2=John A.|last3=Jin|first3=Zhen|last4=Tan|first4=Li Hai|date=13 October 2009|title=Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the co-existence of visuospatial and phonological disorders in Chinese children|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209015498|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=19|pages=R890|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.014|issn=0960-9822|pmid=19825347|access-date=|via=|accessdate=30 July 2013|first1=Wai Ting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In alphabetic languages, phonological awareness plays a central role in reading acquisition; in learning to read Chinese, phonological awareness is much less important. Rather, reading in Chinese is strongly related to a child's writing skills, which depend on orthographic awareness and on motor memory.  In handling alphabetic languages with [[deep orthography|deep orthographies]], the child must cope with having more than one spelling to represent a sound.  In spoken Chinese, a single syllable is used in many different words, and a Chinese child must cope with having many written characters that represent the same syllable.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further complicating the Chinese writing system, the Chinese character is made up of strokes and sub-character components, substantially increasing visual complexity. Thus orthographic processing is an important aspect of reading. Deficient orthography-to-meaning mapping can lead to reading disability. A key strategy in teaching children to read is to have children repeatedly write samples of single characters, thus building the child's awareness of a character's internal structure (orthographic awareness).&lt;ref name="pmid15939871" /&gt;

Rapid naming is one of the best single predictors of dyslexia in all languages tested, including both alphabetic and character-based writing systems.&lt;ref name="pmid15939871" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf2"&gt;Wolf, Maryanne (2007). Proust and the squid. Harper Collins. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-0-06-018639-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence that the means of deciphering characters differs between logographic and alphabetic writing systems differ{{clarify|date=March 2016}} in the brain: logographic systems echo map-reading skills.

===Dyslexia in syllabic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Syllabary}}

In a syllabary,  written characters represent spoken syllables, whereas alphabetic systems use characters/letters to represent separate phonemes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Nick |last2=Natsume |first2=Miwa |last3=Stavropoulou |first3=Katerina |last4=Hoxhallari |first4=Lorenc |last5=Van Daal |first5=Victor|last6=Polyzoe |first6=Nicoletta |last7=Tsipa |first7=Maria-Louisa |last8= Petalas |first8=Michalis |title=The effects of orthographic depth on learning to read alphabetic, syllabic, and logographic scripts|journal=Reading Research Quarterly|year=2004|volume=39|issue=4|pages=438–68 |doi=10.1598/RRQ.39.4.5 |jstor=4151742}}&lt;/ref&gt; A symbol in a syllabary typically has the canonical shape of a consonant-vowel (CV) combination. In the Japanese syllabaries, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], there is a nearly one-to-one correspondence between [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] and characters. The transparency of these syllabaries is the reason for their use in first teaching Japanese children to read before advancing to the complex logographic system of kanji, and by the age of five, prior to any official reading education, 89% of Japanese children can read the majority (60 or more out of 71) of hiragana characters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Syllabary orthographies, like English orthography, can also be very irregular. {{clarify|reason=In which language?|date=May 2015|text=A symbol could mean "i" in one sentence but the same symbol could mean "e" in a different sentence if it is preceded by a different symbol,}}&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, M. (2009). The Psychology of Dyslexia a Handbook for Teachers with Case Studies. (2nd ed.). Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons. p. 141. {{ISBN|978-0-470-74096-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which can increase the difficulty of reading for people with dyslexia. However, little research has been done on how dyslexia presents in syllabic systems. One possible reason for this is that because of the different ways that dyslexia can present, {{clarify|date=May 2015|text=(i.e. how visuospatial systems are affected in Chinese dyslexics - or how the logographic system is affected by defects/abnormalities in the visuospatial processing regions, which is more likely since written language is a cultural artifact with no genetic predispositions, and so existing structures must be adapted to handle language)}} the disorder may go unnoticed or not be recognized. On the other hand, a Japanese psychologist {{who|date=May 2015}}  wrote that "while dyslexia, reading disability, reading disorder, reading retardation, or whatever you prefer to call it, comprises a formidable portion of psychiatric practice in Western countries, its incidence in Japan is so rare that specialists in Japan do not get any referrals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Harold W. |last1=Stevenson |first2=James W. |last2=Stigler |first3=G.

A literacy study on children without reading disabilities found that syllabic scripts like Japanese katakana and hiragana, which are very transparent orthographically, are learned more quickly and with better proficiency than more orthographically opaque languages, followed in ease of use and learning by shallow alphabetic scripts that also have many phonological cues, then by complex alphabetic scripts that have irregular orthography (like English), and then by logographic scripts like [[kanji]] which have no phonological cues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Power Rangers in Space''''' is an American television series and the sixth season of the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise, based on the [[Super Sentai]] series ''[[Denji Sentai Megaranger]]''.&lt;ref name="PR.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Rangers {{!}} Seasons {{!}} Space|url=http://www.powerrangers.com/seasons-space.html|work=Power Rangers Official Website|accessdate=May 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911074433/http://powerrangers.com/seasons-space.html|archivedate=September 11, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all ''Power Rangers'' programs, ''in Space'' is based on one of the entries of the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series. However, due to miscommunication between the United States and Japan as to the contents of the Sentai series, much of the space footage is original to the American adaptation. ''In Space'' was a turning point for the Power Rangers franchise, as the season brought closure to six seasons of plot, and it ended the practice of having regular cast members act in consecutive seasons. The theme of this series, and its successor, ''[[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy]]'', bears little similarity to their Sentai counterparts.

Though its initial tone was similar to that of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Mighty Morphin]],'' ''[[Power Rangers Zeo|Zeo]] and [[Power Rangers Turbo|Turbo]]'', ''Power Rangers in Space'' eventually took a darker, more emotional turn.

==Synopsis==
Picking up where ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]'' left off, Dark Specter has captured [[Zordon]] and is beginning to completely drain his powers. An assortment of old and new villains praises his victory, but an unexpected figure uncovers his plan: the Red Space Ranger, Andros. Dark Specter orders the new Princess of Evil, Astronema, to eliminate Andros so he can't jeopardize his plans.&lt;ref name="dvdtalk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/59063/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-complete-series/ |title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Complete Series : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, four of the former Turbo Rangers (T.J. Johnson, Cassie Chan, Carlos Vallerte and Ashley Hammod) and Alpha 6 are traveling in a NASADA space shuttle with the intent to save Zordon. They are pulled aboard the Astro Megaship and later encounter Andros. Though initially suspicious and dismissive of the four former Rangers, Andros realizes he'll need their help to save Zordon and gives them each an Astro Morpher. Additionally, modifications allow the NASADA space shuttle and the Astro Megaship to combine into the powerful Astro Megazord. The new Space Ranger team then returns to [[Earth]] for repairs and supplies, but are followed by Astronema.

The Space Rangers alternate between searching for Zordon and protecting Earth. From the Dark Fortress, Astronema seeks to eliminate them via [[Ecliptor]] (who raised her), Quantrons and a variety of monsters. ([[Villains in Power Rangers in Space#Elgar|Elgar]] has also been added to her team, but he remains a comedic bungler.) Over time, allies (such as Phantom Ranger, Justin Stewart and Adam Park) offer the Rangers invaluable aid, with Zhane (the Silver Space Ranger) emerging from cryo-sleep and joining the team. New Zords are also introduced. Meanwhile, Bulk and Skull become assistants to eccentric Professor Phenomenus and join him in searching for aliens.

While dedicated to finding Zordon, Andros has another quest: finding his sister, Karone, who was kidnapped when they were children. Over time, Andros discovers his sister was kidnapped by [[Darkonda]], an old rival of Ecliptor's with multiple lives. Much to Andros' surprise, it turns out that Karone is actually Astronema, who was raised by Ecliptor to be evil. Andros is able to convince Astronema of the truth and she defects with Ecliptor's help. Unfortunately, just as quickly, she (along with Ecliptor) is recaptured and reprogrammed to follow Dark Specter.

Astronema becomes more evil than ever, as she not only wants to destroy the Space Rangers, but also Dark Specter. To that end, she unleashes the [[Psycho Rangers]]. The five robotic (and borderline insane) villains possess great power, which secretly comes from Dark Specter. Every time they fight, Dark Specter is drained of power and grows weaker. Only through a great deal of effort are the six Space Rangers able to overcome the Psycho Rangers. Soon afterward, the Rangers suffer setbacks that see two Megazords destroyed, which are Delta Megaword and The Mega Voyager.

Everything culminates in the two-part finale, "Countdown to Destruction", where Zordon is nearly completely drained and Dark Specter orders the villains under his command to attack the entire universe. Across the universe, the [[Alien Rangers]], Phantom Ranger, [[Blue Senturion]], the [[Trey of Triforia|Gold Zeo Ranger]] and KO-35 rebels are defeated and captured. The Space Rangers struggle to defend Earth, but are overwhelmed and forced to retreat. Even Zhane and his Zord, the Mega Winger, are no match. Darkonda kills Dark Specter in a suicide attack, leaving Astronema in command as the "Queen of Evil." While Andros boards the Dark Fortress to appeal to his sister, the remaining five Space Rangers engage in one last fight for Earth and are even joined by the citizens of Angel Grove (with Bulk and Skull leading the charge).

On the Dark Fortress, Andros finds Zordon, who requests his energy tube be shattered. Doing so will release good energy that will destroy the forces of evil and save the universe, but also kill him. Following battles with Astronema and Ecliptor, Andros has no choice but to comply. The many monsters are subsequently turned to dust by the energy wave, while [[Lord Zedd]], [[Rita Repulsa]], [[Divatox]] and Astronema are changed into normal, non-evil humans. With the universe now safe, T.J., Cassie, Carlos, Ashley and Alpha 6 intend to settle down on Earth. Though initially intending to remain on KO-35 with their people, Andros, Zhane and Karone decide to join their friends on Earth.

==Production==
The original pre-bible for ''in Space'', drafted before the start of ''Power Rangers Turbo'''s second half, was placed online in June 2011. The first half includes synopses of ''[[Denji Sentai Megaranger|Megaranger]]'' episodes, with a mix of Japanese names and intended US names, and a breakdown of how much sentai footage was "useable"; there is a list of weaponry and Zords introduced, how often they appear, and the monsters and how they are destroyed. It then goes on to set out the plans for the ''in Space'' adaptation.&lt;ref name="sirstack.livejournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sirstack.livejournal.com/50847.html |title=Mega Rangers Element Breakdown (Scans) - Project HEXAGON |publisher=Sirstack.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Astronema and Andros were originally absent, with the Phantom Ranger finding out about Dark Specter's plan instead, and Justin was going to remain in the team. Instead of losing their powers and base at the end of ''Turbo'', the Rangers would be given their space powers by Dimitria (the ''Turbo'' mentor) so they could head into space and save Zordon. Their spacecraft would have had a limited power supply and could only be recharged by the Power Chamber on Earth, forcing them to keep returning; otherwise, they would hop from planet to planet, encountering new and returning villains, and picking up clues for Zordon's whereabouts. Divatox was still going to be the main recurring villain, with Ecliptor as her new second-in-command. Bulk and Skull formed a volunteer Citizen Force Group to try and protect Angel Grove while the Rangers were away. The Silver Ranger was the subject of debate, as Saban were unsure if they wanted to use him.&lt;ref name="sirstack.livejournal.com"/&gt;

''In Space'' would have seen ''Carranger'' villain Exhaus used as Dark Specter - he would instead be the monster Goldgoyle for the end of ''Turbo''. The Rangers were going to have a base in Earth orbit called the new Power Dome: it was to be realized by "a giant pyramid made of silky material... the walls of silk will change constantly with special effects lights creating the different moods". The "Space Station" (Astro Megaship) interior was going to recycle the Power Chamber set; footage would be shot for the villain's "Evil Platform" set ahead of time and used as recurring stock footage.&lt;ref name="sirstack.livejournal.com"/&gt;

This would be the last full season to feature the character of Skull ([[Jason Narvy]]). Narvy chose to leave the show to continue his college education. He would return briefly in the first episode of the following season, ''[[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy]]'', so that his character could be written off of the show. He would also return (along with [[Paul Schrier]]) for the ''[[Power Rangers Wild Force]]'' episode "Forever Red".

''In Space'' was originally written as the final season for the series, as the ratings began to decline following ''Turbo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GA0eNjuQ0s |title=Top 10 Power Rangers Series |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''In Space'' ended up being an unexpected success and with fan interest returning, Saban and Fox decided to continue production of the series.&lt;ref name="dvdtalk1"/&gt;

Portrayed by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]].

===Villains===
* '''Dark Specter''' (oiced by Christopher Grey&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0120575}}&lt;/ref&gt;) - The "Grand Monarch of Evil", who all other villains fear, Dark Specter appears as a gigantic lava-monster. He is the leader of the United Alliance of Evil. He was shown to have the ability to shape shift. Dark Specter was responsible for the fall of Eltar, he managed to capture Zordon and proceeded to slowly drain his powers throughout the season. He nearly met his end with the creation of the Psycho Rangers, who drew their energy from the evil monarch every time they fought. He was killed in the finale by Darkonda, who had stolen a Velocifighter armed with an experimental laser. With his dying breath, he devoured Darkonda whole before exploding.
* '''Astronema''' (portrayed by [[Melody Perkins]]) - The "Princess of Evil", Astronema is a sinister and ruthless villainess who was groomed as a child in the ways of evil. It is later discovered that she is in fact Karone, sister of Red Ranger Andros. She defected to the Rangers' side for a time, before being captured, brainwashed and given cybernetic implants which overwrote her emotions. As a result of this, her demeanor became cold, and even more ruthless and evil than before. She would later create the Psycho Rangers and link their powers directly to Dark Specter in an attempt to do away with the monarch and take power for herself. When Dark Specter is killed in the finale, she becomes the "Queen of Evil", she is seemingly killed accidentally during a confrontation with Andros, but is revived by Andros' tears. Portrayed by [[Melody Perkins]].
* '''Ecliptor''' (voiced by [[Lex Lang|Walter Lang]]) - Astronema's guardian and surrogate father. He raised Astronema to be evil, caring for her like his own daughter. After Astronema learns her true identity, Ecliptor remained devoted to his princess, defending her against the attacks of his own forces. Branded a traitor, he is given additional cybernetics that suppress his better nature and make him purely evil. Upon seeing Astronema seemingly slain by her brother, Ecliptor broke free of his programming to get revenge. Despite his fatherly affection for Astronema, Ecliptor was killed by Zordon's energy wave.
* '''Elgar''' (portrayed by Kenny Graceson, voiced by [[Derek Stephen Prince|David Umansky]]) - Divatox's idiotic, illiterate nephew. He was assigned to the Dark Fortress by Dark Spector, mostly to allow Divatox to move Zordon around the universe without his bumbling threatening to ruin things. Killed by Zordon's energy wave.
* '''Darkonda''' (voiced by [[Steve Kramer (actor)|Steve Kramer]]) - A [[Bounty hunter]] who was responsible for kidnapping Karone as a child. Sadistic and treacherous, Darkonda was a rival to Ecliptor. He was given as many lives as a cat is said to have, but managed to lose all but one though bungling or being defeated. He planned to kill Dark Specter with the missile intended for Earth's destruction, but was swallowed by the evil monarch before he perished.
* '''Quantrons''' - Astronema's footsoliders. Appearing as silver robots with blades as their primary weapons. Like the Cogs before them, they pilot vehicles for attacks.
* '''Craterites''' - Foot soldiers from the Astro Megaship simudeck's training program. A lightning bolt once hit the megaship while T.J. And Ashley were doing a session, causing them to become real and hide amongst the people in Angel Grove by disguising themselves as humans. After fighting the Rangers, they then merged into a Congolomate version of themselves. After being defeated by the Astro Megazord, they were once again part of the simudeck program.
* '''Piranhatrons''' - Divatox's foot soldiers from ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]''.

====Psycho Rangers====
The '''Psycho Rangers''' are five evil rangers created by Astronoma as part of her plans to destroy Dark Specter and originally drew their energy from him, who felt the drain more strongly if the Psychos fought hard. Though stronger than the Power Rangers, the Psycho Rangers were impatient, could not work together, and unwilling to follow Astronema's plans, leading to them being destroyed by the Space Rangers before Dark Specter was. When grown, their true monster forms were revealed. As spirits, they sought a way to return to physical form; this led them to the lost city, where they used a digitizing device in reverse to become real again. However, the rangers digitized them into data cards; the cards later ended up in Deviot's possession, who revived them in ''[[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy]]'', but they were again destroyed by both the Galaxy and Space Rangers.

* '''Psycho Red''' (portrayed and voiced by Patrick David) - Psycho Red was the leader and the most powerful of the Psycho Rangers, as demonstrated when he faced all five Space Rangers in battle without aid. He was also the most impatient of the Psycho Rangers and became more and more frustrated when Astronema would not let them destroy the Space Rangers. Though each Psycho Ranger wanted to destroy their Space Ranger counterpart, Psycho Red was the most obsessed with doing so – even jeopardizing nearly successful plans. His monster form was a flame-like monster. Psycho Red was destroyed by the powered up V3 Missile attack from the Mega Voyager. 
* '''Psycho Black''' (portrayed and voiced by [[Michael Maize]]) - Psycho Black was created as the evil counterpart of the Black Space Ranger. Of the five, he was the most level-headed and least rebellious. He wasn't too happy with Astronema's strategy, but followed her orders because he was afraid of being destroyed if he rebelled. He tended to disagree with Psycho Red, finding him too irrational. He stopped Psycho Red from killing Andros at a time when Red was refusing to obey Astronema's orders, angry that Red wanted all the glory for himself. His Psycho-Monster form was a rock-like monster who can use a rock-like tentacle. He was destroyed by a V3 Missile Attack from the Mega Voyager.
* '''Psycho Blue''' (voiced by [[Wally Wingert]]) - Psycho Blue was designed to destroy the Blue Space Ranger. He had a seemingly unstable and insane personality - not unlike a raging psychopath. On one occasion, he beat TJ so hard that TJ had to be put in intensive care aboard the Megaship. Over time, his obsession with his counterpart got the better of him, to the point where he refused to give up when he faced five Blue Rangers (the other four main Rangers had re-coloured their costumes to mimic the Blue costume). He rushed into battle, taking out four Rangers, but was eventually overpowered by the Blue and Silver Rangers. His Psycho Monster form is an ice-like monster with freezing powers. Psycho Blue was destroyed by the Winged Mega Voyager's V3 Missile Attack. 
* '''Psycho Yellow''' (portrayed and voiced by Kamera Walton) - Psycho Yellow was the loner Ranger - she did not participate in battle as much as the others did. She preferred to let others do the dirty work while she claimed victory. She even double-crossed Psycho Pink, using her for her own scheme. Psycho Yellow was also able to infect the Mega Voyager and force it to fight against the Mega Winger and Delta Megazord after transforming into a computer virus. Psycho Yellow was a [[spider]]/[[hornet]]-like monster, and was destroyed by the energy that was absorbed from the Psycho Monsters' attack, which was then used to fire an ultra-charged V3 Missile attack. 
* '''Psycho Pink''' (voiced by [[Vicki Davis]]) - Psycho Pink was the least fleshed out of the Psycho Rangers, though at times she appeared to be the most aggressive of them. When Astronema decided the Psycho Rangers would take on one Space Ranger at a time, Psycho Pink was selected to fight first. However, she went in a secret alliance with Psycho Yellow that ended abruptly when Yellow betrayed her. The Pink and Yellow Space Rangers used this to their advantage and defeated Psycho Pink. In her monster form, Psycho Pink was a [[plant]]-like monster, and was destroyed by the Mega Voyager's V3 Missile attack.

====Monsters====
The monsters used in this season work for Astronema. The monsters are adapted from the monsters that are featured in ''[[Denji Sentai Megaranger]]''. To make a monster grow, Astronema would give orders to fire the Sattelaser at the monster making it grow.

* '''Manta Menace''' - A [[stingray]] monster occasionally fought on the Simudeck.
* '''Electrotramp''' (voiced by [[Blake Torney]]) - Electrotramp is an [[electricity|electrical]] monster that Astronema used to draw out the Rangers to have her mesmerized [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] "help" them defeat him.

During the events of "Shattered Grid," the Space Rangers are attacked by Drakkon and his forces.  Andros somehow managed to escape, while TJ was captured.  According to Andros, Ashley, Cassie, and Carlos were all killed in the attack.  

Andros arrives in the world of the Mighty Morpin Power Rangers universe barely escaping Drakon's forces after seeing where he is holding all the captured Rangers he has accumulated across the universe. He is in close talk and strategy with the other Rangers as [[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy|Karone]] watches from the shadows, unsure of how to approach her brother.  After some encouragement from [[Power Rangers Time Force|Jen Scotts]], she approaches Andros, who is overjoyed to find out that eventually his sister was saved by him and the other Space Rangers. 

It has been revealed that Andros will join a team of rangers formed across the various universes in the follow up to "Shattered Grid" in "Beyond the Grid," alongside the Ranger Slayer, [[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy|The Magna Defender]], [[Power Rangers Ninja Storm|Cameron]], [[Power Rangers Zeo|Tanya]], and the as of yet unrevealed [[Power Rangers Dino Charge|Dark Ranger]].

'''Private universities''' (and '''private colleges''') are typically not operated by governments, although many receive [[tax breaks]], public [[student loans]], and [[grant (money)|grants]]. Depending on their location, private universities may be subject to government regulation. This is in contrast to [[public university|public universities]] and [[national university|national universities]]. Most private universities are [[non-profit organization]]s.

== Africa ==

=== Egypt ===
Egypt has many private universities, including [[The American University in Cairo]], the [[German University in Cairo]], The [[British University in Egypt]], the [[Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport]], [[Misr University for Science and Technology]], [[Misr International University]], [[Future University in Egypt]] and [[Modern Sciences and Arts University]].

=== Ghana ===
There were few private universities in Ghana before the beginning of the new millennium. Ghana has seen a flood of the establishment of private universities and colleges, which is a reflection of the country's stable governance and peaceful atmosphere, and most importantly the pace of economic growth. Most of these universities are not known to be sponsored by foreign corporate organisations and government universities, and the aim is to avoid the Ghana government's excessive payment of bond which is a requirement for all foreign institutions endeavouring to operate business in the country. Almost all the private universities in Ghana have a similar kind of academic discipline, like Business Administration, Human Resource, Accounting, Information Technology, etc., which are offered by universities like [[Ashesi University|Ashesi]], [[Regent University College of Science and Technology|Regent]], [[Valley View University|Valley View]], [[Ghana telecom university college|Ghana Telecom]] and many others. The recent discovery of oil and gas in commercial quantities has influenced the development of oil and gas management courses within the private universities' curriculum.

=== Libya ===
Libya has number of recognised private education institutions and universities, approved by the Ministry of Higher Education, ranked and qualified to specialise in academic programs in Business Administration, Computer Science, Law, Medicine and Humanitarian. These institutions include:

* Al Rifaq University for Humanitarian and Applied Science – Tripoli City
* Ibn Al Haytham Center for Technology Education and Scientific research – Tripoli City
* Libyan International Medical University – Benghazi City
* Libyan University for Humanitarian and Applied Science – Tajora City
* Tripoli Community University – Tripoli
* Tripoli Institute for Medical Sciences – Tripoli City
* United Africa University – Zawia City

=== Nigeria ===
The [[National Universities Commission]] of Nigeria has the responsibility to approve private universities and accredit their courses. This ensures a minimum standard in curriculum and teaching. There are currently 60 approved private universities in Nigeria and still counting as there are hundreds of application under processing.

=== South Africa ===
In [[South Africa]] there is a distinction between public universities and what the government calls private higher education institutions. [[Varsity College (South Africa)|Varsity College]], [[Vega (South Africa)|Vega]], [[The Design School Southern Africa]], [[Milpark]], [[Midrand Graduate Institute]], [[Regenesys Business School]], Akademia and Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology are all recognised as private higher education institutions.

== Asia ==

=== Bangladesh ===
A number of private universities were established in Bangladesh after the Private University Act, 1992 was instituted, and amended as the Private University Act 2010. All private universities must be approved by [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) before they are given a permit to operate. See external links for: ''Private Universities Act 1992''.

As of 2014, there were 91 [[List of universities in Bangladesh#Private universities|private universities in Bangladesh]].

=== Brunei Darussalam ===
Private institutions must confer the students with external programmes such as BDTVEC (the largest awarding body in the country), [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] and [[Cambridge International Examinations]] pathways. Accreditation by Brunei Darussalam National Accreditation Council (BDNAC) is very crucial in order to establish a private institution.

=== Pakistan ===

{{Main article|Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)}}
The Higher Education Commission (HEC), formerly the University Grant Commission (UGC), is the primary regulator of higher education in Pakistan. It also facilitates the development of the higher educational system in Pakistan. Its main purpose is to upgrade the schools to be world-class centres of education, research and development. It also plays a leading role towards building a knowledge-based economy in Pakistan by giving out hundreds of doctoral scholarships for education abroad every year.

In spite of the criticism of the HEC, its creation has also had a positive impact on higher education in Pakistan. Its two-year report for 2004 to 2006 states that according to the Institute of Scientific Information, the total number of publications appearing in the 8,000 leading journals indexed in the web of science arising out of Pakistan in 2005 was 1,259 articles, representing a 41% increase over the past two years and a 60% increase since the establishment of HEC in 2002. The HEC digital library now provides access to over 20,000 leading research journals, covering about 75% of the world's peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Until 1991, there were only two recognized private universities in Pakistan: [[Aga Khan University]], established in 1983 and [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]], established in 1985. By 1997, however, there were 10 private universities. In 2001–2002, this number had doubled to 20. Among the first to gain degree awarding status was [[Hajvery University, Lahore]] (HU), established in 1990. In 2003–2004 Pakistan had a total of 83 private degree granting institutions.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
There are nine private universities in Saudi Arabia:
* [[Al Yamamah University]]
* [[Alfaisal University]]
* [[Arab Open University]]
* [[Dar Al Uloom University]]&lt;ref name=mohe&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Universities|url=http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/studyinside/privateedu/Pages/listphe.aspx|publisher=Ministry of Higher Education|accessdate=14 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423075451/http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/studyinside/privateedu/Pages/listphe.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
[[Stansfield College]], founded in 1993, is a private higher education institution and a provider of the [[University of London International Programmes]] in [[Singapore]]. Through its collaboration with the [[University of London]], Stansfield offers undergraduate degrees and diplomas in a range of academic disciplines which include Law, the Humanities, and the EMFSS suite of programmes with specialisations in Accounting, Business &amp; Management, Banking &amp; Finance, Economics, Mathematics &amp; Economics and the Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="stansfield.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stansfield.edu.sg|title=Stansfield College|work=Stansfield College|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has also expanded its range of programmes to include several university foundation awards including certificate and diploma programmes that allow students to progress academically at Stansfield or to gain admissions into overseas universities. The college also provides postgraduate diplomas and executive development courses and seminars.&lt;ref name="stansfield.edu.sg" /&gt;

The college enrolls over 500, with students from over 30 countries studying at its campus.&lt;ref name="stansfield.edu.sg" /&gt;

[[Auston Institute of Management]] is another example of a private 'university' where students who study at the college receive university awards from degree-awarding partners overseas. Auston rose to fame in the early 2000s{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} with a collaboration with [[Coventry University]]. This partnership ended in 2012 and was replaced with new partners including [[London South Bank University]], [[University of Wolverhampton]], [[Birmingham City University]], [[Chichester University]] and [[De Montfort University]]. Auston is known for its hands-on approach and its emphasis in technical areas of study such as electronics, mechatronics, computer security, and various forms of software engineering.&lt;ref name="auston.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auston.edu.sg|title=Auston - Engineering, Computing and Business Degrees &amp; Diplomas|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auston graduates about 400 students per year from as many as eight different countries, all studying in Singapore for UK degree awards.&lt;ref name="auston.edu.sg"/&gt;

=== Sri Lanka ===
[[Sri Lanka]] does not officially recognise private universities, but does not explicitly forbid them either.But there are many private institutes(these institutes are registered under the company act), and several independent institutions that are non-government funded. These mostly provide undergraduate degrees, with a limited few proving postgraduate degrees. The Informatics Institute of Sri Lanka (IIT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iit.ac.lk/ www.iit.ac.lk]&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon Campus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horizoncampus.edu.lk/|title=Horizon Campus|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sri Lanka Institute for Information Technology (SLIIT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sliit.lk/|title=Home - Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology|work=Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are examples. Some foreign universities franchise parts of their degree courses in Sri Lanka with local institutes. Students are charged for the study (some of these institutes are state funded institutions of their home countries) and these charges are often a fraction of the cost studying in the home countries of these institutions.

Efforts to establish private universities have been blocked due to protests from state universities' undergraduates and leftist political parties.

However many private colleges have sprung up one of which is the affiliated campus of [[Auston Institute of Management, Singapore]]. The Sri Lanka campus was established in 2010 and is a [[Board of Investment or (BOI)]] company. It retains a similar focus to the home campus and occupies a prime spot along Colombo's famous Galle Road.&lt;ref name="auston.edu.lk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auston.edu.lk|title=- Engineering and Project Management College in Sri Lanka|work=Auston|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auston has been visited by many foreign universities and continues to expand its provision of titles in engineering and computing.&lt;ref name="auston.edu.lk"/&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, unlike the United States, private universities are typically not as prestigious as some public (national) universities. They are not as highly ranked as public institutions, and also cost nearly twice as much. This is due to the form of testing in schools in Taiwan, in which students take a national entrance exam to determine their university qualifications. The famous private university is [[Fu Jen Catholic University]], and the earliest is [[Tunghai University]].

=== Vietnam ===
Since the 1990s a lot of private universities have opened in Vietnam.  Hochiminh City Open University was one of the first. Typical characteristics of Vietnamese private universities {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} are higher (very high in some cases) tuition fees, poor infrastructure, and limited faculty and human resources.

Private universities are often named after scholars (Fulbright University [[William Fulbright]], Vo Truong Toan University, [[Nguyen Trai]] University, Luong The Vinh University, Chu Van A University, [[Yersin]] University, [[Phan Chau Trinh]] University), or heroes/legends ([[Hung Vuong]] University, [[Quang Trung]] University), although there are exceptions, such as [[FPT University]], named after the FPT Group and [[Tan Tao University]], in [[Tan Tao Group]].

In Vietnam, there exists the "semi-private university"; schools in this category can receive partial financial support from the government. Almost all private universities have to invite professors and lecturers from the state universities. Many lecturers from state-owned universities take up positions in private universities after their retirement.

== Europe ==

=== Austria ===
In [[Austria]], educational institutions must be authorised by the country to legally grant [[academic degree]]s. All state-run universities are governed by the 2002 Austrian Universities' and University Degree Programmes' Organisation Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 120/2002). In 1999, a federal law (''Universitäts-Akkreditierungsgesetz'') was passed to allow the [[School accreditation|accreditation]] of private universities. The ''Akkreditierungsrat'' (Accreditation Council)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/ Official website – ''Akkreditierungsrat'']&lt;/ref&gt;  evaluates applicants and issues recommendations to the responsible Austrian accreditation authority (the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science &amp; Research).

Accreditation by the council yields a couple of privileges: degrees issued by accredited private universities have the same legal status as those issued by state-run universities. Private universities can appoint or promote [[professor]]s. Their students enjoy the same privileges pertaining to social security, foreigner law and state scholarships as students of the state universities. Educational services of private universities are not subject to [[value added tax]], and donations are tax deductible.

Accreditations must be renewed regularly and can be withdrawn, e.g. in the case of repeated academic misconduct as happened in 2003 when the accreditation of [[International University Vienna]] was withdrawn. In 2006, when the accreditation of [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]] expired, the Accreditation Council rejected requests for renewal.

Austrian law provides that private universities in Austria must use the term ''Privatuniversität'' (literally, "private university") in their [[German language|German]] names, although their formal names in other languages are not regulated. Thus, there is the possibility of private institutions employing the term "university" as opposed to "private university" in their advertisements in all languages except German while still complying with Austrian law.

While the legal definition of "private university" prohibits funding by the federal government of Austria, funding by other public bodies is not prohibited. Consequently, some of Austria's private universities are partly or wholly funded by provincial governments, while others are fully privately funded.

Accreditation of private universities began in 2001. {{As of | 2010}} Austria has 12 private universities. Most are small (fewer than 1000 students) and specialise in only one or two fields of study:

* [[Anton Bruckner Private University for Music, Drama, and Dance]] – [[Linz]]
* [[Catholic-Theological Private University Linz]]
* Danube Private University – [[Krems an der Donau]]
* [[European Peace University]] – [[Stadtschlaining]]
* [[Karl Landsteiner University]] – [[Krems an der Donau]]
* [[Konservatorium Wien]] – [[Vienna]]
* [[MODUL University Vienna]] (2007)
* [[New Design University]] – [[St. Pölten]]
* Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversität – [[Salzburg]]
* Privatuniversität Schloss Seeburgin Seekirchen – near Salzburg
* [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]]
* University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology – [[Hall in Tirol]]
* [[Webster University Vienna]] (also accredited in the [[US]])

Four former private universities are '''not accredited''' any more:
* [[International University Vienna]]: Accreditation was withdrawn in 2003 due to academic misconduct.
* [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]]: First accreditation period ended in January 2006 and was not renewed.
* TCM Privatuniversität Li Shi Zhen in [[Vienna]]: Accreditation period ended 2009; TCM did not call for renewal. All students could finish their studies.
* [[PEF Private University of Management Vienna]]: The university closed for economic reasons in March 2012. All students could finish their studies.

=== Bulgaria ===
[[Bulgaria]] has a number of private universities, among which the most renowned are [[New Bulgarian University]], located in the capital city [[Sofia]]; Burgas Free University; [[Varna Free University]]; and [[American University in Bulgaria]].

=== Finland ===
[[Finland]] does not officially recognise private universities, but does not explicitly forbid them either. [[Helsinki School of Business]] is an example of one such educational institution operating in this market.

=== France ===
[[France]] has a dual system: universities and ''[[grandes écoles]].''

It is forbidden by law for a private institution to be called "university",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Code de l'éducation - Article L731-14|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=DE788FC36D1C3DEF7F1BE6989ABCDD09.tplgfr30s_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000027748361&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&amp;dateTexte=20180417|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost all universities are public. Some private institutions still openly call themselves "universities", such as the [[Lille Catholic University]], even if this has no legal basis. Universities provide courses in all academic fields (engineering, law, medical, economics, arts, business administration, sociology). One may join university after a high school degree and study there for a ''licence'' (bachelor), master's degree, or doctoral program, although again by law private institutions may not grant degrees called ''licence'' or ''doctorat''.

''Grandes écoles'' can be public or private, but the most prestigious ones are public. These institutions operate mostly in engineering studies and business administration. Universities and ''grandes écoles'' compete in these two fields. Some of them report to the Ministry of Higher Education, such as [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]] and [[Ecole Centrale Paris|École Centrale Paris]], and a few to the Ministry of Defense, such as [[Ecole Polytechnique|École Polytechnique]]. Several private ''grandes écoles'' are members of the [[Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE)|''Conférence des Grandes Écoles'']], a lobbying group representing grandes écoles. Most ''grandes écoles'' can be joined after following two years of ''[[classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles]]'', an intensive program following the ''[[baccalauréat]]''. A selective examination after the two additional years is taken to enter a ''grande école''. Following the [[Bologna Process]], this full 5 year cursus (two years of preparatory classes plus 3 years in engineering or business school) is equivalent to a master's degree.

Grandes écoles for studying business administration are usually part of the [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]]. For example, [[HEC Paris|HEC]] is part of the Chamber of Commerce of Paris ([[Paris Chamber of Commerce|CCIP]]), and is therefore semi-private.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Germany ===
[[Germany]] has 83 private universities (called ''Privathochschule'') and 45 church-run universities (called ''kirchliche Hochschule''). Similar to the state-run universities, they are subdivided into ''Universitäten'' (research universities), ''[[Fachhochschule]]n'' (universities of applied science) and ''Kunst- und Musikhochschulen'' ([[art school]]s). Private universities in Germany need institutional accreditation by the state.

The first private university in Germany, the Ukrainian Free University, was established 16 September 1950 in Munich. [[Witten/Herdecke University]] opened in 1982 and [[Zeppelin University]] in 2003. Though private universities are numerous in Germany, they represent only less than 1% of all students. Some private universities, including [[Hanseatic University Rostock]] (2007–2009) and the International University in Germany in [[Bruchsal]], have gone out of business.

Most of the church universities are run by the Protestant or Catholic churches; however, there is one Jewish university (''Hochschule für Jüdische Studien'') in [[Heidelberg]].

=== Greece ===
In [[Greece]] private universities are prohibited by [[Constitution of Greece|the constitution]] (Article 16).  However, [[Laboratory of Liberal Studies|laboratories of liberal studies]] (Εργαστήρια ελευθέρων σπουδών, ergastiria eleftheron spoudon) operate freely in the country, and, based on a law from the 1930s they are registered as private for-profit businesses and regulated by the [[Greek Ministry of Commerce]].  Their academic degrees, which are not recognised in Greece, are directly provided to students by foreign universities in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States of America]], or other countries, usually through [[Franchising|franchise]] or [[validation (education)|validation]] agreements (the franchise agreement usually being considered better).  This has limited access to the laboratories, which usually teach in English, to high-income Greeks who for various reasons (usually family matters) did not want to go abroad.

In 2008 a law was introduced that forced all private institutions collaborating with foreign universities to offer programmes in the country, to register with the [[Greek Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs]] as ''[[college]]s'' (κολλέγια, kollegia) by August 2009. Further amendments to the framework in 2010, 2012 and 2013 (4111/2013, 4093/2012) were introduced. Today there are a series of private colleges mostly offering programmes in Business Administration and other fields.

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a private university (more commonly known as a ''private college'') is one that is not funded by the state, and therefore not covered by the free-fees initiative. All [[List of universities in the Republic of Ireland|universities]], [[Regional Technical College|institutes of technology]], [[College of Education|colleges of education]], and the [[National College of Ireland]] and some religious institutions are publicly funded and therefore covered by ''free-fees'' initiative. There are few private colleges, and they are highly specialised, such as [[Griffith College Dublin]], [[Dorset College]] and [[Dublin Business School]]. The major representative body for private colleges in Ireland is the [[Higher Education Colleges Association]]. Private colleges in Ireland can seek to have their programmes validated/accredited by the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]].

See external links for: ''free-fees initiative''  and  ''Higher Education Colleges Association''.

=== Netherlands ===
[[Nyenrode]] is the only private university in the [[Netherlands]] at the graduate level. The university was founded in 1946. It serves as a [[graduate school]] for business and management. Both programs are taught in English.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Recently, Nyenrode merged with the [[Institute for CPA Education]] and both institutions share their facilities. The Nyenrode Business University also contains a campus and active student body.

Other Dutch private universities are universities of applied science (HBOs) where one can obtain a bachelor's or master's degree but not a PhD. These include [[Wittenborg University]], [[Business School Notenboom]] (founded in 1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notenboom.nl/ |title=Particuliere Business school |publisher=Notenboom |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IVA Driebergen]] for the automotive industry with its earliest beginnings in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iva-driebergen.nl/index.php?pageID=30&amp;n=47&amp;s=73 |title=Meer dan tachtig jaar; IVA Driebergen |publisher=Iva-driebergen |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
* [[SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities]]
* [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]]

=== Portugal ===
{{Main article|Higher education in Portugal}}
The oldest non-state-run university, the ''[[Universidade Católica Portuguesa]]'' – UCP (Catholic University of Portugal), a [[catholic]] private university ([[concordat]]ory status), with branches in the cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Viseu]], and [[Caldas da Rainha]], was founded before the others, in 1967, and officially recognized in 1971. UCP offers some well-recognized degrees and is reputed for the economics, law and business management degrees it awards at its Lisbon branch. Other degrees awarded by UCP, like biotechnology and dental medicine, amassed increasing success and popularity since the 2000s.

After the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, in the 1980s and 1990s, a boom of educational private institutions was experienced in Portugal, and many private universities started to open. Most had a poor reputation and were known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get high grades. In 2007, several of those private universities, or their heirs, were investigated and faced compulsory closing (for example, the infamous [[Independente University]] and [[Internacional University]] closings, and the [[Moderna University]] scandal) or official criticism with recommendations that the state-managed investigation proposed for improving their quality and avoid termination.

In the mid-2000s, within the [[Bologna process]], a reorganization of higher education was started which included more stringent regulations for private education and expanded state policies with regard to private education quality assurance and [[educational accreditation]]. In general, the private higher education institutions were often considered the schools of last resort for underachieving applicants who didn't score enough points in the admission examinations to enter the main public institutions.

Nearly open-admission policies have hurt private universities' reputation and the actual quality of their alumni. Without large endowments like those received, for example, by many US private universities and colleges which are attractive to the best scholars, researchers and students, the private [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher education institutions of Portugal]], with a few exceptions, do not have either the financial support or the academic profile to reach the highest teaching and research standards of the top Portuguese [[public universities]]. In addition, most private universities have faced a restrictive lack of collaboration with the major enterprises which, however, have developed fruitful relationships with many public higher education institutions. Most Portuguese private universities specialise in a limited number of fields, most often in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].

=== Serbia ===
{{Main article|List of universities in Serbia}}

There is a number of private universities and independent [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] in Serbia, mostly in [[Belgrade]]. They were founded in the 1990s and 2000s. Some, but not all of them are accredited by the state Commission for Accreditation and Quality Assurance. Serbian private universities and faculties have a general reputation of low-quality institutions where [[nouveau riche]] businesspeople, popular music/TV stars, sportspeople and politicians, as well as their children, [[diploma mill|obtain degrees for money]].

=== Switzerland ===
Further to the public [[Universities in Switzerland]], the country is well known for its high-quality private education system.

=== Turkey ===
In Turkey there are now 66 private universities. Bilkent University, founded in 1984, was the first. Actually they have to be and all belong to NGOs due to the high Education Law, article 3-c and annexed article 2.&lt;ref&gt;Yüksek Öğretim Kanunu/High Education Law&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey, according to the laws of private universities, on the recommendation of the Higher Education Council is established by law. The establishment of such universities, established a new university building or in the form of a higher education institution will be the name of the university. Foundations for the establishment of the university, the university faculty, the formation of at least two of the bodies of the faculties of arts and science education programs related to the fields to be present, the university of arts and science programs to be among the first to be launched training programs and eligible to attend the university's commitment to the education of students in these programs start year necessary.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{See also|Universities in the United Kingdom}}

There are five fully private universities in the United Kingdom: the [[University of Buckingham]], [[BPP University]], [[Regent's University London]], the [[University of Law]] and [[Arden University]].&lt;ref name=independent160211&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/the-university-debate-what-the-ivy-league-can-teach-britain-2215930.html|title=The University Debate: What the Ivy League can teach Britain|accessdate=3 March 2011|publisher=The Independent|date=16 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-23605046 | work=BBC News | title=For-profit college gains full university status | date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/profit-rdi-granted-university-status|title=For-profit RDI granted university status|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=5 August 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All other British universities are partly publicly funded and regulated: the government regulates their tuition fees, student funding and student loans and commissions and regulates research assessments and teaching reviews. However, unlike in Continental European countries, the British government does not own universities' assets, and university staff are not civil servants: government regulation arises as a condition of accepting funding from bodies such as [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]] and any university can in principle choose to leave the HEFCE regulated system at any time.&lt;ref name="OXCHEPS39"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf|title = OFFA and £6000-9000 tuition fees| accessdate =20 March 2011|last = Dennis|first=Farrington|author2=David Palfreyman|date =21 February 2011|format=PDF| work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39|publisher=Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies|quote=Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College). Under existing legislation and outside of the influence of the HEFCE-funding mechanism upon universities, Government can no more control university tuition fees than it can dictate the price of socks in Marks &amp; Spencer. Universities are not part of the State and they are not part of the public sector; Government has no reserve powers of intervention even in a failing institution. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since September 2012 government funding for teaching and background funding for research has been substantially reduced, with one study from that year indicating that annual government funding for teaching and research would make up just 15% of universities’ income by 2015.&lt;ref name="PatonJan2012"&gt;{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=Paton|title=Taxpayer funding of universities 'to drop to 100 year low'|date=5 January 2012|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8992136/Taxpayer-funding-of-universities-to-drop-to-100-year-low.html|work = The Telegraph|accessdate =6 January 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, an institution can only use the title "University" or "University College" if it has been granted by the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]], under the terms of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].&lt;ref name="privy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |title=Higher Education |accessdate=6 December 2007|publisher=[[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile ===
Chile has 31 completely private universities and an additional 14 universities which are run by private organizations (mostly religious) but receive some state funding.&lt;ref name="Chile"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Universidades públicas y privadas: Un enfoque tridimensional |journal=Estudios Públicos |date=Spring 2010 |last=Rigoberto Parada |first=José |volume=120 |pages=183–205 |url=http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/archivo_4745_2877/rev120_JRParada.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202037/http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/archivo_4745_2877/rev120_JRParada.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guatemala ===

In Guatemala, the only public university is [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]]. The rest of the degree offering institutions in the country are private. See [[list of universities in Guatemala]] for a list of the private universities in the country.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico has private and public (government managed) universities. Public universities are free or require a very minimum fee and private universities usually charge for an initial enrollment and monthly fees.

=== United States ===
In the US, many universities and colleges are private,{{quantify|date=June 2017}} mostly operating as educational and research [[nonprofit organization]]s,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} while there are also [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit universities]]. About 20% of American college students attend private colleges.&lt;ref name="WaMo041712"&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Luzer|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/blog/can_we_make_college_cheaper.php|title=Can We Make College Cheaper?|work=[[Washington Monthly]]|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=17 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416060750/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/blog/can_we_make_college_cheaper.php|archivedate=16 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the remainder attend state-supported schools.

Legally, private universities may not discriminate, but generally have a somewhat free hand in setting admissions policies.{{Weasel inline|date=June 2017}}  Universities base their selections on many secondary factors other than academic performance.&lt;ref name="gladwell"&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm. (2005) "Getting In: the social logic of Ivy League admissions." The New Yorker, 10 October 2005 [http://www.newyorker.com/critics/atlarge/articles/051010crat_atlarge]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tuition fees]] at private universities tend to be higher than at [[public universities]], though many private universities offer financial aid as well.&lt;ref&gt;Tottie, Gunnel. (2001) ''Introduction to American English'' Blackwell Publishing. p. 65. {{ISBN|0-631-19792-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at Princeton University, 60% of the Class of 2013 received financial aid, with an average grant amount of $36,000. The average grant now exceeds Princeton’s $35,340 annual tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/admission/whatsdistinctive/experience/financial_aid_without_loa/ |title=Princeton University &amp;#124; Financial Aid Without Loans |publisher=Princeton.edu |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201180525/http://www.princeton.edu/admission/whatsdistinctive/experience/financial_aid_without_loa/ |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Swedish Windsor Chairs.jpg|thumb|right|250px| These Swedish Windor chairs are an example of traditionally finished woodwork.]] 

In [[woodworking]] and the [[decorative art]]s, '''refinishing''' refers to the act of repairing or reapplying the [[wood finishing]] on an object. In practice, this may apply to the [[paint]] or [[wood finish]] top coat, [[lacquer]] or [[varnish]]. The artisan or restorer is traditionally aiming for an improved or restored and renewed finish. Refinishing can apply to a variety of surfaces and materials such as [[wood]], [[glass]], [[metal]], [[plastic]] and [[paint]], although in Britain, when referring to wood or wooden furniture it is commonly known as repolishing - short for re-French Polishing. 

There are a great variety of both traditional and modern finishes, including the use of [[Faux painting|faux]] finishes.  One interesting modern development in refinishing is the art of [[distressing]] or antiquing, making the finishes of pieces look older.

While refinishing is often undertaken to salvage an old piece of furniture, in the case of [[antique furniture]] refinishing has been known to significantly reduce the overall value of the piece.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some African nations such as [[Zambia]] have a vast internal consumer demand for second-hand clothes or hand-me-downs from rich nations in North America and Europe. The clothes arrive in these local markets in large bales or packages and are then cut open so buyers can sort through them and pick what article they like the most.

The Salaula industry faces many criticisms. One is that it tends to disturb the internal textile industry. Local textile business cannot compete with cheap used clothes coming from abroad. Defendants of the industry argue that market demand should dictate what is fair or not. 

Another criticism is towards the profit companies are generating from these clothes since these clothes were originally donated to non-profit organizations such as [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]]. Defendants of the practice argue that non-profit organization must sell these donations in order to acquire money necessary to fund their social projects.

'''School district drug policies''' are measures that administrators of a [[school district]] put into place to discourage [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] by students.

==Background==
Over the decades of the [[War on Drugs]] in the United States, [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]] drug and alcohol policies have become increasingly strict, in punishment and in the kinds of behavior regulated. Some school districts include off-campus and out-of-school behavior in their policy's jurisdiction. These policies are frequently part of comprehensive "Drug and alcohol" policies, and are particularly common in [[urban area|urban]] school districts.

Aspects of the policies may include [[random drug testing]], searches of lockers and personal effects, anti-drug education (e.g., "[[Just Say No]]" curricula), and punitive measures including expulsion and suspension.

Advocates of random drug testing argue that it is not just a punitive measure, but may deter drug use. Opponents, however, have argued that drugs commonly used by students, such as [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]], and prescription drugs are either not detected by the tests or are metabolized within a short period of time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

There are about 600 school districts in about 15,000 nationwide that use drug tests, according to officials from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} White House officials liken drug testing to programs that screen for tuberculosis or other diseases, and said students who test positive don't face criminal charges.

==Legal challenges==
Civil libertarians have raised concerns with these policies, citing student [[civil rights]] and student [[privacy]] as principle objections. These cases have resulted in a number of legal challenges in the United States, as well as in related case law (e.g., ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', the so-called "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" case").

In a 1995 case, ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'', the Supreme Court upheld the legality of random drug tests of student athletes who were not suspected of drug use. The Court reasoned that because school athletes routinely face mandatory physicals and other similar invasions of privacy, they have lower expectations of privacy than the average student. The Court specified that its decision should not be seen as a justification for further expansion of drug testing programs.

In the 2002 case [[Board of Education v. Earls]]  the Supreme Court extended the holding in ''Vernonia'', holding that all students who participate in voluntary activities, like cheerleading, band, or debate, could be subjected to random tests as part of a comprehensive program.  The Court, in an opinion by Justice Thomas, stated that the diminished expectations of privacy of athletes was less important to their decision in ''Vernonia'' than a school's innate custodial responsibility and authority over its students.&lt;ref&gt;''Board of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, a challenge was made to the Haddonfield, New Jersey, Board of Education's 24/7 policy regulating drug and alcohol use of students outside of school property and off school time.  The lawsuit contends that the Board of Education does not have the authority to discipline students unless the conduct in question has some connection to school safety and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/ruling_expected_on_haddonfield.html&lt;/ref&gt; A federal judge denied a request to stop the policy because the student who filed the lawsuit had already graduated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/nj/20101002_Judge_backs_Haddonfield_schools_on_substance_rule.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the plaintiff's lawyer convinced a different judge to find that the school's 24/7 policy was illegal and the judge found that Haddonfield’s policy fails to differentiate between off-campus offenses that simply break the law and those that affect the school district’s ability to provide a safe environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://patch.com/new-jersey/haddon/judge-orders-changes-to-haddonfield-s-24-7-policy.&lt;/ref&gt;  The NJ Commissioner of Education then reviewed the policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-21/news/33287567_1_haddonfield-student-mayor-tish-colombi-high-schools.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, after the Commissioner of Education ruled against the Haddonfield School Board, the Board voted to scrap the policy for good.  &lt;ref&gt;http://legalclips.nsba.org/2013/02/19/new-jersey-district-scraps-247-student-conduct-policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case study==
In late 2001, in [[Ashland, Oregon]], the [[Ashland School District (Oregon)|Ashland School Board]] enacted a Drug and Alcohol Policy for students in leadership positions, igniting a local controversy.  The policy extended to off-campus and after-school conduct, but the controversy reached the general efficacy and constitutionality of drug testing policies.&lt;ref&gt;Ashland Oregon case study:

Opposing the policy were local student groups and the local Oregon [[American Civil Liberties Union]], which had advocated on behalf of various students expelled by the Ashland School District for drug use in May 2001 at a national forensics tournament. Students at [[Ashland High School (Oregon)|Ashland High School]] argued that their off campus behavior after school hours should have no effect on their academic standing.

To resolve the dispute, a community committee was formed, meeting for five months. The committee's recommendations led to a rewriting of the Code of Conduct and a re-evaluation of the School District's entire Drug and Alcohol Policy.

A '''Senegalese kaftan''' is a [[Sweater|pullover]] men's [[robe]] with long bell sleeves. In the [[Wolof language]], this robe is called a ''mbubb'' or ''khaftaan'' and in French it is called a ''boubou''. The Senegalese caftan is an ankle length garment. It is worn with matching [[drawstring]] pants called ''tubay'' in [[Wolof language|Wolof]]. Normally made of [[cotton]] brocade, [[lace]], or synthetic fabrics, these robes are common throughout [[West Africa]]. A [[kaftan]] and matching pants is called a '''kaftan suit'''.&lt;ref name="sunnewsonline2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/features/fashionbeauty/2007/jan/05/fashion-05-01-2007-002.htm|title=Be a Power Dresser this Year}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kaftan suit can be worn with a [[kufi]] cap.&lt;ref name="Seattletimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/restaurants/2008790476_cicero27.html|title=Afrikando Afrikando Dishes up Great Food with a Side of Quirkiness | work=The Seattle Times | first=Providence | last=Cicero | date=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senegalese kaftans are [[formal wear]] in all West African countries.  In the [[United States]], some merchants sell this robe as a ''Senegalese style dashiki pant set'' or a ''full length dashiki pant set''.  Men who are members of the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] tribe, wear  these kaftans to formal events like naming ceremonies and weddings. In the [[United States]], a kaftan is one of three formal suits, equivalent to the [[tuxedo]], that [[African-American]] grooms select for their weddings. The other styles being the [[dashiki]] pant set, and the [[boubou (clothing)|grand boubou]], pronounced ''gran boo-boo''. {{fact|date=June 2013}} There are various other formal robes that are worn throughout West Africa, and with the exception of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]  Gbarie robe, pronounced ''barry'', most of these are a form of Islamic dress, see [[sartorial hijab]]. The kaftan is worn by [[Christians]], [[African Jews]],  [[Muslims]], and followers of [[African traditional religion]]. Furthermore, Senegalese kaftans are common among men of [[African descent]] in the [[African diaspora]].  The Senegalese kaftan is men's attire.  In West Africa, and the United States, this  robe is not worn by [[women]].  The women's robe is called a [[wrapper (clothing)|kaftan]].

==Wedding attire==
[[File:1917316-Travel Picture-The Gambia.jpg|thumb|right|A Moroccan kaftan being worn in [[The Gambia]], West Africa.]]
A white kaftan is worn for weddings. &lt;ref name="Bridalzine"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridalzine.com/culture1.html|title=African American Wedding Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bride's attire is a [[Wrapper (clothing)|buba and wrapper set]] or a woman's [[Wrapper (clothing)|kaftan]] that is the same color as the groom's Senegalese. 

==Informal kaftans==
Another robe that is occasionally seen in West Africa is the short-sleeved Moroccan kaftan, also called a [[thawb|thobe]], dishdasha, or [[Jellabiya|jalabiyyah]].  These kaftans are used as pajamas or lounge wear. In the home, they are worn on top of underwear. Some men wear the Moroccan kaftan outside the home.  When worn outside, it is customary to wear the Moroccan kaftan over a long or short sleeve [[t-shirt]] or [[Polo neck|turtleneck]] and a pair of [[Trousers|pants]], [[jeans]], or [[shorts]].  The Moroccan kaftan can be worn with a knitted or crown style [[kufi]] cap.  In [[Morocco]], this robe is called a ''gandora''.  Although widely worn, Moroccan kaftans are not formal attire in any West African country.  Recently, some tribes have started to wear the Tanzanian [[kanzu]] for informal occasions, including church services, or [[Friday prayers]] at the mosque.

'''Speedwriting''' is the [[trademark]] under which three versions of a [[shorthand]] system were marketed during the 20th century. The original version was designed so that it could be written with a pen or typed on a typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speedwriting, the Natural Shorthand|date=1925|publisher=Brief English Systems, Inc|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of its popularity, Speedwriting was taught in more than 400 vocational schools and its advertisements were ubiquitous in popular American magazines.

==Description of the original version==
The original version of Speedwriting uses letters of the alphabet and a few punctuation marks to represent the sounds of English. There are abbreviations for common prefixes and suffixes; for example, uppercase N represents enter- or inter- so "entertainment" is written as Ntn- and "interrogation" is reduced to Ngj.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Charles E.|title=Speedwriting Dictionary (English Version)|date=1930|publisher=Brief English Systems, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vowels are omitted from many words and arbitrary abbreviations are provided for the most common words.

''Specimen:'' ltus vaqt ll p/, aspz rNb otfm. Let us have a quiet little party and surprise our neighbor on the farm.&lt;ref name="textbook1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dearborn|first1=Emma B.|title=Speedwriting, The Natural Shorthand|date=1936|publisher=School of Speedwriting, Inc.|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By reducing the use of spaces between words a high level of brevity can be achieved: “laugh and the world laughs with you” can be written as “lfatwolfs wu.”&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;

Original Speedwriting can be typed on a typewriter or computer keyboard. When writing with a pen, one uses regular cursive handwriting with a few small modifications. Lowercase 't' is written as a simple vertical line and 'l' must be written with a distinctive loop; specific shapes for various letters are prescribed in the textbook.

With twelve weeks of training, students could achieve speeds of 80 to 100 words per minute writing with a pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Students' Speedwriting Here Amazes Educators|journal=Brooklyn Daily Eagle|date=April 8, 1928|page=19|url=https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/59876615/?terms=speedwriting%2Bamazes|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inventor of the system was able to type notes on a typewriter as fast as anyone could speak, therefore she believed Speedwriting could eliminate the need for stenotype machines in most applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dearborn|first1=Emma B.|title=Speedwriting, The Natural Shorthand: Book One (of the original correspondence course)|date=1925|publisher=Brief English Systems, Inc.|location=New York City|page=3|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the original version==
[[Emma B. Dearborn]] (February 1, 1875 - July 28, 1937&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Dearborn&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=2312427&amp;GRid=17005244&amp; findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt;) worked as a shorthand instructor and trainer of shorthand teachers at [[Simmons College]], [[Columbia University]], and several other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speedwriting, the Natural Shorthand|date=1925|publisher=Brief English Systems, Inc|page=title_page}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an expert in several pen stenography systems as well as [[stenotype]].

Having seen students struggle to master the complexities of symbol-based shorthand systems and stenotype theory, Dearborn decided to design a system that would be easier to learn.&lt;ref name="sheff1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheff|first1=Alexander|title=Speedwriting Shorthand, Century Edition, Book One|date=1951|publisher=Speedwriting Publishing Co. Inc.|location=New York|page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early edition of her system was called "The Steno Short-Type System"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worldcat search result|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/steno-short-type-system/oclc/752547937?referer=br&amp;ht=edition|website=Worldcat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dearborn organized a corporation in 1924 and [[rebranding|rebranded]] her shorthand system under the name of Speedwriting. Starting with just $192 of capital, she used print advertising to turn her textbooks and classes into a thriving international company&lt;ref name="brett" /&gt; with offices in England and Canada. Dearborn's company offered correspondence courses to individuals while [[vocational school]]s around the country paid an annual [[franchising|franchise]] fee for the right to teach Speedwriting classes within a specified territory.

In addition to the extensive use of newspaper and magazine ads, Speedwriting gained publicity from a few unsolicitied endorsements. Commander [[Richard E. Byrd]] commissioned Dearborn to teach her shorthand system to some members of his upcoming polar expedition.&lt;ref name="brett" /&gt; [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]] cited Dearborn as an example of women making great contributions to the business world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modern Woman a Radical in Business...|journal=Greenfield (Indiana) Daily Reporter|date=March 22, 1927|page=2|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/101148049|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 the [[Works Progress Administration]] sponsored free Speedwriting classes as part of its Emergency Education Program.

Dearborn committed suicide in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Eight Killed In Falls From N.Y. Windows|journal=Ottawa Evening Journal|date=July 30, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Speedwriting organization continued publishing her textbooks and making franchise deals with vocational schools through about 1950.

==Later versions==
The second version of Speedwriting, designed by John Sheff (July 21, 1898 – June 27, 1978) in the early 1950s, introduced some symbols that could not be produced on a typewriter such as arcs representing the letters 'm' and 'w'. This version modified a few of the abbreviating principles also. Changes implemented in the Sheff version include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speedwriting Shorthand, Self-Teaching Manual|date=1951|publisher=Speedwriting Pub. Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* vowels are included rather than omitted slightly more often; "cheap" is written as ''cep'' instead of ''cp''
* the word "the" is indicated by a dot rather than the letter t
* period at the end of the sentence is written as a large diagonal stroke \ rather than a dot
* past tense of a regular verb is indicated by a short horizontal stroke above the final letter of the root-word
* the -ing suffix is indicated by a short horizontal mark under the last letter of the outline rather than the letter g

A Spanish-language edition of the Sheff version was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheff|title=Speedwriting : taquigrafia a b c|date=1966|publisher=Instituto Speedwriting (Barcelona)|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1974 a variant of Speedwriting called Landmark Shorthand was taught in some American high schools and universities. Students generally enjoyed Landmark classes more than symbol-based shorthand because of the “immediate positive feedback… Within minutes, words, phrases and sentences are written readily.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harwood|first1=Frank|title=Some Alternatives to Traditional Shorthand|journal=Journal of Education for Business|date=1977|volume=52|issue=8|page=370|doi=10.1080/08832323.1977.10118312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Joe M. Pullis designed the third major version of Speedwriting which further modified the system's symbols and principles. Changes implemented in the Pullis version include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Speedwriting Shorthand, Regency Edition|date=1984|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill Educational Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the sound of 'k' is written with lowercase c
* the "ch" sound is written with uppercase C
* the "sh" sound is written with a modified lowercase cursive s, as in [[Forkner shorthand]]
* the past tense of regular verbs is indicated with a hyphen on the line of writing
* the period, question mark, and end of paragraph symbols are identical to those of [[Gregg shorthand]]
* the brief forms for ''it/at, the, is/his'' are also the same as in Gregg

==Ownership history==
Ownership of the Speedwriting trademark and the textbook copyrights changed hands several times. Dearborn's first corporation, formed in 1924, was called Brief English Systems.&lt;ref name="brett"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brett|first1=Henry Alderson|title=First the Public Then the Schools|journal=Business School Journal|date=1928|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16–17|doi=10.1080/23722800.1928.10771228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that was replaced by the Speedwriting Publishing Company which published textbooks under the name of its subsidiary, School of Speedwriting.&lt;ref name="openjurist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feener Business Schools v Speedwriting Pub. Co.|url=http://openjurist.org/249/f2d/609/feener-business-schools-v-speedwriting-publishing-company|website=OpenJurist|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s ITT had purchased School of Speedwriting. At various times Macmillan and McGraw-Hill owned the Speedwriting trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trademark Electronic Search System|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4804:p3ikrp.2.1|website=United States Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Brief English Systems v. Owen'' (1931)===

John P. Owen, a former Speedwriting student, published a book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owen|first1=John P.|title=Owen A-B-C Shorthand: the alphabetical system, designed for universal use|date=1926|publisher=Owen Pub. Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing a new shorthand system that was very similar to Speedwriting. Dearborn's organization sued him for copyright violation.

In 1931 the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that a particular textbook of shorthand could be copyrighted but the system itself is an invention or process rather than a literary work and cannot be copyrighted. “There is no literary merit in a mere system of condensing written words into less than the number of letters usually used to spell them out. Copyrightable material is found, if at all, in the explanation of how to do it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief English Systems v. Owen, 48 F.2d 555|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/48/555/1569115/|website=Justia|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technoscape''' is a term coined by [[Arjun Appadurai]] in order to describe one of the five dimensions of global cultural flows. The five dimensions consist of ethnoscapes, mediascapes, '''technoscapes''', financescapes, and ideoscapes. The suffix -scape denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "[[nation-states]], multinationals, [[Diaspora|diasporic]] communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Economy|date=1990|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son, Ltd|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be religious, political, or economic. In a more specific scope, Technoscape is the movement of technology (mechanical and informational) and the ability to move such technology at rapid speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lechner|first1=Frank|last2=Boli|first2=John|title=The Globalization Reader|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son, Ltd|location=Malden MA|isbn=978-1-118-73355-4|page=97|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the physical boundaries technology is able to maneuver around.

'''Terrycloth''', '''terry cloth''', '''terry cotton''', '''terry towelling''', '''terry''', or simply '''towelling''' is a [[textile|fabric]] with loops that can absorb large amounts of water. It can be manufactured by [[weaving]] or [[knitting]]. Towelling is woven on special looms that have two beams of longitudinal [[warp (weaving)|warp]] through which the filler or weft is fired laterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Bath-Towel.html|title=How bath towel is made - material, production process, making, history, used, composition, product, industry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Yilmaz|Powell|2005}} The first industrial production of terrycloth towels, in 1850,  was initiated by the English manufacturer [[Christy (towel manufacturer)|Christy]]. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the word may derive from French tiré "drawn," past participle of tirer "draw out".

There are two types of terry fabrics:
; Towel terry: This is a woven fabric with long loops that can absorb large amounts of water. Its content is usually 100% cotton, but may sometimes contain polyester.
; French terry: This is a fabric, used in men's, women's and children's clothes. One of its sides is flat, while the other side is with cross loops. It can be 100% cotton or be made from a variety of fibres, sometimes with [[spandex]] (also known as elastane or lycra). It is often [[warp knitting|warp knitted]], and the term French Terry is colloquially used for all warp knitted Terry.&lt;!-- ref needed for both these terms that seem to come from a making-up perspective that is not universal --&gt;

It is the length of loops that determines how much fluid is absorbed by the cloth as longer loops provide more surface area to absorb and come in contact with the fluid.

Items that may be made from terrycloth include babies' reusable nappies (UK English) or [[diaper]]s (US English), [[towel]]s, [[bathrobe]]s, [[bedding|bedlinen]], and sweatbands for the [[wristband|wrist]] or [[headband|head]]. Terrycloth is also sometimes used to make sweat jackets. Terry towelling hats with a shallow brim were once popular with [[cricket]]ers (like [[England|English]] [[wicketkeeper]] [[Jack Russell (cricketer, born 1963)|Jack Russell]]), but are no longer in fashion.

An alternative fabric used for towels is [[waffle fabric]]. A modern synthetic alternative is [[microfiber]].

'''''The Battle of San Romano''''' is a set of three paintings by the [[Florence|Florentine]] painter [[Paolo Uccello]] depicting events that took place at the [[Battle of San Romano]] between Florentine and Sienese forces in 1432. They are significant as revealing the development of [[linear perspective]] in early [[Italian Renaissance painting]], and are unusual as a major secular commission. The paintings are in [[egg tempera]] on wooden panels, each over 3 metres long. According to the [[National Gallery]], London,&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paolo-uccello-the-battle-of-san-romano Paolo Uccello ''The Battle of San Romano'' NG583]&lt;/ref&gt; the panels were commissioned by a member of the [[Palazzo Bartolini Salimbeni|Bartolini Salimbeni family]] in Florence sometime between 1435 and 1460. The paintings were much admired in the 15th century; [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] so coveted them that he purchased one and had the remaining two forcibly removed to the [[Palazzo Medici]]. They are now divided between three collections, the National Gallery, the [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], Florence, and the [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.

The three paintings are:

File:Uccello Battle of San Romano Uffizi.jpg|'''''Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino unseats Bernardino della Ciarda at the Battle of San Romano''''' (dating uncertain, {{circa|1435–1455}}),  tempera on wood, 182 × 320&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], Florence
File:Paolo Uccello 016.jpg|'''''The Counterattack of [[Micheletto Attendolo|Michelotto da Cotignola]] at the Battle of San Romano''''' ({{circa|1455}}), wood panel, 182 × 317&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Uffizi panel was probably designed to be the central painting of the [[triptych]] and is the only one signed by the artist.  The sequence most widely agreed among art historians is: London, Uffizi, Louvre, although others have been proposed.  They may represent different times of day: dawn (London), mid-day (Florence) and dusk (Paris) – the battle lasted eight hours. 

In the London painting, Niccolò da Tolentino, with his large gold and red patterned hat, is seen leading the Florentine cavalry. He had a reputation for recklessness, and doesn't even wear a helmet, though he sent two messengers (the departure of the two messengers, depicted centre, top) to tell his allied army of Attendolo to hurry to his aid as he is facing a superior force.&lt;ref&gt;Private Life of a Masterpiece, BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground, broken lances and a dead soldier are carefully aligned into orthogonals, so as to create an impression of perspective. Similar to that of a tapestry, the landscape rises up in a picture plane as opposed to receding deeply into space. This illusion of a backdrop and a perspective theme resembling a stage, depicts the war as a theatrical ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Janson's History of Art" The Western Tradition Eighth Edition|last=Davis, Denny, Hofrichter, Jacobs, Roberts, Simon|first=|publisher=Laurence King Publishing LTD|year=2011|isbn=9780205685172|location=London|pages=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three paintings were designed to be hung high on three different walls of a room, and the perspective designed with that height in mind, which accounts for many apparent anomalies in the perspective when seen in photos or at normal gallery height.

Many areas of the paintings were covered with gold and silver leaf. While the gold leaf, such as that found on the decorations of the bridles, has remained bright, the silver leaf, found particularly on the armour of the soldiers, has oxidized to a dull grey or black.  The original impression of the burnished silver would have been dazzling.  All of the paintings, especially that in the Louvre, have suffered from time and early restoration, and many areas have lost their modelling.&lt;ref name="DG"/&gt;

The panels were a subject in the BBC series ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'', 2005.

==References in popular culture==
The dark horse in the Louvre panel, mounted by Micheletto Attendolo, can be seen painted in a tapestry, in the first segment ("Metzengerstein") of the 1968 omnibus film ''[[Spirits of the Dead]]''.
In the 4th Episode (Lucrezia's Wedding) of the 2011 TV Series ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]'', the London and Louvre panel is shown adorning the dining hall walls of the Florentine Prince when cardinal Della Rovere visits him in Florence.

[[File:Classique mille carac.JPG|thumb|Thousand Character Classic used as style dictionary : each character is given in different styles in each column&lt;br/&gt;Japanese book of 1756]]
The '''''Thousand Character Classic''''' ({{CJKV|t=千字文|s=千字文|p=Qiānzìwén}}), also known as the '''''Thousand Character Text''''', is a [[Chinese literature|Chinese]] poem that has been used as a primer for teaching [[Chinese characters]] to children from the sixth century onward. It contains exactly one thousand characters, each used only once, arranged into 250 lines of four characters apiece and grouped into four line rhyming stanzas to make it easy to memorize. It is sung in a way similar to children learning the Latin alphabet sing an "[[alphabet song]]." Along with the ''[[Three Character Classic]]'' and the ''[[Hundred Family Surnames]]'', it formed the basis of literacy training in traditional China.

The first line is ''Tian di xuan huang'' ({{zh|s=天地玄黄|t=天地玄黃|hp=Tiāndì xuán huáng|j=tin1 dei6 jyun4 wong4|links=no}}) ("Heaven and Earth Dark and Yellow") and the last line,  ''Yan zai hu ye'' ({{zh|c=焉哉乎也|hp=Yān zāi hū yě|j=yin1 zoi1 fu1 jaa5|links=no}}) explains the use of the grammatical particles "yan", "zai", "hu", and "ye". {{sfnp|Paar, ed.|1963|p=7, 36}}

==History==

There are several stories of the work's origin. One says that [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Liang Dynasty]] (r. 502–549) commissioned Zhou Xingsi ({{zh|s=周兴嗣|t=周興嗣|hp=Zhōu Xìngsì|links=no}}, 470–521) to compose this poem for his prince to practice [[calligraphy]]. Another says that the emperor commanded [[Wang Xizhi]], a noted calligrapher, to write out one thousand characters and give them to Zhou as a challenge to make into an ode. Another story is that the emperor commanded his princes and court officers to compose essays and ordered another minister to copy them on a thousand slips of paper, which became mixed and scrambled. Zhou was given the task of restoring these slips to their original order. He worked so intensely to finish doing so overnight that his hair turned completely white. 
{{sfnp|Paar, ed.|1963|p=3}}

The popularity of the book in the Tang dynasty is shown by the fact that there were some 32 copies found in the [[Dunhuang]] archaeological excavations. By the [[Song dynasty]], since all literate people could be assumed to have memorized the text, the order of its characters was used to put documents in sequence in the same way that alphabetical order is used in alphabetic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Wilkinson, Endymion  |first =  |year = 2012 |title = Chinese History: A New Manual |publisher = Harvard University Asia Center| location = Cambridge, MA |isbn = 9780674067158|ref = harv}}, pp. 295, 601&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist [[Kingdom of Qocho|Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho]] used the thousand character classic and the [[Qieyun]] and it was written that "In Qocho city were more than fifty monasteries, all titles of which are granted by the emperors of the Tang dynasty, which keep many Buddhist texts as [[Tripitaka]], [[Tangyun]], [[Yupuan]], [[Jingyin]] etc."&lt;ref name="Yakup2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdurishid Yakup|title=The Turfan Dialect of Uyghur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk12I01qTPUC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=Turfan+chinese+speaking&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ihYwVKzzJpD8sATb_IDgDg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Turfan%20chinese%20speaking&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05233-7|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the dynasties following the Song, the ''[[Three Character Classic]]'', the ''[[Hundred Family Surnames]]'', and ''1,000 Character Classic'',  came to be known as ''San Bai Qian'' (Three, Hundred, Thousand), from the first character in their titles.  They were the almost universal introductory literacy texts for students, almost exclusively boys, from elite backgrounds and even for a number of ordinary villagers.  Each was available in many versions, printed cheaply, and available to all since they did not become superseded. When a student had memorized all three, he could recognize and pronounce, though not necessarily write or understand the meaning of, roughly 2,000 characters (there was some duplication among the texts). Since Chinese did not use an alphabet, this was an effective, though time consuming, way of giving a "crash course" in character recognition before going on to understanding texts and writing characters.
{{sfnp|Rawski|1979|pp.= 46-48}}

==Japan==
[[Wani (scholar)|Wani]], a semi-legendary Chinese-Baekje scholar,&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia Nipponica]] {{lang|ja|[http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%8E%8B%E4%BB%81/ "王仁は高句麗（こうくり）に滅ぼされた楽浪（らくろう）郡の漢人系統の学者らしく、朝廷の文筆に従事した西文首（かわちのふみのおびと）の祖とされている。"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is said to have transmitted the ''Thousand Character Classic'' to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] along with 10 books of the ''[[Analects|Analects of Confucius]]'' during the reign of [[Emperor Ōjin]] (r. 370?-410?). However, this alleged event precedes the composition of the ''Thousand Character Classic''. This makes many assume that the event is simply fiction, but some{{who|date=May 2011}} believe it to be based in fact, perhaps using a different version of the ''Thousand Character Classic''.

==Korea==
The ''Thousand Character Classic'' has been used as a [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] for learning Chinese characters for many centuries. It is uncertain when the ''Thousand Character Classic'' was introduced to Korea.

The book is noted as a principal force—along with the introduction of [[Buddhism]] into [[Korea]]—behind the introduction of Chinese characters into the Korean language. [[Hanja]] was the sole means of writing Korean until the [[Hangul]] script was created under the direction of [[Sejong the Great|King Sejong the Great]] in the 15th century; however, even after the invention of Hangul, most Korean scholars continued to write in Hanja until the late 20th century.

The ''Thousand Character Classic's'' use as a writing primer for children began in 1583, when [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]] ordered [[Han Seok-bong|Han Ho]] (1544–1605) to carve the text into wooden printing blocks.

Forty-four legends from ''{{transl|ko|Cheon}}'' (heaven) to ''{{transl|ko|Su}}'' (water) among ''Thousand Character Classic'' were inscribed one by one on the reverse of ''{{transl|ko|Sangpyung Tongbo}}'' (a [[Joseon Dynasty]] Korean coin).

The ''Thousand Character Classic'' has its own form in representing the Chinese characters. For each character, the text shows its [[Hanja#Meaning and Sound|meaning]] ([[Korean language|Korean]] [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko|訓}}; ''{{transl|ko|saegim}}'' or ''{{transl|ko|hun}}'') and [[Hanja#Meaning and Sound|sound]] (Korean Hanja: {{lang|ko|音}}; ''{{transl|ko|eum}}''). The vocabulary to represent the ''{{transl|ko|saegim}}'' has remained unchanged in every edition, despite the natural evolution of the Korean language since then. However, in the editions ''Gwangju Thousand Character Classic'' and ''Seokbong Thousand Character Classic'', both written in the 16th century, there are a number of different meanings expressed for the same character. The types of changes of ''{{transl|ko|saegims}}'' in ''Seokbong Thousand Character Classic'' into those in ''Gwangju Thousand Character Classic'' fall roughly under the following categories:

#Definitions turned more generalized or more concrete when semantic scope of each character had been changed
#Former definitions were replaced by synonyms
#Parts of speech in the definitions were changed

From these changes, replacements between native Korean and [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] can be found. Generally, "rare ''{{transl|ko|saegim}}'' vocabularies" are presumed to be pre-16th century, for it is thought that they may be a fossilized form of native Korean vocabulary or affected by the influence of a [[Dialects of Korean|regional dialect]] in [[Jeolla]] Province.

South Korean senior scholar, Daesan Kim Seok-jin (Korean [[Hangul]]: {{lang|ko|대산 김석진}}), expressed the significance of Thousand Character Classic by contrasting the Western ''concrete science'' and the Asian ''metaphysics'' and ''origin-oriented thinking'' in which "it is the collected poems of nature of cosmos and reasons behind human life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = In-u (인우) | last = Lee (이) |author2=Kang Jae-hun (강재훈) |script-title=ko:[이사람] "천자문이 한문 입문서? 우주 이치 담은 책" | date = 2012-01-03 | url = http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/513193.html | work = The Hankyoreh | accessdate = 2012-01-03 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manchu texts==
Several different [[Manchu language|Manchu]] texts of the ''Thousand Character Classic'' are known today. They all use the [[Manchu script]] to transcribe Chinese characters. They are utilized in research on Chinese phonology.

The ''Man han ciyan dzi wen''&lt;!-- This is Manchu. --&gt; ({{zh|s=满汉千字文|t=滿漢千字文|hp=Mǎn hàn qiān zì wén|j=mun5 hon3 cin1 zi6 man4|links=no}}) written by Chen Qiliang ({{zh|s=沉启亮|t=沈啓亮|hp=Chénqǐliàng|j=cam4 kai2 loeng6|links=no}}), contains Chinese text and Manchu phonetic transcription. This version was published during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{transl|ja|Ikegami Jirō}} ({{lang|ja|池上二郎}}): Manchu Materials in European Libraries ({{transl|ja|''Yōroppa ni aru Manshūgo bunken ni tsuite''}}; {{lang|ja|ヨーロッパにある満洲語文献について}}), Researches on the Manchu Language ({{lang|ja|満洲語研究}}; {{transl|ja|Manshūgo Kenkyū}}), pp.361–363, Publish date: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another text, the ''Qing Shu Qian Zi Wen'' ({{zh|s=清书千字文|t=清書千字文|hp=Qīngshū qiān zì wén|j=cing1 syu1 cin1 zi6 man4|links=no}}) by You Zhen ({{zh|c=尤珍|hp=Yóu Zhēn|j=jau4 zan1|links=no}}), was published in 1685 as a supplement to the ''Baiti Qing Wen'' ({{zh|s=百体清文|t=百體清文|hp=Bǎi tǐ qīngwén|j=baak3 tai2 cing1 man4|links=no}}). It provides Manchu transcription without original Chinese. It is known for being referred to by Japanese scholar [[Ogyū Sorai]] for Manchu studies as early as the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kanda Nobuo 神田信夫: ''Ogyū Sorai no "Manbunkō"'' to "Shinsho Senjimon" 荻生徂徠の『満文考』と「清書千字文」 (On Ogyū Sorai's "Studies of Written Manchu" and "The Manchu Thousand-Character Classic"), Shinchōshi Ronkō 清朝史論考 (Studies on Qing-Manchu History: Selected Articles), pp. 418-431頁, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The undated ''ciyan dzi wen''&lt;!-- This is Manchu. --&gt; which is owned by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] is a variant of the ''Qing Shu Qian Zi Wen''. It is believed to have been used by the translation office of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] of Korea. It contains Hangul transcription for both Manchu and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Kishida Fumitaka {{lang|ja|岸田文隆}}: On Ciyan dzi wen/Ch'ien-tzu-wen ({{lang|ja|千字文}}) in Bibliothèque Nationale (I) ({{lang|ja|パリ国民図書館所蔵の満漢「千字文」について}} (I); ''{{transl|ja|Pari Kokumin Toshokan shozō no Mankan "Senjimon" ni tsuite (I)}}''), ''Journal of the Faculty of Humanities'' Toyama University ({{lang|ja|富山大学人文学部紀要}}; {{transl|ja|Toyama Daigaku Jinbungakubu Kiyō}}) No.21, pp.77-133, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; It is valuable to the study of Manchu phonology.

The oral tradition of the [[Vedas]] ([[Śrauta]]) consists of several '''pathas''', "recitations" or ways of chanting the Vedic [[mantra]]s. Such traditions of '''Vedic chant''' are often considered the oldest unbroken [[oral tradition]] in existence, the fixation of the Vedic texts ([[samhita]]s) as preserved dating to roughly the time of [[Homer]] (early [[Iron Age]]).&lt;ref name = "Scharfe"&gt;Scharfe, Ch. 13: "Memorising the Veda", p. 240 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] proclaimed the tradition of Vedic chant a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] on November 7, 2003. Wayne Howard noted in the preface of his book, ''Veda Recitation in Varanasi'', "The four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva) are not 'books' in the usual sense, though within the past hundred years each veda has appeared in several printed editions. They are comprised rather of tonally accented verses and hypnotic, abstruse melodies whose proper realizations demand oral instead of visual transmission. They are robbed of their essence when transferred to paper, for without the human element the innumerable nuances and fine intonations – inseparable and necessary components of all four compilations – are lost completely. The ultimate authority in Vedic matters is never the printed page but rather the few members&amp;nbsp;... who are today keeping the centuries-old traditions alive."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tones==
Vedic chantings use 4 tones - ''Udatta'' उदात्त(middle tone), ''Anudaatta'' अनुदात्त (lower tone), ''Svarita'' स्वरित (higher tone) and ''Deergha Svarita'' दीर्घस्वरित (High tone extended). These are usually marked with intuitive ''svara marks'' - an underline for lower tone, a small vertical line above the letter for a higher tone and two vertical lines for Deergha Svarita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saraswati |first1=Swamini Svatmabodhananda |title=Rules of chanting - Sanskrit grammar series 2 |date=1 July 2014 |location=Bangalore |url=http://arshadrishti.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rules-of-Chanting-in-Samskritam.pdf |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathas==
{{Hindu scriptures}}
The various pathas or recitation styles are designed to allow the complete and perfect memorization of the text and its pronunciation, including the [[Vedic accent|Vedic pitch accent]]. Eleven such ways of reciting the Vedas were designed - Samhita, Pada, Krama, Jata, Maalaa, Sikha, Rekha, Dhwaja, Danda, Rathaa, Ghana, of which Ghana is usually considered the most difficult.&lt;ref name="page112"&gt;Krishnananda, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The students are first taught to memorize the Vedas using simpler methods like continuous recitation (samhita patha), word by word recitation (pada patha) in which compounds (sandhi) are dissolved and krama patha (words are arranged in the pattern of ab bc cd&amp;nbsp;...); before teaching them the eight complex recitation styles.&lt;ref&gt;Scharfe, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''pathin'' is a scholar  who has mastered the pathas. Thus, a ''ghanapaathin'' has learnt the chanting of the scripture up to the advanced stage of ''ghana''. The Ghanapatha or the "Bell" mode of chanting is so called because the words are repeated back and forth in a bell shape. The sonority natural to Vedic chanting is enhanced in Ghana. In Jatapatha, the words are braided together, so to speak, and recited back and forth.&lt;ref name="page68"&gt;Ramaswami, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The samhita, pada and krama pathas can be described as the natural recitation styles or prakrutipathas. The remaining 8 modes of chanting are classified as complex recitation styles or Vikrutipathas as they involve reversing of the word order. The backward chanting of words does not alter the meanings in the Vedic (Sanskrit) language.&lt;ref name="page68"/&gt;

==Oral transmission==

Prodigious energy was expended by ancient Indian culture in ensuring that these texts were transmitted from generation to generation with inordinate fidelity.&lt;ref name = "Scharfe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staal, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of recitation or ''pathas'' were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the ''[[Veda]]s'' and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139/&gt;
* ''Samhita-patha'': continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* ''Pada-patha'': a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* ''Krama-patha'': a step-by-step recitation where euphonically-combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn "word1 word2 word3 word4&amp;nbsp;...", would be recited as "word1word2 word2word3 word3word4&amp;nbsp;..."; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakalya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* ''Krama-patha'' modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* ''{{IAST|Jata-pāṭha}}'', ''{{IAST|dhvaja-pāṭha}}'' and ''{{IAST|ghana-pāṭha}}'' are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed the most perfect canon not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound.&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Annette and Moebus, Oliver. Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism (Religion and Society). De Gruyter (February 1, 2007). P. 495. {{ISBN|3-11-018159-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the ''[[Rigveda|{{IAST|Ṛgveda}}]]'' ([[circa|ca.]] 1500 BCE).&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat|editor=Karine Chemla|title=History of Science, History of Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9w13rSxWcsC|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-2321-7|pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine sound==
The insistence on preserving pronunciation and accent as accurately as possible is related to the belief that the potency of the mantras lies in their sound when pronounced. The [[shakha]]s thus have the purpose of preserving knowledge of uttering divine sound originally cognized by the [[rishi]]s.

Portions of the [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] literature elucidate the use of sound as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] tool. They assert that the entire cosmic creation began with sound: "By His utterance came the universe." ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 1.2.4). The [[Vedanta]]-sutras add that ultimate [[liberty|liberation]] comes from sound as well (anavrittih shabdat).

[[Katyayana]] likens speech to the supreme [[Brahman]]. He uses the [[Rigvedic]] verse — "Four are its horns, three its feet, two its heads, and seven its hands, roars loudly the threefold-bound bull, the great god enters mortals" (Rig-Veda, iv. 58, 3), to assert this claim. Katyayana explains that in the verse, the "four horns" are the four kinds of words i.e. nouns, verbs, prepositions, and particles; its "three feet" mean the three tenses, past, present and future; the "two heads" imply the eternal and temporary words, distinguished as the "manifested" and the "manifester"; its "seven hands" are the seven case affixes; "threefold bound" is enclosed in the three organs the chest, the throat, and the head; the metaphor "bull" (vrishabha) is used to imply that it gives fruit when used with knowledge; "loudly roars" signifies uttering sound, speech or language; and in "the great god enters mortals" entails that the "great god" speech, enters the mortals.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, primal sound is often referred to as ''Shabda Brahman'' or "word as [[Absolute (philosophy)|The Absolute]]". [[Maitri Upanishad]] states: {{quote|He who is well versed in the Word-Brahman, attains to the Supreme Brahman. (VI.22)&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Mantras]], or sacred sounds, are used to pierce through sensual, [[mind|mental]] and [[intellectual]] levels of existence (all lower strata of consciousness) for the purpose of [[Ritual purification|purification]] and spiritual enlightenment.  "By sound vibration one becomes liberated" (Vedanta-sutra 4.22).

The '''Xicolatada''' is a traditional [[festival]] celebrated in the village of [[Palau-de-Cerdagne]] in [[Languedoc-Roussillon]].  It is celebrated yearly on 16 August, and has been for over 300 years.

In [[Catalonia]], 15 August was once a festival day, and the locals would drink quite a bit, to the point that they felt a bit ill the following morning.  To help them feel better, the village [[chocolatier]] would offer them a [[hot chocolate]], which he claimed was an excellent remedy.  Over the years, this habit grew into a custom, and eventually a municipal association was formed to remember the tradition and to organise the distribution of hot chocolate every year on 16 August, at precisely 11 in the morning. Today, the chocolate is brewed in large [[cauldron]]s over a wood fire.  In 2007, 800 litres were consumed by 3000 people, many of whom were visitors; the festival draws many tourists to the village every year. To preserve the tradition, festival organisers have created a sort of confraternity called the ''Mestres xicolaters'', or "master chocolatiers", who keep the recipes for the chocolate secret; the organisation also handles scheduling, which it does not reveal in advance.
