An '''adda''' ({{lang-bn|আড্ডা}}) is a form of intellectual exchange among members, who were originally of the same socio-economic strata, but the process has democratized in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/travel/tmagazine/the-chattering-masses.html?_r=0 The Chattering Masses] ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is most popular among the youths belonging to the so-called "middle-class intelligentsia". Although many [[Kolkata]]ns boast of the city being the birthplace of adda culture, [[Satyajit Ray]] (in his film [[Agantuk]]) traces back the origin of the tradition to regular intellectual dialogues prevalent in [[Ancient Greece]] at the time of [[Socrates]] or [[Plato]]. Adda is a prominent leisurely activity in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].

''Adda'' was incorporated into the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2004.

The Indian adda has shades of meaning attached to different languages:

*In [[Hindi]], adda is a [[noun]], with the nominal form of the word meaning the location or nest of a group or community, usually shady people. The etymology can be traced to the original meaning of the word, which means the "perching spot or perch for birds".
*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], adda is both a standalone noun and a noun in a noun - [[verb]] compound. The [[nominalization]] of the word has two senses - one being the Hindi sense, and the other being the place of ritual meeting and/or conversation of a group of people (i.e., a symposium or the 'Central Perk'). The [[verb]] form means informal conversation among a group of people, often for hours at an end, and usually accompanied by food. The Bengali institution of the adda has also been the subject of recent scholarly attempts to reconstruct alternative histories of modernity in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newschool.edu/gf/publicculture/backissues/pc27/05-ChakraX.html "Adda" on Newschool.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051118215052/http://www.newschool.edu/gf/publicculture/backissues/pc27/05-ChakraX.html |date=November 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2011 in film|2011]], filmmakers [[Surjo Deb]] and [[Ranjan Palit]] made a documentary on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psbt.org/screening/movie_review/432|title=Public Service Broadcasting Trust|website=www.psbt.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, ''[[Adda: Calcutta, Kolkata]]'' has been screened at several festivals around the globe and won the [[Golden Palm Award]] at the [[Mexico International Film Festival]] 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Deb|first=Surjo|title=Adda: Calcutta, Kolkata|date=2012-06-02|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381081/|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdi.org/event/adda-calcuttakolkata/|title=Upcoming Events {{!}} Adda: Calcutta/Kolkata {{!}} 3rd i|website=www.thirdi.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mexicofilmfestival.com:80/Festival_2007/past_winners/2012_GoldWinners.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427215442/http://www.mexicofilmfestival.com/Festival_2007/past_winners/2012_GoldWinners.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-27 |title=Mexico International Film Festival {{!}} 2012 Golden Palm Winners |date=2012-04-27 |access-date=2016-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film drew parallels with the [[French salon culture]] at the turn of the 20th century and used the phenomenon of adda to create a city symphony film on Calcutta, exploring various [[subcultures]] of the bustling yet laid-back metropolis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">The '''American Musicological Society''' is a membership-based [[musicology|musicological]] organization founded in 1934 to advance scholarly research in the various fields of music as a branch of learning and scholarship. It grew out of a small contingent of the [[Music Teachers National Association]] and, more directly, the New York Musicological Society (1930–1934). Its founders were George S. Dickinson, [[Carl Engel]], [[Gustave Reese]], [[Helen Heffron Roberts]], [[Joseph Schillinger]], [[Charles Seeger]], [[Harold Spivacke]], [[Oliver Strunk]], and [[Joseph Yasser]]. Its first president was [[Otto Kinkeldey]], the first American to receive an appointment as professor of musicology ([[Cornell University]], 1930).

''Talk of Love: How Culture Matters'' (2001) attempts to describe the reality of love in relationships amid the idealized and romanticized "talk of love" within American culture.

'''''Anything That Moves''''' was a literary, journalistic, and topical magazine published in the [[United States]] from 1990 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Gary W.|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|date=January 2003|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=243–252|doi=10.1023/A:1023906620085|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l411067qmx8016tq/|title=Oppression and Discrimination among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered People and Communities}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created as an expansion of the [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area Bisexual Network]] (BABN) newsletter by BABN member, Karla Rossi, in collaboration with bisexual and bi-friendly editors, writers, and artists to become a full 64-page magazine with an international subscriber base. The complete title of the magazine, ''Anything That Moves: Beyond the Myths of Bisexuality'', was purposely chosen for its controversial nature, while its tag line indicated a clear intent to challenge stereotypes of bisexual identities and behaviors. The magazine took its name from the [[stereotype]] depicting bisexuals as willing to have sex with "anything that moves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Israel|first=Tania|author2=Mohr, Jonathan J.|title=Attitudes Toward Bisexual Women and Men|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|date=July 2004|volume=4|issue=1–2|pages=117–134|doi=10.1300/J159v04n01_09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's mission was to confront and redefine concepts of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender]], to defy stereotypes and broad definitions of bisexuals and to combat [[biphobia]].

Most of the issues were theme-based, designed to cohesively present the vast array of diverse bisexual voices and experiences across the lines of gender, class, race, ethnicity, spirituality, lifestyle, age, politics, culture, and sexual behaviors, desires, and preferences. Special care was taken to include a wide variety of perspectives, from straight-identified to queer-identified bisexuals, while inclusion did not require the declaration of an identity or label to indicate where one fell along the spectrum of ways to be bisexual.
Changes in managing editors at the helm precipitated changes in the magazine’s tag line that were made to reflect the evolving, exploratory, and creative nature of its subject matter and content.

'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts ([[artworks]]), expressing the author's [[imagination|imaginative]], [[Concept|conceptual]] [[idea]], or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art |title=Art: definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art |title=art |publisher=Merriam-Websters Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. 

The three classical branches of art are [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=q8rvdsxGokwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vasari+lives+of+painters,+sculptors+and+painters&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTta2zrLreAhUGbBoKHdSoDUIQ6AEIKDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Music, theatre, film, dance, and other [[performing arts]], as well as literature and other media such as [[interactive media]], are included in a broader definition  of [[the arts]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art, n. 1". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com. (Accessed 26 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, ''art'' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [[craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or [[applied arts]].

Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Definitions of Art |author=Stephen Davies |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8014-9794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artworks: Definition, Meaning, Value |author=Robert Stecker |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-271-01596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theories of Art Today |editor=Noël Carroll |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-299-16354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |archive-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427192624/http://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |title=What Is Art? |author=Dr. Robert J.

==Creative art and fine art==

In the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

Over time, [[Philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73-96&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40-72&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name="Levinson5"&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], "Cézanne's Doubt" in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the [[art world]]" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."&lt;ref&gt;Shiner 2003. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art may be characterized in terms of [[mimesis]] (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |website=The Gombrich Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75-115 pp.132-141, pp.147-155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.86-89, pp.135-141, p.143, p.179, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name="Nichols2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tugra Mahmuds II.gif|right|thumb|The stylized signature of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in [[Islamic calligraphy]]. It reads "Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid is forever victorious".]]
[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques. Dated in its present state from the 9th century, it is the ancestor and model of all the mosques in the western Islamic lands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IaM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=oleg+grabar+kairouan+mosque&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=oleg%20grabar%20kairouan%20mosque&amp;f=false John Stothoff Badeau and John Richard Hayes, ''The Genius of Arab civilization: source of Renaissance''. Taylor &amp; Francis. 1983. p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.&lt;ref name="Watson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Watson|title=The Arts of China 900-1620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-v5jUKaCxYC|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.155, p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer,&lt;ref name="Moore2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Moore|title=Propaganda Prints: A History of Art in the Service of Social and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0KAlsQ2Yj4C|date=6 August 2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0591-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.394-395, pp.519-527, pp. 573-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Enlightenment An Anthology Prepared for the Enlightenment Book Club|url=http://www.rosenfels.org/The_Age_Of_Enlightenment_Anthology.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|pages=1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=New York Times Company|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.&lt;ref name="Sangeeta2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]], a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which "that which is" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==
[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]]'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] (French, 1806), oil on canvas]]
{{Main|The arts}}
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as [[List of art mediums|media]], genre, [[Art movement|styles]], and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walton |first1=Kendall L. |title=Categories of Art |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 1970 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=334–67 |doi=10.2307/2183933 |jstor=2183933}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Art form''''' refers to the [[elements of art]] that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., [[figurae]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monelle |first1=Raymond |title=Linguistics and Semiotics in Music |date=3 January 1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-3718652099 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMtQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;pg=PA202#q=figurae |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Color theory|color]], [[Contour drawing|contour]], [[Fourth dimension in art|dimension]], [[List of art mediums|medium]], [[melody]], [[Negative space|space]], [[Texture (painting)|texture]], and [[Lightness|value]]. Form may also include [[Visual design elements and principles#Principles of design|visual design principles]], such as arrangement, [[Formal balance|balance]], [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], [[harmony]], [[Hierarchical proportion|proportion]], [[Principles of grouping|proximity]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Belton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belton |first1=Dr. Robert J. |title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook |chapter=The Elements of Art |date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Extreme [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249–57 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s – while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Extreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831–46 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Finally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat Küçükarslan |last1=Emiroğlu |first2=Fitnat Cimşit |last2=Koş |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16–20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf "Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art"], ''Signs – International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp. 1–28, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oc-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=July 1872|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.&lt;ref name="NewtonNeil1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Newton|author2=William Neil|title=2000 Years of Christian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSfAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency,&lt;ref name="RichardsGjertson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirk Richards|author2=Stephen Gjertson|title=For glory and for beauty: practical perspectives on Christianity and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaBGAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Classical Realism|isbn=978-0-9636180-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.&lt;ref name="Leslie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Leslie|title=Pablo Picasso: A Modern Master|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE8Es-9j3e0C|date=30 December 2005|publisher=New Line Books|isbn=978-1-59764-094-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DillenbergerHandley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Dillenberger|author2=John Handley|title=The Religious Art of Pablo Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uglDQAAQBAJ|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27629-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MonaLisa sfumato.jpeg|thumb|Detail of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', showing the painting technique of ''[[sfumato]]'']]
A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57364-7|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Luke|title=Damien Hirst's Shark: Nature, Capitalism and the Sublime|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/luke-white-damien-hirsts-shark-nature-capitalism-and-the-sublime-r1136828|publisher=Tate|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Belle Assemblée|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pucAAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|volume=V|year=1808|publisher=J.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;
# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. - Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. "The World as I See It". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. - Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. - Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephanidis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name="Resources2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as a "free zone"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as "a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# '''Art for social causes.''' Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of [[autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Trotter |first=Jeramia |title=RiverKings raising autism awareness with art |url=http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WMC tv |date=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053732/http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |archivedate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art exhibit aims to raise awareness of autism |url=http://www.newsminer.com/article_1a9b7e33-6ca0-56a5-89f3-c9c0798815a2.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Daily News-Miner |date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anchorage art exhibit to raise awareness about autism |url=http://dhss.alaska.gov/News/Documents/press/2011/Anchorage_art_exhibit_autism_PR033111.pdf |publisher=Alaska Department of Health and Social Services |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruhl |first=Ashleigh |title=Photographer Seeks Subjects To Help Raise Cancer Awareness |url=http://www.gazettes.com/lifestyle/arts_and_entertainment/photographer-seeks-subjects-to-help-raise-cancer-awareness/article_10291db8-7614-11e2-be53-0019bb2963f4.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Gazettes |date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bra art raising awareness for breast cancer |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/videos/news/national/bra-art-raising-awareness-for-breast-cancer/vgBSm/ |accessdate=22 January 2015 |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=Marella |title=October art walk aims to raise money, awareness for breast cancer |url=http://gargoyle.flagler.edu/2007/10/october-art-walk-aims-to-raise-money-awareness-for-breast-cancer/ |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Flagler College Gargoyle |date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Students get creative in the fight against human trafficking |url=http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness#.USb6vFeIqAg |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WDTN Channel 2 News |date=26 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630141018/http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness%23.UdA8P33LfK5 |archivedate=June 30, 2013}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking to raise awareness at ArtPrize |url=http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WWMT, Newschannel 3 |date=10 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006075346/http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SciCafe – Art/Sci Collision: Raising Ocean Conservation Awareness |url=http://www.amnh.org/calendar/scicafe-art-sci-collision-raising-ocean-conservation-awareness |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights in [[Darfur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SMU students raise awareness with 'Art for Darfur' |url=http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |accessdate=21 February 2003 |newspaper=SMU News Release |date=4 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403085335/http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |archivedate=3 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; murdered and missing Aboriginal women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Donnelly |first=Greg |title=Red dress art project to raise awareness of murdered and missing Aboriginal women |url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/red+dress+art+project+to+raise+awareness+of+murdered+and+missing+aboriginal+women/6442594504/story.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Global Edmonton |date=3 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; elder abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raising elder abuse awareness through intergenerational art |url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |publisher=Human Resources and Skills Development Canada |accessdate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122162638/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathema |first=Paavan |title=Trash to treasure: Turning Mt.

# '''Art for psychological and healing purposes.''' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name="Hogan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. "Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

==Public access==
[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|upright=2|thumb|left|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', later copied all over Europe.]]

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 161-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics of the Indigenous Peoples of South America: Studies of Production and Exchange using INAA|url=https://core.tdar.org/collection/58128/ceramics-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-studies-of-production-and-exchange-using-inaa|website=core.tdar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C|date=30 April 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[coin]]s were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Coins as Works of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34jbjgEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1960|publisher=Museum Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.&lt;ref name="Tucker2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hugo Tucker|title=Forms of the "medieval" in the "Renaissance": A Multidisciplinary Exploration of a Cultural Continuum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfbNzcqgYM4C|year=2000|publisher=Rookwood Press|isbn=978-1-886365-20-9|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony Griffiths|title=Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbxFOR8ujlYC|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20714-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.&lt;ref name="Waldie1839"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Waldie|title=The Select Circulating Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBs7AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1839|publisher=A. Waldie.|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="MeyerSavoy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Meyer|author2=Benedicte Savoy|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums 1750-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1 January 2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-029882-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.&lt;ref name="Fossi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Fossi|title=The Uffizi: The Official Guide : All of the Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYUh_6F-hc8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-88-09-01487-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpD9NgeQozEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04434-7|pages=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.&lt;ref name="Findlay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Findlay|title=The Value of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6jJ5FvdLjcC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Prestel Verlag|isbn=978-3-641-08342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 |id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', p. 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia |last=Fineman |title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. |date=21 March 2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ |work=Slate |pages= |accessdate=3 August 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name="McCue2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.&lt;ref name="RuprechtTaiana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvina Ruprecht|author2=Cecilia Taiana|title=Reordering of Culture: Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada in the Hood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onoI0AI-JJYC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 November 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-88629-269-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stout2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCiment2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chapman|author2=James Ciment|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47351-0|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Noah's Other Son: Bridging the Gap Between the Bible and the Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjbUAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 October 2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2996-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Modernism===
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872–1944)]]
The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref name="Harris2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan P. Harris|title=Writing Back to Modern Art: After Greenberg, Fried, and Clark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TzAIu3LziIC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-32429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kenneth Holt|title=The Search for Aesthetic Meaning in the Visual Arts: The Need for the Aesthetic Tradition in Contemporary Art Theory and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWedB7SA-KMC|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89789-773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.&lt;ref name="Gemünden1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerd Gemünden|title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mpfn_pue34C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08560-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BcnAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2004|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.&lt;ref name="BurgueteLam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Burguete|author2=Lui Lam|title=Arts: A Science Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKmND2ImrGUC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4324-93-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"===
Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name="Waugh2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colebrook1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.&lt;ref name="Roholt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiger C. Roholt|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6aAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3246-8|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darren Hudson Hick|title=Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_S4DgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-00691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==="Linguistic turn" and its debate===
The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, "Feasible Aesthetic Formalism", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit. Stieglitz used a backdrop of ''The Warriors'' by [[Marsden Hartley]] to photograph the urinal. The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Tomkins, p. 186"&gt;Tomkins, ''Duchamp: A Biography'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Solomon |title=2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=14 December 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-video-game-art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. ''Contemporary Art and the Home''. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm "Tribal Art"] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur.

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glancey |first1=Jonathan |title=Is advertising art? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/is-advertising-art-1593252.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal hollow log tomb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name="Potts2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=8 August 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name="AddisonBurgess2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=28 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FergusonMansbach2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philppine air (873989542).jpg|300px|thumbnail|Travellers stand in line for a flight to the Philippines carrying balikbayan boxes. ]]
A '''balikbayan box''' (literally "repatriate box") is a [[corrugated box]] containing items sent by [[overseas Filipino]]s (known as "[[balikbayan]]s"). Though often shipped by [[freight forwarder]]s specializing in balikbayan boxes by sea, such boxes can be brought by Filipinos returning to the [[Philippines]] by air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mandalit |last=del Barco |authorlink=Mandalit Del Barco |author= |coauthors= |title=Gift Boxes Help Migrant Filipinos Keep Ties to Home |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5066964 |format=radio |work=Morning Edition |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The balikbayan box arose around the 1980s in the [[United States]] brought about by the influx of [[overseas Filipino worker]]s in the country. The first [[freight forwarder]] to offer balikbayan box services was Rico Nunga who started REN International in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=LAT2018 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://renbalikbayan.wordpress.com/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=REN International |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Ramon Ungco, a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] residing in [[New York City]], founded Port Jersey Shipping International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portjerseyshipping.com/about_us |title=About Us |publisher=Port Jersey Shipping |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two companies are considered the pioneers of [[door-to-door]] delivery of balikbayan boxes, which back then were charged import duties upon arrival in the [[Philippines]].{{fact|date=April 2018}} 

On 30 June 1987, then [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] enacted Executive Order No. 206.&lt;ref name=LAT2018 /&gt;&lt;ref name=EO206&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1987/eo_206_1987.html |title=Executive Order No. 206 |work=Amending Section 105 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines |publisher=LawPhil.net |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This order amended Section 105 (f) and added a new subsection (f-1) to Republic Act No. 1937, also known as the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, which was signed into law on 22 July 1957 by former president [[Carlos P. Garcia]].&lt;ref name=RA1937&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ph/1957/06/22/republic-act-no-1937/ |title=Republic Act No. 1937 |work=An Act to Revise and Codify the Tariff and Customs Laws of the Philippines |publisher=Official Gazette of the Philippines |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amended Section 105 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines provides duty- and tax-free privileges to balikbayan boxes sent to the Philippines by [[overseas Filipinos|overseas Filipino workers]] (OFWs) as recognition of the magnitude of their contribution and sacrifices in foreign lands as well as bringing of a considerable amounts of foreign exchange annually that contributed to the national recovery effort at that time.&lt;ref name=EO206/&gt; This allowed tax-free entry of personal goods in the country from Filipinos overseas. People then began sending balikbayan boxes through friends and co-workers who were returning to the Philippines.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in the US and the passage of the [[Patriot Act]] by the [[US Congress]], balikbayan boxes have been subjected to rigorous inspections by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]'s Out-Bound Exam Team that caused massive delays of up to three weeks at the [[US Customs]] inspection facility. This extended shipping time from 21 days to 30 plus days. The inspections also resulted in opened balikbayan boxes and complaints of [[pilferage]] and mishandling. The [[Bureau of Customs (Philippines)|Bureau of Customs]] also conducts 100% inspections that added to the burden of delayed shipments. The inspections are the result of some unscrupulous individuals who use balikbayan boxes to smuggle commercial items without paying taxes or smuggle [[contraband]]. Since balikbayan box shipping is a consolidated shipment, even one illegal item will affect all 400 or so packages inside the container. The inspection process has been modernized with the installation of high performance X-ray machines.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

In 2012, these delays were further aggravated by the decision of the [[City of Manila]] to impose a truck ban along the route to and from the [[Port of Manila]], causing backlogs in releasing and transporting not only balikbayan boxes but all cargoes, domestic and international. Most balikbayan box companies, which are based in [[Parañaque City]] near the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|airport]], were heavily affected by the truck ban until it was resolved.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The industry was scrutinized by the Philippine Senate in 2015 after mounting complaints were brought to the attention of the public through social media after the Philippine Customs Commissioner Albert Lina announced the opening of balikbayan boxes for inspection and additional taxes to be imposed.{{fact|date=April 2018}} The inquiry brought the passage of the Customs Modernization Act, which had been pending for years, and the inclusion of the Balikbayan Box Law in the act, increasing the tax-exemption ceiling from PHP 500 to PHP 150,000. This included items being brought home by Filipino tourists from trips abroad, pasalubong or gifts, and returning resident shipments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sra.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/RA-10863_Customs-Tariff_Modernization_act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect consumers, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI), through its Philippine Shipper's Bureau, conducts regular accreditation of international freight forwarders and discourages consumers from patronizing unaccredited and incredibly cheap shipping companies.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

According to the Door to Door Consolidated Association of the Philippines, there are 400,000 balikbayan boxes that arrive in the Philippines every month.&lt;ref name=LAT2018&gt;{{cite news |last=Shyong |first=Frank |date=28 April 2018 |title=These boxes are a billion-dollar industry of homesickness for Filipinos overseas |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-balikbayan-boxes-20180428-htmlstory.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=28 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Balikbayan boxes may contain items the sender thinks the recipient would like, regardless of whether those items can be bought cheaply in the Philippines, such as non-perishable food, toiletries, household items, electronics, toys, designer clothing, or items difficult to find in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phuong |last=Ly |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Money Is Not Enough at Christmas |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A23376-2004Dec23 |format= |work=Washington Post |publisher= |id= |pages= |page=B05 |date=2004-12-24 |accessdate= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A balikbayan box intended for air travel is designed to conform to [[Luggage#Commercial airlines|airline luggage restrictions]] and many Filipino stores sell them.  Some boxes come with a cloth cover and side handles. Others are tightly secured with tape or rope, and thus not confused with an ordinary moving box that is lightly wrapped.

The balikbayan boxes come in three standard sizes:&lt;ref name=dimensionsinfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Balikbayan Box Dimensions|url=http://www.dimensionsinfo.com/balikbayan-box-dimensions/|work=Dimensions Info: Because Size Matters|publisher=Memebridge.com|accessdate=21 March 2013|quote=There are three types of balikbayan box, namely the medium box, the large or the regular box and the extra large box. The width and height of the medium box is 18 inches while the depth is 16 inches. The standard width of the large box has a width and depth of 18 inches while the height is 24 inches. The extra large box has a width of width and height of 24 inches while its depth is 18 inches.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Medium: 18 x 16 x 18 inches
* Large: 18 x 18 x 24 inches
* Extra large: 24 x 18 x 24 inches

Shipped boxes are delivered directly to the recipient, usually the family of the overseas Filipino.

==Cultural significance==
Part of the attraction of the balikbayan box is its economic value, as it allows cheaper bulk shipment of items versus sending each individually or in smaller boxes through postal services. The tradeoff though is longer transit time by [[container ship]], which typically requires several weeks, along with the lack of a firm delivery date. The balikbayan box is a modern manifestation of the general Philippine practice of ''[[pasalubong]]'', where travellers within or outside the country are culturally expected to bring home gifts to family, friends and colleagues.{{fact|date=April 2018}} the balikbayan box provides connections between family within the Philippines and those who are abroad, and provide goods for the family within the Philippines.&lt;ref name=LAT2018 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32380">'''The relationship between the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[English people|English]]''' is characterised largely by tolerance of people and [[culture]]s. Historically this has not always been the case, and elements of mutual mistrust or dislike and overt [[racism]] or [[xenophobia]] persist. Hatred or fear of the Welsh by the English has been termed "Cymrophobia",&lt;ref name=parker&gt;Mike Parker, ''Neighbours from Hell? – English attitudes to the Welsh'', 2007, {{ISBN|0-86243-611-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar attitudes towards the English by the Welsh, or others, are termed "[[Anglophobia]]". However, these expressions are not in general use, and expressions of anti-Welsh or anti-English sentiment tend to be more in jest than in earnest.

The relationship has developed historically from the origins of the two nations, and been shaped by the military, political, economic and cultural power exercised by the much more populous English over the Welsh for many centuries; the marked differences between the English and Welsh languages, both spoken and written; and the high degree of cultural importance attached by many in [[Wales]] to signifiers of national identity such as the [[Welsh language|language]], [[Welsh-language literature|literature]], [[History of Wales|history]], traditions, and the national sport of [[rugby union in Wales|rugby union]].

The [[Anglo-Saxon]] invasions of Britain led to the formation of Wales as a separate nation between the 5th and 7th centuries. The [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] kings of England had conquered Wales militarily by the 13th century, and under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the country was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of England]] by the Laws in Wales Acts in the 16th century. Many elements of the Welsh economy and society since then have been shaped by demands from England, and Wales has been described as "England's first colony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/6358375.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wales-England: Where is the love? | date=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Welsh identity remained strong, and recently there has been an increasing awareness and acknowledgement of Wales' cultural and historical separateness from England, which has [[Welsh Assembly Government|latterly been reflected politically]].

The Welsh language is in the [[Celtic languages|Celtic language group]], whereas English is in the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic group]]; consequently the English language is further from the Welsh language in both vocabulary and grammar than from a number of European languages, such as Dutch, for example. Comparatively few English people can understand or speak Welsh. Conversely, virtually all Welsh speakers can speak English.

==Historical background==
{{see also|History of Wales| History of England}}

=== Celt and Saxon ===
{{see also|Sub-Roman Britain}}
The native inhabitants of [[Roman Britain]] were regarded as [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] (''Britanni''), and spoke the [[Common Brittonic]] language, one of the [[Insular Celtic languages]] which evolved into [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] and [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the time the Roman legions left in the early 5th century, the Britons (Brythons) had started to come under attack and mass migrations of [[Angles]], [[Jutes]], [[Saxons]] and other [[Germanic peoples]] from the European mainland, who set up their own kingdoms and settled in what became [[England]].

The native Britons established independent kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]], and (under Irish influence) [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]] in the more mountainous and remote west. The [[Battle of Chester]] in 616, won by the Angles of Northumbria, contributed to the isolation of what became Wales. Around 730, the English historian [[Bede]] described the Britons as "for the most part, through innate hatred... adverse to the English nation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/bede/bl-bede-5-23.htm 23 - Book 5 - Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum - Bede&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  By that time, the Saxons had full control of [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]].  Mercia, in particular, came into conflict with Powys, and [[Offa's Dyke]] was built around 790 by the Mercian king [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] to create an effective barrier against incursions from the neighbouring Welsh kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpat.org.uk/offa/what.htm  "What is Offa's Dyke?", Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust]. Retrieved 10 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 11th century, if not earlier, Wales – with its own [[Welsh law|distinct legal system]], though only intermittently unified as a political entity – had developed a national identity as ''Cymru'', or "Land of the compatriots" (''[[Welsh people|Cymry]]''), in contrast to the ''Saeson'' or Saxons.  In England, the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon language]] had long supplanted the old Brythonic languages, and the English words "Wales" and "Welsh", meaning "foreigners", came to be used to describe the unconquered land to the west.

=== Anglo-Norman conquest ===
After [[William I of England|William of Normandy]]'s conquest of England in 1066, responsibility for keeping the Welsh under control was in the hands of [[Marcher Lords]] in the border areas. Gwynedd and Powys initially remained independent, but were gradually forced to recognise the technical overlordship of the kings of England. The writings of [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], setting out both positive and negative aspects of what he saw as the Welsh character, date from around this time. [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], building on the policy of his grandfather [[Llywelyn the Great]], had his title of [[Prince of Wales]] accepted by the English crown in 1267. Following [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s invasion in 1282, the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] legally annexed Llywelyn's [[Principality of Wales]] – but not the whole country – to the kingdom of England, and Welsh [[English longbow|longbowmen]] became one of the numerous groups of foreign mercenaries serving with the English army.  English settlers were sent to live in the newly created borough towns which developed in the shadow of Edward I's castles, particularly in the south and east.  Over the next few centuries, the English dominated these garrison towns, from which the native Welsh were officially excluded. The settlers called themselves "the English burgesses of the English boroughs of Wales" and proclaimed that the new towns had been raised "for the habitation of Englishmen", excluding "mere Welshmen" from their privileges on the grounds that they were "foreigners" in the implanted boroughs.&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Davies, ''The Age of Conquest [:] Wales 1063–1415'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 372–3. Quotations from contemporary documents.&lt;/ref&gt; As historian [[R. R. Davies]] notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nowhere was the spirit of conquest and of [[racial superiority]] so vigorously and selfishly kept alive as in the English boroughs. It was little wonder that they were the most consistent target of Welsh resentment throughout the fourteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Davies, ''The Age of Conquest [:] Wales 1063–1415'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They imposed an English legal system, and the Welsh were not allowed to hold office in the government or church.  [[Owain Glyndŵr]]'s rebellion in the early 15th century was the last armed rebellion of the Welsh against the English. Anti-Welsh riots were reported in Oxford and London, and Parliament imposed more repressive measures on Wales.&lt;ref name=parker /&gt;

=== The Tudors and the early modern period ===
In 1485, Henry Tudor, who was of Welsh descent, gained the English throne as King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], thanks largely to the support of the Welsh who hoped he was the [[Mab Darogan]] who would restore Britain to the [[Brythons]]. However, this led to the cementing of Wales into the English administrative and legal system under his son, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Laws in Wales Acts of 1535–1542]] annexed [[England and Wales|Wales to England]], abolished the Welsh legal system, and banned the [[Welsh language]] from any official role and status. It also allowed members representing Wales to be elected to Parliament for the first time, although these were often not Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://britannia.com/wales/whist9a.html GO BRITANNIA! Wales: Union with England&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The second of the Acts of Union (1542) established the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]] to deal with major misdemeanours in Wales: of the 217 judges who sat on its benches in its 288 years of existence, only 30 were Welshmen and it is unlikely that more than a handful of the latter – members of the higher gentry – actually spoke Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;A. O. H. Jarman, 'Cymru'n rhan o Loegr, 1485–1800', ''Seiliau Hanesyddol Cenedlaetholdeb Cymru'' (Cardiff, 1950), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, the Welsh language – which remained the language of the overwhelming majority of the Welsh – regained some of the ground it had lost.  There were translations of the full [[Bible]] into Welsh by 1600, and over the next two centuries there was a steady growth of education in the Welsh language, and the revival of traditions such as the [[eisteddfod]]. The attitude towards the Welsh language in England was generally hostile, however. A flood of anti-Welsh pamphlets were printed in the 17th century, such as ''Wallography'' by [[William Richards (clergyman)|William Richards]] (1682), which wishes the speedy demise of the Welsh language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The native gibberish is usually prattled throughout the whole of Taphydom except in their market towns, whose inhabitants being a little raised do begin to despise it. 'Tis usually cashiered out of gentlemen's houses ... so that (if the stars prove lucky) there may be some glimmering hopes that the [[Welsh language|British language]] may be quite extinct and may be Englished out of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;''Wallography'' (London, 1682): W. J. Hughes, ''Wales and the Welsh in English literature'' (Wrexham, 1924), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Distinct democratic and religious movements also began to develop in Wales.  However, [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746|legislation in 1746]] introduced the legislative notion that, in all future laws, references to "England" would by default include Wales.

The racist [[nursery rhyme|rhyme]] "[[Taffy was a Welshman]]" was first published around 1780, and seems to have been particularly popular in the English counties that bordered Wales.  The name "Taffy" for any Welshman may derive either from the name [[David (name)|Dafydd]], or from the [[River Taff]] which flows through [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref name=Opie1997&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 400–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Stephens ''The Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales'' (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrial Revolution ===
Around the same time, English and Scottish industrialists began establishing iron works and other heavy industry in the [[South Wales coalfield|coalfield of south Wales]].  By attracting labour from the rural areas, this produced new urban concentrations of Welsh speakers, and helped build the culture of the [[South Wales Valleys]] communities.  The [[Merthyr Rising]] of 1831 was a protest against exploitation by the mine owners which began a period of unrest, including the "[[Rebecca Riots]]" and the [[Chartism|Chartist movement]], and a process of radical thinking.  In Parliament, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] declared that south Wales was ''"the worst and most formidable district in the kingdom."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://britannia.com/wales/whist16.html GO BRITANNIA! Wales: The Great Rising&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The concerns of the English political establishment were shown in the 1847 [[Treachery of the Blue Books|Royal Commission]] on Welsh education, which reported that "The Welsh language is a vast drawback to Wales and a manifold barrier to the moral progress and commercial prosperity of the people. It is not easy to over-estimate its evil effects." As a result, English-only schools were set up in much of Wales, and children speaking Welsh were punished with the "[[Welsh Not]]".

Although 18th and 19th century English writers increasingly recognised the beauty and grandeur of the Welsh landscape, many contrasted this with a negative view of the Welsh people themselves. For example, ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper wrote in 1866: "Wales... is a small country, unfavourably situated for commercial purposes, with an indifferent soil, and inhabited by an unenterprising people. It is true it possesses valuable minerals but these have chiefly been developed by English energy and for the supply of English wants."  At the same time, rural areas close to England became more depopulated and anglicised, as many people moved to the growing English cities in the [[North West England|north west]] and Midlands.  Welsh culture was important in these areas; for example, the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] was held in either [[Liverpool]] or [[Birkenhead]] six times between 1884 and 1929.

Changes to the electoral system meant that, by the end of the 19th century, a Welsh presence began to be felt in British politics. In 1881, the [[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881|Sunday Closing Act]] was the first piece of parliamentary legislation that granted Wales the status of a distinct national unit.  Around the turn of the 20th century there was considerable anti-Welsh feeling in the English establishment.  [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[H. H. Asquith]] said in 1905 "I would sooner go to hell than to Wales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DB2EHJ08aIC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=hell+wales+asquith&amp;source=web&amp;ots=geCFFVnaIX&amp;sig=QjyKaV2W03Zg1CngjH0EcJbmbgY&amp;hl=en |title=Rebirth of a nation: Wales, 1880–1980 - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s characters in the novel ''Decline and Fall'' (1928) was made to say: ''"From the earliest times the Welsh have been looked upon as an unclean people. It is thus that they have preserved their racial integrity. Their sons and daughters rarely mate with human-kind except their own blood relations..... I often think that we can trace almost all the disasters of English history to the influence of Wales"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leninimports.com/evelyn_waugh.html Evelyn Waugh Biography (1903–1966)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cofiwch Dryweryn.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The famous [[graffiti]] – ({{lang-en|Remember Tryweryn}})]] --&gt;
In the early 20th century, Welsh politicians such as [[David Lloyd George]] (prime minister from 1916 to 1922), and later [[Aneurin Bevan]] (architect of the NHS) rose to UK-wide prominence.

The apparent powerlessness of Welsh politicians in influencing their own affairs, in the face of the English numerical superiority in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], was highlighted in the mid-20th century. [[Liverpool City Council]] had decided to expand the industry of [[Liverpool]] and [[The Wirral]]. Believing that they would need access to an increased water supply, they chose the [[Afon Tryweryn|Tryweryn Valley]], near [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]], even though the development would require flooding the village of [[Capel Celyn]]. In 1956, a [[private bill]] sponsored by Liverpool City Council was brought before Parliament to create [[Llyn Celyn]] [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]], thus circumventing planning consent from the relevant Welsh local authorities, by obtaining authority via a parliamentary Act.

Despite 35 of the 36 Welsh [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) voting against the bill, with the other abstaining, Parliament &amp;ndash; with [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|630 MPs]], the majority of members represented constituencies in England &amp;ndash; still passed the bill. Years of democratic, non-violent Welsh protest were in vain, Capel Celyn was drowned, and a new wave of Welsh nationalism, including the ''[[Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru]]'' ({{lang-en|Welsh Defence Movement}}) and the [[Free Wales Army]], were born.

The [[Welsh Language Act 1967|Welsh Language Acts of 1967]] and [[Welsh Language Act 1993|1993]] gave the language equal status in Wales, and in 1997 the Welsh electorate voted to establish a [[Welsh Assembly]].

===Anti-Welsh sentiment===
Recent examples of anti-Welsh sentiment in the media include the journalist [[A. A. Gill]] (born in Scotland to English parents) who in the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' in 1997 described the Welsh as "loquacious, dissemblers, immoral liars, stunted, bigoted, dark, ugly, pugnacious little trolls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/44283.stm | work=BBC News | title=Writer reported over "ugly little trolls" Welsh jibe | date=1998-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English writer [[A. N. Wilson]] said: "The Welsh have never made any significant contribution to any branch of knowledge, culture or entertainment.  They have no architecture, no gastronomic tradition, no literature worthy of the name." ([[Evening Standard]], 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marianne MacDonald |date=18 July 1996 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/welsh-say-racist-booker-judge-must-go-1329207.html |title=Welsh say 'racist' Booker judge must go |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a cross-party group of Members of the [[National Assembly of Wales]], representing all four political parties in the Assembly, called for an end to what they termed "persistent anti-Welsh racism" in the UK media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/628747.stm | work=BBC News | title='Anti-Welsh racism' protest | date=2000-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television personality [[Anne Robinson]] (born in England of Irish origin) appeared on the comedy show ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'' in 2001 and made derisive comments about Welsh people, such as "what are they for?" and "I never did like them". The show is designed to draw extreme views from interview subjects in order to generate controversy and humour. The people she was thinking about were supposedly those who spoke Welsh around the market stall operated by her mother in [[Liverpool]] during her childhood. Her comments upset some who accused her of [[racism]]. [[North Wales Police]] spent 96 hours investigating the issue, and concluded that no crime had been committed. She was cleared of racism by the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]], who nevertheless stated that her comments "came close to bordering on racism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=362800&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;in_a_source | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Police spent 96 hours probing Anne's jibes | first=Ben | last=Taylor | date=2005-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Neal Ascherson]] commented that: "Southern views of the Scots over the last hundred years have been faintly sceptical – "chippy, lacking in humour, slow to unbend" – but on the whole affectionate. (Contrast English attitudes to Welshness, which, for reasons I am not sure of, are often genuinely hostile)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ascherson |first=Neal |authorlink=Neal Ascherson |date=August 2007 |title=Scotophobia |url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2007-08-24-ascherson-en.html |journal=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |location=[[Berlin]] |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC]] presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] is well known for his comments about other countries, which sometimes take an anti-Welsh direction, e.g. "It's entirely unfair that some people are born fat or ugly or dyslexic or disabled or ginger or small or Welsh. Life, I'm afraid, is tragic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clarkson |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Clarkson |date=27 January 2008 |title=Clarkson on Johnny Foreigner |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/jeremy_clarkson/greatest_hits/article3250755.ece |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |location=[[United Kingdom]] |publisher=[[News UK]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606040425/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/jeremy_clarkson/greatest_hits/article3250755.ece |archivedate=6 June 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example, in the context of Wales's 2008 [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] victory: "You can never rely on the French. All they had to do was go to Cardiff last weekend with a bit of fire in their bellies and they'd have denied Wales the Six Nations Grand Slam. But no. They turned up instead with cheese in their bellies and mooched about for 80 minutes, seemingly not at all bothered that we've got to spend the next 12 months listening to the [[wikt:sheepshagger|sheepsters]] droning on about their natural superiority and brilliance. Or worse. Give them a Grand Slam and the next thing you know, all our holiday cottages are on fire. There are, of course, other reasons I hoped the French would win. I’d rather live in France than Wales; I’d rather eat a snail than a daffodil; I’d certainly rather drink French fizzy wine; and I’d much rather sleep with [[Carole Bouquet]] than [[Charlotte Church]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clarkson |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Clarkson |date=23 March 2008 |title=Ruck off, you nancy Aussies |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/jeremy_clarkson/article3602024.ece |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |location=[[United Kingdom]] |publisher=[[News UK]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509203510/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/jeremy_clarkson/article3602024.ece |archivedate=9 May 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-English sentiment===
Concerns over the decline of the Welsh language and its historical proscription have contributed to anti-English sentiment in Wales. Other factors include sporting rivalry, particularly over rugby; religious differences concerning nonconformism and English [[Anglican church|episcopacy]]; industrial disputes which usually involved English capital and Welsh labour; resentment over England's historical conquest and subjection of Wales; and perception that England was unfairly benefiting from Wales' natural resources such as coal and water. In 1977, Welsh [[Rugby union|rugby]] player [[Phil Bennett]] is reputed to have inspired his teammates for the [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] v [[England national rugby union team|England]] game with a pre-match speech: "Look what these bastards have done to Wales. They've taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our homes and only live in them for a fortnight every year. What have they given us? Absolutely nothing. We've been exploited, raped, controlled and punished by the English – and that's who you are playing this afternoon."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2998081/Talking-Points-Anna-and-the-king.html Talking Points: Anna and the king - Telegraph 06 Feb 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

English immigration to Wales has frequently been a point of contention.

The '''cyrillization of Japanese''' is the process of [[transliteration|transliterating]] or [[Linguistic transcription|transcribing]] the [[Japanese language]] into [[Cyrillic script]], either to represent Japanese proper names or terms in [[Cyrillic script]] (and various languages based on Cyrillic), or as an aid to Japanese language learning in those languages. This can be done in an ad hoc fashion (e.g. when "sushi" is transliterated as "суши" in Russian Cyrillic or as "суші" in Ukrainian Cyrillic) or using one of a number of systems. 

There are a number of cyrillization systems used by different Cyrillic alphabet-based languages, such as:
* The standard and most widely used system for cyrillization into [[Russian Cyrillic]] is known as the [[Polivanov system]], named after the Russian and Soviet linguist [[Yevgeny Polivanov]]. 
* The standard and most widely used system for cyrillization into [[Ukrainian Cyrillic]] is known as Bondarenko system (2014, updated version), named after the Ukrainian linguist {{ill|Ivan Bondarenko|uk|Бондаренко Іван Петрович}}

{{Distinguish|Economics education}}
{{Economics sidebar}}

'''Education economics''' or the '''economics of education''' is the study of [[economic]] issues relating to [[education]], including the demand for education, the financing and provision of education, and the comparative efficiency of various educational programs and policies. From early works on the relationship between schooling and labor market outcomes for individuals, the field of the economics of education has grown rapidly to cover virtually all areas with linkages to education.

== Education as an investment ==

Economics distinguishes in addition to physical [[Capital (economics)|capital]] another form of capital that is no less critical as a means of production – [[human capital]]. With investments in human capital, such as education, three major economic effects can be expected:&lt;ref name="Weil"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weil |first=David N. |authorlink=David Weil |year=2009 |title=Economic Growth |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Addison-Wesley |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-321-41662-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''increased [[expense]]s'' as the accumulation of human capital requires investments just as physical capital does,
* ''increased [[productivity]]'' as people gain characteristics that enable them to produce more output and hence
* ''[[return on investment]]'' in the form of higher [[income]]s.

=== Investment costs ===
Investments in human capital entail an investment cost, just as any investment does. Typically in [[Europe]]an countries most education expenditure takes the form of [[public sector|government consumption]], although some costs are also borne by individuals. These investments can be rather costly. [[European Union|EU]] governments spent between 3% and 8% of [[GDP]] on education in 2005, the average being 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eurostat |year=2008 |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-117/EN/KS-SF-08-117-EN.PDF |title=5% of EU GDP is spent by governments on education |work=Statistics in Focus 117/2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, measuring the spending this way alone greatly underestimates the costs because a more subtle form of costs is completely overlooked: the opportunity cost of forgone wages as students cannot work while they study. It has been estimated that the total costs, including opportunity costs, of education are as much as double the direct costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kendrick |first=J. |year=1976 |title=The Formation and Stocks of Total Capital |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |edition= |isbn=0-87014-271-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Including opportunity costs investments in education can be estimated to have been around 10% of GDP in the EU countries in 2005. In comparison investments in physical capital were 20% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eurostat |year=2008 |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=2053,70407100&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |title=GDP expenditure and investment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the two are of similar magnitude.
[[File:Average years of schooling versus GDP per capita.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Average years of schooling versus GDP per capita (USD 2005).]]

=== Returns on investment ===
Human capital in the form of education shares many characteristics with physical capital. Both require an investment to create and, once created, both have [[economic value]]. Physical capital earns a return because people are willing to pay to use a piece of physical capital in work as it allows them to produce more output. To measure the productive value of physical capital, we can simply measure how much of a return it commands in the market. In the case of human capital calculating returns is more complicated – after all, we cannot separate education from the person to see how much it rents for.
To get around this problem, the returns to human capital are generally inferred from differences in wages among people with different levels of education. Hall and Jones have calculated from international data that on average that the returns on education are 13.4% per year for first four years of schooling (grades 1–4), 10.1% per year for the next four years (grades 5–8) and 6.8% for each year beyond eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Robert E. |authorlink=Robert Hall (economist) |last2=Jones |first2=Charles I. |authorlink2=Charles Jones (economist) |year=1999 |title=Why Do Some Countries Produce So Much More Output per Worker than Others? |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=83–116 |doi=10.1162/003355399555954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus someone with 12 years of schooling can be expected to earn, on average, 1.134&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; × 1.101&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; × 1.068&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 3.161 times as much as someone with no schooling at all.
[[File:Predicted versus actual GDP per worker.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Predicted versus actual GDP per worker. The figure shows how much one would expect each country’s GDP to be higher based on the data on average years of schooling]]

=== Effects on productivity ===
Economy-wide, the effect of human capital on incomes has been estimated to be rather significant: 65% of [[wage]]s paid in [[developed countries]] is payments to human capital and only 35% to raw [[Labour economics|labor]].&lt;ref name="Weil"/&gt; The higher productivity of well-educated workers is one of the factors that explain higher GDPs and, therefore, higher incomes in developed countries. A strong correlation between GDP and education is clearly visible among the countries of the world, as is shown by the upper left figure. It is less clear, however, how much of a high GDP is explained by education. After all, it is also possible that rich countries can simply afford more education.

To distinguish the part of GDP explained with education from other causes, Weil&lt;ref name="Weil"/&gt; has calculated how much one would expect each country’s GDP to be higher based on the data on average schooling. This was based on the above-mentioned calculations of Hall and Jones on the returns on education. GDPs predicted by Weil’s calculations can be plotted against actual GDPs, as is done in the figure on the left, demonstrating that the variation in education explains some, but not all, of the variation in GDP.

Finally, the matter of [[externalities]] should be considered. Usually when speaking of externalities one thinks of the negative effects of economic activities that are not included in market prices, such as pollution. These are negative externalities. However, there are also positive externalities – that is, positive effects of which someone can benefit without having to pay for it.
Education bears with it major positive externalities: giving one person more education raises not only his or her output but also the output of those around him or her. Educated workers can bring new technologies, methods and information to the consideration of others. They can teach things to others and act as an example. The positive externalities of education include the effects of personal networks and the roles educated workers play in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brokerage and Closure|last=Burt|first=Ronald S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780199249152|location=United Kingdom|pages=46-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive externalities from human capital are one explanation for why governments are involved in education. If people were left on their own, they would not take into account the full social benefit of education – in other words the rise in the output and wages of others – so the amount they would choose to obtain would be lower than the social optimum.&lt;ref name="Weil"/&gt;

== Demand for education ==
 
=== Demand for vs. supply of education === 
  
A 2013 study assesses demand- and supply-side factors that affect educational access and attainment in development countries, and it shows that addressing demand-side factors, such as geographic gaps between rural and urban areas, higher levels of population growth (which place constant pressure on new enrolments) and child labour, can often have greater impact on increasing levels of education in developing countries than supply-side factors, such as constructing additional
school facilities, hiring more teachers etc.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, Alexander. 2013. [http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kraussa/External%20influences%20and%20the%20educational%20landscape%20-%20An%20analysis%20of%20political,%20economic,%20geographic,%20health%20and%20demographic%20factors%20in%20Ghana.pdf '' External influences and the educational landscape: Analysis of political, economic, geographic, health and demographic factors in Ghana'']. New York: Springer Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal approaches ===
The dominant model of the demand for education is based on [[human capital]] theory. The central idea is that undertaking education is [[investment]] in the acquisition of skills and knowledge which will increase [[earnings]], or provide long-term benefits such as an appreciation of literature (sometimes referred to as [[cultural capital]]).&lt;ref&gt;
Daniele Checchi, 2006. ''The Economics of Education: NYUMBANI Human Capital, Family Background and Inequality'', Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-79310-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-521-79310-0}} [http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521793100 Description.]&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in human capital can follow technological progress as knowledgeable employees are in demand due to the need for their skills, whether it be in understanding the production process or in operating machines. Studies from 1958 attempted to calculate the returns from additional schooling (the percent increase in income acquired through an additional year of schooling). Later results attempted to allow for different returns across persons or by level of education.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Card]] "returns to schooling,"  ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'' , 2nd Edition.  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000240 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics have shown that countries with high enrollment/graduation rates have grown faster than countries without.  The [[United States]] has been the world leader in educational advances, beginning with the [[high school movement]] (1910–1950). There also seems to be a correlation between gender differences in education with the level of growth; more development is observed in countries which have an equal distribution of the percentage of women versus men who graduated from high school. When looking at correlations in the data, education seems to generate economic growth; however, it could be that we have this causality relationship backwards. For example, if education is seen as a luxury good, it may be that richer households are seeking out educational attainment as a symbol of status, rather than the relationship of education leading to wealth.

Educational advance is not the only variable for economic growth, though, as it only explains about 14% of the average annual increase in labor productivity over the period 1915-2005.  From lack of a more significant correlation between formal educational achievement and productivity growth, some economists see reason to believe that in today’s world many skills and capabilities come by way of learning outside of traditional education, or outside of schooling altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Kling, Arnold and John Merrifield. 2009." Goldin and Katz and Education Policy Failings in Historical Perspective". ''Econ Journal Watch'' 6(1): 2-20.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/goldin-and-katz-and-education-policy-failings-in-historical-perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative model of the demand for education, commonly referred to as [[Screening (economics)|screening]], is based on the economic theory of [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]]. The central idea is that the successful completion of education is a signal of ability.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Hörner, 2008. "signalling and screening." ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000129  Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxist critique ===
Although Marx and Engels did not write widely about the social functions of education, their concepts and methods are theorized and criticized by the influence of Marx as education being used in reproduction of capitalist societies. Marx and Engels approached scholarship as "revolutionary scholarship" where education should serve as a propaganda for the struggle of the working class.&lt;ref name="marxist persperctive"&gt;[http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/marxianperspectivesoneducation.pdf Douglas Kellner, Marxian Perspectives on Educational Philosophy: From Classical Marxism to Critical Pedagogy]&lt;/ref&gt; The classical Marxian paradigm sees education as serving the interest of capital and is seeking alternative modes of education that would prepare students and citizens for more progressive socialist mode of social organizations. Marx and Engels understood education and free time as essential to developing free individuals and creating many-sided human beings, thus for them education should become a more essential part of the life of people unlike capitalist society which is organized mainly around work and the production of commodities.&lt;ref name="marxist persperctive"/&gt;

== Financing and provision ==
In most countries [[school]] education is predominantly financed and provided by governments. Public funding and provision also plays a major role in [[higher education]]. Although there is wide agreement on the principle that education, at least at school level, should be financed mainly by governments, there is considerable debate over the desirable extent of public provision of education. Supporters of [[public education]] argue that universal public provision promotes equality of opportunity and social cohesion. Opponents of public provision advocate alternatives such as [[School vouchers|vouchers]].&lt;ref&gt;William A. Fischel, 2008. "educational finance,"  ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000237&amp;q=education%20finance&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=3  Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Caroline Hoxby]], 2008. "school choice and competition," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition,  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_V000064  Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

=== Pre-primary education financing ===
Compared to other areas of [[basic education]], globally comparable data on pre-primary education financing remain scarce. While much of existing non-formal and private programmes may not be fully accounted for, it can be deduced from the level of provision that pre-primary  financing remains inadequate, especially when considered against expected benefits. Globally, pre-primary education accounts for the lowest proportion of the total public expenditure on education, in spite of the much-documented positive impact of quality [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] on later learning and other social outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education production function ==
An ''education production function'' is an application of the economic concept of a [[production function]] to the field of [[education]]. It relates various inputs affecting a student’s learning (schools, families, peers, neighborhoods, etc.) to measured outputs including subsequent labor market success, college attendance, graduation rates, and, most frequently, [[standardized test]] scores. The original study that eventually prompted interest in the idea of education production functions was by a sociologist, [[James Samuel Coleman|James S. Coleman]].  The [[Coleman Report]], published in 1966, concluded that the marginal effect of various school inputs on student achievement was small compared to the impact of families and friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Samuel Coleman|Coleman, James S.]], Ernest Q. Campbell, Carol J. Hobson, James McPartland, Alexander M. Mood, Frederic D. Weinfeld, and Robert L. York. 1966. Equality of Educational Opportunity. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later work, by [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]], [[Richard Murnane]], and other economists introduced the structure of "production" to the consideration of student learning outcomes.  Hanushek at al. (2008, 2015) reported a very high correlation between "adjusted growth rate" and "adjusted test scores".&lt;ref name=Hanushek2008eg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanushek|first1=Eric A.

A large number of successive studies, increasingly involving economists, produced inconsistent results about the impact of school resources on student performance, leading to considerable controversy in policy discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric A. Hanushek]], 2008.  "education production functions," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'' , 2nd Edition.

Two separate lines of study have been particularly widely debated.  The overall question of whether added funds to schools are likely to produce higher achievement (the “money doesn’t matter” debate) has entered into legislative debates and court consideration of school finance systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Burtless]], ed., 1996.

'''Electronic media''' are [[media (communication)|media]] that use [[electronics]] or [[electromechanical]] [[audience]] to access the content. This is in contrast to static media (mainly [[printing|print]] media), which today are most often [[Desktop publishing|created electronically]], but do not require electronics to be accessed by the end user in the printed form.  The primary electronic media sources familiar to the general public are [[video]] recordings, [[sound recording and reproduction|audio recordings]], [[multimedia]] presentations, [[Presentation program|slide presentations]], [[CD-ROM]] and [[online and offline|online]] content. Most [[new media]] are in the form of [[digital media]]. However, electronic media may be in either [[analogue electronics]] [[data]] or [[digital electronics|digital electronic]] [[digital data|data]] format.

Although the term is usually associated with content recorded on a [[Data storage device|storage medium]], recordings are not required for live [[broadcasting]] and online networking.

Any equipment used in the [[telecommunication|electronic communication]] process (e.g. [[television]], [[Receiver (radio)|radio]], [[telephone]], [[desktop computer]], [[game console]], [[handheld device]]) may also be considered electronic media.

== Uses ==
Electronic media are ubiquitous in most of the developed world. Electronic media devices have found their way into all parts of modern life. The term is relevant to [[media ecology]] for studying its impact compared to printed media and broadening the scope of understanding media beyond a simplistic aspect of media such as one delivery platform (e.g. the World Wide Web) aside from many other options. The term is also relevant to professional career development regarding related skill set.

The '''national emblem of Algeria''' ({{Lang-ar|'''شعار الجزائر الوطني'''}}) is the seal used by the government, as other states use [[coat of arms|coats of arms]]. 

==Description==
The current form of the emblem with Arabic writing was adopted on 1 November 1976, but was only differentiated from previous one by the changing of the motto from French to Arabic. Contained on the emblem is the [[crescent]] that is also found on the [[flag of Algeria]], and is a symbol of [[Islam]].  The text that encircles the emblem says in Arabic: {{lang|ar|الجمهورية الجزائرية الديمقراطية الشعبية}} ("The People's Democratic Republic of Algeria", the country's official name).

The [[hand of Fatima]], a traditional symbol of the region, appears in front of the [[Atlas Mountains]], below a rising sun representing a new era.  Buildings stand for industry and plants for agriculture.

'''Eye movement in music reading''' is the scanning of a [[Sheet music|musical score]] by a musician's eyes. This usually occurs as the music is read during performance, although musicians sometimes scan music silently to study it. The phenomenon has been studied by researchers from a range of backgrounds, including [[cognitive psychology]] and [[music education]]. These studies have typically reflected a curiosity among performing musicians about a central process in their craft, and a hope that investigating eye movement might help in the development of more effective methods of training musicians' [[sight reading]] skills.

A central aspect of music reading is the sequence of alternating [[saccade]]s and [[Fixation (visual)|fixations]], as it is for most oculomotor tasks. Saccades are the rapid ‘flicks’ that move the eyes from location to location over a music score. Saccades are separated from each other by fixations, during which the eyes are relatively stationary on the page. It is well established that the perception of visual information occurs almost entirely during fixations and that little if any information is picked up during saccades.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Matin (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Fixations comprise about 90% of music reading time, typically averaging 250–400 ms in duration.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Goolsby, 1987; Smith, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye movement in music reading is an extremely complex phenomenon that involves a number of unresolved issues in psychology, and which requires intricate experimental conditions to produce meaningful data. Despite some 30 studies in this area over the past 70 years, little is known about the underlying patterns of eye movement in music reading.

== Relationship with eye movement in language reading ==
[[Image:BWV847 measures 1-9 Fuga a 3 voci.svg|thumb|right|320px|An excerpt from one of JS Bach's compositions for keyboard: a player's scanpath across such a score will be a complex pattern of horizontal and vertical movement.]]

Eye movement in music reading may at first appear to be similar to that in [[eye movement in language reading|language reading]], since in both activities the eyes move over the page in fixations and saccades, picking up and processing coded meanings. However, it is here that the obvious similarities end. Not only is the coding system of music nonlinguistic; it involves what is apparently a unique combination of features among human activities: a strict and continuous time constraint on an output that is generated by a continuous stream of coded instructions. Even the reading of language aloud, which, like musical performance involves turning coded information into a musculoskeletal response, is relatively free of temporal constraint—the pulse in reading aloud is a fluid, improvised affair compared with its rigid presence in most Western music. It is this uniquely strict temporal requirement in musical performance that has made the observation of eye movement in music reading fraught with more difficulty than that in language reading.

Another critical difference between reading music and reading language is the role of skill. Most people become reasonably efficient at language reading by adulthood, even though almost all language reading is [[sight reading]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloboda (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some musicians regard themselves as poor sight readers of music even after years of study. Thus, the improvement of music sight reading and the differences between skilled and unskilled readers have always been of prime importance to research into eye movement in music reading, whereas research into eye movement in language reading has been more concerned with the development of a unified psychological model of the reading process.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner et al. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore unsurprising that most research into eye movement in music reading has aimed to compare the eye movement patterns of the skilled and the unskilled.

== Equipment and related methodology ==
From the start, there were basic problems with [[eye tracker|eye-tracking equipment]]. The five earliest studies&lt;ref&gt;(Jacobsen 1941; Weaver 1943; Weaver &amp; Nuys 1943; York 1951; and Lang 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; used photographic techniques. These methods involved either training a continuous beam of visible light onto the eye to produce an unbroken line on photographic paper, or a flashing light to produce a series of white spots on photographic paper at sampling intervals around 25 ms (i.e., 40 samples a second). Because the film rolled through the device vertically, the vertical movement of the eyes in their journey across the page was either unrecorded&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen 1941; York 1951; and Lang 1961&lt;/ref&gt; or was recorded using a second camera and subsequently combined to provide data on both dimensions, a cumbersome and inaccurate solution.

These systems were sensitive to even small movement of the head or body, which appear to have significantly contaminated the data. Some studies used devices such as a headrest and bite-plate to minimise this contamination, with limited success, and in one case a camera affixed to a motorcycle helmet—weighing nearly 3&amp;nbsp;kg—which was supported by a system of counterbalancing weights and pulleys attached to the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;Young 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to extraneous head movement, researchers faced other physical, bodily problems. The musculoskeletal response required to play a musical instrument involves substantial body movement, usually of the hands, arms and torso. This can upset the delicate balance of tracking equipment and confound the registration of data. Another issue that affects almost all unskilled keyboardists and a considerable proportion of skilled keyboardists is the common tendency to frequently glance down at the hands and back to the score during performance. The disadvantage of this behaviour is that it causes signal dropout in the data every time it occurs, which is sometimes up to several times per bar.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver (1943), York (1951) and Young (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; When participants are prevented from looking down at their hands, typically the quality of their performance is degraded. Rayner &amp; Pollatsek (1997:49) wrote that:
:"even skilled musicians naturally look at their hands at times. ... [Because] accurate eye movement recording [is generally incompatible with] these head movements ... musicians often need appreciable training with the apparatus before their eye movements can be measured."

Since Lang (1961), all reported studies into eye movement in music reading, aside from Smith (1988), appear to have used infrared tracking technology. However, research into the field has mostly been conducted using less than optimal equipment. This has had a pervasive negative impact on almost all research up until a few recent studies. In summary, the four main equipment problems have been that tracking devices:
*measured eye movement inaccurately or provided insufficient data;
*were uncomfortable for participants and therefore risked a reduction in [[ecological validity]];
*did not allow for the display of records of eye movement in relation to the musical score, or at least made such a display difficult to achieve; and
*were adversely affected by most participants' tendency to look down at their hands, to move their bodies significantly during performance, and to blink.

Not until recently has eye movement in music reading been investigated with more satisfactory equipment. Kinsler and Carpenter (1995) were able to identify eye position to within 0.25º, that is, the size of the individual musical notes, at intervals of 1&amp;nbsp;ms. Truitt et al. (1997) used a similarly accurate infrared system capable of displaying a movement window and integrated into a computer-monitored musical keyboard. Waters &amp; Underwood (1998) used a machine with an accuracy of plus or minus one character space and a sampling interval of only 4&amp;nbsp;ms.

== Tempo and data contamination ==
Most research into eye movement in music reading has primarily aimed to compare the eye movement patterns of skilled and unskilled performers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Weaver (1943), Young (1971), Goolsby (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The implicit presumption appears to have been that this might lay the foundation for developing better ways of training musicians. However, there are significant methodological problems in attempting this comparison. Skilled and unskilled performers typically sight read the same passage at different [[tempo]]s and/or levels of accuracy. At a sufficiently slow tempo, players over a large range of skill-levels are capable of accurate performance, but the skilled will have excess capacity in their perception and processing of the information on the page. There is evidence that excess capacity contaminates eye-movement data with a ‘wandering’ effect, in which the eyes tend to stray from the course of the music. Weaver (1943:15) implied the existence of the wandering effect and its confounding influence, as did Truitt et al. (1997:51), who suspected that at slow tempo their participants' eyes were "hanging around rather than extracting information". The wandering effect is undesirable, because it is an unquantifiable and possibly random distortion of normal eye movement patterns.

Souter (2001:81) claimed that the ideal tempo for observing eye movement is a range lying between one that is so fast as to produce a significant level of action slips, and one that is so slow as to produce a significant wandering effect. The skilled and the unskilled have quite different ranges for sight reading the same music. On the other hand, a faster tempo may minimise excess capacity in the skilled, but will tend to induce inaccurate performance in the unskilled; inaccuracies rob us of the only evidence that a performer has processed the information on the page, and the danger cannot be discounted that feedback from action-slips contaminates eye movement data.

Almost all studies have compared temporal variables among participants, chiefly the durations of their fixations and saccades. In these cases, it is self-evident that useful comparisons require consistency in performance tempo and accuracy within and between performances. However, most studies have accommodated their participants’ varied performance ability in the reading of the same stimulus, by allowing them to choose their own tempo or by not strictly controlling that tempo. Theoretically, there is a relatively narrow range, referred to here as the ‘optimal range’, in which capacity matches the task at hand; on either side of this range lie the two problematic tempo ranges within which a performer’s capacity is excessive or insufficient, respectively. The location of the boundaries of the optimal range depends on the skill-level of an individual performer and the relative difficulty of reading/performing the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:80–81)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, unless participants are drawn from a narrow range of skill-levels, their optimal ranges will be mutually exclusive, and observations at a single, controlled tempo will be likely to result in significant contamination of eye movement data. Most studies ''have'' sought to compare the skilled and the unskilled in the hope of generating pedagogically useful data; aside from Smith (1988), in which tempo itself was an independent variable, Polanka (1995), who analysed only data from silent preparatory readings, and Souter (2001), who observed only the highly skilled, none has set out to control tempo strictly. Investigators have apparently attempted to overcome the consequences of the fallacy by making compromises, such as (1) exercising little or no control over the tempos at which participants performed in trials, and/or (2) tolerating significant disparity in the level of action slips between skilled and unskilled groups.

This issue is part of the broader tempo/skill/action-slip fallacy, which concerns the relationship between tempo, skill and the level of action slips (performance errors).&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:80–85)&lt;/ref&gt; The fallacy is that it is possible to reliably compare the eye movement patterns of skilled and unskilled performers under the same conditions.

== Musical complexity ==
Many researchers have been interested in learning whether fixation durations are influenced by the complexity of the music. At least three types of complexity need to be accounted for in music reading: the visual complexity of the [[musical notation]]; the complexity of processing visual input into musculoskeletal commands; and the complexity of executing those commands. For example, visual complexity might be in the form of the density of the notational symbols on the page, or of the presence of accidentals, triplet signs, slurs and other expression markings. The complexity of processing visual input into musculoskeletal commands might involve a lack of [[Chunking (psychology)|'chunkability']] or predictability in the music. The complexity of executing musculoskeletal commands might be seen in terms of the demands of fingering and hand position. It is in isolating and accounting for the interplay between these types that the difficulty lies in making sense of musical complexity. For this reason, little useful information has emerged from investigating the relationship between musical complexity and eye movement.

Jacobsen (1941:213) concluded that "the complexity of the reading material influenced the number and the duration of [fixations]"; where the texture, rhythm, key and accidentals were "more difficult", there was, on average, a slowing of tempo and an increase in both the duration and the number of fixations in his participants. However, performance tempos were uncontrolled in this study, so the data on which this conclusion was based are likely to have been contaminated by the slower tempos that were reported for the reading of the more difficult stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:90)&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver (1943) claimed that fixation durations—which ranged from 270–530&amp;nbsp;ms—lengthened when the notation was more compact and/or complex, as Jacobsen had found, but did not disclose whether slower tempos were used. Halverson (1974), who controlled tempo more closely, observed a mild opposite effect. Schmidt's (1981) participants used longer fixation durations in reading easier melodies (consistent with Halverson); Goolsby's (1987) data mildly supported Halverson's finding, but only for skilled readers. He wrote "both Jacobsen and Weaver ... in letting participants select their own tempo found the opposite effect of notational complexity".&lt;ref&gt;Goolsby 1987:107&lt;/ref&gt;

On balance, it appears likely that under controlled temporal conditions, denser and more complex music is associated with a higher number of fixations, of shorter mean duration. This might be explained as an attempt by the music-reading process to provide more frequent 'refreshment' of the material being held in working memory, and may compensate for the need to hold more information in working memory.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:89–90)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reader skill ==
There is no disagreement among the major studies, from Jacobsen (1941) to Smith (1988), that skilled readers appear to use more and shorter fixations across all conditions than do the unskilled. Goolsby (1987) found that mean 'progressive' (forward-moving) fixation duration was significantly longer (474 versus 377&amp;nbsp;ms) and mean saccade length significantly greater for the less skilled. Although Goolsby did not report the total reading durations of his trials, they can be derived from the mean tempos of his 12 skilled and 12 unskilled participants for each of the four stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Goolsby (1987:88), assuming there were no extraneous methodological factor, such as failing to exclude from total durations the 'return-sweep' saccades and non-reading time at the start and end of readings.&lt;/ref&gt; His data appear to  show that the unskilled played at 93.6% of the tempo of the skilled, and that their mean fixation durations were 25.6% longer.

This raises the question as to why skilled readers should distribute more numerous and shorter fixations over a score than the unskilled. Only one plausible explanation appears in the literature. Kinsler &amp; Carpenter (1995) proposed a model for the processing of music notation, based on their data from the reading of rhythm patterns, in which an iconic representation of each fixated image is scanned by a 'processor' and interpreted to a given level of accuracy. The scan ends when this level cannot be reached, its end-point determining the position of the upcoming fixation. The time taken before this decision depends on the complexity of a note, and is presumably shorter for skilled readers, thus promoting more numerous fixations of shorter duration. This model has not been further investigated, and does not explain what ''advantage'' there is to using short, numerous fixations. Another possible explanation is that skilled readers maintain a larger [[eye–hand span]] and therefore hold a larger amount of information in their [[working memory]]; thus, they need to refresh that information more frequently from the music score, and may do so by refixating more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:91–92)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stimulus familiarity ==
[[Image:Michelangelo Caravaggio 026.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Caravaggio]]'s ''Rest on the Flight into Egypt'' (1594–96)]]

The more familiar readers become with a musical excerpt, the less their reliance on visual input from the score and the correspondingly greater reliance on their stored memory of the music. On logical grounds, it would be expected that this shift would result in fewer and longer fixations. The data from all three studies into eye movement in the reading of increasingly familiar music support this reasoning. York's (1952) participants read each stimulus twice, with each reading preceded by a 28-second silent preview. On average, both skilled and unskilled readers used fewer and longer fixations during the second reading. Goolsby's (1987) participants were observed during three immediately successive readings of the same musical stimulus. Familiarity in these trials appeared to increase fixation duration, but not nearly as much as might have been expected. The second reading produced no significant difference in mean fixation duration (from 422 to 418&amp;nbsp;ms). On the third encounter, mean fixation duration was higher for both groups (437&amp;nbsp;ms) but by a barely significant amount, thus mildly supporting York's earlier finding. The smallness of these changes might be explained by the unchallenging reading conditions in the trials. The tempo of MM120 suggested at the start of each of Goolsby's trials appears to be slow for tackling the given melodies, which contained many semibreves and minims, and there may have simply been insufficient pressure to produce significant results. A more likely explanation is that the participants played the stimuli at faster tempos as they grew more familiar with them through the three readings. (The metronome was initially sounded, but was silent during the performances, allowing readers to vary their pace at will.) Thus, it is possible that two influences were at odds with each other: growing familiarity may have promoted low numbers of fixations, and long fixation durations, while faster tempo may have promoted low numbers and short durations. This might explain why mean fixation duration fell in the opposite direction to the prediction for the second encounter, and by the third encounter had risen by only 3.55% across both groups.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:93)&lt;/ref&gt; (Smith's (1988) results, reinforced by those of Kinsler &amp; Carpenter (1995), suggest that faster tempos are likely to reduce both the number and duration of fixations in the reading of a single-line melody. If this hypothesis is correct, it may be connected with the possibility that the more familiar a stimulus, the less the workload on the reader's memory.)

== Top–down/bottom–up question ==

There was considerable debate from the 1950s to 1970s as to whether eye movement in language reading is solely or mainly influenced by (1) the pre-existing (top–down) behavioural patterns of an individual's reading technique, (2) the nature of the stimulus (bottom–up), or (3) both factors. Rayner et al. (1971) provides a review of the relevant studies.

Decades before this debate, Weaver (1943) had set out to determine the (bottom–up) effects of musical texture on eye movement. He hypothesised that vertical compositional patterns in a two-stave keyboard score would promote vertical saccades, and horizontal compositional patterns horizontal saccades. Weaver's participants read a two-part [[polyphony|polyphonic]] stimulus in which the musical patterns were strongly horizontal, and a four-part [[homophony|homophonic]] stimulus comprising plain, hymn-like chords, in which the compositional patterns were strongly vertical. Weaver was apparently unaware of the difficulty of proving this hypothesis in the light of the continual need to scan up and down between the staves and move forward along the score. Thus, it is unsurprising that the hypothesis was not confirmed.

Four decades later, when evidence was being revealed of the bottom–up influence on eye movement in language reading, Sloboda (1985) was interested in the possibility that there might be an equivalent influence on eye movement in music reading, and appeared to assume that Weaver's hypothesis had been confirmed. "Weaver found that [the vertical] pattern was indeed used when the music was homophonic and chordal in nature. When the music was contrapuntal, however, he found fixation sequences which were grouped in horizontal sweeps along a single line, with a return to another line afterwards."&lt;ref&gt;Sloboda (1985:70)&lt;/ref&gt; To support this assertion, Sloboda quoted two one-bar fragments taken from Weaver's illustrations that do not appear to be representative of the overall examples.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:97)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sloboda's claim may be questionable, and despite Weaver's failure to find dimensional links between eye movement and stimulus, eye movement in music reading shows clear evidence in most studies—in particular, Truit et al. (1997) and Goolsby (1987)—of the influence of bottom–up graphical features ''and'' top–down global factors related to the meaning of the symbols.

== Peripheral visual input ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
The role of peripheral visual input in language reading remains the subject of much research. Peripheral input in music reading was a particular focus of Truitt et al. (1997). They used the [[gaze-contingency paradigm]] to measure the extent of peripheral perception to the right of a fixation. This paradigm involves the spontaneous manipulation of a display in direct response to where the eyes are gazing at any one point of time. Performance was degraded only slightly when four [[crotchet]]s to the right were presented as the ongoing preview, but significantly when only two crotchets were presented. Under these conditions, peripheral input extended over a little more than a four-beat measure, on average. For the less skilled, useful peripheral perception extended from half a beat up to between two and four beats. For the more skilled, useful peripheral perception extended up to five beats.

Peripheral visual input in music reading is clearly in need of more investigation, particularly now that the paradigm has become more accessible to researchers. A case could be made that Western music notation has developed in such a way as to optimise the use of peripheral input in the reading process. Noteheads, stems, beams, barlines and other notational symbols are all sufficiently bold and distinctive to be useful when picked up peripherally, even when at some distance from the fovea. The upcoming [[pitch contour]] and prevailing rhythmic values of a musical line can typically be ascertained ahead of foveal perception. For example, a run of continuous semiquavers beamed together by two thick, roughly horizontal beams, will convey potentially valuable information about rhythm and texture, whether to the right on the currently fixated stave, or above, or above or below in a neighbouring stave. This is reason enough to suspect that the peripheral preprocessing of notational information is a factor in fluent music reading, just as it has been found to be the case for language reading. This would be consistent with the findings of Smith (1988) and Kinsler &amp; Carpenter (1995), who reported that the eyes do not fixate on every note in the reading of melodies.

== Refixation ==

A refixation is a fixation on information that has already been fixated on during the same reading. In the reading of two-stave keyboard music, there are two forms of refixation: (1) up or down within a chord, after the chord has already been inspected on both staves (vertical refixation), and (2) leftward refixation to a previous chord (either back horizontally on the same stave or diagonally to the other stave). These are analogous to Pollatsek &amp; Rayner’s two categories of refixation in the reading of language: (1) “same-word rightward refixation”, i.e., on different syllables in the same word, and (2) “leftward refixation” to previously read words (also known as “regression”).&lt;ref&gt;Pollatsek &amp; Rayner (1990:153)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leftward refixation occurs in music reading at all skill-levels.&lt;ref name="Goolsby 1987, Smith 1988"&gt;Goolsby (1987), Smith (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a saccade back to the previous note/chord (occasionally even back two notes/chords), followed by at least one returning saccade to the right, to regain lost ground. Weaver reported that leftward regressions run from 7% to a substantial 23% of all saccades in the sight-reading of keyboard music. Goolsby and Smith reported significant levels of leftward refixation across all skill-levels in the sight-reading of melodies.&lt;ref name="Goolsby 1987, Smith 1988"/&gt;

Looking at the same information more than once is, ''prima facie'', a costly behaviour that must be weighed against the need to keep pace with the tempo of the music. Leftward refixation involves a greater investment of time than vertical refixation, and on logical grounds is likely to be considerably less common. For the same reason, the rates of both forms of refixation are likely to be sensitive to tempo, with lower rates at faster speed to meet the demand for making swifter progress across the score. Souter confirmed both of these suppositions in the skilled sight-reading of keyboard music. He found that at slow tempo (one chord a second), 23.13% (SD 5.76%) of saccades were involved in vertical refixation compared with 5.05% (4.81%) in leftward refixation (''p'' &lt; 0.001). At fast tempo (two chords a second), the rates were 8.15% (SD 4.41%) for vertical refixation compared with 2.41% (2.37%) for leftward refixation (''p'' = 0.011). These significant differences occurred even though recovery saccades were included in the counts for leftward refixations, effectively doubling their number. The reductions in the rate of vertical refixation  upon the doubling of tempo was highly significant (''p'' &lt; 0.001), but for leftward refixation was not (''p'' = 0.209), possibly because of the low baseline.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:138,140)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eye–hand span ==
[[Image:Mozart and Linley 1770.jpg|thumb|right|300px|WA Mozart meets violinist Thomas Linley in 1770, anon. French painting, 18th century]]

The [[eye–hand span]] (EHS) is the separation between eye position on the score and hand position. It can be measured in two ways: in notes (the number of notes between hand and eye; the 'note index'), or in time (the length of time between fixation and performance; the 'time index'). The main findings in relation to the eye–voice span in the reading aloud of language were that (1) a larger span is associated with faster, more skilled readers,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Buswell (1920), [[Judd and Buswell]] (1922), Tinker (1958), Morton (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; (2) a shorter span is associated with greater stimulus-difficulty,&lt;ref&gt;Buswell (1920), Lawson (1961), Morton (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) the span appears to vary according to linguistic phrasing.&lt;ref&gt;Levin and Kaplin (1970), Levin and Addis (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; At least eight studies into eye movement in music reading have investigated analogous issues. For example, Jacobsen (1941) measured the average span to the right in the sight singing of melodies as up to two notes for the unskilled and between one and four notes for the skilled, whose faster average tempo in that study raises doubt as to whether skill alone was responsible for this difference. In Weaver (1943:28), the eye–hand span varied greatly, but never exceeded 'a separation of eight successive notes or chords, a figure that seems impossibly large for the reading of keyboard scores. Young (1971) found that both skilled and unskilled participants previewed about one chord ahead of their hands, an  uncertain finding in view of the methodological problems in that study. Goolsby (1994) found that skilled [[sight-reading|sight singers']] eyes were on average about four beats ahead of their voice, and less for the unskilled. He claimed that when sight singing, 'skilled music readers look farther ahead in the notation and then back to the point of performance' (p.&amp;nbsp;77). To put this another way, skilled music readers maintain a larger eye–hand span and are more likely to refixate within it. This association between span size and leftward refixation could arise from a greater need for the refreshment of information in [[working memory]]. Furneax &amp; Land (1999) found that professional pianists' spans are significantly larger than those of amateurs. The time index was significantly affected by the performance tempo: when fast tempos were imposed on performance, all participants showed a reduction in the time index (to about 0.7&amp;nbsp;s), and slow tempos increased the time index (to about 1.3&amp;nbsp; s). This means that the length of time that information is stored in the buffer is related to performance tempo rather than ability, but that professionals can fit more information into their buffers.&lt;ref&gt;Furneax S &amp; Land MF (1999) The effects of skill on the eye-hand span during musical sight-reading, ''Proceedings: Biological Sciences'', '''266''', 2435–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloboda (1974, 1977) cleverly applied Levin &amp; Kaplin's (1970) 'light-out' method in an experiment designed to measure the size of the span in music reading. [[Sloboda]] (1977) asked his participants to sight read a melody and turned the lights out at an unpredictable point during each reading. The participants were instructed to continue playing correctly 'without guessing' for as long as they could after visual input was effectively removed, giving an indication as to how far ahead of their hands they were perceiving at that moment. Here, the span was defined as including peripheral input. Participants were allowed to choose their own performing speed for each piece, introducing a layer of uncertainty into the interpretation of the results. Sloboda reported that there was a tendency for the span to coincide with the musical phrasing, so that 'a boundary just beyond the average span "stretches" the span, and a boundary just before the average "contracts" it' (as reported in Sloboda 1985:72). Good readers, he found, maintain a larger span size (up to seven notes) than do poor readers (up to four notes).

Truitt et al. (1997) found that in sight reading melodies on the [[electronic keyboard]], span size averaged a little over one beat and ranged from two beats behind the currently fixated point to an incredibly large 12 beats ahead. The normal range of span size was rather smaller: between one beat behind and three beats ahead of the hands for 88% of the total reading duration, and between 0 and 2 beats ahead for 68% of the duration. Such large ranges, in particular, those that extend leftwards from the point of fixation, may have been due to the 'wandering effect'. For the less skilled, the average span was about half a crotchet beat. For the skilled, the span averaged about two beats and useful peripheral perception extended up to five beats. This, in the view of Rayner &amp; Pollatsek (1997:52), suggests that:

:"a major constraint on tasks that require translation of complex inputs into continuous [[motor transcription]] is [the limited capacity of] [[short-term memory]]. If the encoding process gets too far ahead of the output, there is likely to be a loss of material that is stored in the queue."

Rayner &amp; Pollatsek (1997:52) explained the size of the eye–hand span as a continuous tug-o-war, as it were, between two forces: (1) the need for material to be held in working memory long enough to be processed into [[musculoskeletal]] commands, and (2) the need to limit the demand on span size and therefore the workload in the memory system. They claimed that most music pedagogy supports the first aspect [in advising] the student that the eyes should be well ahead of the hands for effective sight reading. They held that despite such advice, for most readers, the second aspect prevails; that is, the need to limit the workload of the [[memory]] system. This, they contended, results in a very small span under normal conditions.

The Perceptual Span and the Eye-Hand Span in Sight Reading Music

Frances E. Truitt, Charles Clifton, Jr., Alexander Pollatsek, and Keith Rayner

The perceptual span and eye–hand span of pianists were examined while they played and read single-line melodies (with four beats per measure). The perceptual span was measured by the use of a moving-window technique with four window conditions: two beats, four beats, six beats, or no window. It was found that pianists need to see no more than the whole measure that they are fixating in order to perform normally: playing time was longest in the two-beat window condition, and there were longer fixation durations, more fixations, more regressions, and shorter saccade lengths in the two-beat window condition than in the other three conditions, which generally did not differ from one another. The eye-hand span, determined by comparing eye movement data and key press data, was found to be a little more than one beat. The two-beat window yielded the smallest eye-hand span and the no window condition yielded the largest span. Finally, the effect of skill was examined by comparing the four most skilled and the four least skilled music readers. Playing time, eye-hand span, and fixation duration all differed as a function of skill, with the skilled readers having shorter playing times, larger eye-hand spans, and shorter fixation durations than the less-skilled readers. Window size did not interact with reading skill.--&gt;

== Tempo ==
Smith (1988) found that when [[tempo]] is increased, fixations are fewer in number and shorter in mean duration, and that fixations tend to be spaced further apart on the score. Kinsler &amp; Carpenter (1995) investigated the effect of increased tempo in reading rhythmic notation, rather than real melodies. They similarly found that increased tempo causes a decrease in mean fixation duration and an increase in mean saccade amplitude (i.e., the distance on the page between successive fixations). Souter (2001) used novel theory and methodology to investigate the effects of tempo on key variables in the sight reading of highly skilled keyboardists. Eye movement studies have typically measured saccade and fixation durations as separate variables. Souter (2001) used a novel variable: pause duration. This is a measure of the duration between the end of one fixation and the end of the next; that is, the sum of the duration of each saccade and of the fixation it leads to. Using this composite variable brings into play a simple relationship between the number of pauses, their mean duration, and the tempo: the number of pauses factored by their mean duration equals the total reading duration. In other words, the time taken to read a passage equals the sum of the durations of the individual pauses, or nd = r, where n is the number of pauses, d is their mean duration, and r is the total reading time. Since the total reading duration is inversely proportional to the tempo—double the tempo and the total reading time will be halved—the relationship can be expressed as nd is proportional to  r, where t is tempo.

This study observed the effect of a change in tempo on the number and mean duration of pauses; thus, now using the letters to represent proportional changes in values,

nd = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, where n is the proportional change in pause number, d is the proportional change in their mean duration, and t is the proportional change in tempo. This expression describes a number–duration curve, in which the number and mean duration of pauses form a hyperbolic relationship (since neither n nor d ever reaches zero). The curve represents the range of possible ratios for using these variables to adapt to a change in tempo. In Souter (2001), tempo was doubled from the first to the second reading, from 60 to 120 MM; thus, t = 2, and the number–duration curve is described by nd = 0.5 (Figure 2). In other words, factoring the proportional change in the number and mean duration of pauses between these readings will always equal ½. Each participant’s two readings thus corresponded to a point on this curve.

Irrespective of the value of t, all number–duration curves pass through three points of theoretical interest: two ‘sole-contribution’ points and one ‘equal-contribution’ point. At each sole-contribution point, a reader has relied entirely on one of the two variables to adapt to a new tempo. In Souter's study, if a participant adapted to the doubling of tempo by using the same number of pauses and halving their mean duration, the reading would fall on the sole-contribution point (1.0,0.5). Conversely, if a participant adapted by halving the number of pauses and maintaining their mean duration, the reading would fall on the other sole-contribution point (0.5,1.0). These two points represent completely one-sided behaviour. On the other hand, if a reader’s adaptation drew on both variables equally, and factoring them gives 0.5, they must both equal  the square root of t (since t = 2 in this case, the [[square root of 2]]). The adaptation thus fell on the equal-contribution point:

(&lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;), equivalent to (0.707,0.707).

Predicting where performers would fall on the curve involved considering the possible advantages and disadvantages of using these two adaptive resources. A strategy of relying entirely on altering pause duration to adapt to a new tempo—falling on (1.0,0.5)—would permit the same number of pauses to be used irrespective of tempo. Theoretically, this would enable readers to use a standardised scanpath across a score, whereas if they changed the number of their pauses to adapt to a new tempo, their scanpath would need to be redesigned, sacrificing the benefits of a standardised approach. There is no doubt that readers are able to change their pause duration and number both from moment to moment and averaged over longer stretches of reading. Musicians typically use a large range of fixation durations within a single reading, even at a stable tempo.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Smith (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, successive fixation durations appear to vary considerably, and seemingly at random; one fixation might be 200&amp;nbsp;ms, the next 370&amp;nbsp;ms, and the next 240&amp;nbsp;ms. (There are no data on successive pause durations in the literature, so mean fixation duration is cited here as a near-equivalent.)

[[Image:Number–duration ratios.jpg|thumbnail|right|400px|Seven of Souter's (2001:139) nine participants clustered around the equal-contribution point]]In the light of this flexibility in varying fixation duration, and since the process of picking up, processing and performing the information on the page is elaborate, it might be imagined that readers prefer to use a standardised scanpath. For example, in four-part, hymn-style textures for keyboard, such as were used in Souter (2001), the information on the score is presented as a series of two-note, optically separated units—two allocated to an upper stave and two to a lower stave for each chord. A standardised scanpath might consist of a sequence of ‘saw-tooth’ movements from the upper stave to the lower stave for a chord, then diagonally across to the upper stave and down to the lower stave of the next chord, and so on. However, numerous studies&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Weaver (1943), Goolsby (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that scanpaths in the reading of a number of musical textures—including melody, four-part hymns, and counterpoint—are not predictable and orderly, but are inherently changeable, with a certain ragged, ad-hoc quality. Music readers appear to turn their backs on the theoretical advantage of standardised scanpath: they are either flexible or ad hoc when it comes to the number of pauses—just as they are with respect to their pause durations—and do not scan a score in a strict, predetermined manner.

Souter hypothesised that the most likely scenario is that both pause duration and number are used to adapt to tempo, and that a number–duration relationship that lies close to the equal-contribution point allows the apparatus the greatest flexibility to adapt to further changes in reading conditions. He reasoned that it may be dysfunctional to use only one of two available adaptive resources, since that would make it more difficult to subsequently use that direction for further adaptation. This hypothesis—that when tempo is increased, the mean number–duration relationship will be in the vicinity of the equal-contribution point—was confirmed by the data in terms of the mean result: when tempo doubled, both the mean number of pauses per chord and the mean pause duration overall fell such that the mean number–duration relationship was (0.705,0.709), close to the equal-contribution point of (0.708, 0.708), with standard deviations of (0.138,0.118). Thus, the stability of scanpath—tenable only when the relationship is (0.5,1.0)—was sacrificed to maintain a relatively stable mean pause duration.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:137). Mean pause duration was 368&amp;nbsp;ms at slow tempo (SD = 44&amp;nbsp;ms) falling to 263&amp;nbsp;ms at fast tempo (SD = 42&amp;nbsp;ms), t(8) = 5.75, ''p'' &lt; 0.001. Correspondingly, the mean number of pauses per chord fell from a mean of 2.75 (SD = 0.30) at slow tempo to 1.94 (SD = 0.28) at fast tempo, t(8) = 6.97, ''p'' &lt; 0.001.&lt;/ref&gt;

This challenged the notion that scanpath (largely or solely) reflects the horizontal or vertical emphasis of the musical texture, as proposed by Sloboda (1985) and Weaver (1943), since these dimensions depend significantly on tempo.

== Conclusions ==
Both logical inference and evidence in the literature point to the fact that there are three oculomotor imperatives in the task of eye movement in music reading. The first imperative seems obvious: the eyes must maintain a pace across the page that is appropriate to the tempo of the music, and they do this by manipulating the number and durations of fixations, and thereby the scanpath across the score. The second imperative is to provide an appropriate rate of refreshment of the information being stored and processed in working memory by manipulating the number and duration of fixations. This workload appears to be related to tempo, stimulus complexity and stimulus familiarity, and there is strong evidence that the capacity for high workload in relation to these variables is also connected with the skill of the reader. The third imperative is to maintain a span size that is appropriate to the reading conditions. The span must not be so small that there is insufficient time to perceive visual input and process it into musculoskeletal commands; it must not be so large that the capacity of the memory system to store and process information is exceeded. Musicians appear to use oculomotor commands to address all three imperatives simultaneously, which are in effect mapped onto each other in the reading process. Eye movement thus embodies a fluid set of characteristics that are not only intimately engaged in engineering the optimal visual input to the apparatus, but in servicing the process of that information in the memory system.&lt;ref&gt;Souter (2001:103)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figura serpentinata''' (Italian - [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpentine]] figure) is a style in painting and sculpture, intended to make the figure seem more dynamic, that is typical of [[Mannerism]]. It is similar, but not identical, to [[contrapposto]], and features figures often in a [[spiral]] pose.&lt;ref name="mma"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/dona/hd_dona.htm|title=Donatello (ca. 1386–1466)|accessdate=November 20, 2007|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2007|author=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early examples can be seen in the work of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]].

Emil Maurer writes of the painter and theorist [[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo]] (1538–1600): "The recommended ideal form unites, after Lomazzo, three qualities: the pyramid, the "serpentinata" movement and a certain numerical proportion, all three united to form one whole. At the same time, precedence is given to the "moto", that is, to the meandering movement, which should make the pyramid, in exact proportion, into the geometrical form of a cone."

[[File:Laokoon-Gruppe-02.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Laocoön group]]
Bousquet holds that the "serpentinata" style arose as a result of the discovery of the [[Laocoön and His Sons|Laocoön group]] in 1506, and its deep impact on all artists, but on Michelangelo in particular.  [[John Shearman]] also argues that it was invented by Michelangelo, citing the "Victors" that he produced for [[Pope Julius II]]'s tomb.  Maurer, on the other hand, can only detect this style rarely in Michelangelo's work and cites [[Beccafumi]] instead as its pioneer. Beccafumi's student [[Marco Pino]] connected Beccafumi's style with those of [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Salviati]], [[Parmigianino]] and perhaps even Michelangelo, and his work as a whole is marked by "serpentinata" motifs. [[Paolo Pino]] himself says in his "Dialogo della Pittura", that his figures' poses are many and varied, and that in all his works to find one single figure, that completely and utterly distorts, is ambivalent and difficult.

As Maurer writes, painters are freer than sculptors and less closely tied-down to nature.  Thus they can play around with their figures, reshaping, overstretching, geometricising, dissolving, caricaturing, colouring, meandering, according to the painting's goal and intended effect.  With the loosening of the norms of the [[Renaissance]] and the development of the "Serpentita" style, that style's structures and rules began to be systematised.  A style of form began by which figures showed physical power, passion, tension and semantic perfection.  Movements were not without motivation, nor even simply done with a will, but with will shown in a pure form.  Also their actions arose not out of power, but powerlessness.

The style exerted an influence even into the 1620s, with [[Bernini]]'s ''[[The Rape of Proserpina (Bernini)|The Rape of Proserpina]]''.

'''''Heartless''''' is a 2009 [[Cinema of United Kingdom|British]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Philip Ridley]] and starring [[Jim Sturgess]], [[Noel Clarke]], [[Clémence Poésy]] and [[Eddie Marsan]]. This was Ridley's first film in fourteen years since 1995's ''[[The Passion of Darkly Noon]]''. The film garnered positive reception from critics who praised the performances and dark atmospheric tone that complemented the [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian plot]].

==Plot==
Jamie Morgan ([[Jim Sturgess]]) is a lonely, troubled photographer with a large heart-shaped birthmark that covers nearly half of his face. He is still a virgin at 25 because a lifetime of alienation and bullying have left him unable to make friends or attract women. At the photographic studio he shares with his brother and nephew Lee, he meets aspiring model Tia ([[Clémence Poésy]]).

As Jamie develops photos from a shoot, he notices a disturbing face looking at him from the window of a house. When he goes back to investigate, he follows a suspicious man to a group of hooded vandals around a fire, who emit eerie shrieks. One notices Jamie and shrieks at him. Jamie is shocked to see a demonic lizard-like face under the hood, with huge pin-like teeth. Over time Jamie becomes aware of a series of horrific murders by Molotov cocktail that have been occurring in the neighbourhood. A witness to one of the murders, a little Asian girl, tells a TV reporter that they weren’t wearing masks; the demonic faces were real. Jamie's neighbour and new-found friend, A.J. ([[Noel Clarke]]) turns up with a huge wound that looks as if it was caused by claw marks. Parts of his dismembered body then turn up in the local area.

Jamie and his mother are walking in the neighborhood when they are attacked by the demonic gang. His mother is immolated while Jamie watches helplessly, and he is savagely beaten and left for dead. While unconscious in hospital he glimpses a man in his dream who says he's waiting for Jamie. Later, he receives a phone call from a man with the same voice, and is guided to the apartment of Papa B ([[Joseph Mawle]]) and his assistant Belle ([[Nikita Mistry]]), who looks just like the little Asian girl from the TV report. Papa B offers a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]]: Jamie must fulfil Papa B's desire for chaos with occasional acts of [[Graffiti|vandalism]] in return for the removal of his birthmarks. Despite Papa B admitting that he was responsible for his mother's death as a way of bringing Jamie to him, Jamie consents and they shake hands. Jamie is told to immolate himself with a Molotov cocktail in order to be reborn. Jamie miraculously survives and peels away his burned skin to reveal perfect, unblemished skin.

Initially things go well: a chance meeting with Tia leads a newly confident Jamie to spend the day with her in the park, where his beloved, deceased father first taught him to use a camera. The deal sours, however, when the Weapons Man ([[Eddie Marsan]]) arrives: Papa B has reneged on their bargain and Jamie must now commit murder by ripping the heart from a living victim. The Weapons Man tortures Jamie until he agrees to kill a street hustler. His hope for a better life returns after he and Tia become lovers. During this time Belle also comes to live with Jamie, after Papa B beat her in a fit of rage. She starts calling Jamie "Dad" and becomes a bit of a guide to him, kindly and pragmatically explaining that he has no choice but to kill, to save his own life—and Belle's. But Papa B is outraged at Belle's betrayal and as punishment demands that Jamie kill a new victim—Tia.

Tia asks Jamie to put a photo album in his work safe, and it is revealed that Tia and Lee ([[Luke Treadaway]]) intended to steal his late mother's jewellery. Tia had initially meant only to help Lee gain access to the safe, but she ended up sincerely falling  in love with Jamie. During the ensuing struggle Tia is accidentally shot and killed, and Lee is seriously wounded by "She", a gang leader to whom he owed money, and who wears a metallic claw in place of a severed hand.

Jamie is pursued by She but fights back and kills him. He notices that a mark on a wall from She's claw looks just like the wound received by A.J. Jamie tells Belle, who has turned up from nowhere, that she must flee to stay safe, and she disappears. Jamie spies himself in a mirror and sees that his birthmark has returned, and with it the knowledge that it had been there the entire time, even while he was courting Tia. Jamie confronts Papa B's minions and fights them off, but when faced with a larger demon, Papa B in his true form, runs away. Viewers are left to decide for themselves whether Papa B cheated Jamie by never removing the birthmark, or if much of what transpired was the product of Jamie's imagination.

After waking up indoors, Jamie staggers outside. On the ground he sees several masks with sharp teeth, and looks up to see several masked and hooded gang members. But these are ordinary masks made of sacks, not the realistic demon faces Jamie has seen so far. Are these the "demons" he had been fighting a short while ago? Jamie now recalls himself walking and talking with Belle—only now he appears to converse with empty space. As realisation sinks in, a gang member catches him with a [[Molotov cocktail]]. As he stands still and burns to death, Jamie experiences a vision of his father, who tells him that you can only see the stars in the blackness of the night. Whether this is a memory or a near-death experience is left unclear. Jamie ascends into bright light. The light fades into a field of stars in the night sky, mirroring the words spoken by his father.

==Music==
The film featured a number of original songs for which Ridley himself had written the lyrics.&lt;ref name="Nick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbicat.com/news/index/?id=2|title=Dreamscape Cradle launched|publisher=Nick Bicât|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music for these songs were composed by Ridley’s long-time collaborator Nick Bicât who had previously written music for productions of Ridley's stage plays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Ridley|title=Ridley Plays 1: The Pitchfork Disney; The Fastest Clock in the Universe; Ghost from a Perfect Place|url=http://www.books.google.co.uk/books?id=bQ18AAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Philip+Ridley+plays+1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAGoVChMI9offhL2EyQIVgpAPCh1siA_n#v=onepage&amp;q=Nick%20Bic%C3%A2t&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 November 2015|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|pages=7, 137|isbn=14081-42333}}&lt;/ref&gt; and films.&lt;ref name="Nick"/&gt; On Nick Bicât's website it states that the songs had been written to act "like a Greek chorus, commenting on the action. Every song in the film—whether heard on the radio, in a club, or used as part of the score".

As well as being the lead actor, Jim Sturges also sang two of the songs in the film's soundtrack. When talking about the film's music Ridley explained that "[Jim Sturgess] heard some of the songs and loved them. He wondered if, perhaps, it would be right for him to sing a couple. To be honest, Jim and I had discussed this possibility much earlier (Jim's talents are boundless. As well as being one of the greatest actors around, he is also a great singer…not to mention song writer, poet—the list goes on!). Initially, we had both agreed it probably wouldn't be right. But as the film progressed, and the exploration of Jamie's mind in the film become ever more obsessive…well, it just seemed to make total sense for Jim to perform the two songs most pertinent to Jamie's state of mind: the theme music, Heartless, and Another Me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimsturgessonline.com/?p=4047|title='HEARTLESS' SOUNDTRACK &amp; JSONLINE STORE|website=JimSturgessOnline.com|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it a 75% approval rating, based on 36 reviews collected: 27 "fresh" and 9 "rotten".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/heartless-2009/|title=Heartless (2010)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Goldstein of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' credited the film to both Jim Sturgess for having "a terrifically watchable presence," and director Philip Ridley for his compelling soundtrack and dark visual direction that "even at its most seemingly outlandish remains intriguing and involving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/10/entertainment/la-et-capsules-20101210|title=Movie review: 'Heartless'|last=Goldstein|first=Gary|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the film for the performances of both Sturgess and Marsan and the direction of scenes that give off a morose tone, concluding that, "There's more mood than matter here, but suspenseful atmospherics effectively distract from minor plot holes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/heartless-1117943916/|title=Review: 'Heartless'|last=Leydon|first=Joe|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Smith of the ''[[New York Post]]'' commented on how the Faust theme and sappy conclusion paled in comparison to the "macabre wit" that Ridley displays throughout the film, calling it "an uneasy mixture of B-movie shocks, social commentary and sentimentality that shows a potent imagination at work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/11/19/heartless/|title=Heartless|last=Smith|first=Kyle|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|date=19 November 2010|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathan Rabin of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a "B–", crediting its second-half moral tale and the brief appearances by Marsan and Spall but felt it was hampered by the first half with its "plodding pace, portentous tone, and underdeveloped characters", concluding that, "Ridley is a master of atmosphere and mood, but his fantastical conceits require a strong protagonist who isn't defined first by his birthmark, then by its absence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/heartless-47936|title=Review: Heartless|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[The Onion]]|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Rawson-Jones of [[Digital Spy]] felt the film wasted its main cast with a promising plot that was half-heartedly executed with failed horror elements and dialogue that telegraphs the story, saying that, "The form and content are a perfect match in ''Heartless''. Both are desperately terrible." He gave the film 1 star out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/review/a220236/heartless.html#~pekIn698LhHIek|title=Heartless|last=Rawson-Jones|first=Ben|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=1 June 2015}} {{Rating|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Schager of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' criticised Ridley for crafting a Faustian film with an empty-headed protagonist, telegraphed plot elements, mixed moral themes and a muddled third act, giving the film 1 star out of 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/heartless|title=Heartless &amp;#124; Film Review|last=Schager|first=Nick|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=1 June 2015}} {{Rating|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of [[libraries]]''' began with the first efforts to organize collections of [[document]]s. Topics of interest include accessibility of the collection, acquisition of materials, arrangement and finding tools, the book trade, the influence of the physical properties of the different writing materials, language distribution, role in education, rates of literacy, budgets, staffing, libraries for specially targeted audiences, architectural merit, patterns of usage, and the role of libraries in a nation's cultural heritage, and the role of government, church or private sponsorship. Since the 1960s issues of computerization and digitization come to the fore.

[[Library history]] is the [[academic discipline]] devoted to the study of the history of libraries; it is a subfield of [[library science]] and of [[history]].

==Early libraries==
[[File:Library of Ashurbanipal The Flood Tablet.jpg|thumb|Tablet from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] containing part of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]]]
The first libraries consisted of [[archive]]s of the [[Writing#The beginning of writing|earliest form of writing]] – the [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]] discovered in temple rooms in [[Sumer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ECBkVPQkNSsC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Libraries in the Ancient World  |first=Lionel |last=Casson|page=3 |publisher=Yale University Press|date= 11 August 2002 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krasner&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html |title=Survivor: The History of the Library |first=Barbara |last= Krasner-Khait |work=History Magazine |year=2010 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some dating back to 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/05/06_tablet.shtml |title= Clay cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia to be placed online |first=Kathleen |last= Maclay |date=6 May 2003 |website=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; About an inch thick, tablets came in various shapes and sizes. Mud like clay was placed in the wooden frames, and the surface was smoothed for writing and allowed to dry until damp. After being inscribed, the clay dried in the sun, or for a harder finish, was baked in a kiln. For storage, tablets could be stacked on edge, side by side, the contents described by a title written on the edge that faced out and was readily seen. The first libraries appeared five thousand years ago in Southwest Asia's Fertile Crescent, the area that ran from Mesopotamia to the Nile in Africa. Known as the cradle of civilization, the Fertile Crescent was the birthplace of writing, sometime before three thousand BC. (Murray, Stuart A.P.) These archives, which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions or inventories, mark the end of [[prehistory]] and the start of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin (2008) ''Prehistory The Making of the Human Mind'', New York: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3QZXvUhGwhAC&amp;pg=PA35 |title=A Short History of the World  |first=John Morris|page=35 |last= Roberts |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things were much the same in the government and temple records on [[papyrus]] of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt; The earliest discovered private archives were kept at [[Ugarit]]; besides correspondence and inventories, texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes. There is also evidence of libraries at [[Nippur]] about 1900 BC and those at [[Nineveh]] about 700 BC showing a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;''The American International Encyclopedia'', New York: J. J. Little &amp; Ives, 1954; Volume IX&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 30,000 clay tablets from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] have been discovered at Nineveh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/ashurbanipal_library_phase_1.aspx |title='Assurbanipal Library Phase 1', British Museum One |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing modern scholars with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious and administrative work. Among the findings were the [[Enuma Elish]], also known as ''[[Enûma Eliš|the Epic of Creation]],''&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Creation", in [[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]]. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 233–81&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts a traditional [[Babylonia]]n view of creation, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Gilgamesh", in Dalley, Stephanie. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 50–135&lt;/ref&gt; a large selection of "omen texts" including ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' which "contained omens dealing with the moon, its visibility, eclipses, and conjunction with planets and fixed stars, the sun, its corona, spots, and eclipses, the weather, namely lightning, thunder, and clouds, and the planets and their visibility, appearance, and stations",&lt;ref&gt;Van De Mieroop, Marc (2007). ''A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000–323 BC''. Oxford, UK: [[Blackwell Publishing]]. p.&amp;nbsp;263&lt;/ref&gt; and astronomic/astrological texts, as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists, bilingual vocabularies, lists of signs and synonyms, and lists of medical diagnoses.

Philosopher [[Laozi]] was keeper of books in the earliest library in China, which belonged to the Imperial [[Zhou dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Mukherjee, A. K 1966 p. 86"&gt;Mukherjee, A. K. (1966). ''Librarianship: Its Philosophy and History''. Asia Publishing House. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Also, evidence of catalogues found in some destroyed ancient libraries illustrates the presence of librarians.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee, A. K 1966 p. 86"/&gt;

==Classical period==
[[File:Ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|Artistic rendering of the [[Library of Alexandria]], based on some archaeological evidence]]
The [[Library of Alexandria]], in [[Egypt]], was the largest and most significant [[Great libraries of the ancient world|great library of the ancient world]].&lt;ref name="Sagan, C. 1980"&gt;Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan, C 1980, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&amp;feature=related "Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean"]&lt;/ref&gt; It flourished under the patronage of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (323–283 BC) or during the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;II]] (283–246 BC).&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"&gt;Phillips, Heather A., [http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm "The Great Library of Alexandria?"]. Library Philosophy and Practice, August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An early organization system was in effect at Alexandria.&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt;

The [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]], [[Anatolia]], now part of [[Selçuk]], [[Turkey]] was built in honor of the [[Roman Senator]] [[Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Swain, Simon |title=Dio Chrysostom: Politics, Letters, and Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |page=57 |isbn=9780199255214 |quote= Nevertheless, in 92 the same office went to a Greek, Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, who belonged to a family of priests of Rome hailing from Sardis; entering the Senate under Vespasian, he was subsequently to be appointed proconsul of Asia under Trajan, possibly in 105/6. Celsus' son, Aquila, was also to be made suffectus in 110, although he is certainly remembered more as the builder of the famous library his father envisioned for Ephesus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Nicols, John 1978 109 "&gt;{{cite book |author= Nicols, John |title= Vespasian and the partes Flavianae |publisher= Steiner |year= 1978 |page=109 |isbn= 9783515023931 |quote= Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus (PIR2 J 260) was a Romanized Greek of Ephesus or Sardes who became the first eastern consul.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (completed in AD 135) by Celsus' son, [[Gaius Julius Aquila]] ([[consul]], 110). The library was built to store 12,000 [[scroll]]s and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus. The library's ruins were hidden under debris of the city of Ephesus that was deserted in early Middle Ages.  In 1903, Austrian excavations led to this hidden heap of rubble that had collapsed during an earthquake. The donator's son built the library to honor his father's memory and construction began around 113 or 114. Presently, visitors only see the remains of the library's facade.&lt;ref&gt;Strocka, Volke, M. (2003). The Celsus Library. ''Ancient libraries of Anatolia: libraries of Hatusha, Pergamon, Ephesus, Nysa.''(Ankara): Middle East Technical University Library, 2003, pp. 33–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private or personal libraries made up of written books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives) appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. The celebrated book collectors of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] were listed in the late 2nd century in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]''. All these libraries were Greek; the cultivated Hellenized diners in ''Deipnosophistae'' pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus there were public libraries near the forums of Rome: there were libraries in the [[Porticus Octaviae]] near the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Ulpian Library in the [[Forum of Trajan]]. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the [[Roman Forum]] and the [[Capitoline Hill]].

Private libraries appeared during the late republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''armaria'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: "by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, [[Maecenas]]'s several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all described in surviving letters. At the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site.

[[File:Ephesus Celsus Library Façade.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Library of Celsus]] at Ephesus]]
In the West, the first public libraries were established under the [[Roman Empire]] as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor. Rome's first public library was established by [[Asinius Pollio]]. Pollio was a lieutenant of [[Julius Caesar]] and one of his most ardent supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, L. (2001). Libraries in the Ancient World. New Haven: Yale University Press; Ewald, L. A. (2004). Library Culture in Ancient Rome, 100 B.C. – A.D. 400. Kentucky Libraries, 68(1), 9–11; Buchanan, S. (2012). Designing the Research Commons: Classical Models for School Libraries. School Libraries Worldwide, 18(1), 56–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollios's library, the ''Anla Libertatis'',&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; which was housed in the ''Atrium Libertatis'', was centrally located near the [[Forum Romanum]]. It was the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into Greek and Latin. All subsequent Roman public libraries will have this design.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of Rome's civil wars following the death of [[Marcus Antonius]] in 30 BC, the Emperor Augustus sought to reconstruct many of Rome's damaged buildings. During this construction, Augustus created two more public libraries. The first was the library of the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, often called the [[Palatine library]], and the second was the library of the ''Porticus of Octaviae''.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 81; Buchanan, 2012, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more libraries were added by the [[Emperor Tiberius]] on Palatine Hill and one by Vespasian after 70. Vespasian's library was constructed in the [[Imperial Forums|Forum of Vespasian]], also known as the ''Forum of Peace'', and became one of Rome's principal libraries. The ''Bibliotheca Pacis'' was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for Greek and Latin libraries containing the works of Galen and Lucius Aelius.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;84; Buchanan, 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;61–62&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best preserved was the ancient Ulpian Library built by the Emperor Trajan. Completed in 112/113 AD, the [[Ulpian Library]] was part of Trajan's Forum built on the Capitoline Hill. Trajan's Column separated the Greek and Latin rooms which faced each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;10; Buchanan, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;62; Casson, p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was approximately fifty feet high with the peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, G. W. (2008). Tiberius and the Libraries: Public Book Collections and Library Buildings in the Early Roman Empire. Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record, 43, 247–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Greek libraries, readers had direct access to the scrolls, which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room. Reading or copying was normally done in the room itself. The surviving records give only a few instances of lending features. Most of the large [[Roman bath]]s were also cultural centres, built from the start with a library, a two-room arrangement with one room for Greek and one for Latin texts.

Libraries were filled with [[scroll (parchment)|parchment scrolls]] as at [[Library of Pergamum]] and on [[papyrus]] scrolls as at [[Alexandria]]: the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce. There were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public (such as the Serapeum collection of the [[Library of Alexandria]], once the largest [[Great libraries of the ancient world|library in the ancient world]]),&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt; but on the whole collections were private. In those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks. In all recorded cases the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway.

In 213 BC during the reign of Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang#Book burning period|Qin Shi Huang]] most books were ordered destroyed. The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) reversed this policy for replacement copies, and created three imperial libraries. [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] a curator of the imperial library was the first to establish a [[library classification]] system and the first book notation system. The seven Epitomes would be created as the cataloging system started by Liu Xiang and finished by his son Liu Xin. The title of the Seven Epitomes seems to suggest its classification to have seven classes. In fact, it comprised six main classes and 38 divisions or subclasses. Preceding the six classes was the Collective Epitome - thus the title Seven Epitomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=715868e9-af9d-47fc-8a1e-fae1b140sessionmgr101ea3764%|title=Proclaiming Intellectual Authority Through Classification: The Case of the Seven Epitomes|last=Lee|first=Hur-Li|date=31 March 2010|website=Ebscohost|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time the [[library catalog]] was written on scrolls of fine silk and stored in silk bags.

The Ming Dynasty in 1407 founded the imperial library, the Wen Yuan Pavilion. It also sponsored the massive compilation of the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]], containing 11,000 volumes including copies of over 7000 books. It was soon destroyed, but similar very large compilations appeared in 1725 and 1772.

==Late Antiquity==
[[File:Bibl. Malatestiana 3.jpg|thumb|[[Malatestiana Library]] of [[Cesena]], the first [[Europe]]an civic library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stradavinisaporifc.it/cesena.asp |title=Stradavinisaporifc.it |publisher=Stradavinisaporifc.it |date= |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages periods, there was no Rome of the kind that ruled the Mediterranean for centuries and spawned the culture that produced twenty-eight public libraries in the ''urbs Roma''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Bischoff|Bischoff, B.]] and [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Gorman, M.]] (1994). ''Manuscripts and libraries in the age of Charlemagne''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The empire had been divided then later re-united again under [[Constantine the Great]] who moved the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330 AD to the city of Byzantium which was renamed [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, K. K. (2004). ''The history of the library in Western civilization''. New Castle, Del.: Oak Knoll Press, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman intellectual culture that flourished in ancient times was undergoing a transformation as the academic world moved from laymen to Christian clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; As the West crumbled, books and libraries flourished and flowed east toward the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=S. A. P. |year=2009 |title=The Library: An illustrated history |location=New York |publisher=Sky Horse Publishing |page=24 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There, four different types of libraries were established: imperial, patriarchal, monastic, and private.&lt;ref&gt;Papademetriou, G. C. (2000). "The Patriarchal libraries of Constantinople". ''Greek Orthodox Theological Review'', 45(1–4), 171–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Each had its own purpose and, as a result, their survival varied.

Christianity was a new force in Europe and many of the faithful saw Hellenistic culture as pagan. As such, many classical Greek works, written on scrolls, were left to decay as only Christian texts were thought fit for preservation in a codex, the progenitor of the modern book.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011). ''Books: A living history''.

In Byzantium, much of this work devoted to preserving Hellenistic thought in codex form was performed in [[scriptoriums]] by monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=H.

These libraries were devoted solely to the education of the monks and were seen as essential to their spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peterson|2010|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of these texts that were produced were Christian in nature, many monastic leaders saw common virtues in the Greek classics. As a result, many of these Greek works were copied, and thus saved, in monastic scriptoriums.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peterson|2010|pp=330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Europe passed into the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Byzantine scriptoriums laboriously preserved Greco-Roman classics. As a result, Byzantium revived Classical models of education and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=J. W. |year=1957 |title=The medieval library |location=New York |publisher=Hafner Publishing Co. |page=311 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]] was an important depository of ancient knowledge. Constantine himself wanted such a library but his short rule denied him the ability to see his vision to fruition. His son [[Constantius II]] made this dream a reality and created an '''imperial library''' in a portico of the royal palace.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"&gt;{{harvp|Thompson|1957|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ruled for 24 years and accelerated the development of the library and the intellectual culture that came with such a vast accumulation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius II appointed [[Themistius]], a pagan philosopher and teacher, as chief architect of this library building program. Themistius set about a bold program to create an imperial public library that would be the centerpiece of the new intellectual capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Classical authors such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Isocrates]], [[Thucydides]], [[Homer]], and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] were sought. Themeistius hired calligraphers and craftsman to produce the actual codices. He also appointed educators and created a university-like school centered around the library.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Constantius II, [[Julian the Apostate]], a bibliophile intellectual, ruled briefly for less than three years. Despite this, he had a profound impact on the imperial library and sought both Christian and pagan books for its collections.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"/&gt; Later, the [[Emperor Valens]] hired Greek and Latin scribes full-time with from the royal treasury to copy and repair manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thompson|1957|pp=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height in the 5th century, the Imperial Library of [[Constantinople]] had 120,000 volumes and was the largest library in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thompson|1957|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fire in 477 consumed the entire library but it was rebuilt only to be burned again in 726, 1204, and in 1453 when [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hillerbrand |first=H. J. |year=2006 |title=On book burnings and book burners: Reflections on the power (and powerlessness) of ideas |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]] |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=593–614 |doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj117 |jstor=4094001}} p.&amp;nbsp;603.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriarchal libraries''' fared no better, and sometimes worse, than the Imperial Library. The Library of the Patriarchate of Constantinople was founded most likely during the reign of Constantine the Great in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As a theological library, it was known to have employed a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as a repository of several [[ecumenical councils]] such as the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], [[Council of Ephesus]], and the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. The library, which employed a librarian and assistants, may have been originally located in the Patriarch's official residence before it was moved to the Thomaites Triclinus in the 7th century. While much is not known about the actual library itself, it is known that many of its contents were subject to destruction as religious in-fighting ultimately resulted in [[book burnings]].&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, small '''private libraries''' existed. Many of these were owned by church members and the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;429&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also were known to have small personal libraries as well as wealthy bibliophiles who could afford the highly ornate books of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thompson|1957|pp=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the 6th century, at the close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and [[Library of Alexandrina|Alexandria]]. [[Cassiodorus]], minister to Theodoric, established a monastery at Vivarium in the toe of Italy (modern Calabria) with a library where he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus not only collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of reading and methods for copying texts accurately. In the end, however, the library at Vivarium was dispersed and lost within a century.

Through [[Origen]] and especially the scholarly presbyter [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], an avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a reputation for having the [[Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima|most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time]], containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: [[Gregory Nazianzus]], [[Basil the Great]], [[Jerome]] and others came and studied there.

==Islamic lands==
[[image:Chinguetti-biblio.jpg|thumb|Inside a Qur'anic Library in [[Chinguetti]], Mauritania]]
The first libraries in Muslim lands were not necessarily for the public, but they contained much knowledge. The need for the preservation of the Quran, the Muslim Holy Book, and the Traditions of the Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam is what led to the collection of writings in the Muslim world. Where traditions and history used to be oral, the need to preserve the words of the Quran necessitated a method of preserving the words by some means other than orally. Mosques that were the center of everything in an Muslim societies day-to-day life became also libraries that stored and preserved all knowledge, from the Quran to books on religion, philosophy and science. 
"Under the Abbasids, Muslims formed the vanguard of civilization. The Abbasids were influenced by the Quran and Hadith such as, "the ink of scholar is equal to the blood of martyr,&lt;ref&gt;Wani, Z. A., &amp; Maqbol, T. (2012). The Islamic Era and Its Importance to Knowledge and the Development of Libraries. ''Library Philosophy &amp; Practice'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; "stressing the value of knowledge."  With the passion of the Caliphs to establish centers of knowledge, the Muslim world quickly began to have different centers that housed libraries which contained encyclopedias, translations, commentaries and treatises written by Muslim philosophers, scholars and scientists. 
With the discovery of paper, the Muslim world quickly began to progress in its development of libraries, and "libraries (royal, public, specialised, private) had become common and bookmen (authors, translators, copiers, illuminators, librarians, booksellers' collectors) from all classes and sections of society, of all nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, vied with each other in the production and distribution of books.&lt;ref&gt;Wani, Z. A., &amp; Maqbol, T. (2012). The Islamic Era and Its Importance to Knowledge and the Development of Libraries. ''Library Philosophy &amp; Practice'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;"

By the 8th century first [[Iran]]ians and then [[Arab]]s had imported the craft of [[papermaking]] from China, with a [[paper mill]] already at work in [[Baghdad]] in 794. By the 9th century [[public libraries]] started to appear in many Islamic cities. They were called "halls of Science" or ''dar al-'ilm''. They were each endowed by [[Islam]]ic sects with the purpose of representing their tenets as well as promoting the dissemination of secular knowledge. In Baghdad, the library was known as the [[House of Wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Murray|2009|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also was a university where numerous scholars and copyists translated works from other nations into Arabic.  he 9th-century [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]] of [[Iraq]], ordered the construction of a "zawiyat qurra"&amp;nbsp;– an enclosure for readers which was "lavishly furnished and equipped". In [[Shiraz]] Adhud al-Daula (d. 983) set up a library, described by the medieval historian, [[al-Muqaddasi]], as "a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an upper and a lower story with a total, according to the chief official, of 360 rooms.... In each [[Departmentalization|department]], [[Library catalog|catalogues]] were placed on a shelf... the rooms were furnished with carpets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Al-Muqaddasi: Ahsan al-Taqasim|editor=de Goeje, M. J.|year=1906|encyclopedia=Bibliotheca geographorum Arabicorum|language=Arabic |volume=III|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden |pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in order to render into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the bulk of the available [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Roman and [[Sanskrit]] non-fiction and the classics of literature.

It should also be noted that Islamic states in Africa began to see a rapid development in education from the 11th century. Libraries of particular importance would include that of [[Timbuktu]], which held many manuscripts that were important for over 600 years in the [[Ghana Empire|Ghanan]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]] and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] empires. One of the most notable authors was [[Ahmad Baba al Massufi|Ahmad Baba]] who wrote over 40 manuscripts – widely considered as being one of the most influential scholars from Timbuktu. Many of the manuscripts and buildings were destroyed by the [[Battle of Tondibi|Arab-European invasion]] in 1591 and writers, such as Ahmad Baba were taken into captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Destruction of Black Civilisation|last = Williams|first = Chancellor|publisher = Third World Press|year = 1987|isbn = 9780883780305|location = Chicago|pages = 207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this and the poor preservation conditions as many as 700,000 manuscripts still survive today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hidden Treasure of Timbuktu|last = Antonson|first = Rick|publisher = Dundurn Toronto|year = 2008|isbn = 9780500514214|location = |pages = 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flowering of Islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began declining in the [[Islamic world]], after many of these libraries were destroyed by [[Mongol invasions]]. Others were victim of wars and religious strife in the Islamic world. However, a few examples of these medieval libraries, such as the libraries of [[Chinguetti]] in [[West Africa]], remain intact and relatively unchanged. Another ancient library from this period which is still operational and expanding is the [[Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi]] in the Iranian city of [[Mashhad]], which has been operating for more than six centuries.

The contents of these Islamic libraries were copied by Christian monks in Muslim/Christian border areas, particularly Spain and Sicily. From there they eventually made their way into other parts of Christian [[Europe]]. These copies joined works that had been preserved directly by Christian monks from Greek and Roman originals, as well as copies Western Christian monks made of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] works. The resulting conglomerate libraries are the basis of every modern library today.

==Asia==
The spread of religion and philosophy in South and East Asia spurred the development of writing and books.  Chinese emperors were very supportive of this culture.  Chinese printing and papermaking, which predate Western development, gave birth to a thriving book culture in East Asia.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Several Asian religious and philosophical movements are responsible for stimulating learning, printing and book collecting: Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Jainism.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;  Jainism, a major faith of the Indian subcontinent, had a tradition of religious, scientific, and cultural scholarship.  Early practitioners of the faith not only produced scriptural writing the first century BC, but also established some of Asia's earliest libraries.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;  Mainly housed in temples, these libraries later became known as "Jain Knowledge Warehouses" and is responsible for the preservation of hundreds of thousands handwritten manuscripts.
The invention of paper in China allowed the Chinese to create an early form of printing (stone-rubbing).  Writings the sixth-century philosopher, Confucius, were originally inscribed on stone tablets. To achieve this early form of printing the Chinese would push soft paper onto the stone, apply ink to the back of the sheet, resulting in a black background with white letters.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;  The Chinese also employed inked carved woodblock to produce printed materials.  One the major Buddhist cannons, the ''Tripitaka,'' was published in 5,000 volumes using more than 130,000 individual woodblocks.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; In the eleventh century movable type was developed in China and Koreans established the first foundry for producing movable type.  In spite of these developments, woodblock printing remained the norm in China, Korea, and Japan.  Each ruler in China compiled its own official written archives.  Every emperor decided which philosophical texts, which accounts of history, which rituals of faith, and what poetry and literature would be permitted in the empire; oftentimes chronicling their own version of the previous ruler's history.  Confucian and Buddhist writings that were brought to Korea and Japan are directly responsible for the continued development of book publishing and library building in East Asia.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

[[Buddhist scriptures]], educational materials, and histories were stored in libraries in pre-modern [[Southeast Asia]]. In [[Burma]], a royal library called the [[Pitakataik (Bagan)|Pitakataik]] was legendarily founded by King [[Anawrahta]];&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zoq_TtEN54IC&amp;pg=PA29 International dictionary of library histories]'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, British envoy [[Michael Symes (diplomat)|Michael Symes]], on visiting this library, wrote that "it is not improbable that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate, from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China". In Thailand libraries called [[ho trai]] were built throughout the country, usually on stilts above a pond to prevent bugs from eating at the books.

==European Middle Ages==
[[File:Merton College library hall.jpg|thumb|[[Merton College Library]]]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], monastery libraries developed, such as the important one at the [[Abbey of Montecassino]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crossingitaly.net/travel/936/montecassino-one-of-the-most-important-libraries-in-the-world/ |title=Montecassino, one of the most important libraries in the world. |work=crossingitaly.net |year=2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books were usually [[chained libraries|chained to the shelves]], reflecting the fact that [[manuscripts]], which were created via the labour-intensive process of hand copying, were valuable possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jM-OY0LCHCEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Chained+libraries&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=guNVT9v8CMTV8QPmmaTbCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chained%20libraries&amp;f=false |title=The Chained Library|first=Burnett Hillman |last=Streeter | authorlink = Burnett Hillman Streeter|publisher=Cambridge University Press |date= 10 March 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this protectiveness, many libraries loaned books if provided with security deposits (usually money or a book of equal value). Lending was a means by which books could be copied and spread. In 1212 the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is "one of the chief works of mercy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages|author=Geo. Haven Putnam|year=1962|publisher=Hillary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early libraries located in monastic [[cloister]]s and associated with [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] were collections of lecterns with books chained to them. Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of [[Bookcase|bookpresses]]. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in [[carrel desk|carrels]] (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This "stall system" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries. In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This "wall system" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's [[El Escorial]].

Also, in [[Eastern Christianity]] monastery libraries kept important manuscripts. The most important of them were the ones in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] for [[Orthodox Christians]], and the library of the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]] for the [[Coptic Church]].

==Renaissance==
[[File:Biblioteca medicea laurenziana interno 01.JPG|thumb|Reading room of the [[Laurentian Library]]]]
From the 15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an "[[academy]]" of scholars congregated in each Italian city of consequence. [[Malatesta Novello]], [[Signoria|lord]] of [[Cesena]], founded the [[Malatestiana Library]]. [[Cosimo de Medici]] in [[Florence]] established his own collection, which formed the basis of the [[Laurentian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html Survivor: the History of the Library], history-magazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, the papal collections were brought together by [[Pope Nicholas V]], in separate Greek and Latin libraries, and housed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who consigned the [[Vatican Library|Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]] to the care of his librarian, the humanist [[Bartolomeo Platina]] in February 1475.&lt;ref&gt;This section on Roman Renaissance libraries follows Kenneth M. Setton, "From Medieval to Modern Library" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''104'''.4, Dedication of the APS Library Hall, Autumn General Meeting, November 1959 (August 1960:371–390) p. 372 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the Hungarian Bibliotheca Corviniana was one of the first and largest Renaissance Greek-Latin library, established by Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary between 1458 and 1490. In 1490, the library consisted of about 3,000 codices or "Corvinae". Beatrix of Aragon  Queen of Hungary encouraged his work with the Bibliotheca Corviniana. Lots of Corvinaes made in Florence and inspired Lorenzo Medici to found his own Greek-Latin library. The Turkish invasion of Hungary in the 16th century destroyed the codices.

In the 16th century [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] bisected Bramante's [[Cortile del Belvedere]] with a cross-wing to house the Apostolic Library in suitable magnificence. The 16th and 17th centuries saw other privately endowed libraries assembled in Rome: the [[Biblioteca Vallicelliana|Vallicelliana]], formed from the books of Saint [[Filippo Neri]], with other distinguished libraries such as that of [[Cesare Baronio]], the [[Biblioteca Angelica]] founded by the Augustinian [[Angelo Rocca]], which was the only truly public library in Counter-Reformation Rome; the Biblioteca Alessandrina with which [[Pope Alexander VII]] endowed the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]; the [[Biblioteca Casanatense]] of the Cardinal [[Girolamo Casanate]]; and finally the Biblioteca Corsiniana founded by the bibliophile [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII Corsini]] and his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, still housed in Palazzo Corsini in via della Lungara. The [[Republic of Venice]] patronized the foundation of the [[Biblioteca Marciana]], based on the library of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]]. In Milan Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]] founded the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

This trend soon spread outside of Italy, for example [[Louis III, Elector Palatine]] founded the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] of [[Heidelberg]].

These libraries don't have as many volumes as the modern libraries. However, they keep many valuable manuscripts of Greek, Latin and Biblical works. After the invention of the printing press, many Renaissance libraries began to collect printed texts as well as valuable manuscripts. This shift in collection materials took place within a hundred-year period- from 1550 to 1650- where the collection of texts shifted between luxury collectibles to printed texts filled with useful information. The transition of collections during the Renaissance was not just a shift exclusively from manuscripts to printed texts, although this did categorize the shift, but from books as expensive luxury artifacts both in print and in manuscript form to an expenditure on multiple copies of printed texts which held valuable, intellectual practicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Warren |last=Boutcher |year=2011 |title=Collecting Manuscripts and Printed Books in the Late Renaissance: Naudé and the Last Duke of Urbino's Library |journal=Italian Studies |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=206–220 |doi=10.1179/174861811X13009843386558 |ref=harv}} p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt;  This shift can be seen as one from a textually aesthetic point of view to one where texts held intellectual usefulness. One example is the library at the [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino|Ducal Palace in Urbino]], Italy. The collection of the Ducal Palace library of Urbino is evidence of two different economies of collecting: luxury and intellectual. The older library served to collect texts which served primarily to memorialize the history of the Duke of Urbino's relations and show his magnificence, while the new library served primarily as an information retrieval system for contemporary scholars to research with and discuss.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Boutcher|2011|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to manuscripts and information based texts, the Ducal library also housed what we would consider now as archival materials. This included a collection of Renaissance newsletter manuscripts, diplomatic, engineering, military, and other political and moral documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Boutcher|2011|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tianyi Chamber]], founded in 1561 by Fan Qin during the [[Ming Dynasty]], is the oldest existing library in China. In its heyday it boasted a collection of 70,000 volumes of antique boo

==Enlightenment era libraries==
[[File:Thomas Bodley.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Bodley]] founded the [[Bodleian Library]] in 1602 as an early public library.]]
The 17th and 18th centuries include what is known as a golden age of libraries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bYGrRynxtMUC&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A history of information storage and retrieval |page=93 |first=Foster |last= [[Foster Stockwell|Stockwell]] |publisher=McFarland |year= 2001 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; during this some of the more important libraries were founded in Europe. [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] of St. Wulfram's Church, [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]] was founded in 1598 by the rector of nearby Welbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.granthamtoday.co.uk/sites/history/gh_wulf.html |title=Historic Grantham |accessdate=11 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116172337/http://www2.granthamtoday.co.uk/sites/history/gh_wulf.html |archivedate=16 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Bodley]] founded the [[Bodleian Library]], which was open to the "whole republic of the learned", [[Norwich]] City library was established in 1608&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norfolkrecordsociety.org.uk/reviews/LXXII.htm|title=Norwich City Library 1608–1737: The Minutes, Donation Book and Catalogue of Norwich City Library, Founded in 1608|last=Anon|work=Norfolk Record Society|publisher=Norfolk Record Society|accessdate=18 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711070121/http://www.norfolkrecordsociety.org.uk/reviews/LXXII.htm|archivedate=11 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Library]] was established in 1753. [[Chetham's Library]] in Manchester, which claims to be the oldest public library in the English-speaking world, opened in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chethams.org.uk/|title=Welcome to Chetham's Library|last=Anon|work=Chetham's Library Home page |accessdate=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early town libraries of the UK include those of [[Ipswich]] (1612), [[Bristol]] (founded in 1613 and opened in 1615), and [[Leicester]] (1632). Shrewsbury School also opened its library to townsfolk.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Anthony "Open Shelves", ''TLS'', 8 December 2006, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]] was initially the personal library of cardinal [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] (1602–1661), who was a great bibliophile. His first library, arranged by his librarian, [[Gabriel Naudé]], was dispersed when he had to flee Paris during the ''[[Fronde]]''.  He then began a second library with what was left of the first, assisted by the successor to Naudé, François de La Poterie. At his death he bequeathed his library, which he had opened to scholars since 1643, to the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] which he had founded in 1661. The [[Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève]] was also founded in Paris, the [[Austrian National Library]] in Vienna, the [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library]] in Florence, the [[Prussian State Library]] in Berlin, the [[Załuski Library]] in Warsaw and the [[M.E. Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library]] in St Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Information and Storage Retrieval|author=Stockwell, Foster |year=2000 |isbn=0-7864-0840-5 |publisher=North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But this golden age was not just some prosaic period of great expansion to the number and accessibility of the libraries of Europe; it was also a period of great conflict.   [[Reformation|The Reformation]] did not just inspire a redistribution of power but also a redistribution of wealth and knowledge. While the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648) decimated the population of Europe (from 21 million at the beginning of the conflict to 13&amp;nbsp;million by the end) it also aided in the redistribution of this wealth and knowledge.&lt;ref name = "Murray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=Library: an illustrated history.|date=2012|publisher=W W Norton|location=New York|isbn=9781616084530}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}}

Often the plunder of this conflict included the recovery of books from looted monasteries and libraries.&lt;ref name = "Murray" /&gt;{{rp|116}}  Given the large cost associated with the creation of the codex it should come as little surprise that books would be seen as a prize of both pecuniary and scholastic wealth, enough that a Bavarian noble sent the captured contents of the [[Bibliotheca Palatina|Palatine Library of Heidelberg]] to the Vatican as a trophy to the Pope.&lt;ref name = "Murray" /&gt;{{rp|118–119}}  On the other side of the conflict, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] specifically targeted Jesuit schools and seminaries and had wagon loads of loot (seized books and manuscripts) returned to the libraries of his home.&lt;ref name = "Murray" /&gt;{{rp|118}}   Large volumes of books changed hands during the Thirty Years War and eventually found their way across Europe where new libraries sprang up to house these redistributed treasures.

In addition to stores of knowledge being shuffled around as spoils of war, the printing press created economies of scale that allowed for the exchange of books to become more commonplace.&lt;ref name = "Murray" /&gt;{{rp|119–120}}  Book fairs were the most merchants most common choice of sale and catalogs were their most common choice of organization.&lt;ref name = "Murray" /&gt;{{rp|120}}

The collectors of this period helped shape the 'form' of libraries.  We can see echoes of many of their innovations in the tropes of today's libraries.  As noted previously, influenced by the ideals of Gabriel Naude, Cardinal Jules Mazarin proclaimed his library "open to everybody without exception".&lt;ref name = "Murray" /&gt;{{rp|122}}  Also, possibly inspiring a trope, [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Bruce Cotton]] organized his library with the placement of busts of ancient Romans at the tops of his shelves and cataloged his contents alphanumerically based on the name of the shelf (bust) and the books physical position on the shelf (by number of books preceding it).&lt;ref name = "Murray" /&gt;{{rp|123–124}}

At the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Thomas |year=1966 |title=Early Public Libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850 |location=London |publisher=Library Association |page=94 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Predeek, Albert (1947) ''A History of Libraries in Great Britain and North America''. Chicago: American Library Association; p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[British Museum]] existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public, or even to a majority of the population. Access to the Museum depended on passes, of which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of the library. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew (2003) ''Library: an unquiet history''; p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Subscription library}}
[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|The [[British Museum]] was established in 1751 and had a library containing over 50,000 books.]]
At the start of the 19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"&gt;{{harvp|Kelly|1966|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one important library in Britain, namely [[Chetham's Library]] in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"/&gt; However, there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis.

The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial [[subscription library|subscription libraries]]. Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as [[biography]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[travel]], rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel.

Unlike a [[public library]], access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late 17th century England, such as [[Chetham's Library]] in 1653, [[Innerpeffray Library]] in 1680 and [[Thomas Plume|Thomas Plume's Library]] in 1704. In the [[Colonial America|American colonies]], [[the Library Company of Philadelphia]] was started in 1731 by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, PA]].

The increasing production and demand for fiction promoted by commercial markets led to the rise of [[circulating library|circulating libraries]], which met a need that subscription libraries did not fulfil. William Bathoe claimed that his commercial venture was 'the Original Circulating library', opening doors at two locations in London in 1737.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;Raven, James. "Libraries for sociability: the advance of subscription library." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols.

"Circulating libraries in the Victorian age and after." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|thumb|left|[[Załuski Library|Biblioteka Załuskich]], built in [[Warsaw]] in the mid 18th century.|130x130px]]
Subscription libraries were democratic in nature; created by and for communities of local subscribers who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, in order to raise funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.&lt;ref name=Forster&gt;Forster, Geoffrey, and Alan Bell. "The subscription libraries and their members." The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 147-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain there were more than 200 commercial circulating libraries open in 1800, more than twice the number of subscription and private proprietary libraries that were operating at the same time.  Many proprietors pandered to the most fashionable clientele, making much ado about the sort of shop they offered, the lush interiors, plenty of room and long hours of service.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt; "These 'libraries' would be called rental collections today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Scarecrow Press |isbn = 081082972X |publication-place = Metuchen, N.J |title = History of libraries in the western world |author = Michael H.

===Private libraries===
[[File:Linen Hall Library, 1888.jpg|thumb|The [[Linen Hall Library]] was an 18th-century [[subscription library]]. Pictured in 1888, shortly before its demolition.]]
Private subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries, though they varied in many important ways. One of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was a gentleman's only library. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"&gt;{{harvp|Kelly|1966|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool [[Subscription library]] was a gentlemen only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelly|1966|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were History, Antiquities, and Geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and Belles Lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelly|1966|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul. Libraries and Their Users. Page 29. The Library Association. 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Donald McDonald, stationer, and his Circulating Library, Gulgong, 1870.jpg|left|thumb| [[Circulating library]] and stationery shop, [[Gulgong]], Australia 1870.]]
Private subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the nineteenth the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964); p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal what was known as the Economical Library, "designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelly|1966|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the Artizans' library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings. The subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"/&gt;

{{Main|National library}}

===Origins===
[[Image:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|200x200px|The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] is but one of the treasures collected by [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]].]]
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.

One of the first plans for a national library was devised by the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[John Dee]], who in 1556 presented [[Mary I of England]] with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, but his proposal was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;Fell-Smith, Charlotte (1909) ''[http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/ John Dee: 1527–1608]''. London: Constable and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Sir [[Richard Bentley]]'s ''Proposal for Building a Royal Library'' published in 1694 stimulated renewed interest in the subject. [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington]], a wealthy [[antiquarian]], amassed the richest private collection of [[manuscript]]s in the world at the time and founded the [[Cotton Library]]. After the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], many priceless and ancient manuscripts that had belonged to the monastic libraries began to be disseminated among various owners, many of whom were unaware of the cultural value of the manuscripts.  Sir Robert's genius was in finding, purchasing and preserving these ancient documents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Aikin]]. ''The Lives of John Selden, Esq., and Archbishop Usher; With Notices of the Principal English Men of Letters with Whom They Were Connected''. 1812. p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death his grandson donated the library to the nation as its first national library. This transfer established the formation of the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/manuscripts/cottonmss/cottonmss.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46991 "An Act for the better settling and preserving the Library kept in the House at Westminster called Cotton House in the Name and Family of the Cottons for the Benefit of the Publick"] [Chapter VII.

===National libraries===
[[File:Sir Hans Sloane, an engraving from a portrait by T. Murray.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Hans Sloane]]'s collection of books and manuscripts was bequeathed to the [[British Museum]].]]
The first true national library was founded in 1753 as part of the [[British Museum]]. 
This new institution was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People|publisher=Silver, Burdett|year=1896|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's foundations lay in the will of the physician and naturalist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]], who gathered an enviable [[cabinet of curiosities|collection of curiosities]] over his lifetime which he bequeathed to the nation for £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum |publisher=Fathom |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102202555/http://fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |archivedate=2 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane's collection included some 40,000 printed books and 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, as well as [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx|title=General history|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum Act 1753]] also incorporated the [[Cotton library]] and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harleian library]]. These were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various [[British monarchy|British monarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p.&amp;nbsp;346&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition galleries and [[Library|reading room]] for scholars opened on 15 January 1759,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=33121&amp;amid=30262261 The British Museum Opened], History Today&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1757, King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] granted it the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the Museum's library would expand indefinitely.

[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], seat of the [[British Museum|British Library]], founded in 1753.]]
[[Anthony Panizzi]] became the Principal Librarian at the [[British Library]] in 1856, where he oversaw its modernization. During his tenure, the Library's holdings increased from 235,000 to 540,000 volumes, making it the largest library in the world at the time. Its famous circular [[British Museum Reading Room|Reading Room]] was opened in 1857. Panizzi undertook the creation of a new catalogue, based on the "Ninety-One Cataloguing Rules" (1841) which he devised with his assistants.  These rules served as the basis for all subsequent [[library catalog|catalogue]] rules of the 19th and 20th centuries, and are at the origins of the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description|ISBD]] and of digital cataloguing elements such as [[Dublin Core]].

[[File:Jacques Auguste de Thou.jpg|thumb|right|230x230px|As librarian of the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] transformed it into the largest library in the world at the time.]]
In France, the first national library was the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], which evolved from its origin as a royal library founded at the [[Louvre Palace]] by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1368. At the death of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], this first collection was unilaterally bought by the English regent of France, the [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]], who transferred it to England in 1424. It was apparently dispersed at his death in 1435.&lt;ref name=priebe/&gt;&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Americana|wstitle=National Library of France|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of printing resulted in the starting of another collection in the Louvre inherited by [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in 1461.&lt;ref name=staikos2012&gt;{{Citation |isbn = 978-1-58456-182-8 |publication-place = New Castle, DE |publisher= Oak Knoll Press |year= 2012 |title = History of the Library in Western Civilization: From Petrarch to Michelangelo |author = Konstantinos Staikos }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] transferred the collection in 1534 to [[Fontainebleau]] and merged it with his private library.

The appointment of [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] as librarian in the 17th century, initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of [[Camille le Tellier de Louvois|Abbé Louvois]], Minister Louvois's son. Abbé Louvois was succeeded by the [[Jérôme Bignon|Abbé Bignon]], or Bignon II as he was termed, who instituted a complete reform of the library's system. Catalogues were made which appeared from 1739 to 1753 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and [[Joseph Van Praet]] it suffered no injury.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

The library's collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|radical phase]] of the [[French Revolution]] when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergy were seized. After the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] in September 1792, "the Assembly declared the ''Bibliotheque du Roi'' to be national property and the institution was renamed the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]''. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people."&lt;ref name=priebe&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul M. |last=Priebe |title=From Bibliothèque du Roi to Bibliothèque Nationale: The Creation of a State Library, 1789–1793 |journal=The Journal of Library History (1974–1987) |volume=17 |issue=4 |year=1982 |jstor=25541320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expansion====
In the newly formed American republic, [[James Madison]] first proposed instituting a congressional library in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. The Library: An Illustrated History (New York, Skyhouse Publishing, 2012): 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Library of Congress]] was established on 24 April 1800, when [[President of the United States|president]] [[John Adams]] signed an [[act of Congress]] providing for the transfer of the seat of government from [[Philadelphia]] to the new capital city of Washington. Part of the legislation appropriated $5,000 "for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress ..., and for fitting up a suitable apartment for containing them...." Books were ordered from London and the collection, consisting of 740 books and 3 maps, was housed in the new [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].&lt;ref name="loc history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jefferson's Legacy • A Brief History of the Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/loc.html|date=6 March 2006|accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Załuski Library]] of Poland was taken by Russia after the [[Partitions of Poland|country's partition]], and the collection formed the nucleus of the Russian [[National Library of Russia|Imperial Public Library]], established in 1795.]]
The [[National Library of Russia|Imperial Public Library]] was established in 1795 by [[Catherine the Great]], whose private collections included the domestic libraries of [[Voltaire]] and [[Diderot]], which she had purchased from their heirs. Voltaire's personal library is still one of the highlights of the collection. The plan of a Russian public library was submitted to Catherine in 1766 but the Empress did not approve the project for the imperial library until {{OldStyleDate|27 May|1795|16 May}}, eighteen months before her death.
The cornerstone of the foreign-language department came from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the form of [[Załuski's Library]] (420,000 volumes), nationalized by the Russian government at the [[Partitions of Poland|time of the partitions]].&lt;ref&gt;Малый энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона, published in the [[Imperial Russia]] in the early 1900s&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish-language books from the library (numbering some 55,000 titles) were returned to [[Poland]] by the [[Russian SFSR]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd. edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Germany was only constituted as a state in 1871, the first national library was set up in the context of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German revolutions of 1848]]. Various booksellers and publishers offered their works to the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] for a parliamentary library. The library, led by Johann Heinrich Plath, was termed the ''Reichsbibliothek'' ("[[Reich]] library"). After the failure of the revolution the library was abandoned and the stock of books already in existence was stored at the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Reichsbibliothek von 1848 |title=Handbuch der historischen Buchbestände in Deutschland |editor-first=Bernhard |editor-last=Fabian |publisher=Olms Neue Medien |location=Hildesheim |year=2003 |url=http://fabian.sub.uni-goettingen.de/?Reichsbibliothek_Von_1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1912, the town of Leipzig, seat of the annual Leipzig Book Fair, the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] and the Börsenverein der Deutschen Buchhändler (Association of German booksellers) agreed to found a [[German National Library]] in Leipzig. Starting 1 January 1913, all publications in German were systematically collected (including books from Austria and Switzerland).

==Modern public libraries==
===United Kingdom===
[[File:James Silk Buckingham by Clara S. Lane.jpg|thumb|[[James Silk Buckingham]] led the campaign for public libraries in the mid 19th century.]]
Although by the mid-19th century, England could claim 274 [[subscription library|subscription libraries]] and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]]. The Act first gave local [[municipal borough|boroughs]] the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The [[Capitalist]] economic model had created a significant amount of free time for workers, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.&lt;ref&gt;McMenemy (2009), pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm|title=History of the Public Libraries Act|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170538/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the Chair of the [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]] which would examine "the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom" and propose solutions. [[Francis Place]], a campaigner for the working class, agreed that "the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford".&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, ''Report'' (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on [[William Ewart (English politician)|William Ewart]] MP and [[Joseph Brotherton]] MP, who introduced a bill which would "[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly &amp; Kelly (1977), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This became the [[Museums Act 1845]].

[[File:Peter White Public Library, Marquette, Mich. c.1905.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The turn of the 20th century witnessed a tremendous expansion in the provision of public libraries in the [[English-speaking world]]. Pictured, the [[Peter White Public Library]] built in 1905.]]
The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Minto (1932) chapters 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murison (1971) chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard (1850) Col. 848&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill passed through [[Parliament]] as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower [[crime rate]]s.

The earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the UK in 1847. [[Parliament]] appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849 their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries.

[[Salford Museum and Art Gallery]] first opened in November 1850 as "The Royal Museum &amp; Public Library", as the first unconditionally free public library in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_sal_mayor/index.html |publisher=Manchesteronline |title=Eye witness in Manchester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014184824/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_sal_mayor/index.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 }} Retrieved on 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsalford.info/whattosee/heritage/industrialheritage/industrialheritage1st.htm|publisher=visitsalford.info|title=1st in Salford|accessdate=19 January 2008|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library in [[Castlefield|Campfield]], [[Manchester]] was the first library to operate a ''free'' lending library without subscription in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2238494.stm | work=BBC News | title=Anniversary of first public library | date=5 September 2002 | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norwich]] lays claims to being the first municipality to adopt the Public Libraries Act 1850 (which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100,000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries – although not to buy books). Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after [[Winchester]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bolton]], [[Kidderminster]], [[Cambridge]], [[Birkenhead]] and [[Sheffield]].

Another important act was the [[Education Act 1870]], which increased literacy and thereby the demand for libraries. By 1877, more than 75 cities had established free libraries, and by 1900 the number had reached 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Libraries in the Western World|author=Harris, Michael H.|year=1984|location=London|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-1666-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finally marks the start of the public library as we know it. And these acts influenced similar laws in other countries, such as the US.

The first tax-supported public library in the United States was [[Peterborough]], [[New Hampshire]] (1833) first supported by state funds then an "Act Providing for the Establishment of Public Libraries" in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of the Public Library: The Origins of the Public Library Movement in New England, 1629–1855|author=Shera, Jesse H.|year=1949|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peterborough Town Library was proposed by Reverend Abiel Abbot as a central collection of books that would be owned by the people and be free to all of the town's inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Peterborough&gt;[http://peterboroughtownlibrary.org/history/ History: Peterborough Town Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The original collection was bought by Reverend Abbot and the library trustees and was housed in Smith &amp; Thompson's general store, which also acted as a post office.&lt;ref name=Peterborough/&gt;
[[File:Andrew Carnegie at Skibo 1914 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Carnegie]] played an important role in financing public libraries across the [[English-speaking world]].]]
The year 1876 is key in the history of [[Library science|librarianship]] in the United States. The [[American Library Association]] was formed, ''The American Library Journal'' was founded, [[Melvil Dewey]] published his [[Dewey Decimal Classification|decimal-based system]] of classification, and the United States Bureau of Education published its report, "Public libraries in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management."  During the post-Civil War years, there was a rise in the establishment of public libraries, a movement led chiefly by newly formed [[women's club]]s. They contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fund raising campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the [[Carnegie Library]] Endowment founded in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paula D. Watson, "Founding Mothers: The Contribution of Woman's Organizations to Public Library Development in the United States", ''Library Quarterly'', Vol. 64, Issue 3, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;236&lt;/ref&gt;  They led the establishment of 75–80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Teva Scheer, "The 'Praxis' Side of the Equation: Club Women and American Public Administration", ''Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis'', Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;525&lt;/ref&gt;

Philanthropists and businessmen, including John Passmore Edwards, [[Henry Tate]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]], helped to increase the number of public libraries from the late 19th century. Carnegie alone built over 2000 libraries in the US, 660 [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Libraries]] in Britain, in addition to many more in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jones | first = Theodore | title = Carnegie Libraries across America | publisher = Preservation Press | location = Washington | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-471-14422-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====African American libraries====

Exactly where and when the first publicly supported library for blacks was established is still a question in need of an answer, the history of African Americans and libraries in the United States is one with a rich heritage. The earliest established library started by and for African Americans in the United States was the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons. By 1838, its collection included 600 volumes, as well as pamphlets and maps. Members could read independently, or they could follow a scheduled course of study.

Dr. William E. B. Du Bois attributed the movement for Negro libraries to the "natural desire (of the race) for books".&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, W. E. (1909). 14th Annual Conference for the Study of the Negro Problems. Efforts for Social Betterment Among Negro Americans. Atlanta: Atlanta University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The philanthropy of Andrew Carnegie had a tremendous impact upon the ability of "Colored Library Associations" being able to gain access to funding in order to build libraries in and for their communities.

===South Africa===
Beginning in 1910, South Africa's public libraries grew in importance to the country's English settlers. During World War I, South Africa had a total of seventy-one subscription libraries, all governed by the English government.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 39"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Gordon|title=The Culture and History of South African Public Libraries: The Experiences of Durban Library|journal=Library History|date=2013|volume=16|issue=1|pages=35–47|doi=10.1179/lib.2000.16.1.35|ref=harv}} p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaners had less libraries at the time with only seven libraries.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 39"/&gt;

In 1928, two librarians were appointed by the Carnegie Corporation in New York to survey library resources in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 40"&gt;{{harvp|Armstrong|2013|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their top two concerns were the lack of library use by Afrikaners and creating library provisions and school library services for non-Whites, with the recommendation that they not share the same buildings as White patrons.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 40"/&gt;

During the apartheid years (1948–1994), progressive libraries such as the Durban Library, opened branches in Indian and Colored communities, despite government pressure to not do so.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 41"&gt;{{harvp|Armstrong|2013|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The years of apartheid began with the [[Natal Indian Congress]], founded by Gandhi, which called upon the Durban City Council to end the restriction of non-Europeans by opening the library to all sections of the community.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 41"/&gt; The pressure put on the city council by the Natal India Congress forced the council to start a travelling service for non-European patrons.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 41"/&gt;

The Afrikaans government during apartheid passed several discriminatory legislative measures including the Separate Amenities Act of 1953, forcing councils to provide separate amenities and services for each race.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 41"/&gt; If the councils were unable to provide these amenities and services to all races, they focused solely on Whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Armstrong|2013|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the Afrikaans government became responsible for Black library provisions while the provinces became responsible for Colored, Indian and White library provisions, a fact that took two years for the South African Library Association to find out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Armstrong|2013|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Library Wolfsburg Alvar Aalto photo by Christian Gänshirt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wolfsburg]] Municipal Library by [[Alvar Aalto]], built 1958-62]]
In the 20th century, many public libraries were built in different Modernist architecture styles, some more functional, others more representative. For many of these buildings, the quality of the interior spaces, their lighting and atmosphere, was becoming more significant than the façade design of the library building. Modernist architects like [[Alvar Aalto]] put great emphasis on the comfort and usability of library spaces. The Municipal Library he built 1958–62 for the German city of [[Wolfsburg]] features a great central room for which he used a series of specially designed skylights to bring in natural light, even though all the walls are covered with books.

===21st century===
In the 21st century libraries are changing and evolving to match modern society. Lots of libraries are facing financial issues and crises.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org/advocacy/advocacy-university/budgets-funding-fundraising&lt;/ref&gt; But are finding ways to adapt to people's needs. Such as providing digital services to patrons at home, and creating more user friendly places.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/five-ways-libraries-are-changing-in-the-digital-ag/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jemaa el-Fnaa''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;ساحة جامع الفناء &lt;/big&gt; ''saaHat jamaaʻ al-fanâʼ'', also '''Jemaa el-Fna''', '''Djema el-Fna''' or '''Djemaa el-Fnaa''') is a square and market place in [[Marrakesh]]'s [[medina quarter]] (old city). It remains the main square of Marrakesh, used by locals and tourists.

==Name==
The origin of its name is unclear: ''Jamaa'' means "congregation" in Arabic, probably referring to a destroyed [[Almoravids|Almoravid]] mosque. ''el Fnaʼ'' or ''finâʼ'' can mean "death" or "a courtyard, space in front of a building". "''finâʼ'' in arabic commonly means "open area", straight translation would be "the gathering/congregation area". Other meanings could be "The assembly of death," or "The Mosque at the End of the World".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rwty8 The Mosque at the End of the World], [[Tahir Shah]], BBC Radio 3, 10 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation is that it refers to a mosque with a distinctive courtyard or square in front of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Jam'a al-Fnaa Square: a large square surrounded by mysteries" (Arabic)|url=http://www.marrakechpress.com/?p=810|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323093119/http://www.marrakechpress.com/?p=810|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 March 2012|work=Newspaper|publisher=Mararakech Press|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third translation is "assembly of the dead", referring to public executions on the plaza around 1050 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djemaa El-Fna|work=Lonely Planet| date=| url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/marrakesh/sights/squares-plazas/djemaa-el-fna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Marrakesh was founded by the [[Almorabits]] 1070-1072. After a destructive struggle, it fell to the [[Almohads]] in 1147. Following this, Jamaa el-Fna was renovated along with much of the city. The [[city wall]]s were also extended by [[Abou Yacoub Youssef]] and particularly by [[Yacoub el Mansour]] from 1147-1158. The surrounding mosque, palace, hospital, parade ground and gardens around the edges of the marketplace were also overhauled, and the ''[[kasbah]]'' was fortified. Subsequently, with the fortunes of the city, Jamaa el Fna saw periods of decline and also renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/331 |title=Medina of Marrakesh - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2008-11-11 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Square==
{{wide image|Marrakech banner.jpg|1000px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;''Panoramic view of Jemaa el-Fnaa''&lt;/div&gt;}}
During the day it is predominantly occupied by [[orange juice]] stalls, water sellers with traditional leather water-bags and brass cups, youths with chained [[Barbary ape]]s and [[snake charmer]]s despite the protected status of these species under Moroccan law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://lifeadventurestariq.blogspot.com/2010/04/mysteries-of-marrakech-morocco.html |title=Life, Adventures and Discoveries: Mysteries of Marrakech Morocco |publisher=Lifeadventurestariq.blogspot.com |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergin"&gt;Bergin and Nijman (2014) Open, Unregulated Trade in Wildlife in Morocco’s Markets. TRAFFIC Bulletin Available from [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267748463_Open_Unregulated_Trade_in_Wildlife_in_Moroccos_Markets researchgate.net], accessed Mar 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the day progresses, the entertainment on offer changes: the snake charmers depart, and late in the day the square becomes more crowded, with [[Chleuh]] dancing-boys (it would be against custom for girls to provide such entertainment), story-tellers (telling their tales in [[Berber language|Berber]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]], to an audience of locals), magicians, and peddlers of traditional medicines. As darkness falls, the square fills with dozens of food-stalls as the number of people on the square peaks.

[[File:Jmaalfnaa.jpg|thumb|Steam rising from food stalls]]
The square is edged along one side by the Marrakesh [[souk]], a traditional North African market catering both for the common daily needs of the locals, and for the tourist trade. On other sides are hotels and gardens and cafe terraces, and narrow streets lead into the alleys of the medina quarter.

Once a bus station, the place was closed to vehicle traffic in the early 2000s. The authorities are well aware of its importance to the tourist trade, and a strong but discreet police presence ensures the safety of visitors. 


== UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity ==
The idea of the [[UNESCO]] project [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] came from people concerned about the Jamaa el Fna. The place is known for its active concentration of traditional activities by storytellers, musicians and performers, but it was threatened by economic development pressures. In fighting for the protection of traditions, the residents called for action on an international level. To recognize the need for the protection of such places — termed "cultural spaces" — and other popular and traditional forms of cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 2003
|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17716&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO encourages communities to identify, document, protect, promote and revitalize such heritage. The UNESCO label aims to raise awareness about the importance of oral and intangible heritage as an essential component of cultural diversity.
{{cquote|The spectacle of Jamaa el Fna is repeated daily and each day it is different. Everything changes — voices, sounds, gestures, the public which sees, listens, smells, tastes, touches.

[[Image:KupeWheke.jpg|upright|thumb|House carving showing Kupe (holding a paddle), with two sea creatures at his feet]]
In the [[Māori mythology]] of some tribes, '''Kupe''' (10th century) was involved in the Polynesian discovery of [[New Zealand]].

==Contention==
There is contention concerning the status of Kupe. The contention turns on the authenticity of later versions of the legends, the so-called 'orthodox' versions closely associated with [[Percy Smith (ethnologist)|S. Percy Smith]] and [[Hoani Te Whatahoro Jury]]. Unlike the attested tribal traditions about Kupe recorded before Smith and Jury, the orthodox version is precise in terms of dates and in offering placenames in Polynesia where Kupe is supposed to have lived or departed from. The orthodox version also places Kupe hundreds of years before the arrival of the other founding canoes, whereas in the earlier traditions, Kupe is most definitely contemporary with those canoes (Simmons 1976). In addition, according to legends of the Whanganui and Taranaki regions Kupe was a contemporary of Turi of the [[Aotea (canoe)|Aotea canoe]]. In other traditions, Kupe arrived around the year 1400 on other canoes, including [[Tainui]] and [[Tākitimu]] (Simmons 1976:20–25).[[Image:SPSmith1905.jpg|thumb|Stephenson Percy Smith, 1905&lt;ref&gt;Photograph of Stephenson Percy Smith by kind permission of the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand, reference number 1/2-004600-F.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==The orthodox version==
In the "orthodox" version, Kupe was a great chief of [[Hawaiki]] who arrived in New Zealand in 925 AD. He left his cousin [[Hoturapa]] to drown during a fishing expedition and kidnapped his wife, [[Kuramarotini]], with whom he fled in her great canoe [[Matawhourua]]. During their subsequent journeys, they overcame numerous monsters and sea demons, including the great octopus named as [[Te Wheke-a-Muturangi]], and discovered New Zealand. Returning to Hawaiki, Kupe told of his adventures and convinced others to migrate with him (Craig 1989:127; see also External links below).

David Simmons said "A search for the sources of what I now call 'The Great New Zealand Myth' of Kupe, [[Toi (name)|Toi]] and the Fleet, had surprising results. In this form they did not exist in the old manuscripts nor in the whaikorero&lt;ref&gt;whaikōrero: formal speech, oratory&lt;/ref&gt; of learned men. Bits and pieces there were. Kupe was and is known, in the traditions of the Hokianga, Waikato, East Coast and South Island: but the genealogies given did not tally with those given by S. Percy Smith. The stories given by Smith were a mixture of differing tribal tradition. In other words the whole tradition as given by Smith was [[Pākehā|pakeha]], not Maori. Similarly, the story of Toi and Whatonga and the canoe race leading to settlement in New Zealand could not be authenticated except from the one man who gave it to Percy Smith. Learned men of the same tribe make no mention of this story and there are no waiata&lt;ref&gt;''waiata'': song, sung poem&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating their deeds. Tribal origin canoes are well known to the tribes belonging to them: but none of them talk as Smith did of six large sea-going canoes setting out together from Raiatea. The Great New Zealand Myth was just that". (Simmons 1977).

==Attested local traditions==
Traditions about Kupe appear among the peoples of the following areas: Northland, Ngāti Kahungunu, Tainui, Whanganui-Taranaki, Rangitāne, and the South Island.

===Northland===
[[Image:kupe1.png|right|thumb|400px|Māori tribal districts]]In the Northland traditions, Kupe is a discoverer and contemporary with, but older than, Nukutawhiti, the ancestor of the Ngā Puhi people. Kupe arrives, lives at Hokianga, and returns to Wawauatea, his homeland, leaving certain signs and marks of his visit (Simmons 1976:34).

*A reference to Kupe occurs in a version of the legend of Māui fishing up the North Island, recorded in 1841 by Catherin Servant, a Marist missionary. Māui’s hook, made from the jawbone of his eldest son, catches in the gable of the house of [[Nukutawhiti]], Kupe’s wife. Kupe was involved in the formation of New Zealand (from Māui’s fish).&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites Catherin Servant, ‘Notice sur les Maoris de la Nouvelle Zélande’, 1842. Microfilm. (DU:Ho), from an original in the Marist Archives, Rome. Servant was stationed at Hokianga from 1838 to 1839 and then at Kororāreka (Russell) until 1842.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1849 [[Aperahama Taonui|Āperahama Taonui]] of Ngā Puhi wrote that 'Kupe came to this land in olden times' to look for Tuputupuwhenua.&lt;ref&gt;In this version it is not made clear who Tuputupuwhenua was.&lt;/ref&gt; 'He went to all places on this island. He did not see Tuputupuwhenua on this land. Hokianga was seen, a returning of Kupe, that is (the meaning of) Hokianga. Under the earth are his and Kui’s dwelling’. The land was uninhabited (deserted). Āperahama adds a genealogy from Kupe to Nukutawhiti, the ancestor of the Ngā Puhi.&lt;ref&gt;The genealogy is: Kupe begot Matiu who begot Makoro who begot Maea who begot Mahu (or Maahu) who begot Nukutawhiti.&lt;/ref&gt; Nukutawhiti came ‘from overseas’ with his brother-in-law Ruanui in their canoe named Mamari. They met Kupe at sea, who told Nukutawhiti that Tuputupuwhenua was at Hokianga. When Nukutawhiti arrived at the mouth of the harbour, Tuputupuwhenua disappeared underground (Simmons 1976:29–30).&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites A. Taonui, manuscript in Auckland Museum Library, Graham Collection, no. 120:2. Note also that Kupe and his great-great-great-grandchild appear to be contemporaries in this legend.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hoani Timo wrote a manuscript in 1855 in which 'Kupe came in former times – he was the husband of Peketahi; they crossed over from the other side' (of the sea). They lost a child, Totoko, at sea. When they arrived they had more children - Māui-mua, Māui-taha, and [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga]]. Rāhiri, an important ancestor of Ngā Puhi, descends from these children (Simmons 1976:31)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Simmons cites Shortland MS86, Hocken Library, Dunedin.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A tradition collected before 1855 from an unknown author names Kupe's home island as Wawauatea. Kupe came and visited every part of this island. He lived at Hokianga until he returned home. He left several things behind, including his canoe bailer,&lt;ref&gt;That is, a striking natural feature which is said to be Kupe's bailer turned to stone.&lt;/ref&gt; and two of his pets at the mouth of the Hokianga harbour: Āraiteuru (male) and Nuia (female). On his return to Wawauatea he informed the men of the village that there was a good land to the south. Canoes were made, of which [[Matahourua|Matawhaorua]], belonging to Ngā Puhi, landed at Hokianga. Other canoes are mentioned with details of their sailings (Simmons 1976:31).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Simmons had access to a privately held manuscript from the Hokianga area&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites Kamira Manuscript Book No. 9, p. 259, but gives no date.&lt;/ref&gt; which says that there were three Kupe in Hawaiki: Kupe Nuku, Kupe Rangi, and Kupu Manawa.&lt;ref&gt;The names translate as Kupe Earth, Kupe Sky, and Kupe Heart.&lt;/ref&gt; Kupe Nuku came to this island in the Matahourua canoe, with his wife, two slaves, and nine others, with their wives.&lt;ref&gt;The names of the nine others translate as echoing cliff, birds, spirit folk, insects, lizards and reptiles.&lt;/ref&gt; They took three days and nights to paddle to this island, Aotearoa. Kupe sailed around the whole island and saw no people. He left signs along the coast to show that they were the first to live there. At Hokianga he left the posts of his net and his earth oven, the footprints of his slave, and the bailer of his canoe. At Opara, he left his dog.&lt;ref&gt;That is, he left these items and they turned to stone.&lt;/ref&gt; When fish were baked in an oven, Kupe grew angry when the oven was opened and they were not cooked. He cursed his companions, sending the birds and lizards and insects into the forest to live, the spirit folk to the mountains, and the echo to the cliffs where he would be condemned to utter short speeches as he had done as his friends neglected the oven. Kupe returned to Hawaiki, but war broke out because of [[Tama-te-kapua]]. As a result, Kupe's grandson Nukutawhiti leaves Hawaiki and lands in Hokianga (Simmons 1976:33–34).&lt;ref&gt;A later manuscript from the same area was published in the Journal of the Polynesian Society (Biggs 1957). This version contains episodes which appear to have been borrowed from literary sources, including associations with Toto, Rongorongo, Kuramarotini, Turi, and Hoturapa.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ngāti Kahungunu===
Early accounts from the Ngāti Kahungunu area consistently place Kupe on board the Tākitimu canoe or name as his companions people who are strongly associated with the Tākitimu. No other canoes are mentioned in connection with him. They also contain no references to the octopus of Muturangi, nor of the chase from Hawaiki (Simmons 1976:20).

*In a manuscript written by Hami Ropiha in 1862 (Simmons 1976:19–20), Tamatea came on the [[Tākitimu]] canoe, along with his elders, the children of Tato, who were Rongokako, Hikitapuae, Hikitaketake, Rongoiamoa, Taihopia, Kahutuanui, Mataro, Te Angi, Kupe, Ngake, Paikea, and Uenuku. They came to ‘this island’ for two reasons: a fight about a woman, and a dispute over the planting of crops. At Tauranga, the group divided in three. Tamatea and his son Kahungunu stayed to make a fishing net, others went north, but Kupe and Ngake sailed to the south in Tākitimu. At Wairoaiti, the family had been sent inland to weave flax fibre for the canoe. When they returned, the canoe was gone. They climbed a hill and saw the canoe sailing away. Kupe arrived at Tawake. He sent his daughter Mokototuarangi to fetch water. When she was returning, Kupe’s canoe sailed off and the daughter was left standing there, angry.&lt;ref&gt;Other Ngāti Kahungunu traditions, very similar to this, are given in a manuscript translated in ''Transactions of the New Zealand Institute'', volume 15:448, in which Kupe appears as a name among the 13 children of Tato; also in [[John White (ethnographer)|John White]], ''Ancient History of the Maori'', 1887–1891, Volume 3:71–73; and in another account by White entitled ''Ahuriri Natives' Account of Hawaiki 1855'', Turnbull Library Manuscript 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then traveled south to reach Mahia.

===Tainui===
[[Image:ParatutaeIsland.jpg|right|thumb|360px|Paratutae Rock, with the indentations said to have been left in the cliff-face by Kupe's paddle]]Tainui traditions about Kupe can be summarised as: Kupe stole Hoturapa’s wife or wives; came to New Zealand and cut up the land; raised rough seas; and went away again. The sources in detail:

*In a South Manukau tradition dated to 1842 (Simmons 1976:20–21),&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites Rev. J. Hamlin, ‘On the Mythology of New Zealanders’ ''Tasmanian Journal of Natural Science'', 1842, I:260.&lt;/ref&gt; Kupe came with his grandfather, Maru-tawiti, and his brother-in-law [[Hoturapa]] and several others. They came to survey the land and return again. Nothing is known of the land from which they sailed. Kupe is said to have stranded his brother-in-law at East Cape, stealing away with his wives. He sailed around North Cape. Kupe raised a rough sea on the western coast to prevent Hoturapa from following him, and that is why the west coast is always rougher than the east coast. At the Manukau Heads he struck Paratutae rock with his paddle, leaving an imprint which is visible to this day. The journey ended at [[Kawhia|Kāwhia]]. Little more is known of Kupe; perhaps he returned to the land from which he came. It is said that some of his people remained.
*A tradition of the Ngāti Te Ata tribe, also dated 1842, and also from the South Manukau area (Simmons 1976:21),&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites Rev. W.R. Wade, ''A Journey in the Northern Island of New Zealand'' (George Rolwegan: Hobart) 1842:90.&lt;/ref&gt; places Kupe on board the [[Tainui]] canoe.
*A song collected from the Ngāti Toa war leader Te Rauparaha in 1847 refers to Kupe as the ‘man who sliced up the land; Kapiti stands away, Mana stands away, Arapaoa stands separated. These are the signs of my ancestor, of Kupe, who explored Titapua’ (Simmons 1976:21–22).
*A version showing some influence from printed sources was collected before 1907 from Wirihana Aoterangi of the Ngāti Tahinga tribe of Raglan (Simmons 1976:22–23).&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites G. Graham (translator), ''Fragments of Ancient Maori History by Wirihana Aoterangi'' (Champtaloup and Edmiston: Auckland), 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Kupe and his companion Turi arrive on a canoe named Aotearoa. They find the inhabitants of this island to be ‘goblins’ or ‘fairies’ of various kinds,&lt;ref&gt;'Goblins' and 'fairies' represent an attempt by the original translators to render the names of various spiritual or quasi-spiritual beings given the lack of appropriate terms in English. Polynesian 'goblins' and 'fairies' tend to be much scarier entities than English ones.&lt;/ref&gt; the descendants of the companions of [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]] when he fished up this island. Kupe left his daughter at Rangitoto. Near Whanganui-a-tara (Wellington Harbour) he regretted this, and cut his flesh. The blood gushed forth and to this day the cliffs and sea creatures of that area are red. At Aotea Harbour he discovered the inhabitants, the Ngāti Matakore, digging up fern-root. Kupe decided to return to Hawaiki, and told his slave Powhetengu to stay and look after this island. The slave, terrified of the people of this land, did not agree to this. When he left, Kupe threw his belt into the sea, to make it rough and prevent the slave from following him. Powhetengu made a canoe and tried to follow, but the rough seas overturned it and it turned into a rock in Aotea Harbour. Kupe sailed to Hawaiki, announcing that he had found a large land, and that its people were like ‘goblins’.

===Whanganui-Taranaki===
Whanganui-Taranaki traditions can be summarised as: Kupe came looking for his wife who had been abducted by (H)oturapa. His canoe was named Mataho(u)rua; Kupe was associated with Turi as his contemporary. Kupe cut up the land, and he was a brother of Ngake. Kupe encountered rough seas on his journey. The octopus story is known, but the creature is not named. Except in later versions which are somewhat suspect as to their authenticity, the accounts do not include the episode in which Kupe chases the octopus from Hawaiki (Simmons 1976:27). Here are some of the accounts from this area:

*A tradition written by Te Hukahuka on 25 October 1847 states that Kupe found no people on this island when he came. He returned and met Turi, and told him that all he had seen was 'a flock of spirits' (apu aparoa), and two birds: a fantail and a [[Kokako|kōkako]]. Turi said let us go back there and Kupe said 'Kupe returns' and returned to Hawaiki.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons tentatively assigns this tradition to the Whanganui area and cites Grey New Zealand Māori Manuscript 102:35.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a tradition collected from Wiremu Tīpene Pōkaiatua of Manawapou in 1854 (Simmons 1976:23–24),&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites Rev. R. Taylor, ''Te Ika a Maui'' (Wertheim and MacIntosh: London), 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; Kupe arrived at Wellington Harbour aboard the Mata’orua ([[Matahourua]]), looking for his wife Kuramarotini who had been abducted by his younger brother ‘Oturapa ([[Hoturapa]]). He could not find him, and returned, erecting a post at Pātea as a token of his visit. Kupe brought the ''karaka'' tree,&lt;ref&gt;''Corynocarpus laevigatus'', an important food tree which is endemic to New Zealand and thus not found elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; and also divided off the North Island, which had been attached to Hawaiki until then.
*In a legend from a manuscript by Piri Kawau of Āti Awa and dated approximately 1854 (Simmons 1976:24)&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites G. Grey, ''Nga Mahi a Nga Tupuna. Polynesian Mythology'' (H. Brett: Auckland), 1885:19.&lt;/ref&gt; the canoe Matahorua (Matahourua) is the canoe that sailed ‘the great distance’ and was commanded by Reti. Kupe killed Hoturapa and took his wife Kuramarotini. Then they came to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;At this point in the story, Grey inserts the story of the killing of the octopus Te Wheke-a-Muturangi. However, according to Simmons, this episode is not in Piri Kawau’s manuscript, and Grey’s source for it remains to be discovered.&lt;/ref&gt; Kupe cut up the land, and saw two inhabitants, Kōkako and Tiwaiwaka (Blue-wattled crow and Fantail). Then he returned to Hawaiki, and gave Turi directions for sailing to New Zealand.
*A Whanganui chief [[Hoani Wiremu Hipango]] gave a version to Rev. [[Richard Taylor (missionary)|Richard Taylor]] in 1859 (Simmons 1976:24).&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites R. Taylor, ‘notes on New Zealand and its native inhabitants’, No. 6, p 110, MS, Auckland City Library.&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, when Kupe came to New Zealand he found the land flowing. He made it lie quietly, and when Turi arrived, he found it floating.
*In October 1882 Rerete Tapo of [[Parikino]] said "Now listen, the first to come to this island was Kupe to fold and separate the great fish of Māui" (Simmons 1976:24).&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites John White, MS 119, 'Miscellaneous material in Maori'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rangitāne===
[[File:Centennial Exhibition, 1939 - 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|Kupe Statue at the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition|Centennial Exhibition]] (1939–1940)]]
*An 1893 account by Te Whetu of Ngāti Raukawa, who was familiar with Rangitāne traditions,&lt;ref&gt;The Rangitāne people live on both sides of [[Cook Strait]].&lt;/ref&gt; tells of Kupe with his daughters and two birds, Rupe (pigeon) and Kawauatoru (cormorant or shag), exploring the west coast of the North Island. Kupe sends the cormorant to rest the current in the Manukau harbour, which the bird reports as weak, and in Cook Strait, which the bird reports as too strong. The pigeon is sent to explore the interior of the island, and encounters a fantail and a crow (kōkako). Kupe stays at Wellington harbour and names two islands Matiu and Makoro after his daughters. On his return journey, Kupe meets Turi at an island and tells him of this island. At Hawaiki. Kupe recounts his adventures (Simmons 1976:26–27).&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'', 1893, pp. 147–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Island===
The few references to Kupe in South Island sources indicate that the traditions are substantially the same as those of Ngāti Kahungunu, with whom Ngāi Tahu, the main tribe of the South Island, had strong genealogical and trading links (Simmons 1976:34). 
*In one tradition Tamatea of the Tākitimu canoe, having been deserted by his three wives, sails around New Zealand looking for them, and shares with Kupe the honour of naming parts of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites Rev, J.W. Stack, 'Remarks on Mr McKenzies Cameron's Theory respecting Kahui Tipua', ''Transactions of the New Zealand Institute'' 12, 1879:160&lt;/ref&gt;
*White records a legend in which the Rangitāne chief Te Hau has his cultivations at Te Karaka ruined by Kupe who pours salt over them.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons cites White 1887–1891, III:199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unlocated ===
"When Kupe, the first discoverer of New Zealand, first came in sight of the land, his wife cried, 'He ao! He ao!" (a cloud! a cloud!). Great Barrier Island was therefore named Aotea (white cloud), and the long mainland Aotearoa (long white cloud). When Kupe finally returned to his homeland his people asked him why he did not call the newly discovered country after his fatherland. He replied, 'I preferred the warm breast to the cold one, the new land to the old land long forsaken'."&lt;ref&gt;''Lilliput Maori Place Names.'' pub. A . H. Reed 1962 printed in Germany by Langenscheidt KG p36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kupe Statue==
[[File:Kupe Group Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Kupe Statue on the [[Wellington Waterfront]]]]
[[William Trethewey]] produced the statuary for the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition]] that was held in 1939/40 in [[Rongotai]], [[Wellington]]. A {{convert|100|ft|m}} frieze depicted the progress of New Zealand, groupings of pioneers, lions in [[Art Deco]] style, a large fountain and a figure of Kupe standing on the prow of his canoe were produced for the centennial exhibition. Of all these works, only the Kupe Statue still remains.&lt;ref name="DNZB Trethewey"&gt;{{DNZB|Phillips|Jock|4t26|William Thomas Trethewey|24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having spent many decades at [[Wellington Railway Station]], then the Wellington Show and Sports Centre and finally at [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa]], the Kupe Group Trust successfully fundraised to have the plaster statue cast in bronze. Since 2000, the bronze statue has been installed at the [[Wellington Waterfront]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art and Design|url= http://www.wellingtonwaterfront.co.nz/experience/art_and_design/|publisher=Wellington Waterfront|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lists of films}}
The following is a list of films belonging to the [[neo-noir]] genre. Following a common convention of associating the forties and fifties with [[film noir]], the list takes 1960 to date the beginning of the genre. &lt;!-- NOTE: The composition of this list may be controversial. To minimize dispute the films included here should preferably feature a footnote linking to a [[WP:RS|reliable, published source]] which states that the mentioned film is considered to be a neo-noir film by an expert in this field. Films released prior to 1960 should generally only be listed in the [[list of film noir titles]]. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4941">The following languages are listed  as [[unclassified languages|unclassified]] by the ''[[Ethnologue]]'' (17th edition), though in their descriptions some are identified with an established family, or have been retired as spurious. Since the 15th edition, several other unclassified languages were found to be related to known languages once better data was collected, and some, such as ''Amikoana'' and ''Miarrã'', were found to be spurious and their ISO codes were retired. (See [[spurious languages]].) Languages which became extinct before 1950 are the purview of [[Linguist List]] and are being gradually removed from ''Ethnologue''; they are listed as an addendum to this page.

'''Memory Eternal''' ({{lang-el|Αἰωνία ἡ μνήμη}}, ''Aiōnia ē Mnēmē''; {{lang-ar|ذِكرُهُ مؤَبَّداً}}, "Thikruhu muabbadan"; {{lang-ka|საუკუნო ხსენება}}, "Sauk'uno Khseneba"; {{lang-cu|Вѣчьнаꙗ памѧть}}, ''Věčĭnaja pamętĭ'', [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Вічная Пам'ять (vichnaya pamyat) ), is an exclamation, an [[encomium]] like the [[polychronion]], used at the end of an [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christian burial|funeral]] or [[Pannikhida|memorial service]]. The same exclamation is used by those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]]. It is the liturgical counterpart to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Western Rite]] prayer "[[Eternal Rest (Prayer)|Eternal Rest]]". The "eternal memory" mentioned in the prayer refers to remembrance by God, rather than by the living, and is another way of praying that the soul has entered heaven and enjoys eternal life.

This chant is parallel to "[[Polychronion|Many years]]" which is chanted for living members of the Church (and occasionally for national or local authorities, even though they may not be Orthodox). "Memory eternal" is not chanted for those who have been officially [[glorification|glorified]] (canonized) as saints. As part of the glorification process for new saints, on the eve of the day before their glorification, "Memory eternal" will be chanted for them at the end of a solemn service known as the "Last [[Requiem]]." The chanting of "Memory eternal" is introduced by a [[deacon]], as follows:

:''Deacon:'' In a blessed falling asleep, grant, O Lord, eternal rest unto Thy departed servant (''Name'') and make his/her memory to be eternal!

:''Choir:'' Memory eternal! Memory eternal! Memory eternal!

It concludes with the line "with the saints, grant her/him rest o Lord, memory eternal!"

==Other occasions==
"Memory Eternal" is chanted at the end of services on [[Saturdays of the Dead]], though not for an individual, but for all of the faithful departed.

"Memory Eternal" is intoned by the deacon and then chanted by all in response three times during the [[liturgy]] on the [[Sunday of Orthodoxy]] to commemorate church hierarchs, Orthodox monarchs, Orthodox patriarchs and clergy, and all deceased Orthodox Christians &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.monachos.net/library/index.php/liturgics/lent/62-great-lent/lenten-prayers/469-service-triumph-orthodoxy|work= monachos.net|title= Service of the Triumph of Orthodoxy|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], "Memory Eternal" is chanted on the [[Sunday of Orthodoxy]] for all of the departed [[rulers of Russia]].

[[File:ThomasSchweicker2.jpg|thumb|Self portrait by mouth and foot artist [[Thomas Schweicker]] (1540–1602)]]
'''Mouth and foot painting''' is a technique to create [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s and other works of art by maneuvering brushes and other tools with the mouth or foot. The technique is mostly used by artists who through illness, accident or congenital disability have no use of their hands. The [[Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World|Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists]] (AMFPA) is a worldwide organization representing these artists.&lt;ref name="vdmfkhist"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.vdmfk.com/en/about.html|website=www.vdmfk.com|publisher=[[Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World]]|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brushes and tools that are used are ordinary artist's implements, but they may be modified in length or width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Mouthpiece|url=https://www.arttreehouse.com/store/content/artist-mouthpiece|website=www.arttreehouse.com|publisher=The Art Treeshouse|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Jon|title=My Specialist Equipment|url=http://www.jkcmouthartist.com/?page_id=100|website=www.jkcmouthartist.com|publisher=Jon Clayton|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dominic|title=Paralysed artist paints amazing portrait of Thierry Henry's legendary goal celebration using only his mouth|date=25 July 2015|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/paralysed-artist-paints-amazing-portrait-6135328|website=www.mirror.co.uk|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mouth painters hold the brush in their mouth or between their teeth and maneuver it with their tongue and cheek muscles.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Battle|first1=Bella|title=Incredible paintings are a work of mouth art|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4103893/Mouth-artist-Steve-Chambers-50-paints-with-the-brush-between-his-lips.html|website=www.thesun.co.uk|publisher=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=2 February 2012|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper or [[canvas]] is usually mounted vertically on an [[easel]].

The '''''njai''''' ({{IPA-id|ɲai|}}; [[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''''nyai''''') were women who were kept as housekeepers, companions, and [[concubines]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day Indonesia). In the original [[Balinese language|Balinese]], the word ''njai'' meant "sister",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Hans|last2=Roelands|first2=Jan|title=Indisch ABC|year=1970|publisher=Arbeiderspers|language=Dutch|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term later took a more specific meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indische letteren: documentatieblad van de Werkgroep Indisch-Nederlandse Letterkunde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PydcAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Werkgroep Indisch-Nederlandse Letterkunde|language=Dutch|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indisch letterland: verhalen uit twee eeuwen Nederlands- Indische literatuur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bh_iAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Sijthoff|isbn=9789021838014|language=Dutch|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Rob Nieuwenhuys]] described the position of the njai as always subservient, being the white man's housekeeper and companion, before she was his concubine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Joop van den|title=Soebatten, sarongs en sinjo's: Indische woorden in het Nederlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHLlAAAAMAAJ|year=1992|publisher=BZZTôH|isbn=9789062915590|language=Dutch|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Terminology and description==
The word ''njai'' (also ''nyai'', ''njaie'', ''nyaie'', ''nyahi'' or ''nyi'') comes from a [[Balinese language|Balinese]] word meaning sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Hans|last2=Roelands|first2=Jan|title=Indisch ABC|year=1970|publisher=Arbeiderspers|language=Dutch|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] the term ''nyai'' refer to "miss" or young woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nyai (Sunda - Indonesia)| work = Kamus Daerah | url = http://www.kamusdaerah.com/?bhs=m&amp;bhs2=a&amp;q=nona }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Betawi language|Betawi dialect]], ''nyai'' refer to "grandmother" or elderly lady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nyai (Betawi - Indonesia)| work = Kamus Daerah | url = http://www.kamusdaerah.com/?bhs=f&amp;bhs2=a&amp;q=nyai }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Great Dictionary of the Indonesian Language of the Language Center]]'' gives three definitions for ''njai'': as a term for referring to a married or unmarried woman, as a term for referring to a woman older than the speaker, and for the concubine of a non-Indonesian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia |trans-title=Great Dictionary of the Indonesian Language |page=971 |edition=4th |language=Indonesian |publisher=Gramedia |location=Jakarta |author=National Department of Education |isbn=978-979-22-3841-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this last definition which is used here, a definition which gained traction in the 17th century when [[Balinese people|Balinese]] ''njais'' first became common in the colonial capital of Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]).{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=58}} The word, in discussion of the Indies, is sometimes simply translated as "mistress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonneff|first=Marcel|title=L'Indonésie contemporaine vue par ses intellectuels: un choix d'articles de la revue Prisma (1971-1991)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPdHAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=L'Harmattan|language=French|isbn=9782738426680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of other terms were used to refer to the ''njai'', with a varying degree of positive and negative connotations. In the 19th century the term ''inlandse huishoudster'', or simply ''huishoudster'' (housekeeper), was common. The ''njai'' were also known as ''moentji'', from the Dutch [[diminutive]] ''mondje'', meaning "mouth", and the more negative ''snaar'' ("[[String (music)|strings]]"); both referred to the ''njai'''s verbal propensities. As the ''njai'' could also serve as a translator and language teacher, terms such as ''boek'' ("book") and ''woordenbooek'' ("dictionary") are also noted. Objectification of the ''njai'' was found in terms such as ''meubel'' ("furniture") and ''inventarisstuk'' ("inventory items").{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=58–59}}

Not all ''njai'' were necessarily native Indonesian--in [[Madelon Szekely-Lulofs]]'s 1931 novel ''[[Rubber (1931 novel)|Rubber]]'', ''njai'' Kiku San is Japanese.&lt;ref name="Meijer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meijer|first=Maaike|title=In tekst gevat: Inleiding tot een kritiek van representatie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhrOziMoJrkC&amp;pg=PA132|year=2006|publisher=Amsterdam UP|isbn=9789053568552|language=Dutch|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Europeans first arrived in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] in the 16th century, and in 1602 the [[Dutch East India Company]] was established to ensure Dutch domination of the spice trade. The Europeans established small settlements, and in many of them the European residents were all men. Without contact with Dutch women, they began turning to their female slaves (mostly originating from [[Sulawesi]], [[Bali]], and outside the archipelago) for sexual services. By 1620 the habit had become so prevalent that [[List of Governors-General of the Dutch East Indies|Governor-General]] [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] passed a law forbidding Dutchmen from keeping concubines.{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=1–2}} To prevent a relapse, Coen began bringing orphans from the Netherlands, termed ''compagniesdochters'', to become wives of company employees.{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=2–3}}&lt;!--insert note/link about les Filles du Roi in New France--&gt; The program, however, had little effect, as the company could not keep up with the demand. There were also concerns that these women were only accepting marriage for personal gain and that they would attempt to draw their husbands back to the Netherlands&amp;nbsp;– and out of the employment of the Dutch East Indies Company.{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=2–3}}

In the 1650s, Governors-General [[Carel Reyniersz]] and [[Joan Maetsuycker]] began promoting interracial marriage between Dutchmen and [[native Indonesians|indigenous]] women, who were thought to be less greedy and less likely to ask their husbands to leave the Indies. The [[Indo people|Eurasian]] daughters of these marriages proved to be popular targets of affections, as marriage to one could help men improve their social position.{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=3–5}} Many men, however, were unable to marry them, as they generally sought persons already in a position of power. Instead, it was more common for Dutchmen to take Asian women as their partners, as they could not marry without the company's permission and would not be repatriated if they married a non-Christian.{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=9–10}}

When the British took control of the Indies in 1812, they were shocked by the practices of concubinage, interracial marriages, and slavery in the Indies. They attempted to force all elements of Indies society to live in accordance with British morals. However, they were unable to eliminate the keeping of ''njais'', and, indeed, some Englishmen kept a ''njai'' of their own.{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=15–17}}

After the British returned the Indies to the Dutch in 1815, a new wave of immigration&amp;nbsp;– including some women&amp;nbsp;– began. These newcomers, as with the British before them, were shocked by the intermarriage and keeping of ''njais''. Under the new system they established, which pushed for a sharper delineation between Europeans and non-Europeans, a ''njai'' marrying a European could be recognized as of a similar stature to Europeans. Those who were not married, however, received no special recognition.{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=19–20}}

Owing to an economic boom, the early 20th century saw another surge in immigration from Europe. With the European population now of a considerable size, Indies society began drifting towards a more racially divided one. Venues exclusive to one racial group were opened, and European, Chinese, and indigenous people rarely intermingled. Along with this change, the position of men living with a ''njai'' became increasingly difficult. The Indies government, following a decree by Governor-General [[Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg]], would not hire them, and businesses attempted to promote [[endogamy]]. In the Netherlands, extensive polemics were written which condemned, from a moral point of view, the practice of keeping a ''njai'': the practice was deemed to be based on nothing but lust, for a ''njai'' "could not touch the soul". Concern was also expressed over men's seeming lack of enthusiasm for having children with their ''njai'', leading to high abortion rates.{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=86}}

By the 1910s the number of ''njais'' had decreased, although [[prostitution in Indonesia|prostitution]] had become more prevalent.{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=87}} The practice had not died out, however, by the time the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded and [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupied]] the Indies. During the occupation, the ''njai'' and their mixed-race children were forcefully separated from European men, who were put into internment camps.{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=223}} After the occupation ended in 1945, [[Sukarno]] [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] an independent Indonesia. During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], the ''njai'' were forced to choose between going with their partners to Europe, or staying in Indonesia; both choices were taken.{{sfn|Baay|2010|pp=224–25}}

==Rights and social status==
The ''njai'' could be sent home with little or no warning,{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=1}} with or without her children. This was common when the  European man prepared to marry.{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=10}}

The general view of ''njai'' was, at first, extremely negative. In the 17th century, they were described as "lustful beasts", with voracious sexual appetites who would not accept money for sex, but pay for it. Coen, in a 1620 letter, described ''njai'' as lazy (except in their sexual deeds), stupid, dishonest, and willing to kill the persons they hated.{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=12}}

==Children==
The children of a ''njai'' were often raised in indigenous traditions, by their mother or by a maid. The fathers would generally not interact with them, preferring to socialize with other European men instead.{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=10}} In the 17th century few could speak Dutch, although later education programs were initiated to promote the use of the language.{{sfn|Baay|2010|p=11}}

==In culture==
[[File:Njai Dasima p103.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''[[Njai Dasima (1929 film)|Njai Dasima]]'' (1929)]]
===Literature===
The ''njai'' has a broad presence in literature. James Siegel argues that "Dutch shame", which he describes as caused by guilt over the contemporary situation in the Indies that the Dutch colonialists seemed incapable of improving, gave rise to certain stock characters that would explain Dutch political and administrative failure. Siegel cites such characters as the "venal Arab" and the "lustful, greedy Chinese merchant", and the "'deceitful' housekeeper or ''njai''".&lt;ref name="Siegel1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegel|first=James T.|title=Fetish, Recognition, Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JOqVuLrIGycC&amp;pg=PA60|year=1997|publisher=Princeton UP|isbn=9780691026527|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Njai'' characters are common in works of [[Chinese Malay literature]]. Some of the earliest were ''[[syair]]'' (poems), published in 1907 by [[Lie Kim Hok]] and Tjiang O. S. respectively in 1897; both were adaptations of ''Tjerita Njai Dasima''.{{sfn|Salmon|1985|p=30}} In 1904, Oei Soei Tiong published ''Njai Alimah''.{{sfn|Salmon|1985|pp=48–49}} In the 1910s and 1920s, several books were published with ''njais'' as the title characters, including ''Njai Aisah'' (Tan Boen Kim; 1915), ''Njai Soemirah'' ([[Thio Tjin Boen]]; 1917), and ''Njai Marsina'' (Numa, 1923).{{sfn|Salmon|1985|p=60}}

===Film===
''Njai'' are present in early films from the Dutch East Indies, several of which were adapted from novels. In 1929 [[Tan's Film]] produced ''[[Njai Dasima (1929 film)|Njai Dasima]]'', an adaptation of ''Tjerita Njai Dasima''. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that cinemas could make up for several days of losses with a single showing.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=24}} ''Tjerita Njai Dasima'' has since been adapted a further three times. A [[Njai Dasima (1932 film)|talkie version]], directed by [[Bachtiar Effendi]], was released by Tan's by January 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
PVC decking was introduced to the market around 2005 and continues to be a contender as a top deck building material. Its uniquely all-plastic makeup makes it distinctly different from wood decking or other composite decking options. PVC decking has changed in appearance since its introduction and is now available in different colors.&lt;ref name="wood vs"/&gt;

==Production==
Unlike some other wood-alternative decking materials, PVC decking is not made with any wood. It is made completely from plastic instead of from a combination of materials.&lt;ref name="wood vs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wood Plastic Composites vs. PVC Decking|url=http://columbus-decks.com/2010/02/11/wood-plastic-composites-vs-pvc-decking/|publisher=Columbus Decks|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Producing PVC decking is a relatively difficult process called co-extrusion. The deck board core is coated and bound with an outer plastic shell, but the materials can be temperamental and hard to work with.  Commercial production is challenging, not only for this reason, but also because about one eighth of the deck boards produced are considered unsellable and therefore scrapped. The fragile nature of this production process requires careful ingredient mixing and precise execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Craig|title=Composite or PVC: Which One is Best?|url=http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/green-products/composite-or-pvc--which-one-is-best-.aspx|publisher=EcoBuilding Pulse|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Advantages==
PVC decking offers the most significant fade, stain, and mold resistance among decking products. The products are marketed as low-maintenance and are typically easy to clean and maintain. PVC decking typically doesn't require staining, sanding, or painting. It is sometimes partially composed of recycled plastic material, making it an environmentally friendly, efficient use of resources. The product is significantly lighter compared to wood composite products and can be bent and shaped to create custom configurations.&lt;ref name="RemodelingMagazine"/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Compared to other synthetic decking products, PVC is the most expensive. The 100% PVC makeup of the board makes it costlier than the wood powder/plastic mix used in composite decking. This cost means that PVC will be a more expensive investment up front, although manufacturers claim that the long life and low maintenance requirements of the deck make it an economical decision in the long run. PVC lacks the realistic feel of wood. Although manufacturers form the product with a realistic wood grain or brushstroke, some contractors and homeowners simply do not like the artificial sheen of the product. PVC is also formulated to resist scratches, stains, and mold, but some wear will still show over the life of the product.

[[File:Helianthus annuus pollen 1.jpg|thumb|right|Helianthus annuus pollen]]
'''Pollen zones''' are a system of subdividing the [[last glacial period]] and [[Holocene]] paleoclimate using the data from [[pollen core]]s. The sequence provides a global chronological structure to a wide variety of researchers, such as [[geology|geologists]], [[climatology|climatologisist]]s, [[geography|geographers]] and [[archaeologist]]s, who study the physical and cultural environment of the last 15,000 years.

==History==
The palynological aspects of the system were first investigated extensively by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[palynology|palynologist]] [[Lennart von Post]] in the years before the [[World War I|First World War]]. By analysing pollen  in [[core sample]]s taken from [[peat]] bogs, von Post noticed that different plant species were represented in bands through the cores.

The differing species and differing quantities of the same species are caused by changes in climate. Von Post was able to confirm the [[Blytt-Sernander]] climatic sequence showing fluctuations between warmer and colder periods across thousands of years. He used local peat sequences combined with [[varve]] dating to produce a regional climatic chronology for [[Scandinavia]].

In 1940 [[Harry Godwin]] began applying von Post's methods to pollen cores from the [[British Isles]] to produce the wider European sequence accepted today. It basically expanded the Blytt-Sernander further into the late [[Pleistocene]] and refined some of its periods. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], the technique spread to the Americas.

Currently scientists are focusing a repertory of several different methods on [[core sample]]s in peat, ice, lake and ocean bottoms, and sediments to achieve "high resolution" dating not possible to only one method: [[Carbon dating]], [[Dendrochronology]], [[Oxygen isotope ratio cycle|isotope ratios]] on a number of gases, studies of insects and molluscs, and others. While often doubting the utility of the modified Bytt-Sernander, they seem to confirm and expand it all the more.

==Notes on the sequence table==
At present nine main pollen zones, I-IX, are defined, based on the work of [[Johannes Iversen|J. Iversen]], published in 1954. These are matched to period names called "biostratigraphic divisions" in the table, which were defined for Denmark by Iverson based on layers in the peat bogs. They represent climatic and biological zones in the peat. 

Others have used these names in different senses, such as the 1974 chronozones of J. Mangerud. The sequences in Germany and Sweden are not exactly the same as those in Denmark, inviting scientists there to use the names still differently or make other definitions. Moreover, the names are apt to be used interchangeably for glacials, interglacials, stadial, interstadials, or oscillations, leading some scientists to deplore the lack of system.

The system of the table below covers from around 13,000 BC to the modern day. Dates, given in years BC, are best viewed as being based on uncalibrated C-14 dates, which, when calibrated, would result in much earlier BC dates. For example, an Older Dryas start date of 10,000 BC translates roughly into an uncalibrated BP date of 12,000. Calibrated, that becomes 14,000 BP, 12,000 BC. To obtain quick, on-line calibrations, you may use [http://www.calpal-online.de/index.html CalPal].

The dates in the table correspond relatively well to more modern dates for the earlier periods. Larger discrepancies begin at the end of the Boreal. More, and more modern, details on the dating of the periods are given under the article for each one.

The archaeological periods listed only apply to north Europe, and do so approximately. For example, there is no uniform chronozone, "the Bronze Age", which would apply globally or even be of the same dates between north and south Europe.

The geological stages listed are only defined for the British Isles. Scientists use different names for north Europe, south Europe and other regions. However, they are cross-correlated in the articles for the ones listed.

In contrast to glacial periods, these pollen zones are being used to apply globally, with but few exceptions. It is acceptable, for example, to refer to the "Younger Dryas" of [[Antarctica]], which has no pollen of its own. A few scientists disapprove of such uses.

'''Prehistoric art in Scotland''' is [[visual art]] created or found within the modern borders of Scotland, before the departure of the [[Roman Empire in Britain|Romans]] from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Medieval era]]. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context that would allow them to be understood.

The earliest examples of [[portable art]] from what is now Scotland are highly decorated [[petrosphere|carved stone balls]] from the [[Neolithic]] period, which share patterns with Irish and Scottish stone carvings. Other items from this period include elaborate carved maceheads and figurines from [[Links of Noltland]], including the [[Westray Wife]], which is the earliest known depiction of a human face from Scotland.

From the [[Bronze Age]] there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and [[cup and ring marks]].  Representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are probably the oldest two-dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Elaborate carved stone [[battle-axe]]s may be symbolic representations of power. Surviving metalwork includes [[gold lunula]] or neckplates, [[jet (lignite)|jet]] beaded necklaces and elaborate weaponry, such as [[Xiphos|leaf sword]]s and ceremonial shields of sheet bronze.

From the [[Iron Age]] there are more extensive examples of patterned objects and gold work. Evidence of the wider [[La Tène]] culture includes the [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]]. The [[Stirling torcs]] demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland and continental workmanship. One of the most impressive items from this period is the boar's head fragment of the Deskford [[carnyx]]. From the first century CE, as Rome carried out a series of occupations, there are Roman artifacts like the [[Cramond Lioness]] and Roman influence on material culture can be seen in local stone carvings.

==Definitions and meanings==
[[File:Ancient cup and ring stone, Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow - DSC06245.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Cup and ring marks]] survive in large numbers from Scotland and have been suggested to have a variety of meanings]]
The ability to study [[prehistoric art]] is dependent on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and to a lesser extent wood), later pottery and metal, are more likely to be extant. Whether all these artifacts can be defined as works of art is contested between scholars. [[Alexander Marshack]] argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, [[Paul Mellars]] suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", in G. Berghaus, ed., ''New Perspectives on Prehistoric Art'' (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004), {{ISBN|0-2759-7813-3}}, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Renfrew]] has pointed out the dangers of applying modern values of art to past societies and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bradley, ''Image and Audience: Rethinking Prehistoric Art'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-1915-6955-0}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached with a set of post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;N. Sharples, "Comment I. Contextualising Iron Age art", in D. Garrow, ed., ''Rethinking Celtic Art'' (Oxford: Oxbow Books, 2008), {{ISBN|1-7829-7821-6}}, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many meanings have been suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air [[rock art]] may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art may have had a ritual role in [[initiation ceremony|rites of initiation]], [[vision quests]] or [[totemic]] ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as [[notation]] systems and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson, ed., ''Building with Scottish Stone'' (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), {{ISBN|1-904320-02-3}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers also introduced [[chambered cairn]] tombs, as at [[Maeshowe]],&lt;ref name=Fry&amp;Fry1992p7&gt;F. Somerset Fry and P. Somerset Fry, ''The History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7100-9001-3}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the many standing stones and circles such as those at [[Standing Stones of Stenness|Stenness]] on the mainland of Orkney, which dates from about 3100 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;C. Wickham-Jones, ''Orkney: A Historical Guide'' (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2007), {{ISBN|0-8579-0591-0}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar stones to which are found across Europe from about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;F. Lynch, ''Megalithic Tombs and Long Barrows in Britain'' (Bodley: Osprey, 1997), {{ISBN|0-7478-0341-2}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no surviving art from the Mesolithic period in Scotland, probably because the mobile peoples of the period would have made this on perishable organic items.&lt;ref&gt;G. Warren, ''Mesolithic Lives in Scotland'' (Tempus, 2005), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the oldest surviving [[portable art|portable visual art]] from Scotland are carved stone balls, or [[petrosphere]]s, that date from the late Neolithic era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,&lt;ref name=Towie&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-033-206-C "Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but a handful of examples are known from [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]], five of which were found at the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]].&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;D. N. Marshall, "Carved Stone Balls", ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', 108 (1976/77), pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions.&lt;ref name=Towie/&gt; Their production may have continued into the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The complex carved circles and spirals on these balls can be seen mirrored in the carving on what was probably a lintel from a chambered cairn at [[Pierowall]] on [[Westray]], Orkney, which seem to be part of the same culture that produced carvings at [[Newgrange]] in Ireland.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp10-11&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, elaborately carved [[Mace (bludgeon)|maceheads]] are often found in burial sites, like that found at Airdens in Sutherland, which has a pattern of interlocking diamond-shaped facets, similar to those found across Neolithic Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp10-11/&gt;

Pottery appeared in the Neolithic period once hunters and gatherers transitioned to a sedentary lifestyle, until then they needed to use lightweight, mobile containers.&lt;ref name=Bahn1997p100&gt;P.

Ritchie, ''Prehistoric Orkney'' (London: B.T. Batsford Ltd, 1995), {{ISBN|0-7134-7593-5}}, pp. 52 and 54.&lt;/ref&gt; There are scattered occurrences of Unstan ware on the Scottish Mainland, as at [[Balbridie]],&lt;ref&gt;N. Reynolds, and I. Ralston, ''Balbridie, Discovery and Excavation in Scotland 1979'' (Edinburgh: Council for British Archaeology: Scottish Regional Group, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Western Isles]], as at [[Eilean Domhnuill]].&lt;ref&gt;A.

In 2009 the [[Westray Wife]], a lozenge-shaped figurine that is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face found in Scotland, was discovered at the site of a Neolithic village at [[Links of Noltland]] near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray. The figurine's face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Urquhart |first=Frank |date=21 August 2009 |title=Face to face with the 5,000-year-old 'first Scot' |location=Edinburgh |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Face-to-face-with-the.5575575.jp |accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two figurines were subsequently found at the site in 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first= |date=28 August 2012 |title=Third 5,000-year-old figurine found at Orkney dig |location= |publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19397929|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon ''The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3151-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As elsewhere in Europe, [[hill forts]] were first introduced in this period.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0-5002-8795-3}}, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

From this period there are extensive examples of rock art. These include [[cup and ring mark]]s, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the [[Kilmartin]] district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are probably the oldest two-dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Similar carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial [[cist]]s in [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Kincardine]].&lt;ref&gt;V. G. Childe, ''The Prehistory Of Scotland'' (London: Taylor and Francis, 1935), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also elaborate carved stone [[battle-axe]]s found in East Lothian, Aberdenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, and so, rather than being practical objects, may be symbolic representations of power.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Forteviot Bronze Age tomb|site at Forteviot]], in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral and has an axehead pecked into the underside, and underneath there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather scabbard and a carved wooden bowl.&lt;ref&gt;N.

Surviving metalwork includes personal items like the [[gold lunula]] or neckplates found at Auchentaggart in Dumfriesshire and Southside, Lanarkshire, which date from about 2000 BCE and are similar to those found in relatively large numbers in Ireland, but also with examples across Great Britain and in Portugal.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p13&lt;ref&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-036-527-C&amp;scache=3tl8ga9bi2&amp;searchdb=scran "Collar from Southside, Lanarkshire], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 28 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jet (lignite)|Jet]] beaded necklaces strung in a crescent shape have been found at sites including Poltalloch and Melfort in Argyll and [[Aberlemno]] in Angus.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p13/&gt;

==Iron Age==
{{See also|Iron Age}}
[[File:Museum of ScotlandDSCF6322.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Leichestown Deskford [[carnyx]] and reconstruction, probably dating from the first century CE]]
The Iron Age began in Scotland from about the seventh century BCE. From this point there are the first finds of iron artifacts in hoards that are consistent containing other items that are consistent with Bronze Age practice. there is also evidence of smithing and smelting on some settlement sites. Iron Age society in Scotland shared many traits with Southern Britain, Ireland and in some cases continental Europe. These included [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]] and enclosed and fortified settlements, but it also contained elements of independent development.&lt;ref&gt;I. Armit and I. B. M. Ralston, "The Iron Age", in K. J. Edwards, I. B. M. Ralston, eds, ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC – AD 1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1736-1}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early part of the period there is relatively little metalwork and a larger amount of ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples, "Comment I. Contextualising Iron Age art", p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The assemblage of early Iron Age ceramics from Atlantic Scotland is large compared with the rest of Britain. There are a wide variety of forms and styles, some which resemble those of southern Britain, particularly those with incised geometric ornament.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Harding, ''The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders'' (London: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|1-1344-1787-X}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period Scotland had been penetrated by the wider [[La Tène]] culture, which is named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Collingwood and J. N. L. Myres, ''Roman, Britain and the English Settlements'' (New York, NY: Biblo &amp; Tannen, 2nd edn., 1936), {{ISBN|978-0-8196-1160-4}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] are perhaps the most impressive of the relatively few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stirling torcs]], found in 2009, are a group of four gold [[torc]]s in different styles, dating from 300 BCE and 100 BCE. Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France, and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum/past_exhibitions/iron_age_gold.aspx "Iron Age Gold"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are surviving ring-headed pins, which were probably made locally and not imported, and appear to be part of a British and Irish type that was not part of the La Tène culture. There are also spiral finger rings, glass beads and long-handled combs, which are found across Britain, but have local characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Harding, ''The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders'' (London: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|1-1344-1787-X}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze [[Stichill]] collar is a large engraved necklace, fastened at the back with a pin. The [[Mortonhall]] [[scabbard]], probably from the first century CE, is elaborately decorated with trumpet curves and "S"-scrolls. Further north there are finds of massive bronze armlets, often with enamelled decoration, like the ones found at [[Culbin Sands]], Moray.&lt;ref&gt;R. Megaw and J. V. S. Megaw, ''Early Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (Bodley: Osprey, 2nd edn., 2008), {{ISBN|0-7478-0613-6}}, pp. 72–4.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most impressive items from this period is the boars head fragment of the Deskford [[carnyx]], a war-trumpet from [[Deskford]] in Banffshire, probably dating from the first century CE. Similar instruments are mentioned in Roman sources and depicted on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]] found in Denmark.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p16&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In stone carving there are a number of simple stone heads from Scotland, like that found at [[Coupar Angus]] in Perthshire, that may date from the Iron Age. They are similar to those found across Great Britain and Ireland, although they are difficult to date and may have been made much later.&lt;ref&gt;I.

[[File:Cramond Lioness.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cramond Lioness]] found near the Roman base of [[Cramond Roman Fort]] near Edinburgh, which was occupied in the second century CE]]
The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 the occupation was limited to the [[Southern Uplands]] and by the end of the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and [[Solway Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;W.

The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 and the Romans withdrew back to the line of Hadrian's Wall,&lt;ref name=Antoninewall /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. J.

The Antonine Wall and its associated forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Apollo]]. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house in the shape of a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess [[Fortuna]], both found at [[Bearsden]] Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/collections/permanentdisplays/theantoninewall/theantoninewallslideshow/#d.en.219761 The Antonine Wall: Rome's Final Frontier: Slideshow], ''Glasgow University, The Hunterian'', retrieved 19 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Away from the wall, Roman sculptures include the marble head of a Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at [[Hawkshaw, Scottish Borders|Hawkshaw]], Peebleshire in the late eighteenth century. It dates to the second century CE and may have been looted from a Roman monument further to the south.&lt;ref&gt;L. J. F.

A [[relief]] of the goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]] found near Birrens in [[Dumfriesshire]], combines elements of native and classical art.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, pp. 16–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Newstead Helmet]], found at the Roman fort in Newstead, near Melrose in Roxburghshire, is one of the most impressive of many finds of Roman arms and armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Parade helmet and face mask | url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-036-815-C&amp;scache=6r7o44xpxl&amp;searchdb=scran | publisher=[[National Museums Scotland]] | accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] is a second-century Romano-British ''[[trulla]]'' apparently decorated as a souvenir for a soldier who had served on Hadrian's Wall, and probably made locally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1577008&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=enamelled+pan&amp;fromDate=1&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toDate=300&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 "The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan"], ''British Museum'', retrieved 28 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of items were also found in the Sculptor's Cave, Coversea in Morayshire, including Roman pottery, rings, bracelets, needles and coins, some of which had been re-used for ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/16278/details/sculptor+s+cave+covesea/ "Site Record for Sculptor's Cave Covesea"], ''Historic Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland'', retrieved 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public screening''' is the showing of moving pictures to an audience in a public place. The event screened may be live or recorded, free or [[payment|paid]], and may use film, [[video]], or a broadcast method such as [[satellite television|satellite]] or [[closed-circuit television]]. Popular events for public screenings include [[film screening|films]], sporting events, and [[concert]]s. '''Private screening''' refers to the screening of a commercially made film to a group of people somewhere other than one of their homes. Private screening can be legally complex, as the rules and regulations vary from country to country.

Live public screenings of [[association football]] matches, called "{{ill|Public Viewing|de}}", became especially popular at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 football World Cup]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=CNN2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Pleitgen|first=Fred|title=Germany's World Cup legacy: What can South Africa learn?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/04/27/football.world.cup.germany/|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showing a video to a group of people outside of the home is legally regarded as a public showing, and is therefore in breach of [[copyright]] for DVDs/videos that have been purchased or hired for domestic use. To organise a group screening, permission from the copyright owner of the title in question will need to be obtained. Obtaining such rights clearances can be a complex procedure.

For certain types of screening ("non-theatrical" screening), it is possible to hire a copy of a film from its [[distributor]] with the rights already cleared. The primary non-theatrical distributors of feature films on DVD, video and [[16 mm film|16mm]] in Britain are the BFI and Filmbank Distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it on DVD or video?

Another option is to buy a ''blanket'' licence for the year known as a 'Public Video Screening Licence' which may work out cheaper if showing film is to be a regular event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to Filmbank |publisher=Filmbank |url=http://www.filmbank.co.uk/content.asp?id=25871 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006181236/http://www.filmbank.co.uk/content.asp?id=25871|archivedate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pusilhá''' is an archaeological site in [[Belize]]. The location of this Late Classic Maya urban complex along the east and west flow of trade afford archaeologist a historical view of a secondary Maya site.  Continuing excavation has changed the overall picture of Maya social and political relationships between larger and smaller cities.  The research conducted at Pusilhá began at the beginning of the 20th century and continues to this day.

==Location==
The site of Pusilhá is located in the Toledo district of [[Belize]] in the town of San Benito Poité.   Situated between the Poite and Pusilha rivers that run east and west may have had an impact of why the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] urban complex was built there.  The site is also located favorably between the Caribbean to the south and the Maya Mountains to the east.   Pusilhá was also situated in the region for the flow of goods and ideas from the central lowlands and southeastern periphery located in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanton|first=Richard W.|author2=Gary M. Feinman |title=The Mesoamerican World System|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=86|pages=673–682|doi=10.1525/aa.1984.86.3.02a00100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the major Maya urban sites of central lowlands at [[Caracol]] and [[Tikal]] and the southern lowland site of [[Copan]], Pusilhá was possibly a major transfer point for economic activates in the whole of the lowland region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braswell|first=Geoffrey|title=The rise of secondary statesin the southeastern periphery of the Maya world; a report of recent archeological and epigraphic research at Pusilhá, Belize|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|year=2004|volume=15 | issue = 2|pages=219–233|doi=10.1017/s0956536104040143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation==
The initial site survey was conducted in 1927 by archaeologists from the British Museum Expedition to British Honduras that was led by [[Thomas Athol Joyce|Thomas Joyce]].  The survey led to the removal of the best preserved [[stelae]] from Pusilhá to the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=stela+pusilha+600-800 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joyce|first=T.

Morley]]’s discussion work ''The Inscriptions of Petén''. Thomas Joyce also conducted an extensive ceramics evaluation in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joyce|first=T.

The excavation that has continued to present has exposed three major areas at the center of Pusilhá to archaeological interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braswell|first=Geoffrey E. |author2=Christian M.

==History==
{{Maya civilization}}
Pusilhá has a series of confirmed occupation date.  It is known through ceramic analysis that this site is dateable to the late classic.  A stelae found on site indicates a late classic occupation.  According to Braswell, the current excavator of the site, “Stela P begins with the initial series date of '''9.7.0.0.0''' and contains a historical retrospective date of '''9.6.17.8.18''' (A.D. 570), implying that the kingdom was founded shortly before the beginning of the Late Classic period”.&lt;ref name="Braswell2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braswell|first=Geoffrey E. |author2=Christian M.

Transitions in ceramics, burials and construction coupled with the usual cessation of inscriptions on stelae indicate continued occupation at Pusilhá through to the post classic.

Dissertation, Department of Anthropology, Vanderbilt University|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political==
The initial excavation and surveys seem to show that politically Pusilhá was a second tier polity.  The ceramics evidence showed that there were ties to Copan and Quirigua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheptak|first=Russel N. |editor=Eugenia J Robinson |title=Interaction between Belize and the Ulua Valley|journal=In Interaction on the Southeast Mesoamerican Frontier: Prehistoric and Historic Honduras and El Salvador|year=1987|series=Bar International Series|issue=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also seems likely that there were connections between Tikal and Caracol as those polities  rose to prominence in the Petén.  Based in part to the favorable location of Pusilhá along both east and west corridors of trade and the north and south axis of influence that had Caracol to the north and Copan to the south it seemed likely that the polity was politically dependent to one of its larger neighbors. But the current archaeological evidence indicates that Pusilhá maintained its independence.&lt;ref name="Braswell2004" /&gt;

==Ruling Elite==
The archaeological evidence indicates that Pusilhá was a traditional Maya "elite" led urban complex.  There are known to be eight rulers that are associated with the Pusilhá emblem glyph from the [[late Classic]] period with a possible two additional from the [[Terminal Classic]].  All total there are 39 named individuals that have been discovered by the epigraphers in the hieroglyphic record.  Of note is an individual who at first was linked as a ruler of Copan based on the artifactual record of that polity.  k’ak’ u ti’ chan is the name of Ruler B of Pusilhá as well as Ruler 11 at Copan and was first ascribed to be the same individual.  Further research has shown that they were contemporaries to each other that had  different known parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braswell|first=Geoffrey E.|author2=Sherry A. Gibbs |title=In the Land of the Avocado: Recent Archaeological Investigations at Pusilha, Toledo District, Belize|journal=Research Reports in Belizean Archaeology|year=2006|volume=3|pages=271–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site Significance==
The site of Pusilhá has the one representation of bridge construction  that has survived to modern time. The polity of Pusilhá also offers a look at the quantity and quality of the stelae available for study from a secondary urban complex.  This site may represent an alternative method of looking at how the Maya govern themselves that is contrary to prevailing view of conquest and absorption of smaller cities into the larger cities in the region.  To truly understand this site it must be stated that research and excavation is at a very early stage and that more work is required to fully understand the place that Pusilhá holds in the greater Maya world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braswell|first=Geoffrey E. |author2=Christian M.

'''Robert David Putnam'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|t|n|ə|m}}.}} (born 1941) is an American political scientist. He is the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at the [[Harvard University]] [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. Putnam developed the influential [[two-level game theory]] that assumes [[international agreement]]s will only be successfully brokered if they also result in domestic benefits. His most famous (and controversial) work, ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', argues that the [[United States]] has undergone an unprecedented collapse in civic, social, associational, and political life ([[social capital]]) since the 1960s, with serious negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Parry, "Can Robert Putnam Save the American Dream" ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', March 12, 2015 [http://chronicle.com/article/Can-Robert-Putnam-Save-the/228443/  Chronicle Review]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he co-published an article in which he noted that the trend had moved the other way; he continued to advocate a push towards more social capital but he felt his famous thesis ("Americans are now bowling alone") was no longer true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Still Bowling Alone? The Post-9/11 Split|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/ocpa/pdf/still%20bowling%20alone.pdf|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, he published a book called ''Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis'' that looked at issues of inequality of opportunity in the [[US]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release on book release|url=http://robertdputnam.com/about-our-kids/press-release/|website=robertdputnam.com|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Robert David Putnam was born on January 9, 1941, in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name=Tervetuloa&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert D.

An outstanding student, he won a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Fellowship]] to study at [[Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and went on to earn [[Master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate]] degrees from [[Yale University]], the latter in 1970. He taught at the [[University of Michigan]] until joining the faculty at Harvard in 1979, where he has held a variety of positions, including Dean of the Kennedy School, and is currently the [[Malkin Professor of Public Policy]]. Putnam was raised as a religiously observant [[Methodist]]. In 1963, Putnam married his wife Rosemary, a special education teacher and [[French horn]] player.&lt;ref name=NYT82212 /&gt; Around the time of his marriage, he [[Convert to Judaism|converted to Judaism]], his wife's religion.&lt;ref&gt;The Forward, [http://www.forward.com/articles/133047 Robert Putnam Assays Religious Tolerance From a Unique Angle], Retrieved November 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Making Democracy Work''==
His first work in the area of [[social capital]] was ''[[Making Democracy Work|Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy]]'', a comparative study of regional governments in Italy which drew great scholarly attention for its argument that the success of democracies depends in large part on the horizontal bonds that make up social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert D. |last1=Putnam |year=1994 |title=[[Making Democracy Work|Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy]] |isbn=978-0-691-03738-7 }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam writes that northern Italy's history of community, guilds, clubs, and choral societies led to greater civic involvement and greater economic prosperity.&lt;ref name=Putnam1993&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ncr.4100820204 |title=What Makes Democracy Work? |journal=National Civic Review |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=101–107 |year=1993 |last1=Putnam |first1=Robert D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the agrarian society of Southern Italy is less prosperous economically and democratically because of less social capital. Social capital, which Putnam defines as "networks and norms of civic engagement", allows members of a community to trust one another.&lt;ref name=Putnam1993/&gt; When community members trust one another, trade, money-lending, and democracy flourish.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==''Bowling Alone''==
{{BLP sources section|date=October 2015}}
In 1995 he published "Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital" in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]''. The article was widely read and garnered much attention for Putnam, including an invitation to meet with then-President [[Bill Clinton]] and a spot in the pages of ''[[People magazine|People]]''. Some critics argued that Putnam was ignoring new organizations and forms of social capital; others{{who|date= October 2017}} argued that many of the included organizations were responsible for the suppression of civil rights movements and the reinforcement of anti-egalitarian social norms. Over the last decade and a half, the United States had seen an increase in bowlers but a decrease in bowling leagues.

In 2000, he published ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community]]'', a book-length expansion of the original argument, adding new evidence and answering many of his critics. Though he measured the decline of social capital with data of many varieties, his most striking point was that many traditional civic, social and fraternal organizations&amp;nbsp;– typified by [[bowling league]]s&amp;nbsp;– had undergone a massive decline in membership while the number of people bowling had increased dramatically.

Putnam makes a distinction between two kinds of social capital: bonding capital and bridging capital. Bonding occurs when you are socializing with people who are like you: same age, same race, same religion, and so on. But in order to create peaceful societies in a diverse multi-ethnic country, one needs to have a second kind of social capital: bridging. Bridging is what you do when you make friends with people who are not like you, like supporters of another football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Putnam|first1=Robert D.|title=Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|isbn=0743203046|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam argues that those two kinds of social capital, bonding and bridging, do strengthen each other. Consequently, with the decline of the bonding capital mentioned above inevitably comes the decline of the bridging capital leading to greater ethnic tensions.

In 2016, Putnam explained his inspiration for the book, by saying,
{{quote|We've [Americans] been able to run a different kind of society. A less statist society, a more free-market society, because we had real strength in the area of social capital and we had relatively high levels of social trust. We sort of did trust one another, not perfectly, of course, but we did. Not compared to other countries. And all that is declining, and I began to worry, "Well, gee, isn't that going to be a problem, if our system is built for one kind of people and one kind of community, and now we've got a different one. Maybe it's not going to work so well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/robert-d-putnam/|title=Robert D. Putnam on Conversations with Bill Kristol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics such as the sociologist [[Claude Fischer]] argue that (a) Putnam concentrates on organizational forms of social capital, and pays much less attention to networks of interpersonal social capital; (b) Putnam neglects the emergence of new forms of supportive organizations on and off the Internet; and (c) the 1960s are a misleading baseline because the era had an unusually high number of traditional organizations.

Since the publication of ''Bowling Alone'', Putnam has worked on efforts to revive American social capital, notably through the [[Saguaro Seminar]], a series of meetings among academics, civil society leaders, commentators, and politicians to discuss strategies to re-connect Americans with their communities. These resulted in the publication of the book and website, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060714080329/http://www.bettertogether.org/ Better Together],'' which provides case studies of vibrant and new forms of social capital building in the United States

== Social capital ==
Putnam theorizes a relation in the negatives trends in society. He envisions a uniting factor named [[social capital]]; originally coined by social theorist [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Alexis deToqueville]] as a strength within America allowing democracy to thrive due to the closeness of society, "trends in civic engagement of a wider sort".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Robert D.|date=1995|title=Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital|url=|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam observes a declining trend in social capital since the 1960s. The decreasing in social capital is blamed for rising rates in unhappiness as well as political apathy. Low social capital, a feeling of alienation within society is associated with additional consequences such as:

* Lower confidence in local government, local leaders and the local news media.
* Lower political efficacy – that is, confidence in one's own influence.
* Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups.
* Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result.
* Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of [[collective action]] (e.g., voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage).
* Less likelihood of working on a community project.
* Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering.
* Fewer close friends and confidants.
* Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life.
* More time spent watching [[television]] and more agreement that "television is my most important form of entertainment".

==Diversity and trust within communities==
In recent years, Putnam has been engaged in a comprehensive study of the relationship between [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] within communities and their ethnic diversity. His conclusion based on over 40 cases and 30,000 people within the United States is that in the short term, other things being equal, ''more'' diversity in a community is associated with ''less'' trust both among and within ethnic groups. Putnam describes people of all races, sex, socioeconomic statuses, and ages as "hunkering down", avoiding engagement with their local community as diversity increases. Although limited to American data, his findings run counter the [[contact hypothesis]] which proposes that distrust declines as members of different ethnic groups interact, and [[conflict theory]] which suggests that while distrust ''among'' ethnic groups rises with diversity, distrust ''within'' ethnic groups should decrease. Putnam found that even when controlling for income inequality and crime rates, two factors which [[conflict theory]] states should be prime causal factors in declining inter-ethnic group trust, more diversity is still associated with less communal trust. Further, he found that low communal trust is associated with the same consequences as low social capital. Putnam says, however, that "in the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Putnam published his data set from this study in 2001&lt;ref name="Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, 2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221143809/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html#.UDTTcnCUpME|archive-date=February 21, 2015|url=http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html#.UDTTcnCUpME |work=Public Opinion Archives|publisher=[[Roper Center for Public Opinion Research]]|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hendrix | first=Anastasia | title=Fewer In S.F.

Putnam has been criticized for the lag between his initial study and his publication of his article. In 2006, Putnam was quoted in the ''Financial Times'' as saying he had delayed publishing the article until he could "develop proposals to compensate for the negative effects of diversity" (quote from John Lloyd of Financial Times).&lt;ref name=FT10806&gt;{{cite news|last=Lloyd|first=John|title=Study paints bleak picture of ethnic diversity|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c4ac4a74-570f-11db-9110-0000779e2340.html#axzz24HMFQrIc|accessdate=August 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times|The Financial Times]]  |date=October 8, 2006|location=London | publisher = [[The Nikkei]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, writing in ''City Journal'', [[John Leo]] questioned whether this suppression of publication was ethical behavior for a scholar, noting that "Academics aren't supposed to withhold negative data until they can suggest antidotes to their findings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Leo | first = John | author-link = John Leo | title = Bowling with our own |url = http://www.city-journal.org/html/eon2007-06-25jl.html | work = [[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]] | publisher = [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] | date = June 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Putnam did release the data in 2001 and publicized this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/saguaro/communitysurvey/results3.html|title=The Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey|website=www.ksg.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putnam denied allegations he was arguing against diversity in society and contended that his paper had been "twisted" to make a case against race-conscious admissions to universities. He asserted that his "extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Berlett | first = Tom | title=Harvard Sociologist Says His Research Was 'Twisted' | url = https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/robert-putnam-says-his-research-was-twisted/30357 | work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | publisher =  | date = August 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he briefly met Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] to discuss the role of civil society in the Libyan political context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Putnam | first = Robert D. | title=With Libya's Megalomaniac 'Philosopher-King' | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703408604576164363053350664 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | publisher = [[News Corp]] | date = February 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semiotics of culture''' is a research field within [[semiotics]] that attempts to define [[culture]] from semiotic perspective and as a type of human symbolic activity, creation of [[sign]]s and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a [[system]] of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as '''semiotics of culture and language'''. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.

The research field was of particular interest for the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]] ([[USSR]]). Linguists and semioticians by the Tartu School viewed culture as a hierarchical semiotic system consisting of set of functions correlated to it, and linguistic codes that are used by social groups to maintain coherence. These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central.

The study received a research ground also in [[Japan]] where the idea that culture and nature should not be contrasted and contradicted but rather harmonized was developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3798">'''Tarka Sastra''' is a science of dialectics, logic and reasoning, and art of debate that analyzes the nature and source of knowledge and its validity. Sastra in [[Sanskrit]] means that which gives teaching, instruction or command. Tarka means debate or an argument. According to one reckoning, there are six sastras. Vyakarana is one of them. Four of the sastras are particularly important Vyakarana, Mimamsa, Tarka, and Vedanta.

The sastra has concepts called "[[purva paksha|poorva paksha]]" and "apara paksha". When one raises a point (poorva paksha) the other one criticizes it (apara paksha). Then the debate starts. Each one tries to support his point of view by getting various references. The meaning of the word tarka also is specific, in that it does not imply a pure logical analysis but a complex activity of discourse guided by strict definitions and goals so as to have. This concept is referred in [[Bhagawad Gita]] as "vAdaH pravadatAmasmi" (vibhooti yOga).

Tarkasamgraha which is the foundational text of logic and discourse was al the text followed as a Guidelines for discourses. Tarka may be translated as "hypothetical argument." Tarka is the process of questioning and cross-questioning that leads to a particular conclusion. It is a form of supposition that can be used as an aid to the attainment of valid knowledge.

There are several scholars well-versed in Tarka Sastras – [[Adi Shankara]] (788-820 CE), Ramanujacharya,Madhwacharya, [[Uddyotakara|Uddyotkar]] (Nyayavartik, 6th-7th century), [[Vācaspati Miśra]] (Tatparyatika, 9th century), [[Udayanacharya]] (Tatparyaparishuddhi, 10th century), [[Jayanta Bhatta]] (Nyayamanjari, 9th century), Vishwanath (Nyayasutravrtti, 17th century), and Radhamohan Goswami (Nyayasutravivaran, 18th century), [[Kumaran Asan]]. [[Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri]] and [[Sengalipuram Anantarama Dikshitar]] were specialized in Vyakarana, Mimamsa and Tarka Sastra. Also, Krishna Sastri excelled all those scholars of his contemporary period in Tarka Sastra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25149">'''Transparency''', as used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], the [[humanities]] and in other [[Social actions|social]] contexts, is operating in such a way that it is easy for others to see what actions are performed. It has been defined simply as "the perceived quality of intentionally shared information from a sender".&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; Transparency implies [[openness]], communication, and [[accountability]].

Transparency is practiced in companies, organizations, administrations, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening government: A guide to best practice in transparency, accountability and civic engagement across the public sector|url=http://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Opening-Government3.pdf|website=Transparency Initiative|publisher=Transparency &amp; Accountability Initiative|accessdate=September 11, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218030712/http://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Opening-Government3.pdf|archivedate=February 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It guides an organization's decisions and policies on the disclosure of information to its employees and the public, or simply the intended recipient of the information.&lt;ref name='JOM'&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schnackenberg | first1 = Andrew K. | last2 = Tomlinson | first2 = Edward C. | title = Organizational transparency: a new perspective on managing trust in organization-stakeholder relationships | journal = [[Journal of Management]] | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0149206314525202 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206314525202 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Published online before print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a cashier making change after a point of sale transaction by offering a record of the items purchased (e.g., a receipt) as well as counting out the customer's change on the counter demonstrates one type of transparency.

The term '''transparency''' has a very different meaning in Information Security where it is used to describe security mechanisms that are intentionally in-detectable or hidden from view.  Examples include hiding utilities and tools which the user does not need to know in order to do their job, like keeping the remote re-authentication operations of Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol hidden from the user. 

==Wages==
In Norway and in Sweden, tax authorities annually release the "skatteliste" or "tax list"; official records showing the annual income and overall wealth of nearly every taxpayer.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink = |title = Norway Divided by Citizen Wealth Tables|date = October 23, 2009|publisher = |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/global/24tax.html?_r=2&amp;ref=global|work = The New York Times|pages = |accessdate = 22 November 2009|language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations in Hong Kong require banks to list their top earners – without naming them – by pay band.&lt;ref name='retreat'&gt;{{cite news | first=Jill | last=Treanor |authorlink= | title=Government retreats over naming bank top earners - Top 20 highest paid employees now unlikely to be identified unless they have boardroom roles | date=22 November 2009 | publisher= | url =https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/22/banks-top-20-earners | work = [[The Guardian]] | pages = | accessdate = 22 November 2009  | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Spanish government for the first time released information on how much each cabinet member is worth, but data on ordinary citizens is private.

==Management==
[[File:Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] students demonstrate in favor of transparency in school administration, 2010]]
Recent research suggests there are three primary aspects of transparency relevant to management practice: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; To increase transparency, managers actively infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. For example, managers that voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists are demonstrating disclosure; managers that limit the use of [[technical terminology]], [[fine print]], or complicated mathematical notations in their correspondence with suppliers and customers are demonstrating clarity; and managers that do not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in their communications with investors are demonstrating accuracy. The ''strategic'' management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the organization's specific objectives.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt;

Alternatively, [[radical transparency]] is a [[management]] method where nearly all decision making is carried out publicly. All draft documents, all arguments for and against a proposal, all final decisions, and the decision making process itself are made public and remain publicly archived. This approach has grown in popularity with the rise of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Marcia W. | last1= DiStaso | first2= Denise Sevick | last2= Bortree | title= Ethical practice of social media in public relations | page= 23 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9781317917908 | year= 2014 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MujpAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of organizations utilizing this style are the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community and [[Indymedia]].

[[Corporate transparency]], a form of [[radical transparency]], is the concept of removing all barriers to —and the facilitating of— free and easy public access to corporate information and the laws, rules, social [[connivance]] and processes that facilitate and protect those individuals and corporations that freely join, develop, and improve the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= Bernardi | first1= Richard A. |last2= LaCross |first2= Catherine C. | title= Corporate transparency: code of ethics disclosures | url= http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/405/essentials/p34.htm | work= The CPA Journal | publisher= New York State Society of the Certified Public Accountants (CPA) | date= April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organizations===
Accountability and transparency are of high relevance for [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs). In view of their responsibilities to stakeholders, including donors, sponsors, programme beneficiaries, staff, states and the public, they are considered to be of even greater importance to them than to commercial undertakings.&lt;ref name="huidobro-p60"&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Maria | last1= Francesch-Huidobro | title= Governance, politics and the environment: a Singapore study | page= 60 | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) | isbn = 9789812308313 | year= 2008 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrCqBmdZY5UC&amp;pg=PA60 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet these same values are often found to be lacking in NGOs.&lt;ref name="huidobro-p60"/&gt;

The ''[[INGO Accountability Charter|International NGO Accountability Charter]]'', linked to the [[Global Reporting Initiative]], documents the commitment of its members [[international NGO]]s to accountability and transparency, requiring them to submit an annual report, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Is GRI too much transparency for NGOs? | url = http://prizmablog.com/2011/03/27/is-gri-too-much-transparency-porn-for-ngos/ | publisher = PRIZMA | date = March 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Our accountability commitments: transparency | url = http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/home/our-accountability-commitments/transparency/ | publisher = INGO accountability charter | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150329081613/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/home/our-accountability-commitments/transparency/ | archivedate = 2015-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signed in 2006 by 11 NGOs active in the area of humanitarian rights, the INGO Accountability Charter has been referred to as the “first global accountability charter for the non-profit sector”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Thompson | first = Andrew S. | contribution = Laying the groundwork: Considerations for a charter for a proposed global civi society forum | editor-last1 = Walker | editor-first1 = James W.

==Media==
{{Main|Media transparency}}
[[Media transparency]] is the concept of determining how and why [[information]] is conveyed through various means.

If the media and the public knows everything that happens in all authorities and county administrations there will be a lot of questions, protests and suggestions coming from media and the public. People who are interested in a certain issue will try to influence the decisions. Transparency creates an everyday participation in the political processes by media and the public. One tool used to increase everyday participation in political processes is [[freedom of information]] legislation and requests. Modern [[democracy]] builds on such participation of the people and media.

There are, for anybody who is interested, many ways to influence the decisions at all levels in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= Moeller | first1= Susan D. | title= Openness &amp; accountability: a study of transparency in global media outlets | url= http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html | work= Studies | publisher= International Center for Media and the Public Agenda (ICMPA) | display-authors= etal | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515174519/http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html | archivedate= 2008-05-15 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Seal of Good Housekeeping plaque Santa Barbara Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|A 2011 [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] recognizing the municipality of [[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan]] for its "efforts in advancing the principles of [[accountability]] and transparency in [[local governance]]." ]]
The right and the means to examine the process of decision making is known as transparency.
In politics, transparency is used as a means of holding [[official|public officials]] [[accountability|accountable]] and fighting [[political corruption|corruption]]. When a [[government]]'s meetings are open to the [[Mass media|press]] and the public, its [[budgets]] may be reviewed by anyone, and its laws and decisions are open to discussion, it is seen as transparent. It is not clear however if this provides less opportunity for the authorities to abuse the system for their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Mattozzi | first1= Andrea | last2 = Merlo | first2 = Antonio | title = The transparency of politics and the quality of politicians | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 311–315 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] | doi = 10.1257/aer.97.2.311 | date = May 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.97.2.311 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~andrea/transparency.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When military authorities [[classified information|classify]] their plans as secret, transparency is absent. This can be seen as either positive or negative; positive because it can increase [[national security]], negative because it can lead to corruption and, in extreme cases, a [[military dictatorship]].

While a [[liberal democracy]] can be a [[plutocracy]], where decisions are made behind locked doors and the people have fewer possibilities to influence politics between the elections, a [[participative democracy]] is more closely connected to the will of the people.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Participative democracy, built on transparency and everyday participation, has been used officially in northern [[Europe]] for decades. In the northern European [[country]] [[Sweden]], [[Constitution of Sweden#Public access to governmental documents|public access to government documents]] became a law as early as 1766. It has officially been adopted as an ideal to strive for by the rest of EU, leading to measures like [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]] and [[Lobby register|laws for lobby transparency]].

To promote transparency in [[politics]], [[Hans Peter Martin]], [[Paul van Buitenen]] ([[Europa Transparant]]) and [[Ashley Mote]] decided to cooperate under the name [[Platform for Transparency]] (PfT) in 2005. Similar organizations that promotes transparency are [[Transparency International]] and the [[Sunlight Foundation]].

A recent political movement to emerge in conjunction with the demands for transparency is the [[Pirate Party]], a label for a number of political parties across different countries who advocate freedom of information, direct democracy, network neutrality, and the free sharing of knowledge.

==Online culture==

21st century culture affords a higher level of public transparency than ever before, and actually requires it in many cases.  Modern technology and associated culture shifts have changed how government works (see [[WikiLeaks]]), what information people can find out about each other, and the ability of politicians to stay in office if they are involved in [[sex scandals]]. Due to the [[digital revolution]], people no longer have a high level of control over what is public information, leading to a tension between the values of transparency and [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Digital person: technology and privacy in the information age|page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0814798462|isbn=0814798462 |first=Daniel J. |last=Solove|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

[[research|Scholarly research]] in any [[scientific method|academic discipline]] may also be labeled as (partly) transparent (or [[open research]]) if some or all relevant aspects of the research are open in the sense of [[open source]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rocchini | first1 = Duccio | last2 = Neteler | first2 = Markus | title = Let the four freedoms paradigm apply to ecology | journal = [[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 310–311 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.009 | date = June 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open data]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm|title=Wissenschaftsrat: Home|work=wissenschaftsrat.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417091550/http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm|archivedate=2010-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby facilitating [[Recognition (sociology)|social recognition]] and [[accountability]] of the scholars who did the research and [[Reproducibility|replication]] by others interested in the matters addressed by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v3/n1/full/embor241.html|title=Transparent science| volume=3|doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kvf018|pages=9–11|journal=EMBO Reports|pmc=1083937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[mathematicians]] and scientists are critical of using closed source [[mathematical software]] such as [[Mathematica]] for [[mathematical proofs]], because these do not provide transparency, and thus are not verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Mathematica+and+free+software|title=Mathematica and free software|work=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-source software such as [[SageMath]] aims to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news116173009.html|title=Free software brings affordability, transparency to mathematics|publisher=physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

In the computer software world, [[open source software]] concerns the creation of software, to which access to the underlying [[source code]] is freely available. This permits use, study, and modification without restriction.

In computer security, the debate is ongoing as to the relative merits of the [[Full disclosure (computer security)|full disclosure]] of security vulnerabilities, versus a [[Security through obscurity|security-by-obscurity]] approach.

There is a different (perhaps almost opposite) sense of [[Transparency (human–computer interaction)|transparency in human-computer interaction]], whereby a system after change adheres to its previous external interface as much as possible while changing its internal behaviour. That is, a change in a system is transparent to its users if the change is unnoticeable to them.

==Sports==

[[Sports]] has become a global business over the last century, and here, too, initiatives ranging from mandatory drug testing to the fighting of sports-related corruption are gaining ground based on the transparent activities in other domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencyinsport.org/|title=Transparency in Sport|work=transparencyinsport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}

==Criticism==

[[Sigmund Freud]] following [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ("On Truth and Lie in a Nonmoral Sense") regularly argues that transparency is impossible because of the occluding function of the unconscious.

Among philosophical and literary works that have examined the idea of transparency are [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' or [[David Brin]]'s ''[[The Transparent Society]]''. 
The German philosopher and media theorist [[Byung-Chul Han]] in his 2012 work ''Transparenzgesellschaft'' sees transparency as a cultural norm created by neoliberal market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust. He was criticized for his concepts, as they would suggest corrupt politics and for referring to the anti-democratic Carl Schmitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klarheit schaffen|url=http://www.freitag.de/kultur/1223-klarheit-schaffen|work=der Freitag | language = German |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate= 3 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have long explored ethnographically the relation between revealed and concealed knowledges, and have increasingly taken up the topic in relation to accountability, transparency and conspiracy theories and practices today.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, M. 2000.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20131111183729/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/worldwide/initiatives/global/nas/people/Academics/birchall/index.aspx Clare Birchall], Christina Gaarsten, Mikkel Flyverbom, and Mark Fenster among others, write in the vein of 'Critical Transparency Studies' which attempts to challenge particular orthodoxies concerning transparency. 
Birchall, assessed in an article "[...] whether the ascendance of transparency as an ideal limits political thinking, particularly for western socialists and radicals struggling to seize opportunities for change [...]". She argues that the promotion of 'datapreneurial' activity through open data initiatives outsources and interrupts the political contract between governed and government. She is concerned that the dominant model of governmental data-driven transparency produces neoliberal subjectivities that reduce the possibility of politics as an arena of dissent between real alternatives. She suggests that the radical Left might want to work with and reinvent secrecy as an alternative to neoliberal transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Birchall | first = Clare | title = Transparency interrupted: secrets of the left | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 60–84 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0263276411423040 | date = December 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0263276411423040 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[University of Oxford]] and [[Warwick Business School]] found that transparency can also have significant unintended consequences in the field of medical care. McGivern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://warwick.academia.edu/GerryMcGivern|title=Gerry  McGivern - University of Warwick - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fischer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer|title=Michael D Fischer - Australian Catholic University - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found 'media spectacles' and transparent regulation combined to create 'spectacular transparency' which some perverse effects on doctors' practice and increased defensive behaviour in doctors and their staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry |last2=Fischer|first2=Michael D. |title=Medical regulation, spectacular transparency and the blame business|journal=Journal of Health, Organization and Management |year=2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=597–610 |pmid=21155435 |doi=10.1108/14777261011088683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry |last2=Fischer|first2=Michael D. |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=[[Social Science &amp; Medicine]]|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a four-year organizational study, [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and [https://kcl.academia.edu/EwanFerlie Ferlie] found that transparency in the context of a clinical risk management can act perversely to undermine ethical behavior, leading to organizational crisis and even collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Michael D. | last2 = Ferlie | first2 = Ewan |title=Resisting hybridization between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=[[Accounting, Organizations and Society]] |date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002 |doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Air Force uniform''' is the standardised [[Military uniform|military dress]] worn by members of the [[Royal Air Force]].  The predominant colours of Royal Air Force uniforms are blue-grey and Wedgwood blue.  Many Commonwealth air forces' uniforms are also based on the RAF pattern, but with nationality shoulder flashes. Cadets of the RAFAC which includes the ATC and CCF (RAF) Sections wear similar uniforms.

The RAF's [[Service Dress (British Army)|service dress]] is worn on formal and ceremonial occasions.  In temperate regions, it is the most formal uniform in use at present.  It remains essentially unchanged from the service dress uniform adopted in the early 1920s.  It consists of a blue-grey jacket and trousers (or skirt for female personnel). A [[great coat]] may be worn at ceremonial events when the weather is cold. In warm weather regions a stone coloured variant of Service dress is worn.

In 1947, the temperate officers' services dress jacket was altered.  The lower side pockets were removed and the single slit was replaced by two hacking jacket style slits.  The lower button was moved up to a position behind the belt and silk embroidery [[Aircrew brevet|flying badges]] were replaced with ones in bullion embroidery.  These changes were unpopular and in 1951, with the exception of the lower button move, the former uniform style was re-adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britairforce.com/imagepages/raf_uniform_1947.htm |first=H. |last=Routledge |title=RAF 1947 Uniform |work=Uniforms and Insignia of the British Air Force |year=2009 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service dress takes the following forms:
*No. 1 Service Dress, for temperate regions.  Blue-grey colour.
*No. 1A Service Dress (Ceremonial Day Dress), for temperate regions and for [[air officer]]s only. As per No. 1 Service Dress. [[Air vice-marshal]]s and above wear a ceremonial sash and shoulder boards. Entitled [[air commodore]]s only add the ceremonial sash.
*No. 6 Service Dress, for warm weather regions. Stone colour.

[[File:Air Mshl Barry Thornton.jpg|thumb|115px|Air Marshal Sir [[Barry Thornton]] in service working dress (short sleeve order) He also wears an RAF stable belt, held in place by non-standard belt loops]]

Service working dress, officially designated Number 2 Dress, is the routine uniform worn by most RAF personnel not on operations. It is analogous to the Army's barrack dress.  RAF service working dress comes in a number of variations:

* No 2: Long sleeve shirt with jumper and tie  
* No 2a: Long sleeve shirt with tie, jumper not worn
* No 2b: Short sleeve shirt without tie, jumper not worn
* No 2c: Long sleeve dark blue shirt without tie, jumper optional (engineering trades only)

The RAF [[stable belt]] may be worn with all forms of service working dress.

In warm weather regions a stone coloured variant of Service working dress is worn.

===Operational clothing===

====Flying duties====
{{Commons category-inline|Flight suits of the Royal Air Force}}

Aircrew-specific uniforms are officially designated as Number 14 Dress by the RAF.  Aircrew on flying duties wear an olive drab flying suit in temperate regions or a khaki flying suit in desert regions.  A leather flying jacket, purchased at individual expense, may be worn with the flying suit but only while the wearer is on the ground.

====Ground duties====
[[File:Air Commodore Bryan Collins.jpg|thumb|right|115px|Desert Combat Dress, as worn by [[Air Commodore]] [[Bryan Collins]]]]
RAF personnel on operations, exercise or in certain tactical formed units wear Multi Terrain Pattern (MTP) Personal Clothing System Combat Uniform (PCS CU) is a camouflage uniform. This uniform  is the same as the [[British Army]]'s operational uniform. This consists of PCS CU Trousers and Shirt (which is usually worn tucked in, but can be left untucked in warm climates), PCS CU smock and brown boots. A beret or 'Boonie' hat is worn as head dress. 

In 2006 a 45mm squared [[Tactical Recognition Flash|tactical recognition flash]] was introduced for all personnel to wear on the right shoulder of operation clothing. A small rectangular identification patch such as Expeditionary Air Wing (EAW), Expeditionary Air Group (EAG) or Sqn insignia may be worn under the TRF. A [[Union Flag]] is worn on the left shoulder.

===Mess dress===
{{Commons category-inline|Mess uniforms of the Royal Air Force}}

[[File:Sir Glenn Torpy in Mess Dress.jpg|thumb|right|115px|[[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[Glenn Torpy]] wearing No. 5B Mess Dress.]]
In the RAF [[mess dress]], officially designated Number 5 dress, is worn at formal evening functions.  All regular officers possess mess dress whereas warrant officers and senior non-commissioned officers wear mess dress if they choose to purchase it.  The current mess dress for men consists of a high waisted blue-grey single-breasted jacket fastened at the front by a single link of two RAF buttons connected by a link clip, white [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] shirt, bow tie, waistcoat or cummerbund and blue-grey trousers.  Rank, for officers, is indicated in gold braid on the lower sleeve.

The first RAF mess dress was introduced in 1920 and it featured a high waisted single-breasted blue-grey jacket which tapered to a point at the front below the waist.  A blue-grey waistcoat, trousers and black shoes were also worn.  Rank was indicated on shoulder boards in gold lace.  This uniform was modified in 1928 when the shoes were replaced by boots and overalls with gold lace and bright blue stripes were introduced.  This modified form of the uniform lasted until 1934 when it was replaced by a version similar to the current men's mess dress.  The wearing of mess dress was suspended during [[World War II]].

For women, mess dress currently consists of the same style high waisted blue-grey single-breasted jacket and white marcella shirt as men, a small bow tie and cummerbund and a straight ankle length blue-gray skirt, worn with patent-leather court shoes and barely-black tights or stockings.  From the 1970s and prior to the introduction of current women's mess dress in 1996, female officers wore a royal blue "[[Empire line]]" dress made of [[crimplene]] material with a loose mandarin neck, long sleeves and an ankle length hem.  Rank was indicated on a small enamelled brooch worn near the neck.  

[[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] serving on Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadrons in Scotland may wear the Douglas Grey [[tartan]] with their mess dress.  The RAF tartan was designed in 1988 and it was officially recognised by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 2001. The tartan is worn by the RAF's voluntary pipes bands, although not as part of an official RAF uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamrafa.co.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203212300/http://kamrafa.co.uk/ |archivedate=3 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAF personnel without No 5 dress, such as airmen, junior officer cadets and some non-regular officers, wear No 1 dress with the blue shirt and tie replaced with a white shirt (not Marcella) and black bow tie should the need to wear mess dress arise.  This dress pattern is officially designated Number 4 Dress and was previously known as ''(Interim) Mess Dress''.

===Full dress===
{{Commons category-inline|Full dress uniforms of the Royal Air Force}}
[[File:AVM Lambe.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Charles Laverock Lambe|Lambe]] wearing full dress]]
In April 1920 Air Ministry Weekly Order 332 detailed a [[full dress]] uniform.  It consisted of a single-breasted jacket in blue-grey with a stand-up collar.  Rank was indicated in gold braid on the lower sleeve and white gloves were worn. 

Initially the full dress uniform was worn with the service dress cap.  However, in 1921 a new form of head-dress was introduced.  It was designed to resemble the original flying helmet and it consisted of a leather skull cap trimmed with black rabbit fur.  The helmet also featured an ostrich feather plume which was connected at an RAF badge.  This helmet was never popular and junior officers were eventually permitted to wear the service dress hat on full dress occasions.

[[Group Captain]] [[His Royal Highness|HRH]] the Duke of York (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]) wore RAF full dress at [[Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|his wedding]] to Lady [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923.  The Duke wore or carried the full dress headgear rather than the service dress cap.

The wearing of the full dress uniform was suspended just prior to the outbreak of World War II.  Although the uniform was occasionally worn by [[air officers]] as late as the 1950s, its use was never officially re-instated.  Today the blue-grey full dress uniform is no longer worn, except in a modified form by RAF bandsmen.This uniform is; from 2012, worn with the peaked cap rather than the busby; and is now referred to as Number 9 Service Dress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britairforce.com/imagepages/raf_uniform_music.htm |title=RAF Director of Music Uniform |first=H. |last=Routledge |work=Uniforms and Insignia of the British Air Force |year=2009 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a full dress uniform for use by officers in the tropics, officially designated as No.6A Full Ceremonial Dress (Warm Weather Areas). It consists of a white tunic with stand collar, matching trousers, blue-grey peaked cap and black leather shoes. It is only issued to specific appointment holders (e.g. [[aide-de-camp]] and [[air attaché]]), and even then these are hardly ever worn.  Other officers may purchase the uniform at their own expense but few choose to do so.

==Historic uniforms==

===Initial uniform===

With the establishment of the Royal Air Force as an independent service on 1 April 1918, orders were issued detailing new uniform patterns.  Major General [[Mark Kerr (admiral)|Mark Kerr]] designed the first officer uniform which was largely pale blue with gold braid trimmings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Kerr.htm |title=Major-General M. E. F. Kerr |first=M. B. |last=Barrass |work=Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation |year=2015 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britairforce.com/imagepages/raf_uniform_1918_a.htm |title=RAF 1918 Light Blue Uniform |first=H. |last=Routledge |work=Uniforms and Insignia of the British Air Force |year=2009 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Royal Flying Corps]]' use of [[khaki]] was continued.  It has been suggested that the pale blue colour was adopted as the cloth had been intended for use by the [[Imperial Russian Cavalry]] and, following their disbandment after the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] it became available at low cost.  As it was the responsibility of officers to buy their own uniforms, a wearing-out period for old uniforms was allowed and the change-over to the air force uniform was slow.

The 'wearing out' period also applied to [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. Former members of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service continued to wear their old uniforms. New recruits into the newly formed Royal Air Force were often issued with the olive green Army Pattern General Service Tunic.
Later in 1918 a belted olive green uniform was adopted for other ranks, and it was these tunics that first carried the RAF eagle badges on each shoulder.

The pale blue colour for officers' uniforms was unpopular and impractical&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and [[John Slessor]] who was later promoted to [[Marshal of the RAF]] described it as "a nasty pale blue with a lot of gold over it, which brought irresistibly to mind a vision of the gentlemen who stands outside the cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/F21C6257_ABD1_7132_E8716B8C2DA98948.pdf/ |title=The Inter-War Years 1919-39 |page=51 |work=Royal Air Force |year=2016 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A little over a year after its introduction, the pale blue colour was discontinued.  On 15 September 1919, [[Air Ministry]] Order 1049 replaced it with the blue-grey colour which has remained in use to this day.  The olive green uniform continued to be worn until 1924 when it too was replaced by a blue-grey colour.

===War service dress===
[[File:Tedder1943 crop.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Tedder]] wearing war service dress]]
War service dress, also known as battle dress, was introduced in 1940 as a blue/grey version of the British Army's [[Battle Dress|battle dress]].  Initially, war service dress was only worn by air crew.  However, in 1943, its use was authorised for all ranks and trades.  War service dress continued to be worn after the end of [[World War II]].  It was significantly altered in 1948 and not phased out until 1973.

===Later changes in service dress===
Air force rumour later had it that the "air force blue" colour of the postwar uniform had been that of a textile produced in quantity to clothe Russian soldiers during the First World War, and not yet exported when the Russian revolution of 1917 closed that market.  

A visible distinction between the RAF and the other military services was that all ranks wore a starched collar and tie.  Up to 1918, only Officers of the British Army and Royal Navy wore neck-ties; and Officers of all services bought their uniforms from military tailors, while other servicemen were issued clothing from government stocks. Several features of the RAF uniform distinguished officers from airmen;  their cap badges were different, airmen's being all brass while officers' were gold-embroidered fabric;  airmen wore the RAF eagle patch on both shoulders while officers did not; and the fabric of airmen's wool uniforms was thick and heavy, while officers' uniforms were of "smooth blue" barathea fabric.  Another distinction was that while the British Army shod its men only in ankle-high boots the RAF after 1945 also issued its airmen with ordinary shoes for everyday working wear. The shoes maintained the class distinction in that only officers wore shoes with toecaps. Similarly, officers wore unlined brown leather gloves while airmen's gloves were of knitted wool.

"Smooth blue" uniforms for non-commissioned personnel were introduced in the 1950s, first for Warrant Officers. By 1956 NCOs of all ranks (corporal and up) were permitted to buy "smooth blue" uniforms at their own expense.  Another innovation of the period was raincoats, hitherto worn only by officers.  Despite the rainy British climate, the only weather protection for airmen outdoors was either their heavy winter overcoats or the rectangular ground sheets issued for all soldiers' use on campaign.  Regulations were altered in the 1950s to allow airmen to wear raincoats bought at their own expense.

During 1973 the wartime "Hairy Mary" working dress uniforms were replaced for all ranks with the 1972 pattern No 2 uniforms. Made of a smooth woollen and man-made fibre mix material the jacket was a loose blouson design with a front zip fastener and epaulettes. In the mid 1980s RAF blue crew-necked woollen pullovers were replaced with a new V-neck design featuring blue-grey cloth elbow and shoulder patches plus a pen holder patch on the left sleeve.

In the 1990s an RAF blue nylon foul weather jacket and overtrousers were issued. Although not initially intended it quickly became standard practice for officers and other ranks to attach rank badges to the lapels and wear the nylon jacket in place of the uniform raincoat, as a more practical modern wear.

==Ranks and insignia==
The Royal Air Force ranks and insignia form part of the uniform of the Royal Air Force.  Royal Air Force rank insignia were based on combination of those of the [[Royal Navy officer rank insignia]] and [[British Army#Ranks, specialisms and insignia|British Army]].

==Influence on other air forces==
The [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] uniform is also of the RAF pattern, but with nationality shoulder flashes.  The [[Indian Air Force]] uniform is also of a similar pattern to the RAF uniform.  The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] uniform is in midnight blue, instead of grey-blue.  Prior to the 1968 unification of the [[Canadian Forces]], the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] service dress was nearly identical to that of the RAF.  In 1986 Distinctive Environmental Uniforms (DEU) were introduced to the Canadian Forces and the Air Command (now once again known as the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]) variant maintains some similarity with the RAF's uniform.  Until 2014, the RCAF DEU retained the gold sleeve rings (for officers), chevrons (for non-commissioned personnel) and crowns/Royal Arms Of Canada (for warrant officers).  On 24 September 2014, the RCAF announced it would return in part to pre-unification RAF-styled insignia; however, with the exception of Private being retitled ''Aviator'' (''Aviateur'' in French), rank titles would remain unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/article-template-standard.page?doc=new-insignia-for-the-royal-canadian-air-force/i0dsl28w |title=New insignia for the Royal Canadian Air Force |work=Royal Canadian Air Force |date=24 September 2014 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadets of the [[Air Training Corps|ATC]] and [[Combined Cadet Force|CCF]] (RAF) Sections wear the [[Uniform of the Air Cadet Organisation|uniforms]] of the Royal Air Force.

[[Image:Sample ULAN term2.jpg|frame|Sample ULAN Record, [[Mark Rothko]] continued.]]
The '''Union List of Artist Names''' ('''ULAN''') is a free [[online database]] of the [[Getty Research Institute]] using a [[controlled vocabulary]], which by 2018 contained over 300,000 artists and over 720,000 names for them, as well as other information about artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/faq.html ULAN FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Names in ULAN may include given names, pseudonyms, variant spellings, names in multiple languages, and names that have changed over time (e.g., married names). Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. 

Although it is displayed as a list, ULAN is structured as a [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]], compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships.

The focus of each ULAN record is an artist. In the database, each artist record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. The artist's nationality is given, as are places and dates of birth and death (if known).&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Heidi G. (2008)."Resources for Jewish Biography and Autobiography on the Internet". ''Shofar'' '''26'''(2), 128–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Linked to each artist record are names, related artists, sources for the data, and notes. The temporal coverage of the ULAN ranges from Antiquity to the present and the scope is global.

Artists may be either individuals (persons) or groups of individuals working together (corporate bodies). Artists in the ULAN generally represent creators involved in the conception or production of visual arts and architecture. Some performance artists are included (but typically not actors, dancers, or other performing artists). Repositories and some donors are included as well.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/about.html About ULAN] &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Development of the ULAN began in 1984 by the J. Paul Getty Trust. The Trust, which already managed the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT), began the project in response to requests from Getty projects for controlled vocabularies of artists' names.&lt;ref name="Harpring_2010"/&gt; The ULAN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]].&lt;ref name="Harpring_2010"&gt;Harpring, Patricia (2010). "Development of the Getty Vocabularies: AAT, TGN, ULAN, and CONA". ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'' '''29'''(1), 67–72. &lt;/ref&gt;

Although originally intended only for use by Getty projects, the broader art information community outside the Getty expressed a need to use ULAN for cataloging and retrieval. The Getty thus distributed ULAN for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus: Its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community. Originally constructed as a simple alphabetized "union list" of clustered artist names and biographies, in order to make it consistent with the AAT and [[Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names]], in the late 1990s ULAN was brought into compliance with national and international [[ISO 25964|standards for thesaurus construction]]. Its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art, which may have hierarchical levels.

The ULAN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink (head of what was then called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, and later Director of the Art History Information Program, later called the Getty Information Institute).&lt;ref name="Austin1995"&gt;Austin, David L. (1995). ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'' '''14'''(2), 48–49. &lt;/ref&gt; The ULAN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers. The ULAN was published in 1994 in hardcopy (Union List of Artist Names. Project manager, James M. Bower; senior editor, Murtha Baca. New York: G.K. Hall, 1994) and machine-readable files.&lt;ref name="Austin1995"/&gt; Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the ULAN, by 1997 it had become evident that hard-copy publication was impractical. It is now published in automated formats only, in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The data for ULAN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the ULAN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. The current managers of the ULAN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management.

==Design==
Even though the structure is relatively flat, the ULAN is constructed as a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the ULAN hierarchies (Subject_ID: 500000001); it currently has two published facets: Person and Corporate Body. Entities in the Person facet typically have no children. Entities in the Corporate Body facet may branch into trees. There may be multiple broader contexts, making the ULAN structure polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships, the ULAN also has equivalent and associative relationships.

{{nihongo|'''Vegeta'''|ベジータ|Bejīta|lead=yes}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. Vegeta first appears in chapter #204 {{nihongo|''Sayonara, Son Goku''|さようなら孫悟空|Sayōnara Son Gokū}}, published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine on November 7, 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediaarts-db.jp/mg/magazines/322308 |title=週刊少年ジャンプ　1988/11/07　表示号数1・2 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking the wish-granting Dragon Balls to gain [[immortality]].

Vegeta is the Prince of an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] race of warriors known as the Saiyans just like the series' protagonist, [[Goku]]. Vegeta is extremely vain and proud, constantly referring to his heritage throughout the series.&lt;ref name="vegetaprince"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toriyama|first1=Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title=[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]|volume=22|chapter=257: 怯えるドドリア|date=10 July 1990|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-851619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes he should be regarded as the strongest fighter in the Universe and becomes obsessed with surpassing Goku after fighting him. After his loss to Goku and the Z fighters, Vegeta later reluctantly unites with the heroes to thwart greater threats to the universe. Throughout the series, Vegeta's role changes from villain to [[antihero]] and later as one of the heroes, while remaining a rival to Goku. Vegeta's character, particularly his personality, has been well received. He is one of the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise's most popular characters.

==Creation and design==
Following the trend that names of members of the Saiyan race are puns on vegetables, Vegeta's name is a pun of the word ''vegetable'' itself.&lt;ref name="TenkaDen"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 天下一伝説|year=2004|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=80–91|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-873705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama stated that when he received a lot of [[fan mail]] telling him not to kill Vegeta, he purposely did just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集　5: TV ANIMATION PART 2 |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206–210 |isbn=4-08-782755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the release of ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'', Toriyama expressed interest in having Vegeta be the lead in the event of another animated feature, though he insisted this was only his intent and no decision had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Akira Toriyama - Saikyō Jump #3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegeta is shown to be exceptionally vain and egotistical. Only in very few instances is he seen to be afraid of opponents, such as against [[Freeza]].&lt;ref name="afraid freiza"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toriyama|first1=Akira|author-link=Akira Toriyama|title=[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]|volume=25|chapter=294: 最後の願い|date=8 March 1991|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-851415-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afraid freiza2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toriyama|first1=Akira|author-link=Akira Toriyama|title=[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]|volume=25|chapter=296: フリーザ超変身！！|date=8 March 1991|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-851415-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afraidfreezaanime"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=神様も生き返った！超神龍でピッコロが復活|trans-title=God Also Returns to Life!

Vegeta has a signature hair style that firmly stands upwards, with a prominent widow's peak. Like all full-blooded Saiyans,&lt;ref name="saiyanhair"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toriyama|first1=Akira|author-link=Akira Toriyama|title=[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]|volume=28|chapter=333: 帰って来た孫悟空|date=8 November 1991|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-851418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saiyanhairanime"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=オッス！！ひさしぶり…帰って来た孫悟空|trans-title=Heya!!

Vegeta is noticeably shorter than Goku, although a visible shift in Akira Toriyama's artistic style lessens this difference later in the series. Vegeta continues to don the traditional Saiyan armor for a large portion of his appearances, until he integrates into Earthly society eventually favoring clothing more characteristic of a human altogether.

==Appearances==

===''Dragon Ball''===
Vegeta is introduced as the proud prince of the {{nihongo|Saiyan|サイヤ人|Saiya-jin}} race. He travels to Earth with his comrade [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Nappa|Nappa]] to use the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 |chapter=Chapter 10| volume = 1 | isbn = 978-1-56931-930-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nappa easily fights off Earth's heroes and kills [[Tenshinhan]], [[Chaozu]], and [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] in the process. Goku then arrives after completing his training with [[Kaiō-sama]]. Goku easily defeats Nappa who is then killed by Vegeta, for the shame of being defeated by a low class Saiyan such as Goku. Vegeta fights and beats Goku in a very close fight after resorting to his [[Ozaru]] form, but is unable to beat the rest of the heroes due to his sustained injuries. Exhausted and being consistently harassed by [[Gohan]], [[Kuririn]] and [[Yajirobe]], he barely escapes with his life and is humiliated by the fact that Goku pleaded with Krillin to spare his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 | volume = 5| isbn = 978-1-56931-934-5|chapter=Chapter 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegeta travels to planet Namek in an attempt to wish for immortality using that planet's Dragon Balls, cutting the tyrant [[Freeza]] off from making the same wish in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 | volume = 5| isbn = 978-1-56931-934-5|chapter=Chapter 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, Vegeta manages to kill many of Freeza's henchmen and also mercilessly destroys a whole defenseless Namekian village for their Dragon Ball. Later on Vegeta is forced to team up with Gohan, Goku, Piccolo, and Krillin so they can fight off Freeza. He also kills most members of the [[Ginyu Force]]. Ultimately, he is defeated and subsequently killed by Freeza while asking Goku to avenge him and all the other Saiyans. Vegeta is unintentionally revived with a wish from the Dragon Balls from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 | volume = 11| isbn = 978-1-56931-939-0|chapter=Chapter 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 | volume = 10| isbn = 978-1-56931-807-2|chapter=Chapter 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Freeza's final defeat, Vegeta chooses to stay on Earth and has a son named [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] with [[Bulma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 | volume = 12| isbn = 978-1-56931-985-7|chapter=Chapter 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trunksmanga"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toriyama|first1=Akira|author-link=Akira Toriyama|title=[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]|volume=28|chapter=337: 集う超戦士たち|date=8 November 1991|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-851418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trunksanime"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=ボクの父はベジータです…謎の少年の告白|trans-title=My Dad is Vegeta… Confessions of the Mysterious Boy|episodelink=List_of_Dragon Ball Z episodes|series=Dragon Ball Z|serieslink=Dragon Ball Z|language=Japanese|date=8 January 1992|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|location=Japan|station=[[Fuji TV]]|number=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trunksanime2"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=気配を持たぬ殺人鬼どいつが人造人間だ！？|trans-title=Murderers Who Leave No Trace – Which Ones Are the Artificial Humans?!|episodelink=List_of_Dragon Ball Z episodes|series=Dragon Ball Z|serieslink=Dragon Ball Z|language=Japanese|date=5 February 1992|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|location=Japan|station=[[Fuji TV]]|number=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Vegeta finally becomes a Super Saiyan and easily destroys [[Android 19]], sent by [[Dr. Gero]] to kill Goku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 | volume = 13| isbn = 978-1-56931-986-4|chapter=Chapter 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even as a Super Saiyan, he is easily defeated by [[Android 18]]. Afterwards, Vegeta ascends beyond the Super Saiyan level while training with Trunks from an alternate dimension in the {{nihongo|Room of Spirit and Time|精神と時の部屋||}} and pummels the artificial life form [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]], who has absorbed [[Android 17]]. Vegeta's overconfidence leads him to allow Cell to absorb Android 18, upon which Cell achieves his "perfect" form. After Vegeta fails to defeat Perfect Cell, he is forced to participate in Cell's martial arts tournament known as the Cell Games, in which he makes a crucial intervention so [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] can overpower and defeat Cell in his perfect form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2004 | volume = 16| isbn = 978-1-59116-328-2|chapter=Chapter 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2005 | volume = 19| isbn = 978-1-59116-751-8|chapter=Chapter 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years later, Vegeta allows himself to be consumed by [[Bobbidi]]'s evil power for his own desire to become powerful enough to fight and defeat Goku. He then goes on an indiscriminate killing spree to provoke Goku to fight him.&lt;ref name="ch262"&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2005 | volume = 22| isbn = 978-1-4215-0051-5|chapter=Chapter 262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the monster [[Majin Buu]] is revived as a result of the energy released from their fight, Vegeta knocks out Goku from behind after deceiving Goku by feigning a truce. Vegeta then faces Majin Boo alone and ends up sacrificing himself in an attempt to defeat Boo, dedicating his sacrifice to Bulma, Trunks, and Goku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2005 | volume = 23| isbn = 978-1-4215-0148-2|chapter=Chapter 273}}&lt;/ref&gt; With all other fighters dead or absorbed, Vegeta is allowed to recover his body and returns to Earth to help Goku, the last warrior remaining, against the threat of Boo. He reluctantly combines bodies with Goku using the ''Potara'' earrings, to create the fused warrior Vegito, who completely overwhelms Boo with his strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2006 | volume = 25| isbn = 978-1-4215-0404-9|chapter=Chapter 306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2006 | volume = 26| isbn = 978-1-4215-0636-4|chapter=Chapter 311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Vegito allows himself to be absorbed into Boo's body to free the other heroes absorbed by Boo, but this leads to the splitting of the fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2006 | volume = 26| isbn = 978-1-4215-0636-4|chapter=Chapter 312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goku and Vegeta manage to free their allies who have been absorbed by Boo, causing him to undergo a new transformation, which results in his return to his original Kid Boo form. On the [[Kaiō-shin]]'s planet, Vegeta battles Boo again to buy time for Goku to gather energy for the ''Genki Dama'', which he uses to defeat Majin Boo once and for all. It is during this fight that Vegeta finally admits Goku as both his superior and friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2006 | volume = 26| isbn = 978-1-4215-0636-4|chapter=Chapter 322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Toriyama's films and ''Dragon Ball Super''===
In addition, Vegeta appears in eight of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' movies; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler|sixth]], Vegeta comes to Goku's aid against Cooler, foiling his attempt at powering the Big Gete Star with their energy by overloading it;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler''&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13|seventh]], Vegeta appears to aid the others in combating a new wave of androids, destroying Android 15;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13''&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan|eighth]], Vegeta shows hesitation in fighting Broly due to his immense strength though he overcomes it in time to supply Goku with his energy, contributing to Broly's defeat;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan''&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound|ninth]], Vegeta withdraws from attending a tournament, disillusioned by Goku's death, but comes to help Trunks when believing he is in danger;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound''&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn|twelfth]], after having a difficult time with Janemba, Vegeta fuses with Goku to form Gogeta who defeats Janemba easily;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn''&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon|thirteenth]], Vegeta fights Hirudegarn after he steps on his home;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon''&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|fourteenth]], Vegeta tries appeasing Beerus so that he will not destroy the Earth and surpasses Goku and even Beerus, briefly following a power boost of rage brought on by Beerus slapping Bulma;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods''&lt;/ref&gt; and lastly, in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'|fifteenth]], Vegeta trains off planet with Whis and returns to Earth to combat the resurrected Freeza, being killed by him when he destroys the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F''''''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the latter two films, Vegeta participates in a tournament where he defeats Frost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Turn Anger into Power!

Vegeta decides to enter in the Tournament of Power in order to protect his family. During the tournament Vegeta is successful in knocking out numerous fighters. He knocks out Toppo, who achieved the power of a Hakaishin or God of Destruction, and then aids Goku in fighting the last remaining member of Universe 11, Jiren. It is during his fight with Jiren and Toppo that Vegeta breaks the limits of his Super Saiyan Blue form, achieving a higher power and form known as 'Super Saiyan Blue Evolution'. With 2 minutes remaining in the tournament, Jiren knocks Vegeta out, who then sends the last of his remaining power to Goku.

===In other media===
In filler episodes of ''Dragon Ball Z'', set during the Saiyan arc, Vegeta and Nappa travel to Arlia while in space, being hailed as a hero after saving the people there. After leaving, Vegeta destroys the planet from space. After the Namek arc, Vegeta travels across space in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt at finding Goku, defeating remnants of Freeza's army. After the Boo arc, Vegeta attends a gathering with the other heroes.

In ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', Vegeta is confronted by a Baby-possessed Gohan.

Vegeta has appeared in many video games related to the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise as both a [[Player character|playable character]] and [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. In several games, Vegeta is capable of transforming into a Super Saiyan 3,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dragon Ball Z: Raging Blast 2]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dragon Ball Heroes]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Zenkai Battle''&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced in ''Dragon Ball Z: Raging Blast''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dragon Ball: Raging Blast]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2003 game ''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2'', Vegeta can be absorbed by Boo as one of the alternate forms exclusive to the game.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 arcade game ''Dragon Ball: Heroes'', Vegeta bests Super 17 before and after he merges with Android 18.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball: Heroes'' God Mission series fifth mission&lt;/ref&gt; A Time Breaker-possessed version of Vegeta also appears in the game.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball: Heroes'' God Mission series ninth mission&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 game ''[[Dragon Ball: Xenoverse]]'', Vegeta serves as a mentor to the player character, teaching ''Galic Gun'', ''Final Barrage'', ''Shine Shot'' and ''Final Flash''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dragon Ball: Xenoverse]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/dragon-ball-z-xenoverse-mentor-guide-how-unlock-every-move-and-challenge-420837|title=Dragon Ball Z Xenoverse Mentor Guide: How To Unlock Every Move And Challenge|date=March 8, 2015|first=Phillip|last=Martinez|publisher=idigitaltimes.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710091904/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/dragon-ball-z-xenoverse-mentor-guide-how-unlock-every-move-and-challenge-420837|archivedate=July 10, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared in other non ''Dragon Ball''-related video games, such as ''[[Jump Super Stars]]'', ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', and even in the ''Dragon Ball Z''/''[[One Piece]]''/''[[Naruto]]'' crossover game ''[[Battle Stadium D.O.N]]''.

Vegeta has made several appearances in other manga, one of which is in Akira Toriyama's ''Dragon Ball'' self-parody ''[[Neko Majin]]'', where he battles the titular character. In the ''Dragon Ball'' and ''[[One Piece]]'' crossover, ''Cross Epoch'', Vegeta is re-imagined as a captain of a crew of air pirates which includes Trunks, [[Usopp]], and [[Nico Robin]]. On September 15, 2006, Vegeta made a guest appearance in a chapter of the ''[[Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo]]'' manga, ''Super Kochikame'', entitled {{nihongo|''Kochira Namek-Sei Dragon Kōen-mae Hashutsujo''|こちらナメック星ドラゴン公園前派出所||This is the Dragon Police Station in front of the Park on Planet Namek}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Akimoto|first1= Osamu|authorlink1= Osamu Akimoto|title= Super Kochikame|series= ''[[Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo|Kochikame]]''|date= September 15, 2006|publisher= Shueisha|language= Japanese|isbn= 4-08-874096-3|page= |pages= |chapter= This is the Dragon Police Station in front of the Park on Planet Namek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegeta appears in the ''Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru'' manga in Chapter 178.

[[File:Cross Epoch Vegeta.PNG|thumb|150px|Vegeta as he appears in the ''Cross Epoch'' crossover.]]
Vegeta has also been the victim of parody: the ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' ''Gag Special 2005'' issue released on November 12, 2004 featured a ''[[Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo]]'' one-shot ''Dragon Ball'' parody manga. The manga was a humorous retelling of the battle between Goku and Vegeta initial battle; [[Jelly Jiggler]] was Goku and [[Don Patch]] was Vegeta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |cartoonist= [[Yoshio Sawai|Sawai, Yoshio]]|story= Dragon Ball|title= Shōnen Jump Gag Special 2005|issue=  |date= November 12, 2004|publisher= [[Shueisha]]|location= Japan|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegeta has made two contributions to music: in the eighth installment of ''[[Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection Series|Hit Song Collection series]]'' entitled ''[[Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection 8: Character Special 2|Character Special 2]]'', Vegeta sings the song "Vegeta-sama no Oryori Jigoku!!".

==Abilities==
Up until his tail was cut off, Vegeta could turn into a gigantic monkey-like creature called an {{nihongo|''Ōzaru''|大猿||lit.

Vegeta is known to give names for his various energy attacks. In his early appearance, Vegeta is seen to use attacks similar to several of the protagonists of the series, such as a {{nihongo|''Ki Disk Razor''|気円斬|Kienzan}}, a laser-like disk capable of cutting through solid objects, and a ki wave similar to Goku's ''Kamehameha''. One of his better known attacks is the {{nihongo|''Galick Gun''|ギャリック砲|Gyarikku Hō|}}, although he uses it only once in the series proper; during his battle against Goku in an attempt to destroy the Earth.&lt;ref name="destroyplanetanime2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firstvj"/&gt; He later develops the {{nihongo|''Big Bang Attack''|ビッグ・バン・アタック|Biggu Ban Atakku}}&lt;ref name="bigbangattack"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toriyama|first1=Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title=[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]|volume=29|chapter=344: うろたえる人造人間|date=10 March 1992|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-851419-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bigbanganime"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=２０号の不敵な笑い…ドクターゲロの秘密|trans-title=No. 20′s Defiant Smile… The Secret of Doctor Gero|episodelink=List_of_Dragon Ball Z episodes|series= Dragon Ball Z|serieslink=Dragon Ball Z|language= Japanese|date=4 March 1992|publisher= [[Toei Animation]]|location= Japan|station= [[Fuji TV]] |number= 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the {{nihongo|''Final Flash''|ファイナルフラッシュ|Fainaru Furasshu}}&lt;ref name="finalflash"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toriyama|first1=Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title=[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]|volume=32|chapter=384: ベジータ、執念の秘策|date=2 October 1992|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-851687-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finalflashanime"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=超サイヤ人の限界突破!!嵐を呼ぶトランクス|trans-title=Breaking Through the Boundaries of the Super Saiyan!!

One of Vegeta's most commonly used tactics in the series is when he bombards an opponent with an array of small ''ki'' blasts. He is not known to have an official name for this attack, but it is occasionally called {{nihongo|''Rapid-Fire Energy Balls''|連続エネルギー弾|Renzoku Enerugī Dan}}. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', Vegeta displays a powerful new attack, entitling it the {{nihongo|''Final Shine Attack''|ファイナルシャインアタック|Fainaru Shain Atakku}}, where he uses his left hand to fire off a massive beam of green ''ki'' that widens with distance.&lt;ref name="finalshine"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=究極の人造人間!二人の17号合体|trans-title=The Ultimate Android!

Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.&lt;ref name="ssvegeta"&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 1991 | volume = 29| isbn = 1-56931-986-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vegeta32"&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 1992 | volume = 32 | isbn = 1-59116-328-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 1994 | volume = 39 | isbn = 1-4215-0148-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful {{nihongo|Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan|超サイヤ人ゴッドSS（スーパーサイヤ人ゴッドスーパーサイヤ人）|Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo Sūpā Saiya-jin}} transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation called Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Evolution by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the ''Potara'' earrings, presented to Goku by the [[Kibitoshin|Old Kaiō-shin]]. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating {{nihongo|Vegito|ベジット|Bejitto|"Vegerot" in [[Viz Media]]'s manga translation}}, who, in his reappearance in ''Dragon Ball Super'', can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates {{nihongo|Gogeta|ゴジータ|Gojīta}}.

==Reception==
Vegeta has generally received praise by various reviewers from manga, anime and other media. Theron Martin from [[Anime News Network]] noted Vegeta's pride as being partially responsible for the success of the series. His fight against Goku during the final story arc was also commented to be very entertaining, despite its length as well as Goku and Vegeta's fighting styles, which Martin considered to have become stale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-z/dvd-season-8|title=Dragon Ball Z DVD - Season 8 Uncut|author=Martin, Theron|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=March 4, 2009|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another review, Theron noted Vegeta's overcoming his pride to help defeat Cell as the best scene from the fight against said antagonist due to how it creates the climax of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-z/dvd-season-6|title=Dragon Ball Z DVD - Season 6 Box Set (uncut)|author=Martin, Theron|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=November 25, 2008|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd Douglass Jr. from [[DVD Talk]] commented on Vegeta's skills and anger, noting them to be a good combination for any fight even though it is a one-sided battle due to how powerful he is.

[[File:Over_9000!.png|thumb|right|Example of the 'Over 9000!' meme, which shows a still image from the original ''Dragon Ball Z'' episode.]]
Vegeta's quote "It's over 9000!", referring to Goku's new power level, has become an [[Internet meme]] and a popular [[catchphrase]] referring to a large number or great quantity. The line originates from episode 21 of the [[Ocean Productions]] [[English language|English]] dub, "The Return of Goku", where Vegeta was voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. It was altered from the original line, which was {{Nihongo|"over 8,000!"|8000以上だ…!|8000 ijō da…!}}.

The term '''30 million word gap''' (often shortened to just the '''word gap''') was coined in a 2003 article by [[Betty Hart]] and [[Todd R. Risley]] titled "The Early Catastrophe: The 30 Million Word Gap by Age 3".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hart |first=Betty |last2=Risley |first2=Todd |date=2003 |title=The early catastrophe: The 30 million word gap by age 3 |url=http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf |journal=American Educator |pages=4–9 |accessdate=29 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart and Risley used LENA devices, an electronic microphone that measured how many words the child hears to record samples of the utterances of entire families over 2.5 years. Families were classified by [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) into "high" (professional), "middle" (working class), and "low" (welfare) SES. They found that the average child in a professional family hears 2,153 words per waking hour, the average child in a working class family hears 1,251 words per hour, and an average child in a welfare family only 616 words per hour. Extrapolating, they stated that, "in four years, an average child in a professional family would accumulate experience with almost 45 million words, an average child in a working-class family 26 million words, and an average child in a welfare family 13 million words."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The authors found a correlation between word exposure and the rate of [[vocabulary acquisition]] in the subject children. The recordings showed that high SES toddlers spoke approximately 2 new words a day between their second and third birthdays, middle SES children 1 word per day, and low SES children 0.5 words per day. Spoken words are a measure of [[Vocabulary#Productive and receptive knowledge|productive vocabulary]]. It is thought that during children's vocabulary development the productive vocabulary mirrors their underlying [[Vocabulary development|receptive vocabulary growth]].

The authors and subsequent researchers have posited that the word gap–or certainly the differing rates of vocabulary acquisition–partially explains the [[achievement gap in the United States]], the persistent disparity in educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially subgroups defined by socioeconomic status and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Valerie Strauss |title=The famous 'word gap' doesn't hurt only the young. It affects many educators, too. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/16/the-famous-word-gap-doesnt-hurt-only-the-young-it-affects-many-educators-too |work=Washington Post |location= |date=16 February 2015 |access-date=29 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics theorize that the language and achievement gaps are not a result of the amount of words a child is exposed to, but rather alternative theories suggest it could derive from the disconnect of linguistic practices between home and school. Thus, judging academic success and linguistic capabilities from socioeconomic may ignore bigger societal issues. The ongoing word gap discourse can be seen as a modern movement in educational discussion.

== History of language gap research ==

=== Before Hart &amp; Risley ===
Prior to the 30 million word gap study, extensive research had noted strong institutional variation in student success on standardized tests. The initial attention to achievement gap started with a 1966 publication from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] titled “Equality of Educational Opportunity.” The publication begins the onset of achievement gap by acknowledging that there is a great disparity within educational outcomes as a result of inequitable institutions, especially those that were not seen as part of the purview of schools such as cultural, socioeconomic, and linguistic realities of students at home. The National Assessment of  Educational Progress (NAEP) had further been used to census information that various studies used to show achievement gaps across a number of demographics. The idea of equity in education had also given rise to similar gap discourse around the world.

=== Hart &amp; Risley's contribution ===
Hart and Risley (2003) spent 2 ½ years observing 42 families for an hour each month to learn what typical home life was like for 1 and 2 year old children.  The families were grouped into 4 variables, upper SES, middle SES, lower SES and just a few that were on welfare. They found that by age 3 children in welfare families had a vocabulary of 525 words where children in upper SES families had vocabulary of 1,116 words. They also found that the children in upper class families were learning vocabulary at a faster rate. The researchers suggested the reason for this difference is because the welfare children heard on average 616 words per hour where professional-family children heard on average 2,153 words per hour. Thus, proposing the 30 Million Word Gap. The achievement gap is explained as a result of the language gap, in that because children are lacking in their vocabulary and literary skills, they will not be as successful in academics. Hart and Risley argue this is an indispensable societal concern because it sets the child at a disadvantage for not being exposed to more vocabulary skills at a young age.

=== Socioeconomic status studies ===
Fernald, Marchman, and Weisleder (2013) conducted a study with 48 children from diverse backgrounds ages 18–24 months old. The families were divided into low-SES (socioeconomic status) and high-SES.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Their first goal was to track developmental changes in processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning. Their second goal was to examine difference in aspects of early language development in relation to their SES. Their results showed that children at the same age from the lower class families had lower vocabulary scores when compared to children in higher class families. Fernald et al (2013) also found that by 18 months old language processing and vocabulary disparities were already evident, and by 24 months old there was a 6 month gap between the SES groups in processing skills critical to language development.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/desc.12019 |pmid=23432833 |pmc=3582035 |title=SES differences in language processing skill and vocabulary are evident at 18 months |journal=Developmental Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=234–48 |year=2013 |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne |last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A |last3=Weisleder |first3=Adriana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernald et al found fast reaction time as a child can translate into reaction time as an adult. Adults who have high reaction time tend to have better memories, reasoning abilities, language skills and are better able to learn new skills (fluid intelligence). Having better processing speed means having a stronger working memory, and a stronger working memory leads to a better cognitive competence. The authors express the importance of vocabulary knowledge because it sets a foundation for later literacy and language proficiency in preschool and that is predictive of academic success. Implications of long term developmental trajectories. Thus, the issue of the language gap and achievement gap are prevalent in our youth, which can be resolved by teaching families how to work and speak with their children.

=== Educational system studies ===
Sperry, Sperry, and Miller (2018) replicated Hart and Risley’s study and found that the amount of word gaps varied within the same backgrounds of socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  A longitudinal study observed families with their children in their homes and the researchers spoke to the participants as if they were a family friend. They used similar social classes as HR for comparison. Middle class, working class, lower class, poor “welfare” group. During the visit, three analyses were made and transcribed for research. The first was how many words the primary caregiver spoke to the child. The second was that the words spoken by all caregivers to the child showed social class alone did not determine either the composition of households or consequently the amount of a speech a child heard. Lastly, all ambient speech, like language addressed to other individuals but overheard by language learning children was considered. In the poor community sample when you took into consideration the ambient speech, or the words that primary caregivers said to extended family, the amount of words a child hears increased by 54%, in the working class by 210%. This study was the first attempt to replicate Hart and Risley and their findings did not support the previous claims.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/cdev.13072 |title=Reexamining the Verbal Environments of Children from Different Socioeconomic Backgrounds |journal=Child Development |year=2018 |last1=Sperry |first1=Douglas E |last2=Sperry |first2=Linda L |last3=Miller |first3=Peggy J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the variation within communities was greater than when simply comparing socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Garcia and Otheguy (2016) were interested in the origins and validity of the Language Gap, and how the preconceptions of it impact bilingual and bidialectical children, specifically from Latino and Black backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They focused more so on how people talk about and understand language as a whole, especially within the education system. Their argument claims language is a semiotic process that involves sound, touch, and gestures and should be seen as a translanguaging-internalist perspective.  She offers historical context to give insight to the creation of the Language Gap and the biases it may hold. They suggest it began when ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown vs The Board of Education]]'' (1954) and the [[Civil Rights Act]] (1964) made it illegal to judge based on one’s color or race; thus, exclusions needed to be made based on another trait. They build on Flores and Rosas (2017) idea of [[raciolinguistics]] that suggests a new way to separate whites and non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.149 |title=Undoing Appropriateness: Raciolinguistic Ideologies and Language Diversity in Education |journal=Harvard Educational Review |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=149–71 |year=2015 |last1=Flores |first1=Nelson |last2=Rosa |first2=Jonathan }}&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to give historical context on the Achievement Gap in that it was a result of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (2001), despite its good intentions, it compared every race and background on a standardized test written in a White monolingual way.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/19313152.2016.1258190 |title=Interrogating the Language Gap of Young Bilingual and Bidialectal Students |journal=International Multilingual Research Journal |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=52–65 |year=2016 |last1=García |first1=Ofelia |last2=Otheguy |first2=Ricardo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the educational system functions on the dominant groups of society (i.e. white, Standardized English, middle-upper class), it ignores the linguistic and cultural practices of minorities. The theory here is that it is not that families of differing backgrounds are not adequate in teaching their children how to speak, but teach them a different linguistic culture at home than the one taught in schools.

Similarly, Johnson (2015) draws on from Faltis (2006) socialization mismatch hypothesis that the culture of the schooling system that is based around middle to upper class, White, Standardized English principles do not match the language socialization of backgrounds that may not fit into these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Faltis, C.F. (2005), ''Teaching English Language Learners in Elementary School Communities'' , Pearson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the Language Gap was not a result of vocabulary or literary deficiency in a child, but rather not understanding the language socialization of different cultural backgrounds. He drew from a previous linguistic anthropologist Hymes (1972) term of “communicative competence” in that social expectations within a speech community shape the member’s use of language.&lt;ref&gt;Hymes, D. (1972), “On communicative competence”, in Pride, J.B. and Holmes, J. (Eds),''Sociolinguistics'' , Penguin, London, pp. 269-285.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, diverse backgrounds in language have a different set of expectations that a member conforms to. As language differs, so does the developmental process.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Eric J|year=2015|title=Debunking the 'language gap'|journal=Journal for Multicultural Education|volume=9|issue=1|pages=42–50|doi=10.1108/jme-12-2014-0044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (2015) argues the Language Gap is not fair because it does not consider the various ways children use words and create meaning. Therefore, it is not the parents at fault leading their children to fall behind, but the school’s fault for not accommodating to children’s backgrounds.Thus, the Language Gap is not a result of a child’s capabilities to understand, but a result of how a linear function of language ignores the needs of the various ways to make meaning.

== Implications ==

=== Social implications ===
There are possible social implications to Hart and Risley’s theories of the issue of the Language Gap in society. The first possible implication is that this Language Gap is affecting youth’s success because they are not exposed to the same amount of vocabulary and literary skill as other kids from middle-upper classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hart and Risely suggest that possible solutions include interventions on how to improve vocab and literary skills for caregivers in low SES. However, the second possible implication of this theory is that it ignores the fact that language and culture are taught differently. In stating other backgrounds cannot be as successful as the dominant groups in society, It reinstates the homogeneity of language, in that it proposes one “true” way of speaking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Garcia and Otheguy (2016) implies the Language and Achievement Gap derive from racist ideals that reinforce the idea that some cultures are seen as “disadvantaged”. To place the blame on different backgrounds is to invalidate their way to make meaning just because they have different cultures. Thus, to not consider the responsibility of the schooling system is to promote the homogeneity of Standardized English and this notion that anyone who doesn’t speak or understand it is inferior and prone to future failure. Garcia argues it deligitimatizes backgrounds of families and their linguistic and cultural practices because it is not seen to be “successful” in the eyes of the education system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Political implications ===
Sperry, Sperry and Miller discussed some of the consequences of the original Hart and Risley (2003) article. The 30 Million Word Gap has received widespread media attention. In 2013 Bloomberg Philanthropies mayors challenge awarded providence Rhode Island its grand prize to “providence talks” - a project proposed to teach poor parents how to speak to their children with the aid of the LENA Device. The Clinton foundations “Too Small to Fail” initiative which hosted the White House Word Gap event in 2014, resulted in the US department of Health and Human services funding remedial efforts to address the Word Gap.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, Georgia has a policy “Talk with Me Baby” that is a public action strategy aimed at increasing the number of words children are exposed to in early childhood. "Talk With Me Baby" is a program that provides professional development of nurses, who will then coach new parents how they should talk to their children. This program is funded by Greater United Way of Atlanta.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The University of Chicago, School of Medicine's Thirty Million Words Initiative provides intervention for caregivers and teaches to show them how to optimize their talk with their kids. This program is funded by the PNC Foundation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shankar, M. (2014) Empowering our children by bridging the word gap. ''The White House President Barack Obama'' retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/06/25/empowering-our-children-bridging-word-gap&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gap discourse ===
The Word Gap theory can be seen as part of a larger development in modern educational reform and movement: the [[Achievement gap in the United States|Achievement Gap]] discourse. It is widely accepted and noted by scholars that ideas around individual outcome in schools varies based on various demographics. Explaining variations in achievement in schools across levels of demographics that may result in a gap in student achievement has become the primary problems  public schools have to address. The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts- it creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. ''Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient'' are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory. As a broader Discourse, it is an idea which is multimodally shared and accepted as common belief between parents, policy makers, teachers and students through various means according to [[James Paul Gee]]’s idea of Discourse in socio-linguistic analysis.&lt;ref name="Carey2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=Roderick L|year=2013|title=A Cultural Analysis of the Achievement Gap Discourse|journal=Urban Education|volume=49|issue=4|pages=440–68|doi=10.1177/0042085913507459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the Achievement Gap Discourse cause several cultural phenomena- “cultural gate-keeping,” in which policy makers and education reformers decide and label students as more or less capable and worthy than others. Schools might be called under-performing, which can further affect the policy and financing prescribed by their districts, or even higher authorities.&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt;

Using metric standards to understand the cause in Achievement Gap as a result of ineffective cultural practices also tends to place blame on the families unless there is ample socio-linguistic inquiry to individual family circumstance, which still often creates a Discourse against deemed underachieving students’ culture.

The Achievement Gap Discourse initiated with two primary modes in American educational studies: Achievement Gap among races, and gap among socioeconomic status (SES). ''The gap Discourse'' does not typically extend across generations or other forms of demographics that have been studied, and further study of Achievement Gap among different dimensions faces the initial stigmatization as a result of the gap Discourse in various studies around the turn of the 21st Century, pin-headed by the 30 million Word Gap. Among critics are many linguists, anthropologists, and social discipline specialists, as well as organizations such as the Linguistic Society of America.&lt;ref name="Johnson2015" /&gt;

The achievement gap became an especially strong interest for study in the turn of the century, and the early 2000's when a plethora of studies looked at factors such as standardized test scores, presence in class, GPA, enrollment, and dropout rates in secondary and post-secondary education. The problem came in the analyses of the studies which were  criticized for looking at race and socioeconomic explanations to explain educational outcome without taking into account others such as S. J. Lee, 2005, Pang, Kiang, &amp; Pak, 2004, and Rothstein 2004 which provided broad postulations as to why race and SES accounted for varied success.&lt;ref&gt;Pang, V. O., Kiang, P. N., &amp; Pak, Y. K. (2004). Asian Pacific American students: Challenging a biased educational system. In J. A. Banks &amp; C. A. M. Banks (Eds.), Handbook of research on multicultural education (2nd ed., pp. 542-563). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, T. (2003). Up from the parched earth: Toward a theory of African American achievement. In T. Perry, C. Steele, &amp; A. G. Hilliard III (Eds.), Young, gifted and Black: Promoting high achievement among African-American students (pp. 1-108). Boston, MA: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. J. (2005). Up against whiteness: Race, school and immigrant youth. New York, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; President George W. Bush's administration’s [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] rhetoric of 2001 and 2002 left researchers limited to the type of research they could conduct for educational equity due to a need to appease policy makers among educational stakeholders. According to Roderick L Carey, Word Gap researcher, the NCLB “mandated objective and quantitative ‘scientifically based’ research, which left little room for qualitative research agendas that unpack contextual factors that add nuance to the understandings of how high-stakes accountability is felt and lived by students, teachers, and their families.”&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt; The rhetoric also posed ideas that placed responsibility of achievement in institutions on their most proximal function oriented members, shifting responsibility to achieve positive outcomes on high-stakes standardized tests nearly entirely on teachers and schools, whilst the difference in achievement was largely believed to be due to factors outside of the classroom. Various studies culminated to suggest general and vague underlying problems within specific communities which caused deficit in learning outcomes under this context.

Among these studies, Hart and Risley  stumbled upon the idea of word gap when working with youth who used cochlear implants, to form their the idea: they hypothesized exposure to spoken word might explain an achievement gap in standardized test scores, then used standardized testing data on language as well as an in depth study to conclude their 30 million word gap publication.

== Additional information ==

=== Word Gap internationally ===
The ''Oxford Word Gap'' is used to describe the word gap found between races and socioeconomic classes in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Carey2013/&gt; The report study “Why Closing the Word Gap Matters: Oxford Language Report” details out statistics collected in primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom, along the same ideas as the American Word Gap idea, citing ''Hart and Risley (2003)'' in the report. It was published in 2018, so all of its implications are yet to be seen.

A great number of states have paid attention to Achievement Gap across hundreds of criteria including demographics, access to language and economic resources and race around the world: notably in the United Kingdom, France, South Africa as named in one comparative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fulcher |first1=Taylor J. |title=A Comparative Analysis of the Racial and Class Achievement Gap in Schooling in the United States, France, and South Africa |year=2015 |series=Senior Honors Projects |volume=108 |url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/honors201019/108 |type=Thesis }}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has held strongly in its principles the importance on aspects of educational equity, and other educational movements similar to that of the United States Word Gap are numerous throughout Europe and some other members of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14664208.2014.979649 |title=Language rights and language policy: Addressing the gap(s) between principles and practices |journal=Current Issues in Language Planning |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=355–9 |year=2014 |last1=May |first1=Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe also has its own varied standards on the ideas of multilingual competence per state, which stress the apprehension and exposure to secondary language vocabulary in students of all ages.

=== Other Word Gaps ===
The Word Gap has largely been defined to mean the idea of the observed gap between the spoken and read language in the specific context of American education reform described in this article, however other proposed ideas or active research have used it to describe differences in access to language varieties experienced in public settings, such as signage in Orellana, 2017's ''Another Type of Word Gap'', as well as other linguistic resources such as using media for language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Orellana, M. F. (2017, December 07). A Different Kind of Word Gap. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-faulstich-orellana/a-different-kind-of-word-_b_10030876.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of linguistic resource studies could change the language or may attempt to use terms to remain distinct from the stigma of word gap.
