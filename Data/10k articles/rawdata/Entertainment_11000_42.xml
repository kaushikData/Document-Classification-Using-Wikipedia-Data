==Lawsuit==
[[Bayern Munich]] and German international goalkeeper [[Oliver Kahn]] successfully sued [[Electronic Arts]] for their inclusion of him in the game without his prior consent despite EA reaching an agreement with [[FIFPro]], the body that represents all [[FIFA]] players.  As a result, EA was banned from selling copies of the game in Germany and was forced to financially compensate Kahn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080617102026/http://www.uib.no/isf/hms/2003-April/002223.html Oliver Kahn wins case against EA] ''- uib.no'' 29 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''After The War''''' is a [[video game]] published in 1989 by [[Dinamic Software]], in which the player controls a character through a post-apocalyptic city, probably after a nuclear war. Released and unreleased artworks by [[Luis Royo]] and [[Alfonso Azpiri]] reveals that the city should be a post-nuclear version of New York City.

== Gameplay ==

The game consisted of two separate parts; the second half of the game was made accessible by successfully completing part one, whereupon the player is given a password (94656981).

First part is localized in the streets of the city, and is just a sequence of fights with minor enemies and some big bosses; target is to find the entry to the city underground transport, that is in the opposed part of the map.

Second part is localized in the railways and stations of the city underground transport. Some enemies are bigger than in the first load, and more complex in design.

Character movements were slightly different in both parts: common movements were to move left and right, to jump and to duck. While in first part the only way of fighting is using fists and legs, the second part gives the character the ability to use some kind of futuristic gun. Both loads featured some parts with two levels.

== Development ==

=== Versions ===

Some [[16-bit]] versions featured digitized voices. Some ports featured tricky graphical effects (e.g., the [[Amstrad CPC]] version included both mode 0 and mode 1 graphics at a time). ''After The War'' featured two of the classical "FX" brands of Dinamic, the FX double load (consisting on two separate parts to get advantage of computer memory) and FX giant sprites, that made use of very big [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] that can be even ¾ of the total play area height. Note that those "FX" brands are simply commercial names that Dinamic used to name some features of its games.

The "giant sprites" trick was that sprites were composed by a set of small parts that allowed reusing of those parts in different characters (e.g., a lot of enemies share the same trousers and leg movements). In some ports, a problem with the vertical sync of the monitor lets the player to easily see this trick (sometimes characters got rendered divided in two clearly different slices).

A few computer magazines published notes about a [[arcade game|coin-op]] version of the game that was never released outside [[Spain]], although a coin-op of the game could be played many years ago in the [[Parque de Atracciones de Madrid]], graphically identical to the 16-bit computers counterpart.

=== Cover art ===

[[File:After_the_War,_original_unused_artwork_by_Alfonso_Azpiri.jpg|thumb|right|The original, unused box art by Alfonso Azpiri.]]

The cover artwork for ''After the War'' was created by artist [[Luis Royo]]. At the time development began, Spanish comic book author [[Alfonso Azpiri]] was a collaborator with Dinamic for the creation of the box art for their games. Azpiri, whose brother [[Jorge Azpiri|Jorge]] contributed some of the graphics for the [[Amstrad CPC]] version of ''After the War'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&amp;num=130|title=After The War|language=French|publisher=CPC-Power|date=2015-02-09|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew an initial version of the intended cover artwork for the game. However, due to its protracted development schedule, by the time the game was completed Azpiri had ended his collaboration with Dinamic to work with software company [[Topo Soft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.ign.com/retro/67374/feature/las-diez-mejores-portadas-de-alfonso-azpiri|title=Retro: The ten greatest front covers by Alfonso Azpiri|language=Spanish|publisher=IGN España|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''After the War'' was then released with new cover art commissioned to Royo.

== Legacy ==

In 2011, nearly two decades since the dissolution of Dinamic, some of its founding members acquired the rights to distribute the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] game ''[[Collapse (2008 video game)|Collapse]]'' in Spain and [[Italy]] under their new software company [[FX Interactive]]. The game was [[Rebranding|rebranded]] as ''After the War'' and marketed as belonging to the same [[fictional universe]] as the original 1989 game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vandal.net/noticia/60595/after-the-war-lo-nuevo-de-fx-interactive-a-la-venta-la-semana-que-viene/|title=After the War, the new FX Interactive release, in stores next week|language=Spanish|publisher=Vandal|date=2011-09-17|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aquarium fishery''' is the process of [[fishing]] wild fish for sale to private and public [[aquarium]]s.&lt;ref name=ng2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/140718-aquarium-fish-source-sustainability-animals-ocean-science/?rptregcta=reg_free_np&amp;rptregcampaign=2015012_invitation_ro_all# |author=Jane L Lee |title=Do You Know Where Your Aquarium Fish Come From? |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |date=July 18, 2014 |accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Aquarium fisheries collect primarily [[saltwater fish]], typically colorful [[reef fish]]. Major fishery areas are in the waters off the United States ([[Hawaii]], [[Florida]]), [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], [[Australia]],  the [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=ng2014/&gt; According to a report by the [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] “tens of millions of marine animals” are collected each year, more than half of them ending up in the US.&lt;ref name=ng2014/&gt; It is estimated that about 1,800 species of tropical fish are collected and traded.&lt;ref name=ng2014/&gt;  [[Sea Shepherd  Conservation Society|Sea Sherpherd]] estimates that about 25 million fish are in the commercial pipeline of which “nearly all will die within a year from the point of capture”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/reef-defense/about-the-campaign.html |title=Operation Reef Defense Launches in Hawaii |publisher=[[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]]|date= |accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others estimates the number at 30 million animals, the vast majority coming from the Philippines and Indonesia.&lt;ref name=cbs2014/&gt; Aside from fish the pipeline also moves invertebrates and live corals.&lt;ref name=ng2014/&gt;

The industry is largely unregulated and lacks a central data base to assess its impact upon the environment.&lt;ref name=ng2014/&gt;
Different fisheries are regulated or managed differently and with various degrees of oversight. For example, lack of oversight has led to the widespread use of [[cyanide]] to stun fish to collect them in the Philippines although officially it is illegal.&lt;ref name=ng2014/&gt;
While the US is required to monitor import of species listed by the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES)  the majority of fish imported for aquariums is lumped together as marine tropical fish (MATF) by the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]].&lt;ref name=ng2014/&gt; Thus import of endangered species within this group is not monitored. The lack of an adequate database about [[tropical fish]], - life cycle, growth and reproductive rate, population development over time - makes it difficult to monitor the impact of aquarium fisheries.
Overcollection can be damaging to the [[coral reef]] as the example of the [[Paracanthurus|regal blue tang]] has shown.  As these fish eat algae that overgrow corals, their removal endangers the health of the coral.&lt;ref name=ng2014/&gt;

==Demise of MAC==
The [[Marine Aquarium Council]] (MAC) was an international organization formed in 1998 by [[Project stakeholder|stake holders]] including animal collectors, exporters, importers, retailers, aquarium keepers,  and public aquariums, conservation organizations and government agencies.&lt;ref name=mac&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fishchannel.com/sustainable-reefkeeper/is-it-time-for-another-marine-aquarium-council.aspx |author=David Vosseler  |title=Is it Time for Another Marine Aquarium Council (MAC)?|publisher=Fishchannel.com| date=February 15, 2015 |accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAC recognized problems in the trade and wanted to address them. Vosseler listed them as follows:&lt;ref name=mac/&gt;
* Use of cyanide and other destructive collection methods
* Poor handling and husbandry practices
* Unnecessary animal mortality
* Collection of unwanted and/or unsuitable species
* Potential for stock depletion

==Call for prohibition==
With the lack of oversight and the danger to the environment by [[overfishing]] environmentalists have called for stricter regulation and even [[prohibition]] of the collecting of wild fish for private aquariums. Captive-bred tropical fish are readily available for hobbyists. "In this day and age, where the ocean faces a crisis ... there's absolutely no justification for a fishery for hobby," indicated Mike Long of Sea Shepherd.&lt;ref name=cbs2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ethical-battle-over-harvesting-aquarium-fish-in-hawaii/ |author= |title=Ethical battle over harvesting aquarium fish in Hawaii  |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=June 28, 2014 |accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental efforts led Hawaii to enact some protection in the late 1990s when certain sections were closed to aquarium fisheries.&lt;ref name=cbs2014/&gt; There is evidence that these protective measure have been effective, but reefs are also endangered from other factors such as fertilizer run-off and coastal development.&lt;ref name=cbs2014/&gt;

'''AviraKids''' is a Russian [[holding company]], founded in 2010, specializing in safe gaming and entertainment equipment. As a result of 2016, it occupies 37,5 % of the Russian gaming equipment production industry with revenues of $75000000 (450 million [[ruble]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[https://focus.kontur.ru/entity?query=1095905001026 «Авира» на «Контур. Фокус»]&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==

=== History ===
In 2010, the company appeared «accidentally»: after changing the type of activity of the failed enterprise, the owners of the [[Legal person|legal entity]] decided to keep the brand and start manufacturing children's [[playground]]s. AviraKids began working with a starting capital of just $624 (39.000 rubles), which was invested by [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] from [[Perm]] Alexey Zagumyonnov, Alexei Zykov and Pavel Makhnutin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rb.ru/opinion/permyaki-molodtsi/ «Как построить бизнес в провинции и экспортировать российское оборудование в 16 стран мира»], Rusbase.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the sales of gaming mazes for the classic [[Business-to-business|B2B]]-client, the company expanded the structure and range and reoriented to entrepreneurs from the [[millennials]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://knife.media/young-consumers/ «Быстро, необычно, под ключ. Чего хотят молодые российские потребители»], «Нож»&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the first 3 years of the company's operation it was managed to occupy 25% of the [[Russia]]n gaming equipment production industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ekb.dk.ru/news/kak-ob-edinitsya-s-konkurentom-i-poluchit-40-rynka-i-500-mln-rub-oborota-za-god-keys-237099138 «Как объединиться с конкурентом и получить 40 % рынка и 500 млн руб. оборота за год»], «Деловой квартал»&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, according to the [[Kommersant]] publication, AviraKids with a staff of 500 people and exports to 17 countries of the world is considered a «classic medium-sized business». With an average contract price from $4.785 (300000 rubles to $860.000 (54000000 rubles) the average monthly turnover of the group is about $960.000 (60 million rubles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3605331 «Государство душит, оно же спасает»]"Коммерсантъ — Малый бизнес".

AviraKids' products are created on 4 own production sites with an area of about 1,24 [[Acre|ac]]. The products of the group are supplied to [[Spain]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EG-ryM8V-o Estonian project], youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kazakhstan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Abkhazia]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Armenia]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://newshay.com/krupnejshij-park-razvlechenij-armenii-zaza-land-vybral-rossijskoe-oborudovanie/ Крупнейший парк развлечений Армении «Zaza Land» выбрал российское оборудование], «Армения сегодня»&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Marino]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sapir.su/news/labirintakva.html В Сан-Марино началось возведение гигантского лабиринта-аквариума стоимостью 50000 евро], САПИР&lt;/ref&gt; Also announced plans for international cooperation with [[India]], [[Ghana]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.rambler.ru/other/39706402-indiya-i-gana-zainteresovalis-rossiyskim-igrovym-oborudovaniem/?updated Индия и Гана заинтересовались российским игровым оборудованием], Рамблер.

"'''Blame It on Lisa'''" is the fifteenth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In the episode, the [[Simpson family]] goes to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] in search of a Brazilian orphan named Ronaldo whom [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] has been sponsoring. Lisa used to receive a letter from Ronaldo every month, but that recently stopped and according to personnel at the orphanage, he is missing. As the Simpsons search through Rio de Janeiro, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is kidnapped and in order to free him the family must pay a ransom of $50,000, which they do not have. Lisa soon discovers that Ronaldo has been working in a [[flamingo]] costume on the children's television series ''Teleboobies'', which is the reason he left the orphanage. Ronaldo finally meets up with the Simpsons and gives them the $50,000 they need to rescue Homer.

Written by [[Bob Bendetson]] and directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]], "Blame It on Lisa" features several references to [[popular culture]], including a parody of the Brazilian children's television host [[Xuxa]] and an allusion to the film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. When it originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 31, 2002, it was seen by around eleven million people. In 2010, the episode was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the episodes of the thirteenth season.

"Blame It on Lisa" was controversial in Brazil because of its inclusion of clichés and stereotypes, and because the Brazilian culture was inaccurately mixed with the cultures of surrounding Latin American countries. Riotur, the [[tourist board]] of Rio de Janeiro, planned on suing Fox for damaging the international image of the city, which they thought was incorrectly portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and a rat infestation. [[James L. Brooks]], executive producer of ''The Simpsons'', soon issued an apology to Rio de Janeiro.

==Plot==
[[File:Xuxa em premie do filme Senna, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Xuxa Meneghel]] is parodied in the episode by character Xoxchitla.]]
As [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] are watching ''[[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show]]'', [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] tells them that the telephone company has charged [[Simpson family|the family]] hundreds of dollars for making phone calls to [[Brazil]]. Homer and Marge decide to visit the company, thinking there has been a mistake. They meet with customer service representative [[Lindsey Naegle]], who cuts off the family's phone service after Homer tells her that he refuses to pay the bill. Homer attempts to connect illegally to the phone lines, but only succeeds in getting electrocuted at least 5 times and, when he regains consciousness on the couch, is told that he was found "smoldering in the bushes". When [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] finds out the reason the family no longer has phone service, she confesses that she has actually made calls to Brazil. She has been sponsoring an orphan named Ronaldo in the country and she used to receive a letter from him once every month until recently. Lisa called Ronaldo's orphanage to find out what had happened and she was told he is missing. She shows her family a tape recorded by Ronaldo that she received after her first donation, in which Ronaldo thanks Lisa and tells her that with her money he has purchased a pair of dancing shoes for himself and the orphanage has been able to buy a door. Touched by the tape, the Simpsons decide to travel to Brazil to solve the mystery behind Ronaldo's disappearance, leaving [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] with [[Patty and Selma]].

When the family arrives in [[Rio de Janeiro]], they discover that they can get anywhere they want by joining a [[conga line]]. After dancing their way to the hotel, Bart turns on the television in their room and watches a children's show called ''Teleboobies'' which Marge criticizes because of its sexual undertones. The Simpsons then head out to search for Ronaldo. First, they travel to the slums in Rio de Janeiro. According to Lisa, "The government just painted them bright colors so the tourists would not be offended." In the slums, the family sees thousands of rats painted in various colors. They then reach Ronaldo's orphanage, but the nun working there has no idea where he has gone. Later that day, as the Simpsons are having dinner at a restaurant, Lisa shows a map on which she has marked all the places Ronaldo likes to visit. She splits the map in two, giving one piece to Homer and Bart and keeping one piece for her and Marge. Homer and Bart first search through [[Copacabana Beach]] and then a market, where they are robbed by children, while Marge and Lisa visit a [[samba]] school. However, both duos are unsuccessful in finding Ronaldo so far. To get to their last location, Homer and Bart take a taxi and are kidnapped at gunpoint by the taxi driver. However, Bart is able to get away and tell the rest of the family.

The taxi driver and his companion hold Homer hostage deep into the rainforest. They force Homer to make a phone call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a ''Teleboobies'' float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing [[flamingo]] from ''Teleboobies''—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed [[Stockholm syndrome]]. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugarloaf Mountain]] in two separate [[Aerial lift|cable cars]]. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an [[anaconda]]. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.

"Blame It on Lisa" was written by [[Bob Bendetson]] and directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]] as part of the [[The Simpsons (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of ''The Simpsons'' (2001–2002).&lt;ref name="ult"/&gt; For the scenes taking place in Brazil, the animators based much of their work on photographs taken by a staff member who had previously visited the country.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore, Steven Dean.

Martin Kaste, South America correspondent for [[National Public Radio]], reported on April 9, 2002 that since their announcement that they were going to sue Fox, the Riotur officials had been told by their lawyers in the United States that it would be difficult to sue the episode there because of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which protects parodies.&lt;ref name=Ydstie&gt;{{cite news |last=Ydstie |first=John |title=Analysis: Brazilian officials talk about lawsuit in regards to an episode of 'The Simpsons' |newspaper=[[All Things Considered]] |date=April 9, 2002 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' executive producer [[James L.

In the original ''Bounce'' game the player controls a red ball through many levels in a 2D [[side-scrolling]] game world. It came pre-loaded on many Nokia mobile phones and is considered one of the most well-known Nokia mobile games along with ''[[Snake (video game genre)|Snake]]''.

The player controls a red ball with the requirements to go through all hoops. The ball can also become big, allowing it to float in water areas (which is coloured blue). The enemies come in the form of static obstacles as well as moving blue 'spiky' objects and firm yellow 'candle' objects.

The [[Nokia 9210 Communicator]] ([[Series 80 (software platform)|Series 80]]) from 2000 (released 2001) was the first device to feature the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIH65A-hyAM|title=Nokia 9210 - Bounce game|first=|last=MegaBojan1993|date=17 September 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my-symbian.com/s60/software/applications.php?fldAuto=69&amp;faq=2|title=Bounce for Series 60 1st &amp; 2nd Edition by Nokia :: Symbian software @ My-Symbian.com|first=|last=Nokia|website=my-symbian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through updated versions it was also pre-loaded on entry-level [[Series 40]] handsets such as [[Nokia 6610]] (2002), and [[Nokia 2600]] (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobile-review.com/print.php?filename=/review/nokia-6610-en.shtml|title=Mobile-review.com Review Nokia 6610|website=www.mobile-review.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game had a total of 11 levels.

The [[Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium]] (CBJC) created the '''Brooklyn Jazz Hall of Fame''' in 1999 and added a museum component in 2009 to further its mission of providing cultural programs to under served populations. Each year in April, as part of the Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival, CBJC inducts outstanding women and men into the Brooklyn Jazz [[Hall of Fame]] and awards individuals who have made significant contributions to the music genre of [[jazz]].

==Description==
{{quote|A Brooklyn Jazz Hall of Fame member is a master musician who has made a significant contribution to the art form Jazz, has a musical connection or residence in Brooklyn, and has made the transition from earth.}}

Members of the Brooklyn Jazz Hall of Fame include: [[Eubie Blake]], [[Cal Massey]], C. Scoby Stroman, [[Ahmed Abdul-Malik]], [[Joe Carroll (singer)|Joe Carroll]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Betty Carter]], [[Noel Pointer]], [[Betty Roché]], [[Art Blakey]], Kenny Durham, [[Hazel Scott]], [[Mary Lou Williams]], [[Roland Alexander]], [[Cecil Payne]] and [[Max Roach]].

'''conDiT''' (acronym of “Concerts of Technological District”) was a musical creation platform founded in [[Buenos Aires]] on 28 October 2011.

==Origins==

conDIT [buenos aires technological district's concerts] was a creation platform of concert music, in other words, the new 'classical music' made in the 2010s.

Around conDIT, since its foundation in 2011, more than sixty national and international activities has been produced, including workshops, concerts, artistic residencies and tours, a semestral magazine called Espiral, spreading the musical thinking of musicians participating in the platform, more than thirty commissions, 4 call for works, and a media open access  repository.
Since the idea of its founder of creating an independent platform for long-term musical projects, several artists actively participated in the growth and management of the platform. Among others, Bruno Mesz, Fernando Manassero, Rosa Nolly, José Rafael Subía Valdez, Virginia Chacon Dorr, Juan Marco Litrica, Roberto Maqueda, Tatiana Cuoco, Ramiro Iturrioz, Andrea Farina, Daniel Halaban, Florencia Curci, Javier Areal Velez, Rodrigo Gallegos Pinto and Lucas Giono.

==Activities between 2011 – 2014==
Between 2011 and 2013 seventeen commissioned Works, from national and international artists, has been premiered. Among the most remarkable achievements can be listed: nine music works commissioned to new composers, six workshops for residents and external participants, six “Espiral” journal publications, and numerous digital texts. conDiT was also hosted the International Gaudeamus Competition Muziekweek (Netherlands).

Many national and international musicians and ensembles participated in conDiT’s concerts, among which can be mentioned: the double-bass row from the Teatro Colón Orchestra, the French horn player Delphine Gaulthier Guiche, the cellist Martín Devoto, Manos a las Obras duo (formed by the pianist Haydée Schvartz and the violinist Elías Gurevich) Modelo62 ensemble (Netherlands), suono mobile ensemble (Córdoba, Argentina), Nonsense vocal ensemble, the experimental music duo Cilantro, the composer Martin Tellinga (Netherlands), and the Institute of Sonology of The Hague.

The events and concerts performed are closely articulated with a formative and relational instance, addressed both to the public and to the artists, and that is reflected in the multiple activities that surround the performances.

For this purpose conDiT organizes lectures, seminars, and workshops aimed to create opportunities for local and international artistas to share their experiences and knowledge. Among the most remarkable actions can be listed: Delphine Gauthier- Guiche seminar (2013- UNQUI), reConvert Project seminar(2013 - cheLA), Minka 1 (2013-cheLA) and Minka 2 (2013-cheLA).

In 2014 conDiT received two international artists in residence: the Austrian composer Christine Schorkhuber (performance and installation in March); and the Japanese composer Reiko Yamada (installation in August). The residence of German artist Noid is scheduled for December, he will present an installation and concert pieces.

Transatlantic Interscores, performed in August in Vienna, was the first international conDiT concert with the participation of the Spanish percussion duo ReConvert Project.

In November conDiT produced the concert Escrituras Argentinas, with the support of the Ciclo de Música Contemporánea del Teatro General San Martín. The concert included works commissioned by the platform. The artists selected were Pablo Araya, Fernando Manassero, Luciano Azzigotti, and Valentin Pelisch.

==Special Projects==

===Espiral===

Espiral is a biannual magazine in which artists, critics, and organizers involved in conDiT manifest their reflections and reviews about the works and activities developed under the management of the platform. Some articles by authors specialized in different areas within the music field (and its relationship with other arts) are occasionally included. Espiral also works as playbill concerts, providing a reflective framework for the performances. Some of the authors who participated in Espiral are: Luciano Azzigotti, Luciano Kulikov, Ezequiel Dobrovsky, Fernando Manassero, Ezequiel Menalled, Gabriel Paiuk, Dick Raaijmakers, Martjin Tellinga, Eduardo Spinelli and [[:de:Nicolaus A. Huber|Nicolaus A. Huber]].
Related to conDiT’s artistic proposal, the content of Espiral is based on a multidisciplinary esthetic program.  This relationship is materialized through the involvement of different artists to generate de audiovisual material for each publication. Among the visual who participated in Espiral are: Tomás Rawski, Diego Alberti, and Ananke Assef.

===taPeTe (Technological Performance Atelier)===

[[File:ConDiT Música Rusa y Argentina 35.jpg|300px|thumb|taPeTe at conDiT's first concert]]

taPeTe was created to fulfill the contemporary music’s need for a theater that can be configured to meet diverse purposes. The graduation of the acoustic ranks of absorption and diffusion in three defined spectral bands, helps the space to meet the requirement of traditional concert pieces. They require a high level of definition and sound customization.
In taPeTe can also be performed acoustic pieces for instruments which require very specific space conditions, but can also be adapted to performances which require the use of extended materials. Finally, on the auditorium can be developed instrumental and scenographic workshops, aimed to provide a space to fulfill luthiers’ and composers’ needs.
In every Project the artists are able to use the space and manage it in totally different ways, offering different experiencies from the traditional ones – not only in theatrical but also in spatial terms. In taPeTe can also be performed contemporary pieces that can not be displayed in any other conventional space.

===Minka===

 [[File:ConDiT 2013 2 Minka 1 05.jpg|thumb|Final phase of first Minka]]

[[Minka]] is a pre-Columbian tradition of volunteer work, in which the members of a community work for the advantage of the whole group. In some áreas the Minka is still relevant today.
Based on this concept, keeping in mind the idea the creation of a cooperative working method, the composers Luciano Azzigotti, Fernando Manassero and Rafael Subía Valdez designed a composing system under the name of Minka.

The first Minka was done in cooperation with the assembles Modelo62 (resident at Condit in April 2013) and the Contemporary Music Ensemble of the Department of Performing Arts IUNA,
The cooperative composition system consisted of a working day to create and assemble a piece from scratch, under five pre-set slogans organized in five phases.

The second Minka took place in October 2013 with suono mobile Argentina, a contemporary music ensemble from Cordoba (resident at conDiT) in cooperation with Contemporary Music Ensemble of the Department of Performing Arts IUNA.

=== Container ===
In Argentina there is a tradition related to classical concert music, in which the programmers and regisseurs of Argentine concert halls receive (with the support of embassies) top level foreign artists who spread the music of their countries in Argentina.
This project has the clear objective to generate a mutual opportunity, so Argentine composers and musicians can spread their work abroad within an integrated broadcasting, recording, and international artists’ exchange program; framed by the principle of equal opportunities. The purpose is: update the old "center-periphery" relationship, energizing and encouraging the symmetry of cultural exchange between Argentina and the world.
The first chapter of Container is possible thanks to the collaboration between the Embassy of Argentina and conDiT.cheLA, whose team will be in charge of the organization, choice of repertoire and residents, commission works, and the activities advertising.
This project will be carried out by groups and halls in Vienna and Graz, associated with conDiT, and will be the second step after the partnerships we have begun in 2014 with the reception of Austrian artists in our platform.
During 2015 conDiT will form an ensemble in Vienna with young professional musicians. The ensemble will premiere works by Argentine young composers, programmed for the second Container concert (the first antecedent is Transatlantic Interscores, July 2014) on December 10.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Church organ's restoration===

During 2015 conDiT will be in charge of stages 2 and 3 of the restoration of the San Antonio de Padua church’s organ. This action crystallizes the commitment of the platform with the practice and exercise of the collective memory in Parque Patricios.
The restoration of an instrument transcends individual possibilities, it is always a call to the collective voice. Like bells announcing the moments of meeting, provide sound awareness to abandoned instruments allows us to hear and participate in rituals, and prefigure new ones, updating the exercise of our poetic consciousness that drives us to root ourselves and transcend.
With the different impacts of technological waves, the customs of the music’s functions have changed especially in the last century. We are surrounded by an invisible past that deserves to be reborn from silenced voices. This not only means restoring an instrument, but after that restore the memories of those organists who made music that triggers fervor, beliefs, and wills.

[[File:Cootie Game 01a.JPG|thumb|''Cootie Game'', a board game from 1918]]

'''Cooties''' is a fictitious childhood disease, used in the United States and Canada as a rejection term and an infection [[Tag (game)|tag game]] (such as [[Humans vs. Zombies]]).  It is similar to the British [[dreaded lurgi]], and to terms used in the [[Nordic countries]], in Italy, Australia and  New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Bronner/&gt;  A child is said to "catch" cooties through close contact with an "infected" person or from an opposite-sex child of a similar age.

==Origin==
The word is thought to originate from the [[Austronesian language family]], in which the [[Philippine languages]], [[Māori language|Maori]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cooties |title=Definition of cootie |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]-[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word ''kutu'' refers to a parasitic biting insect.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded uses of the term in English are by British soldiers during the [[First World War]] to refer to [[lice]] that proliferated in battlefield trenches.&lt;ref name=Origin&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMqoJdAZjvQC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture | author=Simon Bronner |page=213 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= 26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Got Cooties?

A hand-held game, the ''Cootie Game'', was made by the Irvin-Smith Company of Chicago in 1915; it involved tilting capsules (the cooties) into a trap over a background illustration depicting a  battlefield.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=78|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cootie games followed, all involving some form of bug or cootie,&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; until [[The Game of Cootie]] was launched in 1948 by [[Schaper Toys]].&lt;ref name=Game&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=77|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game was very successful, becoming an icon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=79|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003, the [[Toy Industry Association]] included it on its "Century of Toys List" of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.

In addition to the cooties games, the term ''cooties'' was popularised in America in the 1950s by military personnel coming back from service alongside the British in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name=Origin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sue1980"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1980|title=The Cooties Complex|journal=Western Folklore|volume=39|issue=3, Children's Folklore|pages=198–210|doi=10.2307/1499801|jstor=1499801|oclc=50529929|author=Sue Samuelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the British dreaded lurgi, the cooties games developed during the early 1950s [[polio]] epidemic, and became associated with dirt and contagion.&lt;ref name=Bronner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooties&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMqoJdAZjvQC&amp;pg=PA214#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture | author=Simon Bronner |page=214 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= 26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terms==
The lice of the [[Trench warfare#World War I: Entrenchment|First World War trenches]] nicknamed "cooties" were also known as "arithmetic bugs" because "they added to our troubles, subtracted from our pleasures, divided our attention, and multiplied like hell."&lt;ref&gt;

In Italy children have the term ''la peste'' ("the plague").&lt;ref name="Bronner"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMqoJdAZjvQC&amp;pg=PA452#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture | author=Simon Bronner |page=452 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= 26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooties are known in [[Denmark]] as ''pigelus'' and ''drengelus'' and in [[Norway]] as ''jentelus'' and ''guttelus'': each pair meaning literally "girl lice" and "boy lice". In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], it usually refers to girls, where they are known as ''tjejbaciller''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appserv.cs.chalmers.se/users/peterlj/runtime05/projects/hugnplay/doc/Projektrapport.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031084602/http://appserv.cs.chalmers.se/users/peterlj/runtime05/projects/hugnplay/doc/Projektrapport.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31 |title=p. 10 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "girl [[bacillus|bacilli]]") and ''tyttöbakteeri'' ("girl bacteria"). In [[Serbia]] the game is known as "šuga"; the word means [[scabies]].

==Cooties game==
A child is said to "catch" cooties through any form of bodily contact, proximity, or touching of an "infected" person or from a person of the opposite sex of the same age. Often the "infected" person is someone who is perceived as different, due to disability, shyness, being of the opposite sex, or having peculiar mannerisms.&lt;ref name="public.oed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/appeals/cootie/|title=Appeals: cootie &amp;#124; Oxford English Dictionary|date=|publisher=Public.oed.com|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase is most commonly used by children in elementary school aged 4-10; however, it may be used by older children in a sarcastic or playful way.&lt;ref name="Sue1980"/&gt; Sometimes the phrase specifies the type of cooties, as in "''you've got girl cooties!''" or "''you've got boy cooties!''" after a child has been touched by or in other ways interacted with a child of the opposite sex.

In the United States, children sometimes "immunize" one another from cooties by administering a "cootie injection".&lt;ref name=Origin/&gt; Typically, one child administers the "shot", using an index finger to trace circles and dots on another child's forearm while reciting the rhyme, "Circle, circle, Dot, dot,  – Now you've got the cootie shot!" In some variations, a child then says, "Circle, circle, Square, square, – Now you have it everywhere!" In this case, the child receives an immunization throughout his or her body. These variations may continue to a final shot where the child says, "Circle, circle, Knife, knife,  – Now you've got it all your life!". A number of other variations exist.

[[Image:Croupier de Hold'em Poker.jpg|thumb|A croupier deals cards for a game of [[Texas hold 'em]]]]
A '''croupier''' or '''dealer''' is someone appointed at a [[gambling]] table to assist in the conduct of the game, especially in the distribution of bets and payouts. Croupiers are typically employed by [[casino]]s.

==Origin of the word==
Originally a "croupier" meant one who stood behind a gambler, with extra reserves of cash to back him up during a gambling session. The word derived from "croup" (the [[rump (animal)|rump]] of a horse) and was by way of analogy to one who rode behind on horseback. It later came to refer to one who was employed to collect the money from a gaming-table.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Croupier''&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a 'dealer' meant one who the person responsible for distributing cards or the player in the dealer position, regardless of whether or not that player is responsible for distributing the cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.pokerzone.com/dealer|title=Definition of Dealer - PokerZone|website=dictionary.pokerzone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==
Training methods to become a casino croupier vary from country to country. In North America, [[blackjack]] is almost always the game that dealers learn first, as it is simple and popular, and when the dealer makes errors, they tend not to cost the casino much money. In Europe, croupiers tend to learn [[roulette]] first. Complex, busy games such as [[craps]], with complicated payout systems, etc., are usually reserved for the most competent and/or ambitious dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jobboomcc.canoe.ca/News/2005/10/19/1269228-sun.html|title=Career advice - Job tips for workers and job seekers - Jobboom -|website=Career advice - Job tips for workers and job seekers - Jobboom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==
[[United States|American]], [[Australia]]n and [[United Kingdom|British]] croupiers are required to apply for a gambling license. This license includes police background checks and credit rating checks, to help determine if they are eligible to commence employment. Croupiers are not permitted to deal at a casino until being issued this license.

== Tipping ==
As is common with customer service staff in the United States, croupiers there depend on tips to make their wage worthwhile. While a croupier should theoretically have no personal interest in the outcome of the game, a successful player customarily tips the croupier, especially in American casinos. Tips are often pooled and divided amongst all the staff. Fraternising with customers is frowned upon, and most casinos prevent their gambling staff from being seen smoking or even being seen in uniform outside the casino. Some gambling strategies include suggestions to tip the casino dealer in order to create a good atmosphere and improve dealer's mood. According to these strategies, tipping might even make the dealer shuffle the cards less frequently and thereby allow easier tracking of particular cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casinoobserver.com/casino-news-item-article-ground-casino-rules.htm|title=Land Casino rules |publisher=casinoobserver.com |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian casinos forbid dealers from taking tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starcity.com.au/Casino__Top_Level_.html|title=Casino|accessdate=2011-07-25}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondhand smoke exposure==
Because casinos tend to allow smoking on the gambling floor, American croupiers are exposed to [[secondhand smoke]]. A [[Health Hazard Evaluation Program|health hazard evaluation]] of several [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] casinos showed that nonsmoker croupiers suffered from more respiratory ailments than their administrative counterparts at the casinos and had [[cotinine]] and [[NNAL]] (both components of secondhand smoke) in their urine samples.&lt;ref&gt;West, Christine. [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/blog/nsb061609_casino.html Secondhand Smoke and Casino Dealers]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|Britain]] banned smoking in all public places, including casinos, in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4375478.stm|title=Smoke ban bill details released|date=27 October 2005|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dun Darach''''' is an [[arcade adventure]] published in 1985 by [[Gargoyle Games]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] computers.

The background history is based on [[Celt]]ic folklore about the hero [[Cuchulainn]], and his battles against the people of [[Connachta]] in ancient [[Ireland]]. "Dun Darach" or "Dún na nDarach" means "Oak Fort" in the [[Irish language]]. The game is a [[prequel]] to the 1984 game ''[[Tir Na Nog (game)|Tir Na Nog]]'' as the story takes place before that game, when Cuchulainn was still alive.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:Crash18.PNG|thumb|left|An unofficial piece of artwork created by [[Oli Frey]], which was used for the July '85 cover of [[Crash (magazine)|''CRASH'']] (and re-used in 1990&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/crash-magazine-76/Crash_76_May_1990#page/n0/mode/1up]&lt;/ref&gt;)]] --&gt;

One day Cuchulainn was travelling home from a battle with the Connachta with his companion Loeg the charioteer. On the way, they stopped off at an [[inn]] and Loeg was persuaded to help a beautiful young woman named Skar whose [[chariot]] was damaged. Cuchulainn took refreshment at the inn and on leaving realised Loeg was missing. He later discovered that Skar is a sorceress and ally of the Connachta and had taken Loeg to the timeless Secret City of Dun Darach in retribution for the death of Prince Amhair. Cuchulainn went on a long search for the mysterious city and eventually discovered it and entered Dun Darach to find Loeg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/18/darach.htm CRASH 18 - Dun Darach]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Dun Darach'' is an [[arcade adventure]] with interface and presentation nearly identical to ''Tir Na Nog'' or ''[[Marsport]]'' based on collecting objects, solving puzzles based on word puns or lateral thinking and interacting with other characters wandering through the city. The animation is in the same standard as ''Tir Na Nog'', although there is no [[parallax scrolling]]. Since the game can take many hours to complete, there is support for saving its state to [[cassette tape]].

''Dun Darach'' improves over its predecessor in that other characters can give short hints to the player, rob him, and confiscate his belongings if he carries stolen goods. The player can also now buy, steal and sell goods from the many shops in the city, bet at a casino (Iomain Ludum) and even deposit money at a bank with daily [[compound interest]]. The city of Dun Darach is large and consists of different quarters with shops and the current time of the day is indicated by torches in the wall and by the greetings of characters. There is a "blank" area in the centre of the city in Iomain, the pleasure quarter; this was originally intended to be a [[brothel]] called "Lady Q's" and would have opened into a whole [[red-light district]] (this was censored and all that remains is a sign saying "Forbidden").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/044/htsquad.htm Sinclair User 44 - Interview with Gargoyle Games] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131205915/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/044/htsquad.htm |date=2012-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuchulainn can move north, south, east and west with the player "rotating" the view using the keyboard and then having Cuchulainn move left or right on the screen, so only one side of the street is visible at once.

==Reception==
The ZX Spectrum version was also voted number 57 in the ''[[Your Sinclair]] Official Top 100 Games of All Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Top 100 Games of All Time|journal=Your Sinclair|date=September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0409-300, Bertolt Brecht.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bertolt Brecht]] in 1954]]
'''Epic theatre''' ({{lang-de|episches Theater}}) is a theatrical [[Art movement|movement]] arising in the [[Twentieth-century theatre|early to mid-20th century]] from the theories and practice of a number of [[theatre practitioner]]s who responded to the political climate of the time through the creation of a new [[political theatre]]. Epic theatre is not meant to refer to the scale or the scope of the work, but rather to the form that it takes. Epic theatre emphasizes the audience's perspective and reaction to the piece through a variety of techniques that deliberately cause them to individually engage in a different way.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brecht|last=Barnett|first=David|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of epic theatre is not to encourage an audience to suspend their disbelief, but rather to force them to think introspectively about the particular moments that are occurring on stage and why they are happening a certain way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Famous Practitioners==

* [[Erwin Piscator]]
* [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]
* [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]
* [[Bertolt Brecht]]

== History ==


The term "[[Epic poetry|epic]] theatre" comes from Erwin Piscator who coined it during his first year as director of Berlin's  (1924–27).&lt;ref name="Wiles"&gt;Wiles (1980).&lt;!---Needs page number for citation---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Piscator aimed to encourage playwrights to address issues related to "contemporary existence." This new subject matter would then be staged by means of documentary effects, audience interaction, and strategies to cultivate an objective response.&lt;ref&gt;Innes (1972).&lt;!---Needs page number for citation---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Epic theatre incorporates a mode of acting that utilises what Brecht calls ''[[gestus]]''. One of Brecht's most-important [[Marxist aesthetics|aesthetic]] innovations prioritised ''[[Refunctioning|function]]'' over the sterile opposition between ''form'' and ''content''.&lt;ref name="willett281"&gt;Willett (1964) 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Epic theatre and its many forms is a response to [[Richard Wagner]]'s idea of "[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]", or "total artwork", which intends each piece of art is composed of each other art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leitmotiv and Drama|last=Brown|first=Hilda Meldrum|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since epic theatre is so focused on the specific relationship between form and content, these two ideas contradict each other, despite the fact that Brecht was heavily influenced by Wagner. Brecht discussed the priorities and approach of epic theatre in his work "[[A Short Organum for the Theatre]]".&lt;ref name="Organum"&gt;Brecht (1949, 276).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the approach, and popularised it.

Near the end of his career, Brecht preferred the term "dialectical theatre" to describe the kind of theatre he pioneered. From his later perspective, the term "epic theatre" had become too formal a concept to be of use anymore. According to [[Manfred Wekwerth]], one of Brecht's directors at the [[Berliner Ensemble]] at the time, the term refers to the "'[[Dialectics#Marxist dialectics|dialecticising]]' of events" that this approach to theatre-making produces.&lt;ref name="willett282"&gt;Quoted by Willett (1964) 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epic theatre is distinct from other forms of theatre, particularly the early [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] approach and later "[[Realism (theatre)|psychological realism]]" developed by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Like Stanislavski, Brecht disliked the shallow spectacle, manipulative plots, and heightened emotion of [[melodrama]]; but where Stanislavski attempted to engender real human behaviour in acting through the techniques of [[Stanislavski's system]] and to absorb the audience completely in the fictional world of the play, Brecht saw this type of theatre as escapist. Brecht's own social and political focus was distinct, too, from [[surrealism]] and the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], as developed in the writings and dramaturgy of [[Antonin Artaud]], who sought to affect audiences viscerally, psychologically, physically, and irrationally. While both produced 'shock' in the audience, epic theatre practices would also include a subsequent moment of understanding and comprehension.

==Techniques==
===Verfremdungseffekt===
While not invented by Brecht, the [[Distancing effect|Verfremdungseffekt]], known in English as the "estrangement effect" or the "alienation effect", was made popular by Brecht and is one of the most significant characteristics of Epic theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schall|first1=Ekkehard|title=The Craft of Theatre: Seminars and Discussions in Brechtian Theatre|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781474243308|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some of the ways the Verfremdungseffekt can be achieved is by having actors play multiple characters, rearrange the set in full view of the audience, and "break the fourth wall" by speaking to the audience. The use of a narrator in [[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]] is another example of Verfremdungseffekt at work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lighting can also be used to emulate the effect. For example, flooding the theatre with bright lights (not just the stage) and placing lighting equipment on stage can encourage the audience to fully acknowledge that the production is merely a production instead of reality.

As with the principle of [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]] involved in the epic form of spoken drama amalgamated or what Brecht calls "[[non-Aristotelian drama]]", the epic approach to play production utilizes a [[Soviet montage theory|montage]] technique of fragmentation, contrast and contradiction, and [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interruptions]]. While the French playwright [[Jean Genet]] articulates a very different [[world view]] in his dramas from that found in Brecht's, in a letter to the [[Theatre director|director]] [[Roger Blin]] on the most appropriate approach to staging his ''[[The Screens]]'' in 1966, he advises an epic approach to its production:

{{cquote|Each scene, and each section within a scene, must be perfected and played as rigorously and with as much discipline as if it were a short play, complete in itself. Without any smudges. And without there being the slightest suggestion that another scene, or section within a scene, is to follow those that have gone before.&lt;ref&gt;Genet (1966, 25).&lt;/ref&gt;|20px|20px}}

===Historicisation===
Historicisation is also employed in order to draw connections from a historical event to a similar current event. This can be seen in the plays [[Mother Courage and Her Children]] and [[The Good Person of Szechwan]], both written by Brecht, which comment on a current social or political issue using historical contexts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/brecht-interruptions-and-epic-theatre|title=Brecht, interruptions, and epic theatre|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=7 September 2017|website=British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brecht, too, advised treating each element of a play independently, like a [[music hall]] turn that is able to stand on its own.
Common production techniques in epic theatre include a simplified, non-realistic [[scenic design]] offset against a selective realism in costuming and props, as well as announcements or visual captions that interrupt and summarize the action. Brecht used [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] to [[Distancing effect|distance]] his audiences from the depicted events and was heavily influenced by musicals and fairground performers,  putting music and song in his plays.

Acting in epic theatre requires actors to play characters believably without convincing either the audience or themselves that they have "become" the characters. This is called Gestus, when an actor takes on the physical embodiment of a social commentary. Actors frequently address the audience directly out of character ("breaking the [[fourth wall]]") and play multiple roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/brecht-interruptions-and-epic-theatre|title=Brecht, interruptions, and epic theatre|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=7 September 2017|website=British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht thought it was important that the choices the characters made were explicit, and tried to develop a style of acting wherein it was evident that the characters were choosing one action over another. For example, a character could say, "I could have stayed at home, but instead I went to the shops." This he called "fixing the [[Not / But]] element".

'''Fighting Network Rings''', trademarked as '''RINGS''', is a Japanese [[combat sport]] promotion that has lived three distinct periods: [[puroresu]] promotion from its inauguration to 1995, [[mixed martial arts]] promotion from 1995 to its 2002 disestablishment, and the revived mixed martial arts promotion from 2008 onward.

RINGS was founded by [[Akira Maeda]] on May 11, 1991, following the dissolution of [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)|Newborn UWF]]. At that time, Maeda and [[Mitsuya Nagai]] were the only two people to transfer from UWF, wrestlers such as [[Kiyoshi Tamura]], [[Hiromitsu Kanehara]] and [[Kenichi Yamamoto (mixed martial artist)|Kenichi Yamamoto]] would later also transfer from UWF International.

==Foreigners==
RINGS' system was largely much inspired by organizations such as the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] and [[FIFA]], and featured fighters from different countries organized into [[Stable (disambiguation)|stables]]. These foreign fighters would then compete against RINGS' Japanese competitors and against each other.

==Decline==
Maeda retired from active duty in 1998, leaving Tamura as the top star, but the collapse of [[UWF International]] and the subsequent rise of [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] provided competition that proved to be too much for the promotion. On February 15, 2002, RINGS ceased activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daily.co.jp/ring/2006/12/22/0000198179.shtml|script-title=ja:前田日明 07年リングス再始動へ|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110223724/http://www.daily.co.jp/ring/2006/12/22/0000198179.shtml|archivedate=January 10, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Japanese RINGS stars, including [[Masayuki Naruse]], [[Wataru Sakata]] and Hiroyuki Ito, made the transition back into [[puroresu]]. The MMA promotion [[ZST]] was founded in November 2002 to accommodate former Japanese RINGS fighters who remained competitors in mixed martial arts.

==Revival==
Following the dissolution of [[Hero's]] and the conclusion of Maeda's involvement with FEG, Maeda revived the RINGS brand for a new series of MMA events named ''The Outsider''. The first ''RINGS The Outsider'' event occurred on March 30, 2008. Over a dozen Outsider events have been held since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder.php?organization_id=10 |title=UFC, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) News, Results, Fighting |publisher=Sherdog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand was resurrected once more on January 22, 2012 with Battle Genesis: Vol. 9, Volume 8 took place on September 20, 2001. The event was sanctioned by fellow mixed martial arts promotion ZST.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.livedoor.jp/zst_info/archives/1947680.html 2012年 ZST・RINGS スケジュール]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Floating Melon''''' (Original {{zh|s= 浮果|t=浮果|p='''Fu Guo'''|l=floating fruit}}; Spanish title '''''Sandía amarga''''') is a 2015 Spanish and Chinese [[International co-production|co-production]] [[drama film]] [[written]] and [[Film director|directed]] by [[Roberto F. Canuto]] and [[Xu Xiaoxi]]. It is a low budget independent short movie produced by ''Almost Red Productions'' (China) in association with ''Arkadín Ediciones'' (Spain). It was shot in [[Chengdu]] (China),  using the local dialect of the region, the [[Sichuanese Mandarin]].

The film has a strong [[film noir]] influences and represents the second part of the work ''Invisible Chengdu'', a [[trilogy]] that focuses on characters that usually are kept underground and discriminated in the Chinese society and often not well represented in the [[Movie theater|silver screen]]. The first part is the film ''[[Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal]]'' (2013) and the last part [[Sunken Plum]] (to be released in 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roberto F.

''Floating Melon'' is performed by non professional actors and it includes themes very delicate, often censured in China, specially the representation of the homosexuality in young people, a community that need to protect themselves due to the lack of protective laws in the country. The story is partially based in true events, but the atmosphere is close to the [[Film Noir]] genre, to reflect the only situation where [[queer]] people can express themselves, community that needs to live in the shadows of the night in the Chinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Alderiques d'asturies| date =9 December 2016| title =53 FICX – Nacho Carballo y Día d’Asturies (asturian)| trans-title =53 FICX - Nacho Carballo y Dia de Asturias | medium =Video interview| language =Spanish| url =http://www.alderiquesdasturies.com/53-ficx-nacho-carballo-y-dia-dasturies/| access-date =10 December 2016 | time =minutes:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It tells the story of ''Xiao Cheng'', a young Chinese guy that ask for help to a friend to resolve a big trouble, the guy with whom he spend the afternoon is dead on his bed from the effect of a drug, not something the Chinese authorities look kindly on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floating Melon |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5191784|website=IMDB|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film [[premiere]]d in Spain at the 53rd ''[[Gijon International Film Festival|FICXIXON, Gijón International Film Festival]]'' in November 2015 and in China at the Art Gallery ''Shujingtang Alley Art Space'' in Chengdu (Sichuan) in June 2016. It received an '''Audience Award''' at the 15th ''Aviles Acción Film Festival'' (Spain)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premios 2016 (awards 2016)|url=http://www.avilesaccion.com/premios-2016/|website=Avilés Acción Film Festival Website|publisher=Avilés Acción Film Festival|accessdate=10 December 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Audience Choice Award''' and '''Best Cinematography Award''' ('''Guo Yong''') at the III ''Asturian Film Festival of Proaza'' 2016 (Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards Floating Melon|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5191784/awards|website=IMDB|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 12 months after the release it has been presented in over 40 international film festivals in Europe, America, Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floating Melon Release Info |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5191784/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf|website=IMDB|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production &amp; Directors Commentary ==

'''''Floating Melon (Fu Guo)''''' was shot in Chengdu (China). The principal photography took place in September 2015 and the post-production was completed in October 2015. It was produced by ''Almost Red Productions'' (company owned by the directors in China) in association with the Spanish company ''Arkadin Ediciones''.
[[File:Floating Melon Still pic 2 (Fu Guo, Sandia Amarga, dir. Roberto F. Canuto &amp; Xu Xiaoxi) with Wen Sirui and Vincent Chen Xi.jpg|thumb|left|Scene of Floating Melon (Fu Guo) in [[Chengdu]], [[China]], with Vincent Chen Xi and Wen Sirui.]]
According to the directors, the main difficulty in the production was the casting. "It was complicated to find a group of suitable actor that were interested in play gay characters and also were not scared of play some explicit scenes. Finally we collaborate with non professional actors. Also the production maintained a low profile to avoid the strong censhorship laws in China." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Miss Bang (Miss邦)|title=成都的电影入围了3个国际大奖 是这个成都人和这个西班牙人拍的 (A film made in Chengdu win 3 awards)|url=http://www.yidianzixun.com/as/0DuPwVrK|website=yidianzixun.com (Chinese Website)|accessdate=10 December 2016|language=Chinese|date=15 July 2016|quote="电影里的所有演员皆非专业，不选专业演员，是因为没有选到合适的。“我们花了大量时间去培训演员，但我们不会限定演员的表演方式，比如表现悲伤，每个人悲伤的方式都不一样，我们不需要告诉演员怎么演，只需要告诉他，他所扮演的角色为什么悲伤。"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directors comment about the film in these terms: 
''Floating Melon is a fiction film, but inspired by characters that are present in the Chinese contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=内地同志题材短片《浮果》入围西班牙希洪电影节 (The Chinese gay film "Fu Guo" nominated in Gijon, Spain)|url=http://www.danlan.org/disparticle_52456.htm|website=Danlan Website|accessdate=10 December 2016|language=Chinese|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects, with a film “noir genre” perspective in stylistic and narrative terms, the story of a young guy that cannot react in a situation that is beyond his imaginations. He needs to take a decision that will risk his future, consequence of the strict rules of the society, since he is surrounded by the confusion present on some of members of the young gay Chinese community, with no moral referents apart from the official doctrine.
[[File:Floating Melon Still pic 3 (Fu Guo, Sandia Amarga, dir. Roberto F. Canuto &amp; Xu Xiaoxi) with Vincent Chen Xi.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of Floating Melon (Fu Guo) with Vincent Chen Xi, Cinematography Guo Yong.]]
	The representation of the characters is very close to reality and their reactions towards the situations reflect the Chinese society of these days. Also it represents this invisible community, the LGBT, that it is not as persecuted as in other countries, but for family pressures and the lack of protective laws, it need to be self protected. This lack of referents make for some people to take unusual and in occasions dangerous routes to build their relationships.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Almost Red Productions|title=Floating Melon Pressbook English|date=20 November 2015|publisher=Issuu web|pages=5|url=https://issuu.com/almostredproductions/docs/floating_melon__fu_guo__pressbook_e|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Music==
''Floating Melon'' original soundtrack is composed by [[Andrea Centazzo]]. The collaboration between the directors and the composer started in 2008. "Floating melon'' being the fifth collaboration, following [[Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal]], [[Mei Mei]], [[Toto Forever]] and [[Desire Street (film)|Desire Street]]. According to the directors, "Fu Guo soundtrack is created from the point of view of the main character, Xiaoxi Cheng. The music guides the emotional journey of the character through the film, following the first moments of horror and confusion, until the last part, where bring us a more nostalgic atmosphere. Centazzo composed some experimental tracks for the beginning sequences, mixing sound effects, electronic music and real instruments. As the story advance, he creates some melodic themes, with guitar and saxophone as the main instruments. The music is essential to understand the evolution of the main character and to understand the meaning of the story.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Almost Red Productions|title=Floating Melon Pressbook English|date=20 November 2015|publisher=Issuu web|pages=9|url=https://issuu.com/almostredproductions/docs/floating_melon__fu_guo__pressbook_e|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Garfield''''' is a comic created by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]. Published since 1978, it chronicles the life of the title character, [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]], the cat; [[Jon Arbuckle]], the human; and [[Odie]], the dog. As of 2013, it was syndicated in roughly 2,580 newspapers and [[Magazine|journals]], and held the [[Guinness World Record]] for being the world's most widely [[Print syndication|syndicated]] [[comic strip]].&lt;ref name="BW1"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Garfield Named World's Most Syndicated Comic Strip. | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Jan_22/ai_82001296| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040910215254/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Jan_22/ai_82001296| dead-url = yes| archive-date = September 10, 2004| accessdate=July 26, 2008 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=January 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this is rarely mentioned in print, ''Garfield'' is set in [[Muncie, Indiana]], the home of Jim Davis, according to the television special ''[[Happy Birthday, Garfield]]''. Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness, obsessive eating, coffee, and disdain of Mondays and diets. The strip's focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon, and Odie, but other recurring minor characters appear as well. Originally created with the intentions to "come up with a good, marketable character",&lt;ref name="slatewhyhate"/&gt; ''Garfield'' has spawned merchandise earning $750 million to $1 billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies.

Part of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of [[social commentary|social]] or [[political commentary#Political cartoons|political]] commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his "grasp of politics isn't strong," joking that, for many years, he thought "[[OPEC]] was a [[dental bonding|denture adhesive]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283648,00.html | title=Tales of the Kitty | first=Beth | last=Johnson | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=August 4, 2008 | date=June 19, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/11/5/movies/12462084&amp;sec=movies | title=Everybody loves Garfield| work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1970s, Davis created a comic strip called ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', which met with little success. One editor said, "his art was good, his gags were great," but that "nobody can identify with bugs." Davis decided to take a long, hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well, but there were no cats at the time. Davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with 25 cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat. He then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created Garfield, who borrows the first letter of his name from Davis's earlier work.&lt;ref name="Twenty"&gt;Davis. ''20 Years &amp; Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Garfield'' originally consisted of four main characters. Garfield, the titular character, was based on the cats Davis was around growing up; he took his name and personality from Davis's grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis,&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/fyi/student.bureau/10/24/jim.davis/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214062806/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/fyi/student.bureau/10/24/jim.davis/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 14, 2009 |title=The cat's meow |date=October 6, 2000 |publisher=CNN |first=Gerrard |last=Hall |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was, in Davis's words, "a large, cantankerous man". Jon Arbuckle came from a 1950s coffee commercial, and Odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by Davis, which featured Odie the Village Idiot. Early on in the strip, Odie's owner was a man named Lyman. He was written in to give Jon someone to talk with. Davis later realized that Garfield and Jon could "communicate nonverbally". The strip, originally centered on Jon, was first rejected by the [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]], [[Post-Hall Syndicate|Post-Hall]] and the [[Chicago Tribune]]-[[Daily News (New York)|New York News]] agencies, all of which asked Davis to focus on the cat, who in their opinion, got the better lines. [[United Media|United Feature Syndicate]] accepted the retooled strip in 1978 and debuted it in 41&amp;nbsp;newspapers on June 19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780619.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = June 19, 1978 | accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of that year (however, after a test run, the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' dropped it, only to reinstate it after readers' complaints).&lt;ref name="BW1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953256,00.html | title=Those Catty Cartoonists (fee required) | date=December 7, 1981 | accessdate=July 26, 2008 | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Garfield'''s first [[Sunday page]] ran on June 25, 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780625.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = June 25, 1978 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; being featured as a third-pager until March 22, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1981/ga810322.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = March 22, 1981 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A half-page debuted the following Sunday, March 29,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1981/ga810329.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = March 29, 1981 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the strips for March 14&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1982/ga820314.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = March 14, 1982 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 21, 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1982/ga820321.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = March 21, 1982 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; having a unique nine-panel format, but UFS curtailed further use of it (it did, however,  allow Davis to use the format for his ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' strip).

[[File:Garfield-comparison.png|thumb|300px|The appearance of the characters gradually changed over time.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DC1530F93AA25757C0A9679C8B63&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=Garfield+jim+davis&amp;st=nyt | title=Boldface Names | first=James | last=Barron | date=April 19, 2001 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left panel is taken from the March 7, 1980 strip; the right is from the July 6, 1990 strip.]]

The strip underwent stylistic changes, evolving from the style of the 1978–83 strips, to a more cartoonish look from 1984 onward. This change has mainly affected Garfield's design, which underwent a "Darwinian evolution" in which he began walking on his hind legs, "slimmed down", and "stopped looking ... through squinty little eyes" His evolution, according to Davis, was to make it easier to "push Odie off the table" or "reach for a piece of pie."&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

''Garfield'' quickly became a commercial success. In 1981, less than three years after its release, the strip appeared in 850&amp;nbsp;newspapers and accumulated over $15 million in merchandise. To manage the merchandise, Davis founded [[Paws, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953256-2,00.html | title=Those Catty Cartoonists | accessdate=July 26, 2008 | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | page=2 | date=December 7, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the strip was appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;DRD/KT. "Newswatch: Garfield Hits 1000th Newspaper," ''The Comics Journal'' #73 (July 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002, ''Garfield'' became the world's most syndicated strip, appearing in 2,570&amp;nbsp;newspapers with 263&amp;nbsp;million readers worldwide;&lt;ref name="BW1" /&gt; by 2004, ''Garfield'' appeared in nearly 2,600&amp;nbsp;newspapers and sold from $750 million to $1 billion worth of merchandise in 111&amp;nbsp;countries.&lt;ref name="slatewhyhate" /&gt; In 1994, Davis's company, Paws, Inc., purchased all rights to the strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature. The strip is currently distributed by [[Universal Press Syndicate]], while rights for the strip remain with Paws.

While retaining creative control and being the only signer, Davis now only writes and usually does the rough sketches. Since the late 1990s most of the work has been done by long-time assistants Brett Koth and Gary Barker. Inking and coloring work is done by other artists, while Davis spends most of the time supervising production and merchandising the characters.&lt;ref name="slatewhyhate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2102299/ |title=Why we don't hate Garfield. |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |last=Suellentrop |first=Chris |date=June 11, 2004 |publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Garfield'' was originally created by Davis with the intention to come up with a "good, marketable character".&lt;ref name="slatewhyhate"/&gt; Now the world's most syndicated comic strip, ''Garfield'' has spawned a "profusion"&lt;ref name="slatewhyhate"/&gt; of merchandise including clothing, toys, games, books, Caribbean cruises, credit cards, dolls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/08/stories/2003040800360200.htm |title=The Hindu : Grab your Garfield now |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507134606/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/08/stories/2003040800360200.htm |archive-date=May 7, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; DVDs of the movies or the TV series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131895890.html |title=Article: Garfield's ready to share the lasagna. – The Dallas Morning News (via Knight-Ridder/Tribune NewsService)|publisher=Highbeam.com |date=2005-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.commercebank.com/personal/cards/credit/garfield-visa/ | title=Garfield Credit Card | publisher=[[Commerce Bancshares|Commerce Bank]] | accessdate=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfield.com is the strip's official website, which contains archives of past strips along with games and an online store. Jim Davis has also collaborated with [[Ball State University]] and [[Pearson Education|Pearson]] Digital Learning to create www.ProfessorGarfield.org, an educational website with interactive games focusing on math and reading skills, and with Children's Technology Group to create MindWalker, a web browser that allows parents to limit the websites their children can view to a pre-set list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=14857#middle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016175332/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=14857 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 16, 2005 |title=Ball State University, Garfield Partner on New Website |date=August 22, 2005 |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |publisher=Inside Indiana Business |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://san-diego-business-journal.vlex.com/vid/garfield-to-guard-web-sites-54313369 | title=Garfield to Guard Web Sites | date=March 19, 2001 | accessdate=Jun 19, 2012 | publisher=[[San Diego Business Journal]] | first=Zion | last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Garfield+Hangs+Ten+on+the+World+Wide+Wave(TM).-a073877177 | title=Garfield Hangs Ten on the World Wide Wave | date=May 1, 2001 | accessdate=June 19, 2012 | publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of edited ''Garfield'' strips have been made available on the Internet, some hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site called the "Garfield Randomizer" created a three-panel strip using panels from previous ''Garfield'' strips.&lt;ref&gt;The application is still available online; do a web search for "Garfield" + "randomizer".&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, known as "Silent Garfield",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jonsview.tumblr.com | title=Silent Garfield |  accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves removing Garfield's thought balloons from the strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jonsview.tumblr.com/post/23638639257 | title=Jon's View |  accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples date from 2006.&lt;ref name="silentgarfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=

The ''Arbuckle'' website creator writes: "'Garfield' changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat's thoughts. This is the world as he sees it. This is his story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tailsteak.com/arbuckle/ | title=Arbuckle: Garfield through Jon's eyes | accessdate=July 25, 2008 | publisher=Tailsteak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation along the same lines, called "Realfield" or "Realistic Garfield", is to redraw Garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons.&lt;ref name="tabby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20081114/REVIEW/72206455/-1/ART |title=The tabby vanishes |accessdate=December 25, 2008 |last=Hamrah |first=A.

While strips in this vein can be found online as early as 2006,&lt;ref name="silentgarfield" /&gt; the 2008 site ''[[Garfield Minus Garfield]]'' by Dan Walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media. Reception was largely positive: at its peak, the site received as many as 300,000 hits per day. Fans connected with Jon's "loneliness and desperation" and found his "crazy antics" humorous; Jim Davis himself called Walsh's strips an "inspired thing to do" and said that "some of [the strips] work better [than the originals]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/business/media/02garfield.html | title=Is the Main Character Missing?

&lt;!-- redirect here from [[Garfield (TV series)]] --&gt;
Garfield's animation debut was on ''The Fantastic Funnies'', which aired on CBS in May 15, 1980, voiced by actor [[Scott Beach]]. ''Garfield'' was one of the strips featured, introduced as a newcomer (the strip was only two years old at the time). From 1982 to 1991, twelve primetime ''Garfield'' cartoon specials and one hour-long primetime documentary celebrating the character's 10th anniversary were aired; [[Lorenzo Music]] voiced Garfield in all of them. A Saturday morning cartoon show, ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', aired for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994; this adaption also starred Music as the voice of Garfield. ''[[The Garfield Show]]'', a [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series, started development in 2007 to coincide with the strip's 30th anniversary the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&amp;newsitem_no=23758|title=New CG Garfield To Air On Cartoon Network|date=June 26, 2008|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=January 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305215116/http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&amp;newsitem_no=23758|archivedate=March 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in France in December 2008 and made its U.S. debut on [[Cartoon Network]] on November 2, 2009.

A ''Garfield'' video game was developed by [[Atari, Inc.]] for its [[Atari 2600]] home [[video game system]] and appears in their [[1984]] catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atari, Inc.|url=https://atariage.com/catalog_page.html?CatalogID=67&amp;currentPage=4 |title=Atari (CO25618-001 Rev.

''[[Garfield: Big Fat Hairy Deal]]'' is a 1987 video game for the [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and the [[Amiga]] based on the [[comic strip]]. Towa Chiki made ''[[A Week of Garfield]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], released only in Japan in 1989. [[Sega]] also made video games based on Garfield for the Genesis (''[[Garfield: Caught in the Act]]'') and Windows 3.1 computers. Other companies made games, such as ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (video game)|A Tale of Two Kitties]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS|DS]], published by Game Factory, ''[[Garfield's Nightmare]]'' for DS, ''Garfield's Funfest'' for DS, and ''[[Garfield Labyrinth]]'' for [[Game Boy]].  On PlayStation 2 were ''Garfield'' and ''Garfield 2'' (known in the US as ''Garfield, a Tale of Two Kitties'').  ''Garfield Lasagna World Tour'' was also made for PS2. And recent additions for mobile devices are "Garfield's Diner" and "Garfield's Zombie Defense".

[[Konami]] also released a Garfield ''[[Handheld electronic game]]'' titled ''[[Lasagnator]]'' in 1991, which met with mild success.

In 2012, a series of Garfield video games was launched by French publisher [[Anuman Interactive]], including ''My Puzzles with Garfield!'', ''Multiplication Tables with Garfield'', ''Garfield Kart'', and ''Garfield's Match Up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan Farrugia |url=http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2013/10/garfield-kart-new-details-and-pictures/ |title=Garfield Kart New Details and Pictures – Capsule Computers |publisher=Capsulecomputers.com.au |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage===
[[Joseph Papp]], producer of ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', discussed making a Garfield stage musical, but due to some complications, it never got off ground. A full-length stage musical, titled "Garfield Live", was planned to kick off its US tour in September 2010, but got moved to January 18, 2011, where it premiered in [[Muncie, Indiana]]. The book was written by Jim Davis, with music and lyrics by Michael Dansicker and Bill Meade, and it was booked by AWA Touring Services. The opening song, "Cattitude" can be heard on the national tour's website, along with two more, "On the Fence," and "Going Home!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garfield Live on Stage|url=http://garfieldthemusical.com/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011093814/http://garfieldthemusical.com/|archivedate=October 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the North-American tour concluded in 2012, it toured throughout Asia.

===Comic book===
In agreement with Paws, [[Boom! Studios]] launched in May 2012 a monthly ''Garfield'' comic book, with the first issue featuring a story written by [[Mark Evanier]] (who has supervised ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' and ''[[The Garfield Show]]'') and illustrated by Davis's long-time assistant Gary Barker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Garfield Comic Book|url=http://www.garfield.com/news/stories.html?boom&amp;boom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art book===
In 2016, [[Hermes Press]] signed an agreement with Paws, Inc to publish an art book on the art of author Jim Davis, titled ''The Art of Jim Davis' Garfield''.&lt;ref name="Herman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Daniel|title=[SOLICITATIONS] THE ART OF JIM DAVIS' GARFIELD TO BE RELEASED BY HERMES PRESS|url=http://majorspoilers.com/2016/03/21/solicitations-art-jim-davis-garfield-released-hermes-press/|work=Major Spoilers|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes an essay by author [[R.C.

Through the Garfield strips, there have been many additional characters, but the main ones are described here.

===Garfield===
'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''

{{quote box|quote=I'm not overweight, I'm undertall.|source= —''[[Garfield At Large: His First Book|Garfield At Large: his First Book]]'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressroom.garfield.com/garfield_bio/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030410100409/http://pressroom.garfield.com/garfield_bio/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 10, 2003 |title=The Garfield PressRoom: A Brief History |publisher=Paws Inc. |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=310px}}

[[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] is an orange, fuzzy [[tabby cat]] born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant (later revealed in the television special ''[[Garfield: His 9 Lives#The television special|Garfield: His 9 Lives]]'' to be Mama Leoni's Italian Restaurant) who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for [[lasagna]] and [[pizza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga841213.gif | title=Garfield | date=December 14, 1984 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Phil Roman (Director), [[Lorenzo Music]] (Voice) | title=Garfield: His Nine Lives [Television production] | medium=Television (Original), VHS | publisher=[[Fox Home Entertainment]] | origyear=1988 (television), 1993 (VHS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gags in the strips commonly deal with Garfield's obesity (in one strip, Jon jokes, "I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on a [[Ferris wheel]], the two guys on top starved to death"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1980/ga800502.gif | title=Garfield | date=May 2, 1980 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his disdain of any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying "breathing is exercise".

Though Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and one Christmas he says, "they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast ... I wish it would never end."
However, in the feature film ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.

It has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904152923/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 4, 2014 | title=Garfield | date=August 15, 2009 | publisher=Gocomics.com | accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the feature film [[Garfield Gets Real]] and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the 1 April ([[April Fools' Day]]) 1997 strip,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1997/04/01 | title=Garfield | date=April 1, 1997 | publisher=Gocomics.com | accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.

To break the fourth wall, 19 June is celebrated within the strip as Garfield's birthday. The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (19 June 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics|title=Garfield Comics| date=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jon Arbuckle===
'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''

{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Here's my sixth-grade report card. My parents were so proud.

Garfield, reading the report card:'' "Jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term."|source= —''Garfield'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960311.gif | title=Garfield | date=March 11, 1996 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=310px}}

[[Jon Arbuckle|Jon (Jonathan Q. Arbuckle)]] is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy [[geek]] who has trouble finding a date.  Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's "don't care, not interested," attitude, and  often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of.  In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808190758/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=August 8, 2016 | title=Garfield | date=July 28, 2005 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210333/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=August 8, 2016 | title=Garfield | date=July 28, 2008 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that "two hundred moths committed suicide";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2002/ga020110.gif | title=Garfield | date=January 10, 2002 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in another, the "geek police" ordered Jon to "throw out his tie"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890811.gif | title=Garfield | date=August 11, 1989 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with "[[polka]] [[ninja]]s". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a [[pop-up book]] in one strip).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1990/ga900324.gif | title=Garfield | date=March 24, 1990 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks, "Woo-ha! Ain't science something?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga841127.gif | title=Garfield | date=November 27, 1984 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was initially portrayed as a [[cartoonist]] in earlier strips, as Jim Davis stated this would've been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself, but this eventually faded in the later strips.

===Odie===
'''First appearance: August 8, 1978'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Garfield Vault Strip | work=Garfield.com | url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780808.gif|date=August 8, 1978 | accessdate=August 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' I think I'm having some kind of identity crisis.

''Garfield, walking past Odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer:'' He thinks '''he's''' having an identity crisis ... Odie thinks he's a potato peeler.|source= —''Garfield'' (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1991/ga910912.gif | title=Garfield | date=September 12, 1991 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=310px}}

[[Odie]] is a yellow, long-eared [[beagle]] with a large, slobbering tongue, who walks on all four legs, though occasionally he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend [[List of characters in Garfield#Lyman|Lyman]], though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book ''Garfield: His 9 Lives'' (1984) [[retcons]] Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading ''[[War and Peace]]'' and watching a television program, ''An Evening With Mozart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890427.gif | title=Garfield | date=April 27, 1989 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's [[sudoku]] puzzle.

===Dr. Liz Wilson===
'''First appearance: June 26, 1979'''

{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Tell me, Liz, haven't we met somewhere before? A rice paddy in Hong Kong?

''Liz:'' Look, jerk. I'll be the vet for your cat, but I won't play [[fall guy]] for your stupid lines. Understood?

''Jon, shocked:'' Uh-huh. So long, doctor.

''Liz:'' Have a nice day.|source= —''Garfield'' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1979/ga790630.gif | title=Garfield | date=June 30, 1979 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=310px}}
Dr. Liz Wilson is Garfield's [[veterinarian]] and a long-time crush of Jon Arbuckle. She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss. Now, they are a couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&amp;addr=060728 |title=Garfield's Comic Strip Archives at Garfield.com – The Official Web Site of Garfield &amp; Friends |publisher=Garfield.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072545/http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&amp;addr=060728 |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring subjects and themes==
Many of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to [[Abu Dhabi]], or simply throwing ''through'' the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of [[raisin]]s and [[spinach]]), Garfield is particularly fond of [[lasagna]]; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with "Nancy", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting "shot down by three generations").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960614.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = June 14, 1996 | accessdate=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.

Garfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his [[tractor]] (which he [[double parking|double-parked]]) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.&lt;ref name="The Garfield Vault Strip"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2007/ga070819.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = August 19, 2007 | accessdate = June 6, 2008|work = Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, the characters break the [[fourth wall]], mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1992/ga920125.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = January 25, 1992 | accessdate = June 21, 2008|work = Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga781127.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = November 27, 1978 | accessdate = June 21, 2008|work = Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short storylines===
One particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.

Another commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).

Other unique themes are things like "Garfield's Believe it or Don't",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garfield's Believe it, or DON'T |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+Believe+it%2C+or+DON%27T%21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712032111/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+Believe+it,+or+DON'T!|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=Jim Davis (cartoonist)|date=January 20, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Garfield's Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Garfield's law |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+law|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710084143/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+law|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 10, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=|date=November 8, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Garfield's History of Dogs",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garfield Comic Strips September 1980 |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708094750/http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 8, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=|date=September 1, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Garfield's History of Cats",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garfield's history of cats garfield.nfshost.com :: search garfield|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+history+of+cats|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709072827/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+history+of+cats|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 9, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012|author=Jim Davis|date=August 6, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is "National Fat Week", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and "kicking Odie into next week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840629.gif | title=The Garfield Vault Strip | date=June 29, 1984 | accessdate=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Garfield realizes that "Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food" (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840630.gif | title=The Garfield Vault Strip | date=June 30, 1984 | accessdate=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a "nagging feeling I'm forgetting something," with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840702.gif | title=The Garfield Vault Strip | date=July 2, 1984 | accessdate=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is "Splut Week", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia "splut", hence the name.

Every week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: "I'M OFF MY DIET!" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.

One storyline, which ran the week before [[Halloween]] in 1989 ([http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/23/ Oct 23] to [http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/28/ Oct 28]), is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/its-not-just-you-garfield-is-not-meant-to-be-funny-6199556/ | title = It's Not Just You: Garfield Is Not Meant to Be Funny | date = 20 March 2013 | accessdate = 29 April 2018 | publisher = ''Smithsonian Magazine'' | author = Rose Eveleth }}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's ''Twentieth Anniversary Collection'', in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:

{{quote|During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I wanted to scare people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers. Reaction ranged from 'Right on!' to 'This isn't a trend, is it?'}}

One of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, [[monkey]]s, a [[Pinniped|seal]], a snake, a [[kangaroo]] and [[joey (marsupial)|joey]], and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.

Another story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (1984 December 3 to 23). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special ''[[Garfield on the Town]]''.

==2010 Veterans Day controversy==
[[File:Garfield comic strip November 11, 2010.png|thumb|The controversial comic strip]]
Davis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a ''Garfield'' strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]] that appeared in newspapers on November 11, 2010. In the strip, a spider who is about to be squashed by Garfield boasts that if he is squished, he will get a holiday in his remembrance. The next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate "National Stupid Day," implying that the spider was squished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2010&amp;addr=101111|title=Garfield Comic Strip Archive|date=November 11, 2010|publisher=garfield.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114121219/http://garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2010&amp;addr=101111|archivedate=November 14, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip, saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/11/12/garfield.ill.timed.comic/?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title='Garfield' creator apologizes for ill-timed Veterans Day comic strip | date=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gravon: Real Virtuality''''' is a 1995 video game developed by Suma. The game originally was released for [[Atari Falcon]] and later ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2013 and packed as a bonus game to ''[[Take On Mars]]''. The famous game ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]'' is considered to be a spiritual successor to ''Gravon''.&lt;ref name="dbh"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Gravonscreen.jpg|thumb|left|Player controls a Hovercraft. The blue line on the left is a health bar, while the yellow on right is an ammo bar. Also visible are multiple gauges on the dashboard displaying speed and engine thrust levels.]]
The player pilots a hovercraft and has to complete tasks in the missions. Possible tasks include finding something, destroying an enemy object, destroying enemy fighters, etc. Missions are set on a large terrain that is procedurally generated. The player can come across mountains, villages, forests, and other terrain features. The game environment also differs on different missions. The player has to fight enemies that try to prevent him from completing the task. Types of enemies include hovercrafts, tanks, helicopters and defense towers.&lt;ref name="dbh"/&gt;

==Plot==
The game's setting is a planetoid belt. The belt is occupied by enemy NPC's. The player character is a hovercraft pilot who has just completed training and is sent to the belt to fight enemies and fulfill multiple missions. The player character gets promoted after every mission success.

When the last mission is finished the outro is seen. The player character and protagonist returns home in a pod with a parachute. The player character lands in an ocean where a helicopter arrives to exfiltrate the character.

==Development==
''Gravon'' was created by brothers Marek and Ondřej Španěl. They founded their development studio Suma in 1985. They finished their second game ''Invaze z Aldebaranu'' in 1992 and started to be curious about the military genre. They decided to create a military simulator with a large assortment of vehicles. The result of this interest in military simulation was the game ''Gravon''. They decided to make it for the Atari Falcon due to the fact that they didn't trust Windows yet. They released ''Gravon'' in 1995. ''Gravon'' was well received but was a financial failure, not selling many copies. Only 400 copies of ''Gravon'' were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ПРИШЕЛ, УВИДЕЛ, ПОБЕДИЛ. ИСТОРИЯ СОЗДАНИЯ OPERATION FLASHPOINT|url=http://www.igromania.ru/print/index.php?ID=121479|website=Igromania.ru|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G:RVrps"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gillen|first1=Kieron|title=Making Of: Operation Flashpoint|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/10/05/making-of-flashpoint/|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=October 5, 2007|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suma then worked on multiple unfinished Projects like Rio Grande and Poseidon. Poseidon was meant to be a sequel to Gravon but only a technical demo was released. The Španěl brothers then changed the name of their studio from Suma to [[Bohemia Interactive]] and developed ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]''. ''Operation: Flashpoint'' was a spiritual successor to ''Gravon''. During development and support of ''Operation: Flashpoint'', Bohemia Interactive became the largest video game development studio in the Czech Republic. Bohemia Interactive later ported ''Gravon'' to Windows and packaged it as a bonus game with ''[[Take On Mars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doskočil|first1=Jan|title=Dobré ráno s Eurogamerem - pátek, 6. září|url=http://www.eurogamer.cz/articles/2013-09-06-dobre-rano-s-eurogamerem-patek-6-zari|website=Eurogamer.cz|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Ike's Wee Wee'''" is the fourth episode of the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 18th episode of the series overall, it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on May 27, 1998.&lt;ref name="pr" /&gt; In the episode, school counselor [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]] is fired, and turns to [[drug]]s. Meanwhile, the boys misconstrue what [[circumcision]] entails, and try to save [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s younger brother [[List of South Park families#Ike Broflovski|Ike]] from his upcoming [[Brit milah|bris]].

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. "Ike's Wee Wee" satirizes certain attitudes towards drug users, and explores whether family can only mean those who are related by blood. This episode introduced Ike's backstory as an adopted Canadian child. "Ike's Wee Wee" received positive responses from critics, who especially praised the episode for its touching moments.

==Plot==
[[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]], the school counselor, is giving a drug and alcohol prevention lecture to the class, emphasizing that [[Cigarette|smoking]], [[Alcoholic beverages|drinking]], [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] are bad. He passes a sample of marijuana around the class so that the children can learn its smell, but it is never returned. As a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying marijuana one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled [[hippie]], and meets a female hippie, with whom he decides to get married. While on [[honeymoon]] in India, Mr. Mackey is captured and taken into [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. Mr. Mackey emerges clean from rehab and is given his job back.

Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] invites [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to his younger brother [[List of South Park families#Ike Broflovski|Ike]]'s [[Brit milah|bris]]. When they learn more about what a bris is, and misconstrue it as a party where they are going to remove his penis, Kyle tries to find a way to hide his brother from his parents and the [[circumcision]] process. Kyle puts Ike on a train to [[Nebraska]] and makes an Ike-style doll out of meat bones in an attempt to not arouse his parents' suspicions. This backfires when the doll is eaten by a dog, which leads to them to think that Ike is dead. It is at the funeral that Kyle finds out that Ike is not his [[Consanguinity|biological]] brother, but was adopted from Canada due to the tombstone featuring the [[Canadian flag]]. Upon discovering this, Kyle decides that Ike is no longer his brother. His parents are shocked after Kyle reveals the truth, and Ike is retrieved from Nebraska.

The day of the bris arrives, and Kyle is grounded for sending Ike away. When the [[mohel]] arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts a change of heart in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.

"Ike's Wee Wee" was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared.&lt;ref name="marijuana_inspiration" /&gt; At the beginning and end of the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in [[Middle school|junior high school]], who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character.&lt;ref name="comedyarts"&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/aspen/chat_southpark.shtml |title=''South Park'' Comes Home |date=March 7, 1998 |conference=[[The Comedy Festival|The US Comedy Arts Festival]] |location=Aspen, Colorado |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010111175300/http://www.comedycentral.com/aspen/chat_southpark.shtml |archivedate=January 11, 2001 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commentary110"&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = Parker, Trey; Stone, Matt | format = Audio commentary for "[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]" | title = South Park – The Complete First Season: Episode Commentary | year = 2002 | medium = CD | publisher = Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, "There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: "Do whatever you want, just wait till [[college]] because you don't know what the fuck's up right now."&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Steve |last=Pond |date=June 2000 |title=Interview: Trey Parker and Matt Stone |magazine=[[Playboy]] |publisher=[[Playboy Publishing]] |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=65–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chef's sentence would later return in the [[South Park (season 4)|season four]] episode "[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]".

"Ike's Wee Wee" features regular voice acting from series creators Parker and [[Matt Stone]] for most characters, [[Mary Kay Bergman]] (credited as Shannen Cassidy) for female characters, and [[Isaac Hayes]] for [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]]. Additional dialogue was provided by ''South Park'' audio engineer Bruce Howell, while Ike's lines were uttered by Howell's then-5-year-old son Jesse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/news-articles/crappy-possible-method-behind-madness-south-park/382927 ""As Crappy As Possible": The Method Behind the Madness of South Park"].

==Themes==
"Ike's Wee Wee" raises the question of who really can be considered one's family. At first, Kyle's implicit idea is that family consists of "those for whom we care that are related by blood".&lt;ref name="learnedsomething_socratic"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Arp |editor-first=Robert |title=[[South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today]] |publisher=Blackwell Publishing (The Blackwell Philosophy &amp; Pop Culture Series) |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-6160-2 |chapter=8: The Philosophical Passion of the Jew: Kyle the Philosopher |last1=Devlin |first1=William J. |pages=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this viewing of family, he no longer feels the need to help Ike when he learns that they are not related by blood.&lt;ref name="learnedsomething_socratic" /&gt; As the story progresses, Kyle questions his initial beliefs, and forms the episode's central moral by saying that "Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who you care about."&lt;ref name="learnedsomething_socratic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="takingseriously"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Weinstock |editor-first=Jeffrey Andrew |title=Taking South Park Seriously |last=Becker |first=Matt |chapter=Chapter 8: 'I Hate Hippies' |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7914-7566-9 |page=159 |quote=In fact, the idea that family is more about for whom you care than about whose blood you share is the central moral of 'Ike's Wee Wee.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Kyle's reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother, but his friends as well.&lt;ref name="learnedsomething_socratic" /&gt; Kyle's questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in the [[dialectic]]al [[Socratic method]] of inquiry.&lt;ref name="learnedsomething_socratic" /&gt;

The subplot of "Ike's Wee Wee" satirizes certain [[Drug culture|drug subcultures]], as well as [[drug abuse|drug use]], and societal attitudes towards [[drug user]]s. The way the episode portrays Mr. Mackey's lack of real knowledge about drug use and addiction has been described as an example of ''South Park'' satirizing [[left-wing politics]], when "they lead to the sort of hypocrisy inconsistent with a proper [[open society]]".&lt;ref name="learnedsomething_opensociety"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Arp |editor-first=Robert |title=[[South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today]] |publisher=Blackwell Publishing (The Blackwell Philosophy &amp; Pop Culture Series) |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-6160-2 |chapter=10: ''South Park'' and the Open Society: Defending Democracy Through Satire |last1=Curtis |first1=David Valleu |last2=Erion |first2=Gerald J. |pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
Part of the episode revolves around the practice of [[religious male circumcision]] in [[Judaism]], and the related ceremony called the ''[[brit milah]]'' or bris, and the boys' misunderstanding of the tradition.&lt;ref name="script" /&gt; The boys believe that circumcision entails the cutting off of one's penis, which they refer to by the childish colloquial term "[[wiktionary:wee wee|wee wee]]", except for Cartman, who insists on calling it "fireman". [[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] is also referred to by various names, including ''weed'', ''grass'', ''pot'', and ''[[Marijuana (word)|marijuana]]'', in which Mr. Mackey constantly pronounces the letter ''j'' as {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (as in ''jam''), which makes Kyle mispronounce the drug as "marry-Jew wanna".&lt;ref name="script" /&gt;

Drug use is often portrayed in conjunction with the [[hippie]] subculture, through hippie characters, such as the two teenagers that give [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries.&lt;ref name="script"&gt;{{Cite web |title=''South Park'': 'Ike's Wee Wee' script |publisher=[[Comedy Central]], South Park Studios |first=Trey |last=Parker |year=1998 |url=http://www.spscriptorium.com/Southparkpdfs/204.pdf |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of South Park families#Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] and Cartman both use the term ''hippie'' pejoratively. During their argument, Jimbo tells Mackey that he should just go to a [[Grateful Dead]] concert, to which Mackey says he can't since [[Jerry Garcia]] is deceased. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching ''[[Teletubbies]]'' while high on marijuana or in rehab.&lt;ref name="script" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rj_teletubbies"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QLlbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VFINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4015%2C2621555 |title='Teletubbies' are just a bit overbearing for this guy |first=Mark |last=McGuire |date=February 18, 1999 |newspaper=[[Record-Journal]] |page=A6 |agency=[[Times Union (Albany)|Albany Times Union]] |quote=There was an episode of 'South Park' that nailed it, showing a group at the Betty Ford clinic getting a substitute fix and easing withdrawal symptoms by watching the show. |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], former members of [[The Beatles]]. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented with the drug.&lt;ref name="beatles"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hertsgaard |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Hertsgaard |year=1995 |chapter=We All Want to Change the World: Drugs, Politics, and Spirituality |title=A Day in the Life: The Music and Artistry of the Beatles |isbn=978-0-385-31377-3 |publisher=Delacorte Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While walking home, Mr. Mackey drunkenly sings the 1983 [[Pat Benatar]] song "[[Love Is a Battlefield]]". During Ike's supposed funeral, a [[bagpipe]] player starts playing the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] folk song "[[Hava Nagila]]".&lt;ref name="script" /&gt; At the funerals, the priest uses the phrase "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust", from the [[Anglican]] burial service. When the townspeople start to harass Mackey, one of them shouts, "Now we see what you and [[Homer Simpson]] have in common... Dope!". This references the famous catchphrase from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[D'oh!]]", which sounds similar to the word ''dope'', meaning illicit drugs. At Kyle's house, Kyle's parents offer the boys a dish called "GaHekgafuga",&lt;ref name="script" /&gt; which is not a real dish.&lt;ref name="gahekgafuga"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/353970 |title=FAQ: What is the name of the dish that Kyle's mom is supposed to make in the 'Ike's Wee Wee' episode?

A common [[plot device]] is referenced, where a [[shoulder angel]] (represents [[conscience]]) and a shoulder devil (representing [[temptation]]) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, as both the devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a [[dolly zoom]] is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used to show that a character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).

In the scene where the boys are talking to [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]], he leaves without answering the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, "Dammit, children, why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]'', the 1995 short film that was the precursor to ''South Park''.&lt;ref name="ham"&gt;{{Cite newsgroup |title=Anyone catch this? |author=User "Alyssa" |date=May 24, 1998 |newsgroup=alt.tv.southpark |message-id=01bd8798$68f04f00$4a16a5ce@primenet.primenet.com |url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.southpark/msg/82cc1ddf0ff39252 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ike's Wee Wee" was met with favorable reviews. Critics especially praised the episode for its touching moments, in contrast with the [[off-color humor]] often employed in the series. In his review of the episode in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Allan Johnson praised the episode, especially in comparison with the first two episodes of the season, considering it to be one of the better episodes of the series.&lt;ref name="tribune_review" /&gt; When the series reached [[I'm a Little Bit Country|its 100th episode]] in 2003, the same writer also listed "Ike's Wee Wee" as one of the "top 10 episodes that have made {{Interp|''South Park''}} one of the most provocative comedies on TV".&lt;ref name="tribune_top10"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-04-09/features/0304090091_1_south-park-music-teacher-comedy-central |title=Whoever thought this show would last 100 episodes? |date=April 9, 2003 |first=Allan |last=Johnson |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |location=Chicago, Illinois |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] said that "{{Interp|i}}n the midst of all this potty-mouthed humor, there are moments that are downright touching", and particularly highlighted the ending of "Ike's Wee Wee" as an example, explaining that "all's well in the end, and Kyle and the boys learn a lesson about family values that even [[Dan Quayle]] would approve of".&lt;ref name="post-gazette"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Naughty boys: 'Very Bad Things' and 'South Park' flaunt a twisted sense of humor |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |publisher=Block Communications |date=May 21, 1999 |page=42 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z44zAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3937%2C427628 |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, visitors of the Comedy Central website chose "Ike's Wee Wee" as their favorite episode during a voting called "''South Park'' e-Lections", held around the time of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|United States presidential election that year]].&lt;ref name="elections_site"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://comedycentral.com/southpark/e_lections/index.tin |title=South Park e-Lections |year=2000 |publisher=[[Comedy Central]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001117021000/http://comedycentral.com/southpark/e_lections/index.tin |archivedate=November 17, 2000 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elections_spin"&gt;{{Cite journal |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=March 2001 |title=On the Download |last=Radestsky |first=Ary Tye |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzBMbiDVcKoC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=%22ike's%20wee%20wee%22&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ike's%20wee%20wee%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mayumana.jpg|thumb|Mayumana troupe]]
'''Mayumana''' ({{lang-he|מיומנה}}) is an [[Israel]]i dance troupe that combines dance, song and percussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/theater/reviews/09moment.html?_r=0 From Israel, Acrobatic Rhythm and Moves, [[New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mayumana was established in [[Tel Aviv]] by Eylon Nuphar and Boaz Berman in 1996.
The name of the troupe is derived from the [[Hebrew]] word for "skill." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-158620843.html "Mayumana's Be," an Israeli rhythm-dance-performance amalgam, begins perfs at Off Broadway's Union Square Theater in February]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996-2007, Mayumana performed over 5,000 shows in 30 countries, reaching an audience of more than 3.5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-136039049.html Mayumana's BE is the place to be]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mayumana's "BE" show was performed with an international cast of dancers, actors, gymnasts, musicians and singers. The show uses instruments, voices and bodies to create a "visual smorgasbord of dance, movement and theater."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-136039049.html Mayumana's BE is the place to be]&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Momentum'', created by Eylon Nuphar and Boaz Berman, is a rhythmic dance performance in which the dancers drum on boxes, buckets and floors with their hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/theater/reviews/09moment.html?_r=0 From Israel, Acrobatic Rhythm and Moves, [[New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayumana also performs a children's show, ADRABA. In 2006, the troupe collaborated with  Israeli singer/songwriter [[David Broza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-136039049.html Mayumana's BE is the place to be]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
[[Image:Majumaana2.jpg|thumb|Mayumana House in [[Jaffa]]]]
In 2011, the [[Arava Power Company]], an Israeli solar energy firm, partnered with Mayumana to create a promotional video for the Israel EcoCinema Festival. The video was used a second time as Arava Power Company’s video-invitation to the historic launch of [[Ketura Sun]], the first solar field in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRe8Z_qCYb0| title = You Are Invited to the Inauguration of Israel's First Solar Field| date = May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Mayumana won the Award for Excellence in Theater Production by Israel's National Academy of Theater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-136039049.html Mayumana's BE is the place to be]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Museum Speelklok''' (previously known as ''Museum van Speelklok tot Pierement'') is a museum in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]]. It has a collection of automatically playing musical instruments, most of which still work and therefore still can play their music. Among the instruments on display are [[Musical box|music boxes]], musical clocks, [[pianola]]s, [[barrel organ]]s (including the typically Dutch large [[street organ]]s) and a turret clock with [[carillon]]. The word ''speelklok'' means musical clock.

Over the years the museum has become popular nationwide and also internationally. The museum's restoration workshops are a leader in their field, and are known for their excellent standards.

== History of the museum ==
The museum had its origins in an exhibition of mechanical organs and other musical automata in Utrecht in the summer of 1956. The great success of this led to the creation of a permanent national museum dedicated to mechanical musical instruments. In 1984 the museum's present housing in the central medieval [[Buurkerk]] (citizens' church) was officially opened by Queen Beatrix.

== Royal Music Machines exhibition ==
For its 50-year Jubilee in 2006 the museum held a special exhibition, "Royal Music Machines". For this event, various renowned museums, including the [[Hermitage Museum]], the [[Louvre]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna, loaned very special instruments.

== Influence and coverage in media ==
In 2016, Swedish musician [[Wintergatan|Martin Molin]] visited Museum Speelklok and stated that the experience inspired him to build [[Wintergatan#Marble Machine|Marble Machine]], an instrument constructed with plywood that plays music through the use of falling marbles. 
 
Molin's retired [[Wintergatan#Marble Machine|Marble Machine]] was transported to Museum Speelklok as a temporary attraction in Summer 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wintergatan|title=Meet the Retired Marble Machine at Speelklok Museum|date=2017-05-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkAwf3hlHSE|accessdate=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2017, Molin announced a weekly [[Vlog|video series]] on streaming site [[YouTube]] that would showcase various instruments from the museum in a series known as 'Music Machine Mondays'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wintergatan|title=Welcome back to Wintergatan Wednesdays (and Mondays!)|date=2017-08-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNqktpl5syk|accessdate=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5701">'''''Patintero''''', also known as '''''harangang-taga''''' or '''''tubigan''''', is a traditional [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[children's game]]. Along with ''[[tumbang preso]]'', it is one of the most popular outdoor games played by children in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="jara"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pamintuan-Jara |first1=Noemi M. |title=Whatever happened to ‘patintero’? |url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/73810/whatever-happened-to-patintero/ |website=Inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Patintero'' is derived from Spanish word ''tinte'' ("tint" or "ink") in reference to the drawn lines. Another name for it is ''tubigan'', ''tubiganay'', or ''tubig-tubig'' ("water [game]"), due to the fact that the grid lines are also commonly drawn by wetting the ground with water. It is also known as ''harangang-taga'' or ''harang-taga'' (lit. "block and catch"), referring to the game mechanics.&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;{{cite web |title=Old-Fashioned Filipino Games |url=http://www.ethnicgroupsphilippines.com/2016/03/06/old-fashioned-filipino-games/ |website=Ethnic Groups Philippines |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corb"/&gt;

Other names for the game include ''lumplumpas'' ([[Igorot people|Igorot]]), ''sabatan'' ([[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]]), ''sinibon'' ([[Ilokano people|Ilokano]]), and ''tadlas'' (for four players) or ''birus-birus'' (for six players) in eastern [[Visayas]].&lt;ref name="corb"/&gt;

==Description==
Patintero is played on a rectangular grid drawn into the ground. The rectangle is usually {{convert|5|to|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, and {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. It is subdivided into four to six equal parts by drawing a central lengthwise line and then one or two crosswise lines. The size of the rectangle and the number of subdivisions can be adjusted based on the number of players. The individual squares in the grid must be large enough that someone can stay in the middle out of reach of someone standing on the lines.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web |title=Patintero |url=https://www.playworks.org/game-library/patintero/ |website=Playworks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Play Patintero |url=https://www.tagaloglang.com/how-to-play-patintero/ |website=Tagalog Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sea"&gt;{{cite web |title=Patintero a.k.a. Tubigan or Harangang Taga |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/filipino_games/patintero.htm |website=SEAsite |publisher=Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tap"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Posadas |first1=Justin |title=Laro ng lahi: How to play patintero, tumbang preso and more! |url=https://ph.theasianparent.com/rules-of-popular-laro-ng-lahi-games/ |website=theAsianParent Philippines |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two teams are needed, each with around two to six players. One team acts as the taggers, the other acts as the runners. This is usually decided by a game of [[rock–paper–scissors]] (''jak-en-poy'') or a coin toss.&lt;ref name="pw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tap"/&gt;

The object of the game is to cross the rectangle back and forth without getting tagged. One tagger is usually assigned per crosswise line. Taggers can only move along their respective lines, with the exception of the tagger on the first line who is regarded as the team leader (''patoto''). Unlike the other taggers, the ''patoto'' can also move along the central lengthwise line.&lt;ref name="corb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corbett|first1=Doris |last2= Cheffers|first2=John|first3=Eileen Crowley |last3=Sullivan|editor =|title =Unique Games and Sports Around the World: A Reference Guide|chapter =|publisher =Greenwood Publishing Group|series =|year =2001|page=183|isbn =9780313297786|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Au3Pd8BQrB4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taggers can tag runners at any time, including those already past them, but ''both'' of their feet must always be on the lines. Tagging a runner when none or only one foot is contacting the line is not counted.&lt;ref name="pw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tap"/&gt; 

Runners can cross at any time and to any adjacent square, however, they can only exit the playing rectangle at both ends of the rectangle. Once a runner is tagged, they are out and will sit out the match until the next game. Teams score points when they complete ''isang gabi'' ("one night"), a full circuit of the playing rectangle, from one end to the other and back again. Once all the runners have been tagged, the teams reverse roles, with the taggers now becoming the runners and vice versa.&lt;ref name="pw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tap"/&gt;

In some versions of the game, the match ends if even only one runner is tagged. In others, this only applies if the ''patoto'' of the team is tagged. In modern versions, there is also sometimes a time limit for how long runners can attempt to score points. The match ends once the time is up, regardless if no points have been scored.&lt;ref name="pw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tap"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Jaywalking]] is derisively referred to as "playing ''patintero'' with cars" in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palma |first1=Ragene Andrea L. |title=‘Patintero’ on the streets |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/93112/patintero-on-the-streets |website=Inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:wrestling_repechage_example.svg|thumb|238px|&lt;!-- 238px makes text most legible --&gt; Example of a wrestling tournament using a repechage bracket with two 3rd place finishers without crossover.

'''Repechage''' ({{IPAc-en|ɹ|ə|p|ɛ|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|ʒ}}; {{lang-fr|repêchage}}, "fishing out, rescuing") is a practice in series competitions that allows participants who failed to meet qualifying standards by a small margin to continue to the next round, in a similar way as a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card system]] works out.

{{wiktionary|repechage}}

== Types ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Different types of repechage can occur.  As a basis for the examples below, assume that 64 competitors are divided into four pools of 16 competitors, labeled A, B, C, and D.  The first three rounds of the primary championship bracket winnow the field down to eight competitors for the quarter-final.

=== Full repechage ===
In full repechage, a competitor who loses to the pool winner drops into the repechage bracket. The theory is that a worthy competitor who is paired with another worthy competitor should not be unduly penalized by luck of the draw, but have an opportunity to fight for at least third place.  In our example, four competitors from each pool (the loser to the pool winner in the first, second, third and quarter-final rounds) drop into the repechage bracket.  A larger pool results in a longer wait for first-round losers to determine if they will compete in repechage.

=== Quarter-final repechage ===
Quarter-final repechage pulls losers from the quarter-final round only.  The prior rounds are single-elimination.  Losers in the quarter-final from two pools (e.g., A and B) are entered into one bracket of the repechage first round. Quarter-final losers from the other two pools are entered into the other bracket. Repechage losers are placed in seventh place. Winners of these matches play against semifinal losers of opposite bracket. Losers are placed in fifth place and winners are awarded with bronze medal each.

=== Double-elimination repechage ===
In [[double-elimination tournament|double-elimination]] repechage, any loser in the championship bracket drops into the repechage bracket.  Typically the losers from the championship bracket's first round compete against each other in the repechage first round for the right to compete in the repechage second round (against the championship bracket second round losers).  In ''full'' double-elimination repechage, the eventual repechage bracket winner competes against the championship bracket winner to determine the winner of the overall competition, but the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to win the competition whereas the championship bracket winner needs only win one match.  In a ''partial'' double-elimination repechage bracket, the bracket winner(or winners in dual third-place scenario) will take third place.

=== Repechage bracket with two third place finishers ===
Dual third-place finishers can result with full, quarter-final, or double-elimination repechage.  Losers from two championship bracket pools (e.g., A and B) are placed into one repechage bracket and losers from the other two pools are placed in the other repechage bracket.  The winner from each pool's repechage bracket competes against the loser in the championship semi-final who comes from one of that repechage bracket's two pools.  Or, in a "cross-over" arrangement, the semi-final loser comes from the other bracket's pools.  Each winner of this repechage round takes third place.  The losers of the prior two repechage rounds are often considered to take fifth and seventh places.

=== Consolation bracket ===
A consolation bracket is when losers drop from the primary championship bracket and compete for [[Third place playoff|third place]] or a lesser [[consolation prize]].  Hence, except in the case of full double-elimination repechage, a repechage bracket might be referred to as a consolation bracket.

== Usage ==

=== Baseball and softball ===
In [[Major League Baseball]] a repechage bracket is formed by [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams in each League. Entry to the [[Major League Baseball postseason|Postseason]] is determined by the [[Wild Card Game]].

At many levels of amateur play in [[baseball]] and [[softball]], including the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], tournaments are established as a full double-elimination repechage.

In the current 64-team baseball and softball NCAA tournament formats, there are alternating four-team double-elimination repechage formats, and best two-of-three games series.  The first and third rounds are full double-elimination repechages, while the second and fourth rounds are best two-of-three game series.

The [[Southeastern Conference]] baseball tournament has a flip-bracket format; the winner of the first championship bracket plays the winner of the second repechage bracket, and the winner of the second championship bracket plays the winner of the first repechage bracket.  As usual, the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to advance to the championship game.

=== Beach volleyball ===
Some competitions use a modified double elimination format called Olympic Crossing, in which the winning teams compete until two teams remain, while teams with one loss continue in an elimination format until two of them remain. Then, in the semifinals, each of the two remaining winning teams play a team from the losers bracket, and the winners of these matches compete in the final match, while the semifinal losers compete for third place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-04-07/community/0004060624_1_double-elimination-format-championship-bracket-double-fault  Glossary Of Beach Volleyball Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cycling ===
In [[cycling]], repechage heats are used in the [[Keirin]] and [[match sprints]]. These heats give a second chance for non-qualifiers in the preliminary heat(s) to advance to the next round of competition.

=== Fencing ===
Although not normally used for [http://britishfencing.com/uploads/files/fie_rules_-_organisation_rules_-_dec_2014.pdf FIE events], sometime local events use direct elimination with repechage.  A disadvantage is that some competitors have to wait.  An advantage for team events is more willingness to use DE from the start (with seeding by drawing lots) instead of pools.  Example format sheets are [http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Fencing/Membership/Divisions/Division-Officer-Resources/Score-and-Pool-Sheets here].

Repechage was formerly widely used in [[fencing]] tournaments, but the majority have now abandoned it, an exception being [[United States Fencing Association]] Division I tournaments.

=== Martial arts ===

All wrestlers who lost against both finalists will have repechage matches. There are two separated groups of repechage: one group of wrestlers who lost against the first finalist, and another group of wrestlers who lost against the second finalist. The repechage matches begin with wrestlers who lost in the first round including in matches to obtain the ideal number against one of the two finalists up to the losers in the semi-finals by direct elimination. The winners of the two repechage groups will receive each the bronze medal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; tournaments, single-elimination brackets are used to determine the two athletes who will compete in the final for first and second place. The repechage bracket is built from athletes who were knocked out by the finalists and building brackets to determine third place.

Repechage addresses the possibility of two top competitors meeting in an early round, allowing the loser a chance to compete for a bronze medal.

===Quiz===

In ''[[University Challenge]]'', 28 teams compete in each season. Of the fourteen teams who lose in the first round, the four teams with the highest scores compete in the Highest Scoring Losers Play-Offs, with the two winners advancing to the second round.

===Rowing  ===
In [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], often only the first one or two boats in a race will qualify automatically for the next round, and the other boats race again in one or more repechage to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Competition Rowing | publisher = [[International Rowing Federation]] | url = http://www.worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=168 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101204080143/http://worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=168 | archivedate = 4 December 2010 | quote = Repechages – in cases of up to 24 entries in one boat class and in cases of 37 to 54 entries, every crew who has not qualified for the next round of racing in the heats has a second chance to advance through the repechages round.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conditions such as wind vary between the heats, often significantly affecting a competitor's time, and the repechage system allows the "fastest losers" to qualify irrespective of the variable conditions in the opening heats.

===Rugby ===
In [[rugby football|rugby]], the qualification processes for the [[Rugby Union World Cup]] and the [[Rugby League World Cup]] use a repechage system. The [[Air New Zealand Cup]], [[New Zealand]]'s domestic professional competition in Union, used the repechage in the [[2006 Air New Zealand Cup]], but scrapped it for the [[2007 Air New Zealand Cup]].

=== Sailing ===
A repechage stage in [[sailing]] is sometimes used in match-racing competition to allow teams finishing the round robin(s) just below the top-level teams a chance to advance to the quarter-final stage. This is standard competition for the Olympic-class events, such as the [[ISAF Sailing World Cup]].

=== Track and field athletics ===
In [[track and field|field athletics]], automatic qualification for the next round depends on meeting or surpassing a specified minimum result.  The remaining qualification spots (if any) are given in order to the best results.

In [[track and field|track athletics]], automatic qualification for the next round is given to the best competitors in each heat.  Other competitors with the best times may qualify for the next round indirectly as "fastest losers" as a result of the repechage.  If a particular heat was significantly faster than the others, repechage spots can be all taken by athletes from that heat.

== Alternatives ==
Alternatives to repechage include [[Single-elimination tournament|single elimination]], [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]], [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] and the [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system]].

'''''Sessão da Tarde''''' (English: '''''Afternoon Session''''') is a [[Brazil]]ian television program on [[Rede Globo]] that shows [[feature film|movies]] on Monday through Friday afternoons. It is one of the most enduring movie screenings. It launched on 5 March [[1974 in television|1974]].

==Opening theme==
* '''5 March 1974–1989:''' The first vignette has many pictures, and at the end the letters fly off the screen, setting up the logo. This was followed by an instrumental before the next vignette. During the 1989–1990 Christmas season, the block was temporarily replaced by ''Festival de Férias'' (''Holiday Festival'').
* '''1990–1999:''' In this opening a [[rainbow]] in the sky appears under the names that make up the logo (gold color) and at the end, the rainbow and the sky are transferred to a dark background and form the logo.
* '''1999–2004:''' The opening was updated: The rainbow was replaced by translucent colors. The clouds and the animation of the logo were redone. The first version aired from 1999 to 2000, the second version came up in 2004, with the logo looking like the Globo glass.
* '''2004–4 October 2013:''' The source became a translucent blue, while the logo's letters revolved around a rainbow in the sky. By forming the logo, the rainbow is combined with the first word.
* '''7 October 2013–Present:'''  The opening changed identity and arrangement. The lines of varying sizes are scattered and change the color of the background and at the end the bands form the new logo.

==Movies==
[[File:Sessão da Tarde.png|thumb|right|150px|alt=Logo used from 2004 to 2013.|2004–2013 logo]]
In general, the films presented are comedy, adventure and action. At one point the show presented all kinds of movies, but with the emergence of the [[Brazilian advisory rating system#Movies and TV programs|ClassInd system]], much of its heritage disappeared, as it can only show L- or 10-rated films. The classic movies of ''Sessão da Tarde'' are various, such as ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', ''[[La misma luna]]'', ''[[Matilda (1996 film)|Matilda]]'', ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'', ''[[Barbie as Rapunzel]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' and ''[[Ghost]]'', among many others.

On 28 November 2017, ''Sessão da Tarde'' aired its first 12-rated film, ''[[Addams Family Values]]'', but only on certain affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Júnior|first=Aloizio|date=28 November 2017|title=Globo escala pela primeira vez filme proibido para menores de 12 anos na Sessão da Tarde|url=http://www.otvfoco.com.br/globo-escala-pela-primeira-vez-filme-proibido-para-menores-de-12-anos-na-sessao-da-tarde/|language=Portuguese|work=Otvfoco.com.br|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2018, Globo affiliate [[RBS TV]] in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] aired the 14-rated film ''[http://globofilmes.globo.com/en/filme/otempoeovento/ O Tempo e o Vento]'' in ''Sessão da Tarde''{{'}}s time slot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expertplay.net/forum/topic/288433-ousada-sess%C3%A3o-da-tarde-exibe-seu-primeiro-filme-14-hoje-2009/|title=Ousada, Sessão da Tarde exibe seu primeiro filme +14 Hoje (20/09)|language=Portuguese|work=Expertplay.net|date=20 September 2018|accessdate=21 September 2018|quote=RBS TV vai fazer uma Sessão da Tarde Especial, para comemorar o feriado de 20 de setembro no estado do RS, vai exibir o filme O Tempo e o Vento protagonizado por Thiago Lacerda, classificação passou na chamada, 14 ANOS.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgslFiLtxmg|title=[RBS TV] - Chamada da "Sessão da Tarde Especial" com o filme "O Tempo e o Vento" - 20/09/2018|website=[[YouTube]]|date=20 September 2018|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rest of the country saw the 10-rated ''[[Playing House (2006 film)|Playing House]]''.

==Ratings==
Currently, across [[Brazil]] the movie session averages 15 points and 47% interest, and is the leader in its exhibition schedule. The audience demographic is mostly people between 25 and 49 years (37%), class C (53%) versus 24% of class A and B, and 23% of classes D and E. Most are women over 18, who make up 49% of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comercial.redeglobo.com.br/programacao_filme/sessaotarde_dados.php Media Data Session Afternoon]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shirley Valentine''''' is a one-character play by [[Willy Russell]].&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=THEATER; One Woman's Fling In 'Shirley Valentine'|first=Alvin|last=Klein|date=24 April 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/theater-one-woman-s-fling-in-shirley-valentine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Shirley Valentine (1989) Review/Film; Shirley Valentine Talks With Others|first=Caryn|last=James|date=30 August 1989|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE7D61F3AF933A0575BC0A96F948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the form of a [[monologue]] by a middle-aged, [[working class]] [[Liverpool]] [[housewife]], it focuses on her life before and after a transforming holiday abroad.

==Plot==
Wondering what has happened to her youth and feeling stagnant and in a rut, Shirley finds herself regularly alone and talking to the wall while preparing an evening meal of egg and chips for her emotionally distant husband. When her best friend offers to pay for a trip-for-two to [[Greece]], she packs her bags, leaves a note on the cupboard door in the kitchen, and heads for a fortnight of rest and relaxation. In Greece, with just a little effort on her part, she rediscovers everything she had been missing about her existence in England.  She finds so much happiness, in fact, that when the vacation is over she decides not to return, ditching her friend at the airport and going back to the hotel where she'd been staying to ask for a job and to live a newly self-confident life in which she is at last true to herself.

==Productions==
Commissioned by the [[Everyman Theatre, Liverpool|Everyman Theatre]] in [[Liverpool]], the play premiered in 1986, with [[Noreen Kershaw]] directed by Glen Walford. Two years later it opened in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]], with [[Pauline Collins]] directed by [[Simon Callow]]. After eight previews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, with Collins again directed by Callow, opened on 16 February 1989 at the [[Booth Theatre]], where it ran for 324 performances. [[Ellen Burstyn]] replaced Collins later in the run, and [[Loretta Swit]] starred in a US national tour in 1995.

From 26 March - 8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]], [[Meera Syal]] played Shirley in the production's first London West End revival. A West End transfer of the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] production ran at the [[Trafalgar Studios]] from 20 July - 30 October 2010. [[Meera Syal]] reprised her role as Shirley; this production was adapted and broadcast by BBC Radio Four in 2010 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wmxw3|title=Willy Russell - Shirley Valentine, Saturday Drama - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 30th Anniversary Tour, starring [[Jodie Prenger]] ran in the UK from March 2017 to November 2017. Prenger was met with rave reviews.

'''Spider-Man's wedding''' at [[Shea Stadium]] in 1987 was a [[publicity stunt]] and live performance adaptation of the comic book storyline "[[The Wedding! (comics)|The Wedding!]]" produced by [[Marvel Comics]]. The event was meant to advertise the special issue of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' comic book, which went on sale the next Tuesday and took place at home plate in front of more than 45,000 fans just before the New York Mets play the Pittsburgh Pirates.&lt;ref name=model&gt;{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Michael|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/02/style/spider-man-to-wed-model.html|title=Spider-Man to Wed Model|date= June 2, 1987|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gothamist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/08/21/video_when_spider-man_and_mary_jane.php|publisher=gothamist.com|title=Video: When Spider-Man And Mary Jane Got Hitched At Shea Stadium: Gothamist|accessdate=2017-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106043759/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/21/video_when_spider-man_and_mary_jane.php|archivedate=2017-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbnation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2012/3/23/2897287/when-spider-man-got-married-in-shea-stadium|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|title=When Spider-Man Got Married In Shea Stadium|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldtimefamilybaseball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldtimefamilybaseball.com/post/19778514207/great-moments-in-mets-history-or-the-time|publisher=Old Time Family Baseball|title=Great Moments in Mets History or: The Time Spider-man Married Mary Jane at Shea Stadium|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comicsalliance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/stan-lee-officiates-spider-man-and-mj-wedding-in-awesome-1987-fo/|website=comicsalliance.com|publisher=[[Comics Alliance]]|author=Nadel, Nick|title=Stan Lee Officiates Spider-Man and MJ Wedding In Awesome 1987 Footage|accessdate=2017-01-08|date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/VintageTube-Spider-Man-Shea-Stadium-and-Morgan?urn=mlb,84584|publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Reception==
Andy L.

'''The Best Coin Fold''' is the title of a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] (effect) which appeared in [[Jean Hugard]]'s book, ''Close Up Magic'', published in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;
''Close Up Magic'' by Jean Hugard (pp. 46 - 47)&lt;/ref&gt; A coin fold is an effect that involves the appearance of a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] folding a [[coin]] up within a piece of [[paper]] seemingly trapping the coin therein. The magician then causes the coin to vanish and (often) reappear elsewhere. Magic literature (within the [[20th century]]) contains numerous references to coin fold techniques and presentations. The "trick" is built around special procedures or techniques in folding the paper such that it appears that the coin is trapped, but in fact it easily slides out undetected by the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Lost World''''' is a 1992 film, based on the [[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)| book of the same name]] by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. The movie is set in [[Africa]] rather than the book's setting of [[South America]], and the character of [[Lord John Roxton]] has been replaced with a female character played by [[Tamara Gorski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lost World|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104759/|website=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was followed by a sequel the same year, '''''[[Return to the Lost World]]''''', with the same director and main cast.

== Plot ==
Set in 1912, the film opens on Edward Malone, a junior reporter looking for an adventurous assignment. Malone is sent to interview [[Professor Challenger]], an explorer and researcher who believes he is on the trail of the "lost world," a mysterious place in Central Africa. Challenger has a picture of a cliff and a strange beast resembling a [[pterodactyl]] that is his only evidence of the place.

The British scientific community finds his claims laughable. After receiving funding from the family of Jenny Nielson, a wildlife photographer and the daughter of a rich American contributor to the sciences, the "scientific community" agrees to organise an exploratory expedition under the leadership of the antagonistic Professor Summerlee. Summerlee agrees to Malone and Nielson coming on the expedition, but refuses to allow Challenger to be part of the expedition. With obvious reluctance, Challenger gives Summerlee a "map" to be opened at a road-end village in Africa at a particular date and time. The expedition departs. A newsboy associate of Malone named Jim stows away on the trip.

The expedition arrives in Africa where they are joined by a female guide named Malu and a Portuguese called Gomez. Summerlee opens the map from Challenger, finding it blank, at which point Challenger appears from nowhere leaving Summerlee no option but to accept his guidance on the exhibition. Under Challenger's guidance they find the cliff in the picture and reach the top, but Gomez (who turns out to be the brother of a Portuguese who was killed on Challenger's first journey here) strands them with no way back down. Exploring the Lost World to find another way home, the team finds dinosaurs, from a pair of [[Anatosaurus]] to a pterodactyl rookery.

Jim, Malone, and Malu narrowly avoid being eaten by a dinosaur (presumably a Herrerasaurus), only to find that their camp was attacked and the rest of the team is gone. The three discover a gathering of native tribesmen (painted with symbolic skeletons) who regularly sacrifice humans off a cliff to the carnivorous dinosaurs. While the 'skeleton men' sacrifice a man to a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', Malone distracts the tribe while the other explorers and captured natives escape, and they retreat to the safety of a second tribe nearby (who use clothes, not paint). During these events, Summerlee notes some oddities about the "ritual" vegetation necklaces that the sacrifices (themselves) were dressed in. The second tribe's members, through Malu's translation, tell the explorers about a time long ago when the shamans of their tribe convinced some to worship the carnivorous dinosaurs, splitting the tribe in two.

Summerlee deduces that the vegetation necklaces placed on the sacrifices provided some necessary nutrient or immunisation to the dinosaurs which had protected these dinosaurs from the extinction that the rest of the dinosaurs suffered globally (this being a theory Summerlee had espoused previously). The expedition team uses their modern knowledge and research to benefit the tribe with irrigation and horticultural benefits, to produce the antidote to a prehistoric plague. The skeleton tribe's leader is killed, and the two tribes reunite. The chief shows the team a hidden cave that will lead them back to their world, and has them promise that they will come back if they are ever needed.

Returning to the river, the team is ambushed by Gomez. Gomez is shot and wounded, but instead of killing him, Challenger leaves him behind, saying, "Let the jungle have him." Malu stays in Africa, and the others return home. The Royal Zoological Society in London rules that Challenger and Summerlee have insufficient evidence of their tale, until Jim reveals that he brought back a baby pterodactyl. The team is celebrated for their achievements, but when Malone, Jenny, and Jim discover the pterodactyl (named Percival), is unhappy being kept in a zoo, they release him, allowing him to fly back to the "lost world".

'''The Magic Circle''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[organisation]], dedicated to promoting and advancing the art of [[magic (illusion)|magic]].

Applicants must qualify for membership, either through a performance exam or by a written thesis on a branch of magic, after which they will be designated Member of the Magic Circle (M.M.C.) Further distinctions may earn them the title Associate of the Inner Magic Circle (A.I.M.C.), and Member of The Inner Magic Circle (M.I.M.C) a select group limited to 300 members. The Circle was founded in 1905, and was male-only until 1991. There is a junior branch, the Young Magicians Club, which gained popularity through the success of the [[Harry Potter]] franchise.

== History ==
[[File:Magic Circle Blue Plaque 2017.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Blue plaque]] commemorating the founding of the Magic Circle on the former Pinoli's in [[Wardour Street]]]]
[[File:Magic Circle staircase.jpg|thumb|upright|A staircase at the Magic Circle building]]
The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 after a meeting of 23 amateur and professional magicians at London's Pinoli's Restaurant. At this founders meeting, chaired by [[Servais Le Roy]], those present decided upon the name of the Society: it was initially felt that the name of the Society should be the Martin Chapender Club, in memory of the performer and founding member who had recently died at the age of twenty-five. However, it was then agreed that the name "Magic Circle" would be more appropriate and that this name shared the same initials as those of Martin Chapender.&lt;ref name="londonist"/&gt;

The first official meeting was at the Green Man [[public house]] in [[Soho]], but meetings were later in a room at [[St. George's Hall (London)|St George's Hall]] in Langham Place, where [[David Devant]] and [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] were regularly seen performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/06/magic-circle-magician-faq/ |title=Magic Circle Magician FAQ |first=Andi |last=Gladwin |authorlink=Andi Gladwin |date=June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devant became the first president of the Magic Circle, and in 1906, Maskelyne edited the first issue of ''The Magic Circular'' magazine, a regular feature for members ever since. The ''Magic Circular'' claims to be the longest-running regular magic magazine in conjuring history.

The club was male-only until 1991, when more than 75% of members voted to admit women. As of 2010 there were around eighty female members of the Magic Circle, including [[Paul Daniels]]' wife, [[Debbie McGee]].&lt;ref name="londonist"/&gt; In 2014, [[Megan Knowles-Bacon]] became the first female officer in the Magic Circle, as well as the youngest person to be elected as an officer; she was elected as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/11217461/Magic-Circle-elects-Megan-Knowles-Bacon-as-first-female-officer.html|title=Magic Circle elects Megan Knowles-Bacon as first female officer|date=7 November 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motto ==
The motto of the society is the Latin ''indocilis privata loqui'', roughly translated as "not apt to disclose secrets" (lit. "incapable [of] speaking [of] private [things]") ; members give their word not to wilfully disclose magic secrets other than to bona fide students of magic. Anyone breaking this or any other rule may be expelled.

== Headquarters ==
[[File:Houdini's cabinet.jpg|thumb|'[[Harry Houdini|Houdini']]s Cabinet' at The Magic Circle Museum, London]]
Since 1998, the Magic Circle building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venue.themagiccircle.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to The Magic Circle |publisher=The Magic Circle |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in central London near [[Euston Station]] in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] has been available for meetings and corporate entertainment. It was voted the UK's Number One Venue in the hospitality industry's Top 20 UK Venues poll 2008.

== Membership ==
Magicians who wish to join may spend up to two years as an Apprentice before applying for full membership.  They need to have known two current members for at least one year and must be at least 18 years old. These two members are then asked to act as sponsors, or referees, on the candidate's application form and propose them as a suitable candidate for membership. Following the receipt and processing of the application, the candidate is invited to an interview with the examinations secretary, usually at the London headquarters. If the candidate proves suitable and sufficiently knowledgeable a performance exam is scheduled or a thesis may be written. The exam takes place in front of a panel of judges, and candidates must demonstrate their skills to members in a rehearsed act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/attachments/193_193_GuideFullRevised.pdf|title=The Magic Circle guide to examinations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a thesis is chosen, it is read by two examiners and a copy is made available in the Magic Circle library. The final stage is by vote by members of the Council, who will approve the candidate as a member. Once the applicant is successful, they are free to call themselves "Members of the Society" and use the letters '''''M.M.C.''''' after their name.

Members of the Magic Circle include: [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Luis de Matos (magician)|Luis de Matos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ionline.pt/artigos/mais/magico-luis-matos-premiado-londres-pelo-the-magic-circle|title=ionline|website=ionline|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Vincent (magician)|Michael Vincent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c3qI4ijaP8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael+Vincent&amp;f=false|title=Circle Without End: The Magic Circle 1905-2005|first1=Edwin Alfred|last1=Dawes|first2=Michael|last2=Bailey|date=1 July 2005|publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themagiccircle.co.uk/news/716-dynamo-wins-best-entertainment-programme|title=Dynamo wins Best Entertainment Programme|website=themagiccircle.co.uk|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom London (magician)|Tom London]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/americas-got-talent-star-surprises-129383/|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Archer (magician)|John Archer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2009/06/10/huddersfield-magic-circle-to-celebrate-60th-anniversary-86081-23831071/|title=Huddersfield Magic Circle to celebrate 60th anniversary|date=10 June 2009|publisher=Huddersfield Daily Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members may take a further examination to achieve the degree of '''''Associate of the Inner Magic Circle'''''. The designation '''A.I.M.C.''' shows this higher membership.  The A.I.M.C. degree can also be attained through thesis, and in rare cases &amp;ndash; that is when a candidate gains 18 or higher out of a possible 20 marks in the written exam &amp;ndash; examinees taking the M.M.C. exam are awarded the A.I.M.C. degree. Those who attain an A.I.M.C. degree as a result of a performance examination are awarded the A.I.M.C. with silver star.

Within the society, there are a number of members never exceeding three-hundred known as the "'''Inner Magic Circle'''". Full membership of the Inner Magic Circle is denoted by the letters '''M.I.M.C.''' after the member's name. '''Membership of the Inner Magic Circle''' is by call of The Society's President. The M.I.M.C. degree may be awarded with a gold star, to signify that the recipient is a performer of magic (as opposed to e.g. an inventor, historian or noteworthy volunteer for the Society). The honour of a gold star does not necessarily signify the holder's excellence as a performer and not all recipients are performers of excellence.

Members must undertake not to reveal magic secrets to anyone except bona fide magicians, on pain of expulsion.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Sponsored by the Magic Circle, members of the Young Magicians Club meet for monthly workshops at the Magic Circle Headquarters, the 'Centre for the Magic Arts' in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magicweek.co.uk/magic_articles/article_young_magicians.htm |title=The Young Magicians Club |last=Thomson |first=Ian A. |date=July 2000  |work=MagicWeek |accessdate=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Young Magicians Club's principal means of communication among its members is its bi-monthly magazine ''Secrets''. The worldwide membership also communicates through a members-only on-line forum on the Young Magicians Club website.

Membership in The Young Magicians Club requires no interview or exam and is open to all young people interested in magic. There are monthly all-day workshops for members who come from all over the country to take part. Adult members of the Magic Circle take on the responsibility of instructing the members of the Young Magicians Club. Local adult magic clubs will often have a junior magicians club attached to them but The Young Magicians Club is the only such club associated with the Magic Circle. Members of the Young Magicians Club are eligible to join the Magic Circle at a reduced rate when they reach 18, but then they must complete the examination procedure for full membership.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Young Magicians Club holds their annual one-day convention every October called 'J-Day'. The convention includes lectures and the finals of two competitions with awards, which include the ''Home Counties Trophy'' for stage magic, ''The Mark Leveridge Cup'' for close-up magic, ''Kaymar Komedy Cup'' and the ''Peter McCahon Award for Originality''. In recent years, the celebrity guest lectures have been presented by [[Derren Brown]] in 2010, [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]] in 2011, [[John Archer (magician)|John Archer]] in 2012, [[Marvin Berglas]] in 2013, [[Luis de Matos (magician)|Luis De Matos]]  in 2014 and Dave Loosley and [[Andi Gladwin]] in 2015.

The popularity of the [[Harry Potter]] franchise was one of the key reasons for the organisation's growth this century with membership doubling after the announcement of the first film in 2001.&lt;ref name="potter"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' has been the subject of criticism from a variety of sources. Criticism has been aimed at the newspaper has been in response to individual controversial reporters, along with alleged [[Media bias in the United States|political bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Daniel Okrent]] |title=Is The New York Times a Liberal Newspaper?  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E7D8173DF936A15754C0A9629C8B63 |quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 25, 2004 |accessdate=September 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The New York Times'' used to have a public editor who acted as an [[ombudsman]] and "investigates matters of journalistic integrity".&lt;ref name="public"&gt;{{cite news |title=Margaret Sullivan |url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/shonda-rhimes-alessandra-stanley-margaret-sullivan-column/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body |quote=Margaret Sullivan is the fifth public editor appointed by The New York Times. ...

|quote= And who will be watching, on this subject or anything else, if they don’t acquit themselves well? At The Times, it won’t be the public editor. As announced on Wednesday, that position is being eliminated, making this my last column. Media pundits and many readers this week were questioning the decision to end this role, fearing that without it, no one will have the authority, insider perspective or ability to demand answers from top Times editors. There’s truth in that. But it overlooks a larger issue.

== Los Alamos investigation ==
In 1999, the ''Times'' ran a series of stories about alleged theft of classified documents from [[Los Alamos National Lab]] in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;James Risen and Jeff Gerth (March 6, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/06/world/breach-los-alamos-special-report-china-stole-nuclear-secrets-for-bombs-us-aides.html "BREACH AT LOS ALAMOS: A special report; China Stole Nuclear Secrets For Bombs, U.S. Aides Say" (includes extensive corrections)], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Risen (March 16, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/16/world/los-alamos-scientist-admits-contacts-with-chinese-us-says.html "Los Alamos Scientist Admits Contacts With Chinese, U.S. Says"], ''The New York Times'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Risen (April 11, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/11/world/fbi-searches-home-of-researcher-fired-from-los-alamos.html " F.B.I.

In 2008, the case was appealed to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] which refused to grant [[certiorari]], effectively leaving the dismissal in place.

In 2003, the ''Times'' admitted that [[Jayson Blair]], one of its reporters, had committed repeated [[Journalism scandals|journalistic fraud]] over a span of several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/national/11PAPE.html?ei=5070&amp;en=8dfc464a841fa742&amp;ex=1159243200&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position=|author1=Dan Barry |author2=David Barstow |author3=Jonathan D.

===Valerie Plame affair===
{{Main|Plame affair}}
In October 2005, ''Times'' reporter [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] was released from prison after 85 days, when she agreed to testify to [[special prosecutor]] [[Patrick Fitzgerald]]’s grand jury after receiving a personal waiver, both on the phone and in writing, of her earlier confidential source agreement with [[Lewis "Scooter" Libby]]. No other reporter whose testimony had been sought in the case had received such a direct and particularized release. Her incarceration has helped fuel an effort in Congress to enact a federal [[Shield laws in the United States|shield law]], comparable to the state shield laws which protect reporters in 31 of the 50 states. After her second appearance before the grand jury, Miller was released from her contempt of court finding. Miller resigned from the paper on November 9, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judithmiller.org/news/#76|author=Judith Miller|title=Judith Miller's Farewell|date=November 9, 2005|accessdate = November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CampusJ==
'''CampusJ Jewish Collegiate News''' was a website covering [[Judaism|Jewish]] news on college and university campuses with a network of student [[journalist]]s. In March 2005, CampusJ broke the story that ''[[The New York Times]]'' had negotiated a deal with [[Columbia University]] administrators to exclude student response in an article on [[academic bias]] in exchange for exclusive access to a report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/98317/columbia-and-new-york-times-rachel-zabarkes-friedman|title=Columbia and The New York Times|work=National Review|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CampusJ, part of the [[J-Blogosphere]], was launched in February 2005 by [[Editing#Executive editor|editor]] and publisher [[Steven I. Weiss]] of ''Canonist''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canonist.com Canonist website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The last posting was dated May 20, 2007. By 2008, the site appeared defunct, and many of the sections had no new content for months. CampusJ's staff of student reporters covered the Jewish news on thirty or more campuses, including [[American University]], [[George Washington University]], [[McGill University|McGill]], [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]], [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], by reporting for campus-specific school homepages ([[blogs]]).

==National Security Agency revelations delayed==
On December 16, 2005, a ''New York Times'' article revealed that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] had ordered the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to intercept telephone conversations between suspected terrorists in the U.S. and those in other countries without first obtaining court warrants for the surveillance, apparently in violation of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978]] (FISA) and without the knowledge or consent of the Congress.  A federal judge recently held that the plan revealed by the ''Times'' was unconstitutional, and hearings have been held on this issue in Congress. The article noted that reporters and editors at the ''Times'' had known about the intelligence-gathering program for approximately a year but had, at the request of White House officials, delayed publication to conduct additional reporting. The Justice Department has launched an investigation to determine the sources of the classified information obtained by the ''Times''. The men who reported the stories, [[James Risen]] and [[Eric Lichtblau]], won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for national reporting in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2006/national-reporting/|author=Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|title=2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners - NATIONAL REPORTING|publisher=''The Pulitzer Board''|date=2006|accessdate = November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the lapse in reporting [[Edward Snowden]] decided not to supply the ''New York Times'' with his information, choosing to go to the ''Guardian'' and ''Washington Post'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Times Editor: Losing Snowden Scoop 'Really Painful' |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/05/319233332/new-york-times-editor-losing-snowden-scoop-really-painful |quote=But Snowden already knew the one place he didn't trust: The New York Times.

==Terrorist Finance Tracking Program==
::[[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program#Controversy regarding The New York Times' decision to publish]]
Much controversy was caused when, on June 23, 2006, The Times (along with the [[Wall Street Journal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bank Records Secretly Tapped | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1065118181.html?dids=1065118181:1065118181&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Jun+23%2C+2006&amp;author=&amp;desc=Bank+Records+Secretly+Tapped | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Los Angeles Times : Page Not Found | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-swift23jun23,0,6482687.story | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) revealed the existence of the [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]], a [[CIA]]/[[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]] scheme to access transactional database of the [[Brussels]]-based [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] ("[[SWIFT]]"). In September 2006, the Belgian government declared that the SWIFT dealings with U.S. government authorities were, in fact, a breach of Belgian and European privacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

On December 22, 2006 at the request of the Bush Administration, the paper removed sections of an Op-Ed piece critical of the administration's policy towards [[Iran]] which contained publicly available information that Iran cooperated after the 9/11 attacks and offered to negotiate a diplomatic settlement in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/22/1447213|author=Democracy Now, Headlines|title=NYT Publishes White House-Redacted Op-Ed Critical of Iran Policy|date=December 22, 2006|publisher=''[[Democracy Now]]''|accessdate=December 22, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224143543/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F12%2F22%2F1447213|archivedate=December 24, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MoveOn.org ad controversy==
{{Main|MoveOn.org ad controversy}}
On Monday, September 10, 2007, the ''Times'' ran a full-page advertisement for [[MoveOn.org]] questioning the integrity of General [[David Petraeus]], the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, entitled "General Petraeus or General Betray Us?" The Times only charged [[MoveOn.org]], a liberal activist group, $65,000 for the advertisement that, according to public relations director Abbe Serphos, normally costs around $181,692, or roughly a 64% discount. Serphos declined to explain the discount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|newspaper=[[New York Post]] | title = Times Gives Lefties A Hefty Discount For &amp;#39;Betray Us&amp;#39; Ad   | url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09132007/news/nationalnews/times_gives_lefties_a_hefty_di.htm | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis denied the rate charged indicated a political bias and said it was the paper's policy not to disclose the rate paid by any advertiser. "We do not distinguish the advertising rates based on the political content of the ad," Mathis told [[Reuters]]. "The advertising folks did not see the content of the ad before the rate was quoted," she said, adding that there were over 30 different categories of ads with varying rates. Mathis confirmed the open rate for an ad of that size and type was around $181,000. Among reasons for lower rates are advertisers buying in bulk or taking a standby rate, she said. "There are many instances when we have published opinion advertisements that run counter to the stance we take on our own editorial pages," she said.

[[Jeff Jarvis]], a journalism professor who blogs on media at buzzmachine.com, said the key question for the Times was could any other political or advocacy group get the same rate under the same circumstances. "The quandary the Times gets stuck in is they don't want to admit you can buy an ad for that rate, no matter who you are," Jarvis said, noting that with print advertising revenues in newspapers generally decline to offer big discounts.

On a more general note, Jarvis said U.S. papers should emulate their counterparts in Britain where, for example, ''[[The Guardian]]'' makes no effort to hide its liberal stance. "In the U.S., I would argue newspapers should be more transparent and open about the views taken ... and The (New York) Times is liberal," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Advertising Age]] reported that "MoveOn bought its ad on a 'standby' basis, under which it can ask for a day and placement in the paper but doesn't get any guarantees." A subsequent full-page ad bought by [[2008 Republican presidential candidates|Republican presidential hopeful]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] to rebut MoveOn.org's original ad was purchased at the same standby rate. [http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=120480]  MoveOn later paid ''The Times'' the full rate once the newspaper publicly acknowledged that "an advertising sales representative made a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Corporate-influence concerns==
In their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|Manufacturing Consent]]'', [[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] analyze a variety of major U.S. media outlets, with an emphasis on ''The Times''. They conclude that a bias exists which is neither [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] nor [[Conservatism|conservative]] in nature, but aligned towards the interests of [[Multinational corporations|corporate conglomerates]], which own most of these media outlets and also provide the majority of their advertising revenue. The authors explain that this bias functions in all sorts of ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Herman%20/Manufac_Consent_Prop_Model.html|title=Manufacturing Consent: A Propaganda Model: excerpted from the book|accessdate=March 20, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314235027/http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Herman%20/Manufac_Consent_Prop_Model.html|archivedate=March 14, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...by selection of topics, by distribution of concerns, by emphasis and framing of issues, by filtering of information, by bounding of debate within certain limits. They determine, they select, they shape, they control, they restrict — in order to serve the interests of dominant, elite groups in the society."&lt;ref name="Chomsky1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1992----02.htm|title=Excerpts from Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky interviewed by various interviewers|accessdate=2006-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721164116/http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1992----02.htm|archivedate=2006-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chomsky and Herman also touch on the specific importance this perceived bias has in ''The Times'', saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...history is what appears in ''The New York Times'' archives; the place where people will go to find out what happened is ''The New York Times''. Therefore it's extremely important if history is going to be shaped in an appropriate way, that certain things appear, certain things not appear, certain questions be asked, other questions be ignored, and that issues be framed in a particular fashion."&lt;ref name="Chomsky1992"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Duke University lacrosse case reporting==
{{Main|2006 Duke University lacrosse case}}
In their 2007 book ''Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustice of the Duke Lacrosse Case'', [[KC Johnson]] and [[Stuart Taylor, Jr.]] sharply criticize The New York Times for their editorial judgment and its effect on the case investigation.  It claims that the original reports by Joe Drape tended to exonerate the accused players, which contradicted Times' editorial stance.  This led to Drape's quick dismissal and replacement by Duff Wilson who took a pro prosecution stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Also covering the case, sports writer Selena Roberts, made assertions, that "Something happened March 13." Furthermore, Roberts writes, “Players have been forced to give up their DNA, but to the dismay of investigators, none have come forward to reveal an eyewitness account.”  Johnson points out that this statement was not true.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  The captains’ March 28, 2006 statement or examined the defense attorneys’ subsequent press conference both described the captains’ cooperation with police, occurred before she penned her column.

[[Daniel Okrent]], former Times ombudsman admitted to the bias in the Times coverage of the case. He said, "It was too delicious a story.  It conformed too well to too many preconceived notions of too many in the press:  white over black, rich over poor, athletes over non-athletes, men over women, educated over non-educated.  Wow.  That's a package of sins that really fit the preconceptions of a lot of us."&lt;ref&gt;http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4379&lt;/ref&gt;

==John McCain-lobbyist article criticism==
{{See also|John McCain lobbyist controversy, February 2008}}

The February 21, 2008 ''The New York Times'' published an article on [[John McCain]]'s alleged relationship with lobbyist [[Vicki Iseman]] and other involvement with special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = For McCain, Self-Confidence on Ethics Poses Its Own Risk - New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/us/politics/21mccain.html | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | date = 2008 | work=The New York Times | first1=Jim | last1=Rutenberg | first2=Marilyn W. | last2=Thompson | first3=David D. | last3=Kirkpatrick | first4=Stephen | last4=Labaton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article received a widespread criticism among both liberals and conservatives, McCain supporters and non-supporters as well as [[talk radio]] personalities. [[Robert S. Bennett]], whom McCain had hired to represent him in this matter, defended McCain's character. Bennett, who was the special investigator during the [[Keating Five]] scandal that ''The Times'' revisited in the article, said that he fully investigated McCain back then and suggested to the [[Senate Ethics Committee]] to not pursue charges against McCain.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And if there is one thing I am absolutely confident of, it is John McCain is an honest and honest man. I recommended to the Senate Ethics Committee that he be cut out of the case, that there was no evidence against him, and I think for the New York Times to dig this up just shows that Senator McCain's public statement about this is correct. It's a smear job. I'm sorry.

Former staffer to President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] campaigner [[Lanny Davis]] said the article "had no merit." Stating that he did not support McCain's bid for the White House, Davis, who had himself lobbied for the same cause Iseman lobbied McCain for, said that McCain only wrote a letter to the FCC to ask them to "act soon" and refused to write a letter that supported the sale of the television station the article talked about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = McCain disputes report of lobbyist relationship | url=http://washingtontimes.com/article/20080222/NATION/813344605/1002| accessdate = February 25, 2008 | date = February 22, 2008 |publisher = The Washington Times|author1=Ralph Z.

[[Tom Rosenstiel]], the director of the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]], suggested that the article does not make clear the nature of McCain's alleged "inappropriate" behavior: "The phrasing is just too vague."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sign Up | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-media22feb22,1,2442135.story?page=2&amp;cset=true&amp;ctrack=8 | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was later criticized by the [[White House]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=White House Accuses NYT of Anti-GOP Bias | url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iG-8I87S5w4QP8CPIrx2wh8irqmgD8UVVVBO0 | work=[[Associated Press]] | accessdate=February 24, 2008 | date=2008 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by several news organizations including the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Follow the innuendo | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/23/EDGOV6TOM.DTL | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] raised the question about why the paper had endorsed McCain on January 25, 2008 for the Republican nomination if they had information that alleged an inappropriate relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331867,00.html | title = Did The New York Times Smear John McCain? | date = February 22, 2008 | author = Bill O'Reilly | publisher = Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'', owned by the ''Times'', declined to publish the story, choosing instead to run a version of the same story written by the competing Washington Post staff. That version focused almost exclusively on the pervasive presence of lobbyists in McCain's campaign and did not mention the sexual relationship that the Times article hinted at.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Top of the Ticket : Los Angeles Times : Boston Globe declines to publish parent paper's McCain story | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/02/maybe.html | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the criticism, the ''Times'' editor [[Bill Keller]] was "surprised by the volume" and "by how lopsided the opinion was against our decision [to publish the article]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Howard Kurtz - N.Y.

In September 2008, a McCain senior aide ([[Steve Schmidt]]) charged: "Whatever The New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization. It is a pro-Obama advocacy organization that every day impugns the McCain campaign, attacks Sen. McCain, attacks Gov. Palin. ... Everything that is read in The New York Times that attacks this campaign should be evaluated by the American people from that perspective."

In December 2008, Iseman filed a sued ''The New York Times'', alleging that the paper had defamed her by, in her view, falsely implying that she had an illicit romantic relationship with McCain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Paul |last1=Fletcher |first2=Alan |last2=Cooper |title=Lobbyist Vicki Iseman files $27M suit against New York Times |url=http://www.valawyersweekly.com/weeklyedition/2008/12/30/lobbyist-vicki-iseman-files-27m-suit-against-new-york-times/ |work=[[Virginia Lawyers Weekly]] |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105043018/http://www.valawyersweekly.com/weeklyedition/2008/12/30/lobbyist-vicki-iseman-files-27m-suit-against-new-york-times/# |archive-date=January 5, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, the suit "was settled without payment and ''The Times'' did not retract the article."&lt;ref name="LibelSuit"&gt;[[Richard Pérez-Peña]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/business/media/20lawsuit.html Libel Suit Against The Times Ends], ''New York Times'' (February 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, however, ''The Times'' agreed to publish a statement from Iseman's lawyers on the ''Times'' website.&lt;ref name="LibelSuit"/&gt;

The newspaper had wrong dates for historic events; gave incorrect information about Cronkite’s work, his colleagues and his program’s ratings; misstated the name of a news agency, and misspelled the name of a satellite. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=August 1, 2009 |accessdate=August 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times printed a correction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An appraisal on Saturday about Walter Cronkite’s career included a number of errors. In some copies, it misstated the date that the Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] Jr. was killed and referred incorrectly to Mr. Cronkite’s coverage of D-Day. Dr. King was killed on April 4, 1968, not April 30. Mr. Cronkite covered the D-Day landing from a warplane; he did not storm the beaches. In addition, [[Neil Armstrong]] set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, not July 26. “[[The CBS Evening News]]” overtook “[[The Huntley-Brinkley Report]]” on NBC in the ratings during the 1967-68 television season, not after Chet Huntley retired in 1970. A communications satellite used to relay correspondents’ reports from around the world was [[Telstar]], not Telestar. [[Howard K. Smith]] was not one of the CBS correspondents Mr. Cronkite would turn to for reports from the field after he became anchor of “[[The CBS Evening News]]” in 1962; he left CBS before Mr. Cronkite was the anchor. Because of an editing error, the appraisal also misstated the name of the news agency for which Mr. Cronkite was Moscow bureau chief after [[World War II]]. At that time it was [[United Press]], not [[United Press International]].&lt;ref name=signature/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An earlier contentious wording was on September 5, 2005 in an article on [[Hurricane Katrina]] where she wrote "Fox's Geraldo Rivera did his rivals one better: yesterday, he nudged an Air Force rescue worker out of the way so his camera crew could tape him as he helped lift an older woman in a wheelchair to safety." The Times later acknowledged that no nudge was visible on the broadcast tape.&lt;ref name=cjr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/regret_the_error/wrong_wrong_wrong_wrong_wrong.php |title=Wrong, Wrong, Wrong, Wrong, Wrong, Wrong |accessdate=July 27, 2009 |author=[[Craig Silverman]] |date=July 24, 2009 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |quote=In fairness, I’ll emphasize that the story’s seventh mistake was the result of an editing error.

==Story about fathers==
In 2017, the ''New York Times'' was criticized for an article, headlined "How Vital Are Women? This Town Found Out as They Left to March," about fathers from [[Montclair, New Jersey]] who looked after their children while their wives participated in the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]]. To some, the article "seemed to reinforce three old-fashioned tropes about gender and parenting: Men can’t handle parenting tasks; men who manage to handle the basics of parenting are exceptional and worthy of a news story; and parenting is fundamentally the work of women."&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite news |last=Peck|first=Emily |date= January 23, 2017  |title=New York Times Apologizes For Much-Ridiculed Story About Fathers |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ny-times-fathers-womens-march_us_5886346be4b0e3a7356a7295 |newspaper=The Huffington Post |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The freelance writer who wrote the story apologized, and the Metro section editor stated: "It was a bad idea from the get-go. It was conceived with the best intentions, but it fell flat. And I regret it."&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt;

==China==
Quotation symbols were put around "terrorist" by the New York Times when describing the [[2014 Kunming attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheehan |first=Matt |date= March 3, 2014  |title=Chinese Netizens Lash Out At U.S. For Downplaying Severity Of Deadly Knife Attack |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/03/china-knife-attack_n_4887500.html |newspaper=The Huffington Post |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdated figures about the carbon output of China were used by the New York Times in a 2015 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=West|first=James |date=November 4, 2015 |title=Sorry, New York Times: Your Big China Story is "Old News." |url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/11/sorry-new-york-times-your-big-china-story-old-news |newspaper=Mother Jones |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
{{See Also|Anti-Indian sentiment#New York Times}}
The newspaper's coverage of India has been heavily criticized by [[Sumit Ganguly]], a professor of [[political science]], for its "hectoring" and "patronizing" tone towards India. He finds anti-India bias in coverage of the [[Kashmir Conflict]], the [[Hyde Act]] and other India-related matters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/21/new-york-times-india-clinton-climate-nuclear-opinions-contributors-sumit-ganguly.html Hillary, India And 'The New York Times'], [[Sumit Ganguly]], [[Forbes]] Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Similar charges of racism against Indians have been levelled at the ''[[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;

United States lawmaker [[Kumar P. Barve]] described a recent editorial on India as full of "blatant and unprofessional factual errors or omissions" and having a "haughty, condescending, arrogant and patronizing" tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/indianamerican-lawmaker-blasts-nyt-for-antiindia-editorial/492140/|title=Indian-American lawmaker blasts NYT for anti-India editorial|date=July 21, 2009|publisher=The Indian Express Limited|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, The New York Times published a cartoon showing a [[Stereotypes of South Asians|stereotypical Indian]] turban-wearing man with a cow knocking at the door of an "elite space club".

== Yorkshire ==
In 2018 the New York Times came under criticism, including from the tourist office of the city of [[York]], for describing [[Yorkshire pudding]] as a "large, fluffy pancake" and recommending it be served with "syrup, preserves, confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar". A presenter for the BBC stated that the Yorkshire pudding's history was longer than that of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Times thinks Yorkshire pudding is a dessert|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44123786|date=May 15, 2018|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing leaked photos from the Manchester bombing==
On May 24, 2017, ''The New York Times'' caused outrage among the British police and government when it published leaked photos showing the scene of the [[2017 Manchester Arena bombing]]. Counter terror police chiefs said the leak undermined their investigation and victims' and witnesses' confidence. ''The New York Times'' published photos it says were gathered by UK authorities at the scene of the attack, including the remnants of a backpack, nuts and screws, and a device identified as a "possible detonator". [[Greater Manchester Police]] were said to be "furious" and said they would stop sharing information with the US.  [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] the next day in a [[NATO]] summit condemned the media leaks, calling it "deeply troubling" and a "grave threat to our national security". ''The New York Times'' defended its decision to publish the photos, saying they were "neither graphic nor disrespectful of victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40048565|title=Manchester attack: Trump condemns media leaks|date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40038630|title=Manchester attack: 'Fury' at US 'evidence' photos leak|date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi ==
Caliphate, a podcast for the New York Times, has received numerous criticism after [[Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi]] admitted on the podcast that he “murdered people” while he was fighting for the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Buller|first1=Alice|title=New York Times podcast ‘Caliphate’ faces backlash over ethics|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1315651/media|newspaper=[[Arab News]]|date=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous conservatives called for action against him after his statement, including [[Candice Bergen (politician)|Candice Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Conservative MPs call for action on self-described terror recruit for Daesh reportedly in Toronto|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/05/11/conservative-mps-call-for-action-on-self-described-terror-recruit-for-daesh-reportedly-in-toronto.html|publisher=[[The Canadian Press]]|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She criticized the liberal government after not ordering law enforcement against him. Bergen also called for Public Safety Minister [[Ralph Goodale]] to reveal whether the government knows where he is or not, but Goodale stated that it was the “opposition of keeping Canadians safe”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1= Khandaker|first1=Tamara|title= Politicians are freaking out over a podcast about returned Canadian ISIS fighter|url=|publisher=[[Vice News]]|date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huzaifa also received concerns from television journalist [[Diana Swain]] that he may be “lying” to [[The New York Times]] or [[CBC News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Swain|first1=Diana|title=Did former Canadian ISIS member lie to the New York Times or to CBC News?|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/isis-abu-huzaifa-investigators-1.4669769|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusation of homophobia==
After the ''Times'' tweeted a cartoon portraying Trump and Putin as a gay lovers, [[LGBT]] activist and Democratic Rep. [[Brian Sims]] said it's time to stop the [[homophobic]] jokes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44859358 'Homophobic' jokes about Trump and Putin criticised by LGBT campaigners].

July 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; American transgender activist [[Jeffrey Marsh]] said "to have a group that's as well-established as The New York Times personally attacking you feels horrendous."&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

'''''Toren''''' is a 2015 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[puzzle video game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation 4]], developed by Swordtales and published by [[Versus Evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://g1.globo.com/tecnologia/games/noticia/2015/04/game-brasileiro-toren-chega-em-12-de-maio-para-ps4-e-pc.html |title=Game brasileiro 'Toren' chega em 12 de maio para PS4 e PC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by games such as ''[[Ico]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''Toren'' was the first game funded by Brazilian government's public tax credit, through [[Rouanet Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/entretenimento/noticia/2015/05/primeiro-jogo-financiado-pela-lei-rouanet-gaucho-toren-sera-lancado-em-12-de-maio-4753549.html |title=Primeiro jogo financiado pela Lei Rouanet, gaúcho "Toren" será lançado em 12 de maio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In ''Toren'', the player controls the Moonchild, a girl born in a magic tower, and who has the goal to reach the top of it. The game begins with her as a baby; she grows up and develops as she goes up the tower's levels, solving puzzles and avoiding traps until defeating the dragon that lives at the top of the tower. Moonchild has visions about a wizard, her own origin and tower's nature.

== Development ==
''Toren'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "[[tower]]") started development in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://br.ign.com/brasil/3789/interview/superproducao-brasileira-game-toren-e-lancado-apos |title=Superprodução brasileira, game Toren é lançado após quatro anos de desenvolvimento}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swordtales' staff pledged funding by the [[Rouanet Law]] in 2013, achieving [[Brazilian real|R$]]75 thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geracaogamer.com/2015/04/20/o-primeiro-game-aprovado-na-lei-rouanet-nao-foi-toren-mas-sim-game-comix/ |title=O primeiro game aprovado na Lei Rouanet não foi Toren, mas sim Game Comix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law began to award electronic game cultural projects in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/tec/2013/08/1324415-game-toren-levanta-r-40-mil-pela-lei-rouanet-meta-e-arrecadar-370-mil.shtml |title=Game "Toren" levanta R$ 75 mil pela Lei Rouanet; meta é arrecadar 370 mil - 12/08/2013 - Tec - Folha de S.Paulo |website=www1.folha.uol.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total budget of the game was R$350,000, the rest of the money being funded by sponsors.

== Reception ==
''Toren'' was met with a mixed reception by the video game press. The ambiance "full of symbolism and mysticism" were praised but the game's problematic controls, camera angles and bugs were criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://overloadr.com.br/analises/2015/05/analise-toren/ «Análise - Toren»].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcgamer.com/toren-reivew/ «Toren review»].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/toren-review/1900-6416133/ «Toren Review»].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Video game reviews
