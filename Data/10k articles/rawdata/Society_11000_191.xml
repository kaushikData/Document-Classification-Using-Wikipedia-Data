'''Attiya Dawood''' ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: عطیہ داؤد b. April 1, 1958&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iefsindh.org/governing-body/113-attiya-dawood-member|title=Attiya Dawood (Member)|last=User|first=Super|website=www.iefsindh.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] poet, writer, feminist and activist. She was born in Moledino Larik (a small village in [[Naushahro Feroze District|Naushero Feroze]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]])&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.t2f.biz/in-their-own-voice-attiya-dawood/|title=T2F » In Their Own Voice: Attiya Dawood|website=www.t2f.biz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/517294|title=URDU LITERATURE: Story of a lifetime|date=2010-01-31|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has been hailed as one of the most important feminist Sindhi writers of her time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dawood uses her poetry to highlight the oppression of women in Pakistani society in the name of tradition. She has been writing poetry since 1980.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Attiya Dawood moved to [[Karachi]] in 1975, and has been writing [[poetry]] regularly since 1980.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her father was a school teacher, a poet and a [[Hafiz (Quran)|Hafiz]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1074991|title=Diary of a six-year-old's pastoral experiences|last=Baloch|first=Saher|date=2013-12-19|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She changed her name from Attiya Larik to Attiya Dawood in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her first poem, published in a Sindhi-language newspaper, received a negative reaction from her brothers; as a result she changed her name.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Dawood's biography ''Ainay kay Saamnay'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2009. An earlier version was published in [[Hindi]] in [[India]] in 2000 by Rajkamal Prakashan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Dawood wrote the story of her life during a residency at the Sanskriti Kendra in [[New Delhi]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; an institution that supports artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskritifoundation.org/kendra.htm|title=Sanskriti Kendra|website=www.sanskritifoundation.org|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ritabanerjisblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/94/|title=Rebellion in Writing: Pakistani Author Attiya Dawood|date=2010-11-12|work=REVOLUTIONS IN MY SPACE: A BLOG BY RITA BANERJI|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected works ==
Attiya Dawood has numerous publications to her credit. She writes mostly in [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. She draws inspiration from her traumatic girlhood experiences in rural Sindh.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whoiswhoinpakistan.blogspot.com/2010/12/attiya-dawood.html|title=Who is who in Pakistan: Attiya Dawood|last=Editor|first=Chief|date=2010-12-05|website=Who is who in Pakistan|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her poems have been translated into [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/in/lp/prj/ptp/dic/en15026992.htm|title=Poets translating Poets - Poets - Goethe-Institut|website=www.goethe.de|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her poetry is noted for its sincerity and zeal.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.ws/attiyadawood/index-2.html|title=Attiya Dawood &amp; Her Writings: Feminist writings by Pakistan's leading activist-poet|website=www.geocities.ws|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4433">'''Bzhedug''' or '''Bazdug''' ({{lang-ady|Бжъэдыгъу}}, ''Bz̄edyğw'', {{IPA-ady|bʐadəʁʷ}}; {{lang-ru|Бжедуги}}, {{lang|ru-latn|Bžedugi}}) are one of the 12 tribal divisions of the [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] [[Circassians]].

Many of them immigrated to Turkey in the 1860s, but there is still a community of Bzhedug on the left bank of the [[Kuban River]] (in the vicinity of [[Krasnodar]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rywkin &amp; Wixman, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The Bzhedug people live in [[Adygea]] and [[Krasnodar Krai]], and are well represented in the Adyghe (Circassian) diaspora in all countries of residence. Even in ancient times the Bzhedug people were divided into four tribes.

==History==
The Bzhedugs originally lived in the area of Shahe River, between [[Tuapse]] and [[Sochi]]. Later they divided in two groups: those who lived close to the [[Black Sea]] (Abhiaskis) and Adygeans (territory of Kuban River). This migration was causes by overpopulation and warlike neighbors to their Black Sea’s territories. Bzhedug were subdivided into Chechenay tribe ([[Psekups River]] and [[Pshish River]]) and the Hamish tribe ([[Afips River]] and Psekups River). They were involved in cattle breeding and agriculture, growing mostly crops and corn. 

==Language==
{{Main|Bzhedug Adyghe Dialect}}
The Bzhedugs people speak a dialect ({{lang-ady|Бжъэдыгъубзэ}}, ''Bz̄edyğwbze'') of the [[Adyghe language]].

==Bzhedug villages in Adigey==

There are 48 Circassian villages in [[Republic of Adygea]], 26 of which are Bzhedug villages (54% of the villages in Adygea).

Some may have a secondary role as an entertainer.&lt;ref name=LAT2010/&gt; Examples of celebrity doctors include [[Mehmet Oz|Dr. Oz]], [[Drew Pinsky|Dr. Drew]], [[Andrew Weil|Dr. Weil]] and [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]].

==Media==

A "celebrity doctor" is a medical professional noted for appearances on television, the internet and social media, books, and speaking engagements.&lt;ref name=LAT2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jameson|first1=Marni|title=The cult of celebrity doctors|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/14/health/la-he-celeb-docs-20100614|work=Los Angeles Times|date=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JGIM2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cifu|first1=AS|title=Why Dr. Oz makes us crazy.|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=February 2014|volume=29|issue=2|pages=417–8|pmid=24197635|pmc=3912308|doi=10.1007/s11606-013-2646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |title = On Dr Oz in 2016
 |quote = "He's operating both as an M.D., somebody who's on the faculty at Columbia University, one of the most respected universities in the world, and at the same time is operating as essentially a businessman and an entertainer. And he's delivering non-fact-based, non-evidence-based medical advice. I mean that is the definition of quackery.  &lt;p&gt;...I think he has changed the balance of his presentation on the show and probably deserves some credit for that, but that doesn't change the inherent conflict."

For many years, doctors such as [[Everett Koop]], [[Benjamin Spock]] and [[Ruth Westheimer]] gave advice on the radio, on television, and in books.&lt;ref name=LAT2010/&gt;

With the growth of the internet and social media, medical professionals had more places to reach the public, especially with messages alternative to mainstream medical advice.&lt;ref name=LAT2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=PhysWeek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gumpert|first1=David E.|title=Dr. Weil, Heal Thyself|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-03-27/dr-dot-weil-heal-thyself|work=Bloomberg News|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrity doctors are part of a "healthcare/media complex" that constantly seeks new attention of consumers in the [[24 hour news cycle]] with catchy content about health in order to achieve and maintain high rankings, which media channels can then monetize.&lt;ref name=JGIM2014/&gt; There is a conflict between their roles and responsibilities as medical doctors, and their roles as business people and entertainers.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|title=Despite Controversy, Dr. Oz Maintains Wide Appeal|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/15/494127905/despite-controversy-dr-oz-maintains-wide-appeal|work=National Public Radio: All Things Considered|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplementing Their Income|url=https://cspinet.org/new/200601241.html|publisher=Center for Science in the Public Interest|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers generally trust that the content they receive from celebrity doctors is valid due to their credentials and their fame. Content may be exaggerated and simplified by the need to gain and keep the public's attention, and is often general and may not be applicable to an individual receiving the content.&lt;ref name=LAT2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=JGIM2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=PhysWeek&gt;{{cite news|last1=Girgis|first1=Linda|title=The Cult of Dr. Oz Crumbles|publisher=Physician's Weekly|date=May 8, 2015|url=http://www.physiciansweekly.com/the-cult-of-dr-oz-crumbles/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=C2C&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoffman|first1=Steve|last2=Belluz|first2=Julia|title=Why celebrities and TV doctors can be bad for your health|url=http://www.c2cjournal.ca/2013/01/why-celebrities-and-tv-doctors-can-be-bad-for-your-health/|publisher=C2C Journal|date=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of conflicts of interest becomes especially acute if a celebrity doctor endorses some specific product or approach to health when they deliver content about health, and also sells related products.&lt;ref name=PhysWeek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stetka|first1=Bret|title=Do Vitamins and Supplements Make Antidepressants More Effective?|journal=Scientific American|date=April 26, 2016|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-vitamins-and-supplements-make-antidepressants-more-effective/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Oz controversy raises questions about celebrity doctor endorsements|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/jun-19-2014-1.2907967/dr-oz-controversy-raises-questions-about-celebrity-doctor-endorsements-1.2907968|work=The Current with Anna Maria Tremonti|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scammers Use Celebrity Doctors to Target Consumers|url=http://www.bbb.org/northwest/news-events/news-releases/2016/03/scammers-use-celebrity-doctors-to-target-consumers/|publisher=Better Business Bureau|date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the content is dangerous because people who are sick waste time following poor or irrelevant advice and their illness advances and becomes more difficult to manage.&lt;ref name=PhysWeek/&gt;

[[File:Nm toronto metro toronto convention centre.jpg|thumb|[[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]], late 2004]]
A '''convention''', in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some common interest. The most common conventions are based upon [[industry]], [[profession]], and [[fandom]]. [[Trade convention]]s typically focus on a particular industry or industry segment, and feature keynote speakers, vendor displays, and other information and activities of interest to the event organizers and attendees. [[Professional]] conventions focus on issues of concern along with advancements related to the profession. Such conventions are generally organized by societies or communities dedicated to promotion of the topic of interest. [[Fan convention]]s usually feature displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities. [[Science fiction convention]]s traditionally partake of the nature of both professional conventions and fan conventions, with the balance varying from one to another. Conventions also exist for various hobbies, such as [[Role-playing game|gaming]] or [[model railroad]]s.

Conventions are often planned and coordinated, often in exacting detail, by professional [[meeting and convention planner]]s, either by staff of the convention's hosting company or by outside specialists. Most large cities will have a [[convention center]] dedicated to hosting such events. The term [[Meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions|MICE]]—meetings Incentives Conventions and Exhibitions—is widely used in Asia as a description of the industry. The Convention ("C") is one of the most dynamic elements in the M.I.C.E. segment. The industry is generally regulated under the tourism sector.

In the technical sense, a convention is a meeting of delegates or representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 7|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1947 [[Newfoundland National Convention]] is a classic example of a state-sponsored political convention. More often, organizations made up of smaller units, chapters, or lodges, such as [[labor unions]], [[list of honorary societies|honorary societies]], and [[fraternities and sororities]], meet as a whole in convention by sending delegates of the units to deliberate on the organization's common issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|pp = 600–601}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to a [[political convention]], though in modern times the common issues are limited to selecting a [[political party|party]] candidate or [[party]] chairman. In this technical [[sense]], a [[congress]], when it consists of representatives, is a convention. The [[British House of Commons]] is a convention, as are most other houses of a modern representative [[legislature]]. The [[National Convention]] or just "Convention" in [[France]] comprised the [[constitution]]al and legislative [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] which sat from September 20, 1792 to October 26, 1795. The governing bodies of religious groups may also be called conventions, such as the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention of the Episcopal Church USA]] and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].

Many [[sovereign state]]s have provisions for conventions besides their permanent legislature. The [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States of America]] has a provision for the calling of a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], whereby delegates of the states are summoned to a special meeting to amend or draft the [[constitution]]. This process has never occurred, save for the original drafting of the constitution, although it almost happened in several cases. The US Constitution also has provisions for constitutional amendments to be approved by state conventions of the people. This occurred to ratify the original constitution and to adopt the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|twenty-first amendment]], which ended [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]].

''Con'' is a common abbreviation for convention, and some conventions (such as [[DEF CON]] and [[Gen Con]]) use it in their names.

== Co-located conventions ==
When two or more conventions are held at the same place and time they are '''co-located'''. Co-located conventions are usually in related industries.

Observers maintain that '''[[political corruption|corruption]] in Paraguay''' remains a major impediment to the emergence of stronger democratic institutions and sustainable economic development in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=crs&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34180.pdf "Paraguay: Background and U.S. Relations"]. Olhero, Nelson &amp; Mark P. Sullivan. [[Congressional Research Service]] (September 20, 2007). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Present situation ==
President [[Nicanor Duarte]]'s measures to combat corruption have included increased penalties for [[tax evasion]] and other measures to increase tax revenue, greater oversight of government spending, and a crackdown on the trade of [[contraband]] and [[counterfeit]] goods.&lt;ref name=crs/&gt; 

He also removed members of the [[Supreme Court of Paraguay|Supreme Court]] after corruption allegations surfaced against them.&lt;ref name=crs/&gt;  

Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 123rd place out of 176 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2016|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This ranking was an improvement from 2004 when the country was classified among the six most corrupt countries in the world and the second most corrupt in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=crs/&gt; The opposition, however, has claimed that anti-corruption efforts have not been far-reaching enough because they have not addressed the clientelism that is pervasive in Paraguayan politics or the dominance of the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] in governmental institutions.&lt;ref name=crs/&gt;

'''Crime in the United States''' has been recorded since colonization. [[Crime rates]] have varied over time, with a sharp rise after 1963, reaching a broad peak between the 1970s and early 1990s.

Statistics on specific crimes are indexed in the annual [[Uniform Crime Reports]] by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and by annual [[National Crime Victimization Survey]]s by the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]].&lt;ref name="cius2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011 |title=Crime in the United States |year=2011 |publisher=FBI |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the primary Uniform Crime Report known as ''Crime in the United States'', the FBI publishes annual reports on the status of [[law enforcement in the United States]].&lt;ref name="ucr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr |title=Uniform Crime Reports |publisher=FBI |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's definitions of specific crimes are considered standard by many American law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html?_r=0 |title=U.S. to Expand its Definition of Rape in Statistics |author = Charlie Savage | date=January 6, 2012 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FBI, [[index crime]] in the United States includes violent crime and property crime.&lt;ref name="ucrdatatool"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/ |title=Uniform Crime Reports Data Tool |publisher=FBI |accessdate=May 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703191609/http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/ |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent crime consists of four criminal offenses: [[homicide|murder and non-negligent manslaughter]], [[rape]], [[robbery]], and [[aggravated assault]]; property crime consists of [[burglary]], [[larceny]], [[motor vehicle theft]], and [[arson]].&lt;ref name="ucrdatatool"/&gt;

==Crime over time==

In the long term, violent crime in the United States has been in decline since colonial times. The homicide rate has been estimated to be over 30 per 100,000 people in 1700, dropping to under 20 by 1800, and to under 10 by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Claude|title=A crime puzzle: Violent crime declines in America|url=http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2010/06/16/a-crime-puzzle-violent-crime-declines-in-america/|publisher=UC Regents|accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, crime rates increased in the United States, peaking from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Violent crime nearly quadrupled between 1960 and its peak in 1991. Property crime more than doubled over the same period. Since the 1990s, however, crime in the United States has declined steadily. Several theories have been proposed to explain this decline:
# The number of police officers increased considerably in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Levitt 04"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |title=Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do Not | year=2004 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=163–190 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittUnderstandingWhyCrime2004.pdf |accessdate= November 29, 2012 |doi=10.1257/089533004773563485 |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# On September 16, 1994, [[U.S. President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] into law. Under the act, over $30 billion in federal aid was spent over a six-year period to improve state and local law enforcement, prisons and crime prevention programs.&lt;ref name="iopppv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Violent+Crime+Control+and+Law+Enforcement+Act+of+1994 |title=Effect of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 |year=2008 |publisher=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of the law, including the President, touted it as a lead contributor to the sharp drop in crime which occurred throughout the 1990s,&lt;ref name="iopppv" /&gt; while critics have dismissed it as an unprecedented federal [[boondoggle]].&lt;ref name="iopppv" /&gt;
# The prison population has [[United States incarceration rate|rapidly increased since the mid-1970s]].&lt;ref name="Levitt 04" /&gt;
# Starting in the mid-1980s, the crack-cocaine market grew rapidly before declining again a decade later. Some authors have pointed towards the link between violent crimes and crack use.&lt;ref name="Levitt 04" /&gt;
# [[Legalized abortion and crime effect|Legalized abortion]] reduced the number of children born to mothers in difficult circumstances, and difficult childhood makes children more likely to become criminals.&lt;ref name="Donohue 69"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Donohue |first=John |author2=Levitt, Steven |date=March 1, 2000 |title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime |journal=Berkeley Program in Law &amp; Economics, Working Paper Series |volume=2000 |issue=2 |page=69 |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=john_donohue |accessdate= March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Rising income.&lt;ref name=bcj&gt;{{Cite web |ssrn=2566965 |title=What Caused the Crime Decline? |last=Roeder |first=Oliver K., et al. |website=Brennan Center for Justice |publication-date=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The introduction of the data-driven policing practice [[CompStat]] significantly reduced crimes in cities that adopted it.&lt;ref name=bcj/&gt;
# The [[lead-crime hypothesis]] suggests reduced lead exposure as the cause; Scholar Mark A.R. Kleiman writes: "Given the decrease in lead exposure among children since the 1980s and the estimated effects of lead on crime, reduced lead exposure could easily explain a very large proportion—certainly more than half—of the crime decrease of the 1994-2004 period. A careful statistical study relating local changes in lead exposure to local crime rates estimates the fraction of the [[crime decline]] due to lead reduction as greater than 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;When Brute Force Fails: How to Have Less Crime and Less Punishment, Princeton University Press 2009 page 133 citing Richard Nevin, "How Lead Exposure Relates to Temoral Changes in IQ, Violent Crime and Unwed Pregnancy," Environmental Research 83, 1 (2000): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The quality and extent of use of security technology both increased around the time of the crime decline, after which the rate of car theft declined; this may have caused rates of other crimes to decline as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farrell|first1=G.|last2=Tseloni|first2=A.|last3=Mailley|first3=J.|last4=Tilley|first4=N.|title=The Crime Drop and the Security Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|date=February 22, 2011|volume=48|issue=2|pages=147–175|doi=10.1177/0022427810391539|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/11021/1/205359_7515%20Tseloni%20Postprint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests===
Each state has a set of statutes enforceable within its own borders. A state has no jurisdiction outside of its borders, even though still in the United States. It must request extradition from the state in which the suspect has fled. In 2014, there were 186,873 felony suspects outside specific states jurisdiction against whom no extradition would be sought. Philadelphia has about 20,000 of these since it is near a border with four other states. Extradition is estimated to cost a few hundred dollars per case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Brad | last=Heath | title=A license to commit crimes | url=https://www.usatoday.com/longform/news/nation/2014/03/11/fugitives-unwanted-extradition-investigation-crime-violence/6273375/| work= | newspaper=USA Today | location=| pages= 1B, 4B | date=March 13, 2014 | id= | accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of offenders vary from the average for specific types of crimes and specific crimes. In terms of violent crime by gender, in 2011, 80.4% of arrested persons were male and 19.6% were female.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table42"/&gt; Males were 88.2% of those arrested for homicide, while females were 11.8%.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table42"/&gt; Among those arrested for rape in 2011, males were 98.8% and females were 1.2%.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table42"/&gt; For property crime in 2011, 62.9% of arrested persons were male and 37.1% were female.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table42"/&gt;

For violent crime by race in 2011, 59.4% of those arrested were white, 38.3% were black, and 2.2% were of other races.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table43"/&gt; For persons arrested for homicide in 2011, 49.7% were black, 48% were white, and 2.3% were of other races.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table43"/&gt; For persons arrested for rape in 2011, 65% were white, 32.9% were black, and 2.1% were of other races.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table43"/&gt; For property crime in 2011, 68.1% of arrested persons were white, 29.5% were black, and 2.4% were of other races.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table43"/&gt;

In 2011, law enforcement reported 6,222 bias-motivated incidents, known as hate crimes, for which 5,731 offenders were identified.&lt;ref name="fbi 2011 hate"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2011/narratives/offenders |publisher = FBI |title=Hate Crime Statistics, Offenders |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 59% were white, 20.9% were black, 7.1% were of various races, 1.4% were Asian or Pacific Islanders, 0.8% were Native American, and 10.8% were of unknown race.&lt;ref name="fbi 2011 hate"/&gt;

Reporting at the annual meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] (August 3, 2008), sociologists at [[Bowling Green State University]] found that men who attend college are more likely to commit [[property crime]]s during their college years than their non-college-attending peers. The research draws from three waves of data from the [[National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health]] and examines education, crime levels, substance abuse and socializing among adolescents and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/543011/ Male College Students More Likely than Less-Educated Peers to Commit Property Crimes] Newswise, Retrieved on August 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Naci Mocan of the University of Colorado and Erdal Tekin of Georgia State University, "We find that unattractive individuals commit more crime in comparison to average-looking ones, and very attractive individuals commit less crime in comparison to those who are average-looking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mocan |first= |last2=Tekin |first2= |title=Ugly Criminals |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=92 |issue=1 |year=2010 |pages=15–30 |doi=10.1162/rest.2009.11757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime victimology==
[[File:United_States_homicide_victimization_rates_by_race_1980_2008.svg|thumb|400px|This graph shows the homicide victimization rate for whites and blacks, according to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics.&lt;ref name="htus"/&gt;]]
In 2011, surveys indicated more than 5.8 million violent victimizations and 17.1 million property victimizations took place in the United States; according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, each property victimization corresponded to one household, while violent victimizations is the number of victims of a violent crime.&lt;ref name="victcrim2011"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv11.pdf |title=Criminal Victimization, 2011 |page=1 |author=Bureau of Justice Statistics |publisher= U.S. Department of Justice | date=October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterns are found within the [[victimology]] of crime in the United States. Overall, males, people with lower incomes, those younger than 25, and non-[[White people|whites]] were more likely to report being the victim of crime.&lt;ref name="victcrim2011"/&gt; [[Household income in the United States|Income]], gender, and age had the most dramatic effect on the chances of a person being victimized by crime, while the characteristic of race depended upon the crime being committed.&lt;ref name="victcrim2011"/&gt;

In terms of gender, males were more likely to become crime victims than were females,&lt;ref name="victcrim2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv08.pdf |title=Criminal Victimization, 2008 |author=Bureau of Justice Statistics |publisher= U.S. Department of Justice | date=September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 79% percent of all murder victims being male. Males were twice as likely to be [[carjacked]] as females.&lt;ref name="victcrim2008"/&gt; In terms of income, households with a 2008 income of less than $15,000 were significantly more likely to have their homes burgled.&lt;ref name="victcrim2008"/&gt;

Concerning age, those younger than twenty-five were more likely to fall victim to crime, especially violent crime.&lt;ref name="victcrim2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict_v.htm |title=Criminal Victimization, 2005 |author=Bureau of Justice Statistics |publisher= U.S. Department of Justice |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060926003700/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict_v.htm#income &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chances of being victimized by violent crime decreased far more substantially with age than the chances of becoming the victim of property crime.&lt;ref name="victcrim2005"/&gt; For example, 3.03% of crimes committed against a young person were theft, while 20% of crimes committed against an elderly person were theft.&lt;ref name="victcrim2005"/&gt;

Bias motivation reports showed that of the 7,254 hate crimes reported in 2011, 47.7% (3,465) were motivated by race, with 72% (2,494) of race-motivated incidents being anti-black.&lt;ref name="fbi 2011 hate"/&gt; In addition, 20.8% (1,508) of hate crimes were motivated by sexual orientation, with 57.8% (871) of orientation-motivated incidents being anti-male homosexual.&lt;ref name="fbi 2011 hate"/&gt; The third largest motivation factor for hate crime was religion, representing 18.2% (1,318) incidents, with 62.2% (820) of religion-motivated incidents being anti-Jewish.&lt;ref name="fbi 2011 hate"/&gt;

{{anchor|Crimes against homeless people}}
As of 2007, [[Homelessness in the United States#Crimes against homeless people|violent crime against homeless people]] is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Lewan, Todd, [https://web.archive.org/web/20181010060835/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/PREYING_ON_THE_HOMELESS?SITE=WIJAN&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Unprovoked Beatings of Homeless Soaring"], [[Associated Press]], April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalhomeless.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/getinvolved/projects/hatecrimes/pressrelease.html|title=VIOLENT CRIMES AGAINST THE HOMELESS ON THE RISE|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=October 3, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403051522/http://www.nationalhomeless.org/getinvolved/projects/hatecrimes/pressrelease.html|archivedate=April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of such documented crimes in 2005 was 30% higher than of those in 1999.&lt;ref name="A Dream Denied"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/crimreport/report.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Dream Denied: The Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities |website=Nationalhomeless.org|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of all perpetrators are under the age of 25. Studies and surveys indicate that homeless people have a much higher criminal [[victimization]] rate than the non-homeless, but that most incidents never get reported to authorities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In recent years, largely due to the efforts of the [[National Coalition for the Homeless]] (NCH) and academic researchers the problem of violence against the homeless has gained national attention. The NCH called deliberate attacks against the homeless [[hate crimes]] in their report ''Hate, Violence, and Death on Mainstreet USA'' (they retain the definition of the American Congress).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The ''Center for the Study of Hate &amp; Extremism'' at [[California State University]], San Bernardino in conjunction with the NCH found that 155 homeless people were killed by non-homeless people in "hate killings", while 76 people were killed in all the other traditional hate crime [[homicide]] categories such as race and religion, combined.&lt;ref name="nationalhomeless.org"/&gt; The CSHE contends that negative and degrading portrayals of the homeless contribute to a climate where violence takes place.

The likelihood of falling victim to crime relates to both [[demographic]] and geographic characteristics.&lt;ref name="crimvict2011"/&gt; Overall, men, minorities, the young, and those in urban areas are more likely to be crime victims.&lt;ref name="crimvict2011"/&gt; The likelihood of perpetrating crime also relates to demography.

In 2010, according to the [[UNODC]], 67.5% of all homicides in the United States were perpetrated using a firearm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Homicides_by_firearms.xls Homicides by firearms] UNODC.

The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world (which includes pre-trial detainees and sentenced prisoners).&lt;ref name="walmsley"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prisonstudies.org/images/news_events/wppl9.pdf |author= R.

Among the 1.35 million sentenced state prisoners in 2011, 725,000 people were incarcerated for violent crimes, 250,000 were incarcerated for property crimes, 237,000 people were incarcerated for drug crimes, and 150,000 were incarcerated for other offenses.&lt;ref name="bjs2011prisons"/&gt; Of the 200,000 sentenced federal prisoners in 2011, 95,000 were incarcerated for drug crimes, 69,000 were incarcerated for public order offenses, 15,000 were incarcerated for violent crimes, and 11,000 were incarcerated for property crimes.&lt;ref name="bjs2011prisons"/&gt;

==International comparison==
The manner in which America's crime rate compared to other countries of similar wealth and development depends on the nature of the crime used in the comparison.&lt;ref name="Comparison of National Crime Rates, Bureau of Justice Statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/statistics/statistics35.htm |title=National Crime Rates Compared |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115003526/http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/statistics/statistics35.htm |archive-date=November 15, 2006 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall crime statistic comparisons are difficult to conduct, as the definition and categorization of crimes varies across countries. Thus an agency in a foreign country may include crimes in its annual reports which the United States omits, and vice versa.

However, some countries such as Canada have similar definitions of what constitutes a violent crime, and nearly all countries had the same definition of the characteristics that constitutes a homicide.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Overall the total crime rate of the United States is higher than developed countries, specifically Europe, with South American countries and Russia being the exceptions.&lt;ref name=UNODC2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf|title=Global Study on Homicide 2013|publisher=United Nations publication|author=UNODC|id=Sales No. 14.IV.1|isbn=978-92-1-054205-0|accessdate=December 27, 2016|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of reported [[property crime]] in the U.S. survey as lower than in Germany or Canada, yet the [[homicide]] rate in the United States is substantially higher as is the prison population.

===Violent crime===
{{see also|Violent crime in the United States|Gun violence in the United States|List of U.S. states by homicide rate|List of countries by intentional homicide rate by decade}}
The reported U.S. violent crime rate includes murder, rape and sexual assault, robbery, and assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=31|title=Violent Crime|publisher=[[United States Bureau of Justice Statistics]]|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Canadian violent crime rate includes all categories of assault, including Assault level 1 (i.e., assault not using a weapon and not resulting in serious bodily harm).&lt;ref name="BKA, German federal crime statistics 2004 (German)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crime in Canada, Canada Statistics 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/080717/d080717b.htm|title=Crime in Canada, Canada Statistics|accessdate=August 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806160341/http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/080717/d080717b.htm|archive-date=August 6, 2008|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian government study concluded that direct comparison of the 2 countries' violent crime totals or rates was "inappropriate".&lt;ref name=statcan2001comp&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0035x/85f0035x2001000-eng.pdf Feasibility Study on Crime Comparisons Between Canada and the United States] Maire Gannon, Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Statistics Canada, Cat. no. 85F0035XIE, Accessed June 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

France does not count minor violence such as punching or slapping as assault, whereas Austria, Germany, and Finland do count such occurrences.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010&gt;[https://english.wodc.nl/images/ob285_full%20text_tcm45-294766.pdf European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics] 2010, Fourth edition, English.wodc.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom similarly has different definitions of what constitutes violent crime compared to the United States, making a direct comparison of the overall figure flawed. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports defines a “violent crime” as one of four specific offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The [[British Home Office]], by contrast, has a different definition of violent crime, including all “crimes against the person,” including simple assaults, all robberies, and all “sexual offenses,” as opposed to the FBI, which only counts aggravated assaults and “forcible rapes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/2013/01/12/fact-checking-ben-swann-is-the-uk-really-5-times-more-violent-than-the-us/|title=By the Numbers: Is the UK really 5 times more violent than the US?|date=January 12, 2013|work=The Skeptical Libertarian|access-date=September 27, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime rates are necessarily altered by averaging neighborhood higher or lower local rates over a larger population which includes the entire city. Having small pockets of dense crime may lower a city's average crime rate.

According to a 2013 report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), {{as of|2013|alt=between 2005 and 2012}}, the average homicide rate in the U.S. was 4.9 per 100,000 inhabitants compared to the average rate globally, which was 6.2.

In the United States, the number of homicides where the victim and offender relationship was undetermined has been increasing since 1999 but has not reached the levels experienced in the early 1990s. In 14% of all [[murders]], the victim and the offender were strangers. Spouses and family members made up about 15% of all victims, about one-third of the victims were acquaintances of the assailant, and the victim and offender relationship was undetermined in over one-third of homicides.
Gun involvement in homicides were [[gang]]-related homicides which increased after 1980, homicides that occurred during the commission of a felony which increased from 55% in 1985 to 77% in 2005, homicides resulting from arguments which declined to the lowest levels recorded recently, and homicides resulting from other circumstances which remained relatively constant. Because gang killing has become a normal part of [[inner city|inner cities]], many including police hold preconceptions about the causes of death in inner cities. When a death is labeled gang-related it lowers the chances that it will be investigated and increases the chances that the perpetrator will remain at large. In addition, victims of gang killings often determine the priority a case will be given by police. Jenkins (1988) argues that many serial murder cases remain unknown to police and that cases involving Black offenders and victims are especially likely to escape official attention.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, P. (1988). Myth and murder: the serial killer panic of 1983-1985, Criminal Justice Research Bulletin. 3(11) 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], "When the race of the offender was known, 53.0 percent were black, 44.7 percent were white, and 2.3 percent were of other races. The race was unknown for 4,132 offenders. (Based on [https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2014.xls Expanded Homicide Data Table 3]). Of the offenders for whom gender was known, 88.2 percent were male."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide FBI – Expanded Homicide Data – 2014]". Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1980 to 2008, 84 percent of white homicide victims were killed by white offenders and 93 percent of black homicide victims were killed by black offenders.&lt;ref name="htus" /&gt;

===Property crime===
[[File:Burglaries per 1,000 pop.svg|left|thumb|The burglary rates of selected industrialized countries as published by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics]]
According to a 2004 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, looking at the period from 1981 to 1999, the United States had a lower surveyed residential [[burglary]] rate in 1998 than Scotland, England, Canada, [[the Netherlands]], and Australia. The other two countries included in the study, Sweden and Switzerland, had only slightly lower burglary rates. For the first nine years of the study period the same surveys of the public showed only Australia with rates higher than the United States. The authors noted various problems in doing the comparisons including infrequent data points. (The United States performed five surveys from 1995 to 1999 when its rate dipped below Canada's, while Canada ran a single telephone survey during that period for comparison.)&lt;ref name="Comparison of National Crime Rates, Bureau of Justice Statistics"/&gt;

===Crimes against children===
{{further information|Child abuse#U.S. statistics|Child sexual abuse#United States and Europe}}
According to a 2001 report from [[UNICEF]], the United States has the highest rate of deaths from child abuse and neglect of any industrialized nation, at 2.4 per 100,000 children; France has 1.4, Japan 1, UK 0.9 and Germany 0.8. According to the US Department of Health, the state of Texas has the highest death rate, at 4.05 per 100,000 children, New York has 2.46, Oregon 1.49 and New Hampshire 0.35.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;
[[BBC]] - [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15288865 America's child death shame], October 17, 2011
&lt;/ref&gt; A [[UNICEF]] report on child wellbeing stated that the United States and the United Kingdom ranked lowest among industrial nations with respect to the wellbeing of children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/ChildPovertyReport.pdf Child Poverty in Respective: An Overview of Child Wellbeing in Rich Countries].

==Geography of crime==
Crime rates vary in the United States depending on the type of community.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-2 |publisher=FBI |title=Crime in the United States by Community Type |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[metropolitan statistical areas]], both violent and property crime rates are higher than the national average; in cities located outside metropolitan areas, violent crime was lower than the national average, while property crime was higher.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table2"/&gt; For rural areas, both property and violent crime rates were lower than the national average.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table2"/&gt;

===Regions===
For regional comparisons, the FBI divides the United States into four regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.&lt;ref name="cius2011regions"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/standard-links/region |title=Crime in the United States by Region |publisher=FBI |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2011, the region with the lowest violent crime was the Midwest, with a rate of 349.9 per 100,000 residents, while the region with the highest violent crime rate was the South, with a rate of 428.8 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="cius2011regions"/&gt; For 2011, the region with the lowest property crime rate was the Northeast, with a rate of 2,121.8 per 100,000 residents, while the region with the highest property crime rate was the South, with a rate of 3,370.8 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="cius2011regions"/&gt;

===States===
{{see also|List of U.S. states by homicide rate}}
Crime rates vary among [[U.S. states]].&lt;ref name="cius2011states"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-5 |title=Crime in the United States by State | publisher = FBI |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the state with the lowest violent crime rate was [[Maine]], with a rate of 123.2 per 100,000 residents, while the state with the highest violent crime rate was [[Tennessee]], with a rate of 608.2 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="cius2011states"/&gt; However, the [[District of Columbia]], the U.S. [[capital district]], had a violent crime rate of 1,202.1 per 100,000 in 2011.&lt;ref name="cius2011states"/&gt; In 2011, the state with the highest property crime rate was [[South Carolina]], with a rate of 3,904.2 per 100,000, while the state with the lowest property crime rate was [[South Dakota]], with a rate of 1,817.7 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="cius2011states"/&gt; However, [[Puerto Rico]], an [[unincorporated territory of the United States]], had a property crime rate of 1,395.2 per 100,000 in 2011.&lt;ref name="cius2011states"/&gt;

Louisiana's homicide rate of 12.4 per 100,000, in 2017, was the highest among U.S. states for the 29th straight year according to the 2017 FBI Uniform Crime Report.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Metropolitan areas===
{{Further information|United States cities by crime rate}}
Crime in metropolitan statistical areas tends to be above the national average; however, wide variance exists among and within metropolitan areas.&lt;ref name="fbiwarning"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/caution-against-ranking |title=Caution Against Ranking |publisher=FBI |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some responding jurisdictions report very low crime rates, while others have considerably higher rates; these variations are due to many factors beyond population.&lt;ref name="fbiwarning"/&gt; FBI crime statistics publications strongly caution against comparison rankings of cities, counties, metropolitan statistical areas, and other reporting units without considering factors other than simply population.&lt;ref name="fbiwarning"/&gt; For 2011, the metropolitan statistical area with the highest violent crime rate was the [[Memphis metropolitan area]], with a rate of 980.4 per 100,000 residents, while the metropolitan statistical area with the lowest violent crime rate was [[Logan metropolitan area]], with a rate of 47.7.&lt;ref name="ucr2011table6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-6|publisher=FBI |title=Crime in the United States by Metropolitan Statistical Area|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagonote"&gt;Data collection methodology for Chicago for forcible rape did not align with FBI standards so its metropolitan statistical area violent crime rate was not reported.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is quite common for crime in American cities to be highly concentrated in a few, often economically disadvantaged areas. For example, [[San Mateo County, California]] had a population of approximately 707,000 and 17 homicides in 2001. Six of these 17 homicides took place in poor [[East Palo Alto]], which had a population of roughly 30,000. So, while East Palo Alto accounted for a mere 4.2% of the population, about one-third of the homicides took place there.&lt;ref name="Crime in San Mateo County in 2007, US Bureau of Justics Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Crime/Local/RunCrimeOneYearofData.cfm|title=Crime in San Mateo County in 2001, US Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language has approximately 3,300 speakers and is considered a regional language of France.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Cèmuhî has a consonantal distinction of what Rivierre (1980) calls nasal, semi-nasal, and oral consonants. He refers to voiced oral consonants as semi-nasal because they are always prenasalized. &lt;ref&gt;Rivierre ([[#grammar|1980]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
Like its neighbour [[Paicî language|Paicî]], Cèmuhî is one of the few [[Austronesian languages]] which have developed [[tone (linguistics)|contrastive tone]]. However, unlike other New Caledonian tonal languages, Cèmuhî has three tonal registers: high, mid, and low tones. &lt;ref&gt;Rivierre (1972, [[#grammar|1980]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DanielAdams.png|thumb|Daniel Adams]]
'''Daniel R. Adams''' is an American feature [[film director]]. He is best known for directing and writing the films ''[[The Lightkeepers]],'' starring [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Blythe Danner]], and ''[[The Golden Boys]],'' starring [[David Carradine]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Rip Torn]], [[Charles Durning]], and [[Mariel Hemingway]].&lt;ref name=Boston&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilsdorf |first=Ethan |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/06/03/not_the_retiring_type/ |title=Not the retiring type - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date=2007-06-03 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams grew up in the Boston area, went to the [[University of Vermont]] for two years, from 1980 to 1981, and attended some Harvard Extension School classes in the early 1980s, spokesmen for both schools confirmed.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/17/producer-leaves-cape-feeling-fleeced/WzxWoCcHWZI8zD8Khj0kiM/story.html |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107232815/http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/17/producer-leaves-cape-feeling-fleeced/WzxWoCcHWZI8zD8Khj0kiM/story.html |archivedate=January 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams  worked for several political campaigns before going into movies. After working in politics, including two gubernatorial campaigns, a race for attorney general, and a presidential campaign, he also garnered valuable film production experience directing television commercials for a Boston advertising agency.

He then co-wrote and directed his first feature film in 1989, ''A Fool And His Money'' (originally titled, ''Religion, Inc.''), which starred [[Sandra Bullock]] (Adams is credited with casting Ms. Bullock in her first leading role), [[Jonathan Penner]], [[George Plimpton]] and [[Jerzy Kosinski]] (released through Trimark Pictures - now Lions Gate). He then went on to write and direct his second feature, the critically acclaimed ''Primary Motive'', which starred [[Judd Nelson]], [[Justine Bateman]], [[Richard Jordan]], [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] and [[Sally Kirkland]], for Twentieth Century Fox. His third feature, which he also wrote and directed, was a comedy entitled, ''The Mouse'', starring [[Rip Torn]] and [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]], and released through Strand Releasing. ''The Mouse'' also received positive reviews throughout the United States and abroad. His film, ''The Golden Boys'', was released through Roadside Attractions and Lions Gate Films in 2009. Also in 2009, he directed the feature film, ''The Lightkeepers'', from a script he wrote. ''Lightkeepers, starring Richard Dreyfuss and Blythe Danner,'' was released through New Films Cinema in the spring of 2010.

Adams is the recipient of numerous awards and honors. His film, "The Lightkeepers" was chosen as the closing night film for the Palm Springs International Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psfilmfest.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=21283&amp;fid=40 |title=Closing Night Gala 2010 &amp;#124; 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival |publisher=Psfilmfest.org |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231330/http://www.psfilmfest.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=21283&amp;fid=40 |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the opening night film for the Boulder International Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_14386945 |title=BIFF brings out Boulder's film buffs - Boulder Daily Camera |publisher=Dailycamera.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; won the "Golden Angel" award (best picture) and chosen closing night film at the Los Angeles Chinese-American Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cafilmfestival.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=54&amp;lang=en |title=The Lightkeepers |publisher=Cafilmfestival.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named the #2 Best Grown Up Love Story of the Year (2010) by AARP Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newcott |first=Bill |url=http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-01-2011/best-love-story-movies-for-grownups-2011.html |title=Movies for Grownups Awards 2011 - Best Grownup Love Story: Annette Ben... |publisher=AARP |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the 2010 "best musical score for a comedy" award by the International Film Music Critics Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://filmmusiccritics.org/2011/03/pinar-toprak-receives-her-ifmca-award-for-the-lightkeepers/ |title=Pinar Toprak receives her IFMCA Award for The Lightkeepers &amp;#124; IFMCA: the International Film Music Critics Association |publisher=Filmmusiccritics.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danieladams.la |title=Homepage |publisher=Danieladams.la |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also received praise from the actors he has directed. Two-time Academy Award nominated actor Bruce Dern has compared Adams' directing style to Hal Ashby and Alfred Hitchcock, and commented, "He (Adams) is on the threshold of becoming an extremely interesting commodity in this business because he's really old-school - he's an old-school filmmaker." &lt;ref&gt;http://news.moviefone.com/2010/05/08/new-old-news-bruce-dern-on-working-with-hitchcock-hal-ashby/&lt;/ref&gt; And Academy Award winning actor Richard Dreyfuss has been quoted, "Daniel is a smart man, who truly understands the old values of filmmaking... He is an excellent writer and perhaps enough people will see The Lightkeepers to appreciate that." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/news/ni1895342/&lt;/ref&gt;

As a novelist, he conceived, edited and contributed to the serial novel, ''Out Of The Fog'', working with a dozen of the nation's best-selling authors. Also a historian, he is writing a biography of American patriot [[James Otis, Jr.]]

Adams was indicted in December 2011 on 10 counts of making false tax claims related to two films for which his production company received $4.7 million in tax credits from the state of Massachusetts, which in turn were used toward production expenses on two movies. On April 19, 2012 he pleaded guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Director Pleads Guilty to Inflating Movie Costs |url=http://itemlive.com/articles/2012/04/19/updates/updates09.txt |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709232231/http://itemlive.com/articles/2012/04/19/updates/updates09.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |newspaper=The Daily Item |date=April 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has subsequently resumed his career directing movies. His next projects include the gangster drama, "Curtain of Fire"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/filmmaker-daniel-adams-breaks-silence-683100&lt;/ref&gt; and the action film, "Panama." &lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2014/artisans/news/daniel-adams-panama-first-post-prison-project-1201302305/&lt;/ref&gt; He also signed on to direct the drama, "Land of the Free."&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2014/film/news/daniel-adams-land-of-the-free-directing-1201304205/&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams recently completed the film, "An L.A. Minute" which he co-wrote with National Lampoon alum [[Larry_Sloman|Larry "Ratso" Sloman]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://deadline.com/2016/05/spiderworx-media-50m-film-fund-daniel-adams-mike-flanders-an-l-a-muinute-1201747765/&lt;/ref&gt; The film is due to be released in theaters in the summer of 2018 through Strand Releasing&lt;ref&gt;https://www.etonline.com/kiersey-clemons-becomes-an-overnight-sensation-in-an-la-minute-trailer-exclusive-104246&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[Darkhad valley]] is named after them. The regional variant of [[Mongolian language|Mongol language]] is the [[Darkhad dialect]].  In the 2000 census, 16,268 people identified themselves as Darkhad.

The Darkhad were originally part of the [[Oirats|Oirat]] or [[Khotgoid]] tribes. Between 1549 and 1686, they were subjects of [[Administrative divisions of Mongolia during Qing#Outer Mongolia (Khalkha)|Zasagt Khan aimag]] and the Khotgoid Altan Khan. In 1786 they became part of the [[Jebtsundamba|Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]]'s [[Administrative divisions of Mongolia during Qing#Khövsgöl|shabi otog]]. At roughly the same time they became known as ''Black Darkhad''.

In 1947, 2071 people from 462 households were eligible to be Darkhad.&lt;ref name=bayer11/&gt; They were liable for maintaining the Great Khan's mausoleum at their own expense prior to the erection of a permanent government-owned structure in 1954–6.&lt;ref name=bayer11/&gt;

Many Darkhad practise [[shamanism]].

'''Derwick''' is a Venezuelan energy company specializing in the construction of turn-key power plant projects. Derwick undertook eleven projects that created 1.216MW of new generation capacity for [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="el-nacional1"&gt;{{cite web|author=El Nacional Web |url=http://www.el-nacional.com/economia/Premian-Centro-Tecnologico-Turbinas-Derwick_0_320368236.html |title=Premian en España al Centro Tecnológico de Turbinas de Derwick |language=es |publisher=El-nacional.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and clients==
Derwick's first project was the Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) of Picure Power Plant in Vargas State for 156 MW, awarded by the state-owned Electricidad de Caracas in 2009. It was followed by 11 more contracts from the Venezuelan government through  PDVSA, CVG and Corpoelec during the 2009 - 2010 energy crisis in Venezuela. Four contracts were awarded by state-owned [[Electricidad de Caracas]] (since December 2011, part of [[Corpoelec]]), five by state-owned [[Petróleos de Venezuela]] SA (PDVSA, with the contract negotiated by Bariven, a division of PDVSA), and one by state-owned [[Corporación Venezolana de Guayana|Venezuelan Guayana Corporation]] (CVG).  The company's directors are: Edgard Romero Lazo, Iker Candina, [[Alejandro Betancourt López]] and [[Pedro Trebbau López]].

=== Turbine Technology Center (TTC) ===
Derwick´s Turbine Technology Center (TTC) was started by Derwick in 2011 and conceived as a quick response to the technical assistance needs of the country.&lt;ref name="el-nacional1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eleconomista1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleconomista.es/empresas-eAm-chile/noticias/5402182/12/13/-CTT-de-Derwick-es-distinguido-como-mejor-iniciativa-empresarial-latinoamericana.html |language=es |title=CTT de Derwick es distinguido como mejor iniciativa empresarial latinoamericana |publisher=elEconomista.es |date=2013-12-17 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Derwick Associates received the award "The Best Latin-American Initiative",&lt;ref name=initiative&gt;{{cite web | url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/derwick-associates-wins-capital-award-153000709.html | title=Derwick Associates Wins Capital Award for Best Latin American Initiative | work=Yahoo Finance | date=13 December 2013 | accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  given by Capital, Spanish financial magazine &lt;ref name="el-nacional1"/&gt; The award recognizes the TTC (Technological Center of Turbines) as an important initiative that has helped to improve Venezuela's power system.&lt;ref name=initiative/&gt;

==Controversy and litigation==

===Independent investigations===
In 2011, Venezuelan newspaper [[Ultimas Noticias]]'s [[César Batiz]] published an investigative series alleging overbilling and odd transactions between BARIVEN and Derwick Associates. The articles alleged that the company had no experience building power plants when it was contracted to build them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ultimasnoticias.com.ve/noticias/ciudad/parroquias/ipys-reconoce-investigacion-de-periodista-de-un.aspx |title=Ipys reconoce investigación de periodista de ÚN &amp;#124; Últimas Noticias |publisher=Ultimasnoticias.com.ve |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deputy to the National Assembly called for an investigation of how the Derwick contracts were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2011/08/15/oposicion-exige-revisar-plan-de-inversion-electrica |title=Oposicion Exige Revisar Plan De Inversion Electrica - 2011 |language=es |publisher=El Universal |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the Derwick articles in [[Ultimas Noticias]] won an award for investigative journalism. According to [[Reporters Without Borders]] and to the Institute of Press and Society, reporters received "threats, pressures, bribe offers" or were banned on Venezuela's internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.el-nacional.com/economia/Calculan-sobreprecio-plantas-supera-millardos_0_245375679.html]  [http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2013/09/05/actualidad/1378389465_768430.html] [http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/venezuelas-electricity-deficit]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, [[César Batiz]] was offered a US$50,000 bribe to stop writing about the Venezuelan electricity industry.&lt;ref name="Instituto Prensa y Sociedad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipys.org.ve/alerta?id=3238 |title=Autor de investigaciones periodísticas sobre sector eléctrico es citado por presunto funcionario de policía de inteligencia e intimidado por empresa contratista |date=18 Dec 2012 |publisher=IPYS |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to claims by energy expert José Aguilar, the 40 contracts awarded to various companies, including Derwick, to address the Venezuelan energy crisis were overbilled by billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2013/09/05/actualidad/1378389465_768430.html |title=La corrupción apaga a Venezuela &amp;#124; Internacional &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Internacional.elpais.com |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Derwick director Edgard Romero Lazo claimed that allegations of overbilling and bribery were "part of a defamation campaign" against the company.&lt;ref name="el-nacional2"/&gt; The company claims that all contracts are available to the public through the National Contractors Registry (RNC).&lt;ref name="el-nacional2"/&gt;

===Lawsuits===
In 2013, Derwick was sued in the New York Federal Court by Washington businessman and ex-ambassador [[Otto Reich]], who alleged that Derwick's executives defamed him and caused his consulting business to suffer financial losses, accusing Derwick of falsely stating that he consulted for them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/otto-reich-lawsuit_n_3688670.html "Otto Reich, Former US Ambassador To Venezuela, Files Bribe Suit Against Executives At Derwick Associates."] ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. Accessed 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate legal action, [[Thor Leonardo Halvorssen Mendoza]], a human rights lawyer, alleged defamation and sued Derwick and its partners.&lt;ref name="miamiherald.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maria |first=Antonio |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/03/27/4023508/lawsuit-filed-in-miami-accuses.html |title=Lawsuit filed in Miami accuses Venezuela top official, Diosdado Cabello, of bribery - Venezuela |publisher=Miami Herald |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both suits have been dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newsham|first1=Jack|title=2nd Circ. Won't Save Ex-Venezuela Ambassador's RICO Case - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/928884/2nd-circ-won-t-save-ex-venezuela-ambassador-s-rico-case|work=[[Law360]]|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corte de EEUU desestima acusación contra Derwick Associates {{!}} Globovisión|url=http://archivo.globovision.com/corte-de-eeuu-desestima-acusacion-contra-derwick-associates/|work=[[Globovision]]|date=18 July 2015|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Department of Justice investigations===
In August 2014, it was reported in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that Derwick was under preliminary investigations by the [[United States Department of Justice]] and Manhattan prosecutors due to bribery allegations and possible banking infractions. [[ProEnergy Services]], an energy company based in Missouri, was also said to be under investigation due to its relationship with Derwick. Manhattan prosecutors were specifically investigating Derwick and ProEnergy Services due to potential violations of New York banking laws. Federal prosecutors, however, are investigating the two companies for potential breaches of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]], "which prohibits offering foreign government officials improper payments in exchange for a business advantage", with prosecutors suspicious of the potentially inflated prices used by Derwick and ProEnergy Services for the Venezuelan government that possibly showed raised prices to cover acts of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelan-energy-company-derwick-investigated-in-u-s-1407516278 | title=Venezuelan Energy Company Investigated in U.S. | work=Wall Street Journal | date=8 August 2014 | accessdate=8 August 2014 |author1=Cordoba, Jose |author2=Mathews, Christopher }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Derwick's activities were investigated by U.S. Attorney [[Preet Bharara]] in New York. [[Federal administration of Switzerland#Federal Department of Justice and Police|Switzerland's Federal Office of Justice]] confirmed that 18 Swiss banks, following the measures of mutual assistance, agreed to turn over any existing bank records they would have involving representatives of the company, the first official statement acknowledging the investigation against Derwick by the United State Department of Justice.&lt;ref name=bloommarch&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-24/swiss-banks-land-in-middle-of-money-laundering-probe-again | title=Swiss Banks Land in Middle of Money-Laundering Probe -- Again | work=Bloomberg | accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insidermarch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-switzerland-to-hand-venezuela-oil-firm-bank-records-to-us-2016-3 | title=Switzerland to hand Venezuela oil firm bank records to U.S. | work=Business Insider | accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Derwick spokesman, the investigation was suspended after the Justice Department reviewed its bank records, though the Department of Justice did not confirm this.&lt;ref name=OHARA&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaefer Muñoz|first1=Sara|last2=Kurmanaev|first2=Anatoly|title=Colombian Oil Producer Pacific Falls From Grace|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/colombian-oil-producer-pacific-falls-from-grace-1461111089|accessdate=27 April 2016|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deuce 7''' (also known as Deuce Seven, Twenty Seven, 27) is the pseudonym of an American artist based in [[Dunsmuir, California]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Background==
Deuce 7 has been a [[railfan]] ([[trainspotter]]) since his early days, and eventually began [[freighthopping]] as a means of transport as well as to spread his work beyond the Minneapolis area. His love of trains and freighthopping strongly influences his art. Locomotives, freight cars, and railyard denizens are recurrent [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s in his work. He calls the west coast home, but his [[monikers]] can be seen on train cars throughout the United States.

He got his pseudonym from the markings on an old [[diesel locomotive]], BNSF 6127, signing his work with a "27". Eventually it was suggested that he spell the name out "Deuce 7".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypages.com/music/street-artist-deuce-7-i-absolutely-hate-shepard-fairey-6629975 Lars Larson, Street artist Deuce 7: I absolutely hate Shepard Fairey, CITY PAGES, Friday, May 17, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in Mt Shasta, California.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Work==
Deuce 7 started working as a [[street art]]ist in the 1990s in Minneapolis. 
Since 2006 has been exhibiting work in a gallery in Minneapolis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypages.com/music/street-artist-deuce-7-i-absolutely-hate-shepard-fairey-6629975 Lars Larson, Street artist Deuce 7: I absolutely hate Shepard Fairey, CITY PAGES, Friday, May 17, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[New York City]], [[Seattle]], and other major cities.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Style===
Deuce 7 uses aerosol paint, one-shot, and oilbars to create intensely colorful, spidery images of a variety of subjects which he refers to as "stories",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iverson |first=Kate |url=http://twincities.decider.com/articles/deuce-seven-balances-graffiti-gallery-worlds,24984/ |title=Deuce Seven balances graffiti, gallery worlds &amp;#124; Features &amp;#124; Arts &amp;#124; Twin Cities &amp;#124; Decider |publisher=Twincities.decider.com |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include characters he has met on his travels, romantic interests, trains, cityscapes, as well as purely expressive, surrealist images.

His fine art pieces carry the design hallmarks of his street style, and are also typically rendered with one-shot, ink, watercolor, and/or enamel spray paint.  Some pieces utilize mixed media including masks, found objects, and baroque moldings. His pen and ink drawings frequently evoke stark, decaying cityscapes of crumbling tenement buildings patrolled by strange vehicles and airborne creatures.

'''Economic growth''' is the increase in the inflation-adjusted [[market value]] of the goods and services produced by an [[economics|economy]] over time. It is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real [[gross domestic product]], or real GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/197039/growth-of-the-global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/ Statistics on the Growth of the Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 2003 to 2013], IMF, October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth is usually calculated in ''real'' terms - i.e., [[real vs. nominal in economics|inflation-adjusted]] terms – to eliminate the distorting effect of [[inflation]] on the price of goods produced. [[Measures of national income and output|Measurement of economic growth]] uses [[National accounts|national income accounting]].&lt;ref name="Bjork 1999 251"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bjork|1999|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since economic growth is measured as the annual percent change of gross domestic product (GDP), it has all the advantages and drawbacks of that measure. The economic growth rates of nations are commonly compared using the ratio of the GDP to population or per-capita income.&lt;ref name="Bjork 1999"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bjork|1999|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "rate of economic growth" refers to the geometric annual rate of growth in GDP between the first and the last year over a period of time. This growth rate is the trend in the average level of GDP over the period, which ignores the fluctuations in the GDP around this trend.

An increase in economic growth caused by more efficient use of inputs (increased productivity of labor, [[physical capital]], energy or materials) is referred to as ''intensive growth''. GDP growth caused only by increases in the amount of inputs available for use (increased population, new territory) is called ''[[extensive growth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won’t: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first= Gordon J.|year= 1999|publisher =Praeger|location= Westport, CT; London|isbn=0-275-96532-5 |pages=2, 67| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of new goods and services also creates economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Rise and Fall of American Growth |last=Gordon |first= Robert J. |year= 2016 |publisher =Princeton University Press |location= Princeton, NJ USA|isbn= 978-0-691-14772-7|pages=38}}In the U.S. about 60% of consumer spending in 2103 was for goods that did not exist in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring economic growth==
{{Main|Gross domestic product}} The economic growth rate is calculated from data on GDP estimated by countries' statistical agencies. The rate of growth of GDP per capita is calculated from data on GDP and people for the initial and final periods included in the analysis of the analyst.

==Determinants of per capita GDP growth==
In national income accounting, per capita output can be calculated using the following factors: output per unit of labor input (labor productivity), hours worked (intensity), the percentage of the working age population actually working (participation rate) and the proportion of the working-age population to the total population (demographics). "The rate of change of GDP/population is the sum of the rates of change of these four variables plus their cross products."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bjork|1999|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productivity===
Increases in labor [[productivity]] (the ratio of the value of output to labor input) have historically been the most important source of real per capita economic growth.&lt;ref name="Bjork 1999 pp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last1 = Roubini | first1 =Nouriel| last2= Backus | first2 =David | author1-link =  |work= Lectures in Macroeconomics | year = 1998 |title=Productivity and Growth |url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~nroubini/NOTES/CHAP4.HTM#topic2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web

Increases in productivity lower the real cost of goods.

====Historical sources of productivity growth====
{{main|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}

Economic growth has traditionally been attributed to the accumulation of human and physical capital and the increase in productivity and creation of new goods arising from technological innovation.&lt;ref name="Lucas1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=R. E. |year=1988 |title=On the Mechanics of Economic Development |journal=[[Journal of Monetary Economics]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=3–42 |doi=10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further [[division of labour]] (specialization) is also fundamental to rising productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Capitalism: A complete understanding of the nature and value of human economic life|last=Reisman|first= George|year= 1998|isbn= 0-915463- 73-3|publisher =Jameson Books |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[industrialization]] technological progress resulted in an increase in the population, which was kept in check by food supply and other resources, which acted to limit per capita income, a condition known as the [[Malthusian trap]].&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galor |first=Oded |year=2005 |chapter=From Stagnation to Growth: Unified Growth Theory |title=Handbook of Economic Growth |volume=1 |pages=171–293 |publisher=Elsevier |chapterurl=https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/grochp/1-04.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid economic growth that occurred during the [[Industrial Revolution]] was remarkable because it was in excess of population growth, providing an escape from the Malthusian trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2007|pp= Part 2: The Industrial Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Countries that industrialized eventually saw their population growth slow down, a phenomenon known as the [[demographic transition]].

Increases in productivity are the major factor responsible for per capita economic growth – this has been especially evident since the mid-19th century. Most of the economic growth in the 20th century was due to increased output per unit of labor, materials, energy, and land (less input per widget). The balance of the growth in output has come from using more inputs. Both of these changes increase output.  The increased output included more of the same goods produced previously and new goods and services.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;Kendrick, J. W. 1961 "[https://www.nber.org/books/kend61-1 Productivity trends in the United States]," Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[mechanization]] began to replace hand methods in manufacturing, and new processes streamlined production of chemicals, iron, steel, and other products.&lt;ref name="Landes1969"&gt;

During the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], a major factor of [[productivity]] growth was the substitution of inanimate power for human and animal labor.  Also there was a great increase in power as steam powered [[electricity generation]] and internal combustion supplanted limited wind and [[water power]].&lt;ref name="Landes1969"/&gt;  Since that replacement, the great expansion of total power was driven by continuous improvements in energy conversion efficiency.&lt;ref name="Ayres-Warr2004"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Demographic changes===
Demographic factors may influence growth by changing the employment to population ratio and the labor force participation rate.&lt;ref name="Bjork 1999 pp"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bjork|1999|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Industrialization]] creates a [[demographic transition]] in which birth rates decline and the average age of the population increases.

Women with fewer children and better access to market employment tend to join the labor force in higher percentages.  There is a reduced demand for child labor and children spend more years in school. The increase in the percentage of women in the labor force in the U.S. contributed to economic growth, as did the entrance of the [[baby boomer]]s into the workforce.&lt;ref name="Bjork 1999 pp"/&gt;  See: [[Spending wave]]

In economics and economic history, the transition to [[capitalism]] from earlier economic systems was enabled by the adoption of government policies that facilitated commerce and gave individuals more personal and economic freedom.

There are many different ways through which states achieved state (fiscal) capacity and this different capacity accelerated or hindered their economic development. Thanks to the underlying homogeneity of its land and people, England was able to achieve a unified legal and fiscal system since the Middle Ages that enabled it to substantially increase the taxes it raised after 1689.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the other hand, the French experience of state building faced much stronger resistance from local feudal powers keeping it legally and fiscally fragmented until the French Revolution despite significant increases in state capacity during the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Noel D. |title=Banking on the King: The Evolution of the Royal Revenue Farms in Old Regime France |journal=Journal of Economic History |year=2006 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=963–991 |doi=10.1017/S0022050706000398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Noel D. |first2=Mark |last2=Koyama |title=Tax Farming and the Origins of State Capacity in England and France |journal=Explorations in Economic History |year=2014 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2013.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Prussia and the Habsburg empire—much more heterogeneous states than England—were able to increase state capacity during the eighteenth century without constraining the powers of the executive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, it is unlikely that a country will generate institutions that respect property rights and the rule of law without having had first intermediate fiscal and political institutions that create incentives for elites to support them. Many of these intermediate level institutions relied on informal private-order arrangements that combined with public-order institutions associated with states, to lay the foundations of modern rule of law states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In many poor and developing countries much land and housing are held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system. In many urban areas the poor "invade" private or government land to build their houses, so they do not hold title to these properties.  Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various property associations and other arrangements.  Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building. In some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land.  Other causes of extra-legal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency.&lt;ref name="Desoto_2000"&gt;{{cite book

Not having clear legal title to property limits its potential to be used as collateral to secure loans, depriving many poor countries one of their most important potential sources of capital.  Unregistered businesses and lack of accepted accounting methods are other factors that limit potential capital.&lt;ref name="Desoto_2000"/&gt;

Businesses and individuals participating in unreported business activity and owners of unregistered property face costs such as bribes and pay-offs that offset much of any taxes avoided.&lt;ref name="Desoto_2000"/&gt;

"Democracy Does Cause Growth", according to Acemoglu et al.  Specifically, "democracy increases future GDP by encouraging investment, increasing schooling, inducing economic reforms, improving public goods provision, and reducing social unrest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Naidu |first2=Suresh |last3=Restrepo |first3=Pascual |last4=Robinson |first4=James A. |title=Democracy Does Cause Growth |work=NBER Working Paper No. 20004 |doi=10.3386/w20004 |date=March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entrepreneurship===
Policymakers and scholars frequently emphasize the importance of entrepreneurship for economic growth. However, surprisingly few research empirically examine and quantify entrepreneurship's impact on growth. This is due to endogeneity - forces that drive economic growth also drive entrepreneurship. In other words, the empirical analysis of the impact of entrepreneurship on growth is difficult because of the joint determination of entrepreneurship and economic growth. A few papers use quasi-experimental designs, and have found that entrepreneurship and the density of small businesses indeed have a causal impact on regional growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/jeg/lbw021| title=Entrepreneurship, small businesses and economic growth in cities| journal=Journal of Economic Geography| pages=311–343 &lt;!-- Bad Crossref data: lbw021 --&gt; |volume=17 |issue=2 | date=2016-07-28| last1=Lee| first1=Yong Suk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883902617308923 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.11.001| title=Government guaranteed small business loans and regional growth| journal=Journal of Business Venturing| volume=33| pages=70–83| year=2018| last1=Lee| first1=Yong Suk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital===
Capital in economics ordinarily refers to physical capital, which consists of structures (largest component of physical capital) and equipment used in business (machinery, factory equipment, computers and office equipment, construction equipment, business vehicles, medical equipment, etc.).&lt;ref name="Bjork 1999 251"/&gt;  Up to a point increases in the amount of capital per worker are an important cause of economic output growth.  Capital is subject to [[diminishing returns]] because of the amount that can be effectively invested and because of the growing burden of depreciation.

In the development of economic theory the distribution of income was considered to be between labor and the owners of land and capital.&lt;ref&gt;

===New products and services===
Another major cause of economic growth is the introduction of new products and services and the improvement of existing products.  New products create demand, which is necessary to offset the decline in employment that occurs through labor-saving technology (and to a lesser extent employment declines due to savings in energy and materials).&lt;ref name="Jorgenson&amp;Ho_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ayres

===Growth phases and sector shares===
{{Main|Rostow's stages of growth}}
Economic growth in the U.S. and other developed countries went through phases that affected growth through changes in the labor force participation rate and the relative sizes of economic sectors.  The transition from an agricultural economy to manufacturing increased the size of the sector with high output per hour (the high-productivity manufacturing sector), while reducing the size of the sector with lower output per hour (the lower productivity agricultural sector). Eventually high productivity growth in manufacturing reduced the sector size, as prices fell and employment shrank relative to other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uschamberfoundation.org/blog/2012/03/manufacturing%E2%80%99s-declining-share-gdp|title=Manufacturing’s declining share of GDP is a global phenomenon, and it’s something to celebrate|work=U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MANEMP|title=All Employees: Manufacturing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The service and government sectors, where output per hour and productivity growth is low, saw increases in their shares of the economy and employment during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Bjork 1999 pp"/&gt; The public sector has since contracted, while the service economy expanded in the 2000s.

==Theories and models {{anchor|theory}}==

===Classical growth theory===
In classical ([[David Ricardo|Ricardian]]) economics, the theory of production and the theory of growth are based on the theory or law of variable proportions, whereby increasing either of the [[factors of production]] (labor or capital), while holding the other constant and assuming no technological change, will increase output, but at a diminishing rate that eventually will approach zero.  These concepts have their origins in [[Thomas Malthus]]’s theorizing about agriculture.  Malthus's examples included the number of seeds harvested relative to the number of seeds planted (capital) on a plot of land and the size of the harvest from a plot of land versus the number of workers employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bjork|1999|pp=297–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See also [[Diminishing returns]].

Criticisms of classical growth theory are that technology, an important factor in economic growth, is held constant and that [[economies of scale]] are ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bjork|1999|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural rate of growth ===

According to Harrod, the natural growth rate is the maximum rate of growth allowed by the increase of variables like population growth, technological improvement and growth in natural resources.

In fact, the natural growth rate is the highest attainable growth rate which would bring about the fullest possible employment of the resources existing in the economy.

===Solow–Swan model===
{{Hatnote|This section is about a neoclassical growth model. It is not to be confused with [[Steady-state economy]]}}
{{Main|Solow–Swan model}}
[[Robert Solow]] and [[Trevor Swan]] developed what eventually became the main model used in growth economics in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert M. |last=Solow |year=1956 |title=A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=70 |issue=1 |jstor=1884513 |pages=65–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swan | first1 = Trevor W. | year = 1956 | title = Economic Growth and Capital Accumulation' | url = | journal = Economic Record | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 334–61 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-4932.1956.tb00434.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that there are [[diminishing returns]] to capital and labor. Capital accumulates through investment, but its level or stock continually decreases due to depreciation. Due to the diminishing returns to capital, with increases in capital/worker and absent technological progress, economic output/worker eventually reaches a point where capital per worker and economic output/worker remain constant because annual investment in capital equals annual depreciation. This condition is called the 'steady state'.

In the Solow–Swan model if productivity increases through technological progress, then output/worker increases even when the economy is in the steady state.  If productivity increases at a constant rate, output/worker also increases at a related steady-state rate.  As a consequence, growth in the model can occur either by increasing the share of GDP invested or through technological progress.  But at whatever share of GDP invested, capital/worker eventually converges on the steady state, leaving the growth rate of output/worker determined only by the rate of technological progress.  As a consequence, with world technology available to all and progressing at a constant rate, all countries have the same steady state rate of growth.  Each country has a different level of GDP/worker determined by the share of GDP it invests, but all countries have the same rate of economic growth.  Implicitly in this model rich countries are those that have invested a high share of GDP for a long time.  Poor countries can become rich by increasing the share of GDP they invest.  One important prediction of the model, mostly borne out by the data, is that of  ''conditional convergence''; the idea that poor countries will grow faster and catch up with rich countries as long as they have similar investment (and saving) rates and access to the same technology.

The Solow–Swan model is considered an "exogenous" growth model because it does not explain why countries invest different shares of GDP in capital nor why technology improves over time. Instead the rate of investment and the rate of technological progress are exogenous.  The value of the model is that it predicts the pattern of economic growth once these two rates are specified.  Its failure to explain the determinants of these rates is one of its limitations.

Although the rate of investment in the model is exogenous, under certain conditions the model implicitly predicts convergence in the rates of investment across countries.  In a global economy with a global financial capital market, financial capital flows to the countries with the highest return on investment.  In the Solow-Swan model countries with less capital/worker (poor countries) have a higher return on investment due to the diminishing returns to capital.  As a consequence, capital/worker and output/worker in a global financial capital market should converge to the same level in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=Robert E. |year=1990 |title=Why Doesn't Capital Flow from Rich to Poor Countries? |journal=American Economic Review |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=92–6 |jstor=2006549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since historically financial capital has not flowed to the countries with less capital/worker, the basic Solow–Swan model has a conceptual flaw.  Beginning in the 1990s, this flaw has been addressed by adding additional variables to the model that can explain why some countries are less productive than others and, therefore, do not attract flows of global financial capital even though they have less (physical) capital/worker.

===Endogenous growth theory===
{{Main|Endogenous growth theory}}
Unsatisfied with the assumption of exogenous technological progress in the Solow–Swan model, economists worked to "[[Endogeneity (economics)|endogenize]]"  (i.e., explain it "from within" the models) productivity growth in the 1980s; the resulting [[endogenous growth theory]], most notably advanced by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]] and his student [[Paul Romer]], includes a mathematical explanation of technological advancement.&lt;ref name="Lucas1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Romer |year=1986 |title=Increasing Returns and Long-Run Growth |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=1002–1037 |doi=10.1086/261420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model also incorporated a new concept of [[human capital]], the skills and knowledge that make workers productive. Unlike [[physical capital]], human capital has increasing rates of return. Research done in this area has focused on what increases human capital (e.g. [[education]]) or technological change (e.g. [[innovation]]).&lt;ref name="mystery"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elhanah |last=Helpman |title=The Mystery of Economic Growth |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-674-01572-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unified growth theory===
[[Unified growth theory]] was developed by [[Oded Galor]] and his co-authors to address the inability of endogenous growth theory to explain key empirical regularities in the growth processes of individual economies and the world economy as a whole. Endogenous growth theory was satisfied with accounting for empirical regularities in the growth process of developed economies over the last hundred years. As a consequence, it was not able to explain the qualitatively different empirical regularities that characterized the growth process over longer time horizons in both developed and less developed economies. Unified growth theories are endogenous growth theories that are consistent with the entire process of development, and in particular the transition from the epoch of [[Malthusian stagnation]] that had characterized most of the process of development to the contemporary era of sustained economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Galor O., 2005, "From Stagnation to Growth: Unified Growth Theory". ''Handbook of Economic Growth'', Elsevier {{DOI|10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01004-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The big push===
One popular theory in the 1940s was the [[big push model]], which suggested that countries needed to jump from one stage of development to another through a [[virtuous cycle]], in which large investments in infrastructure and education coupled with private investments would move the economy to a more productive stage, breaking free from economic paradigms appropriate to a lower productivity stage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]] {{specify|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was revived and formulated rigorously, in the late 1980s by [[Kevin Murphy (economist)|Kevin Murphy]], [[Andrei Shleifer]] and [[Robert Vishny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kevin M. |last=Murphy |first2=Andrei |last2=Shleifer |first3=Robert W. |last3=Vishny |title=Industrialization and the Big Push |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=97 |issue=5 |year=1989 |pages=1003–1026 |doi=10.1086/261641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schumpeterian growth===
Schumpeterian growth is an [[economic theory]] named after the 20th-century [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[economist]] [[Joseph Schumpeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harry |last=Landreth |title=History of Economic Theory : Scope, Method, and Content |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1976 |isbn=0-395-19234-X |pages=478–480 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9y5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA478 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; The approach explains growth as a consequence of [[innovation]] and a process of creative destruction that captures the dual nature of technological progress: in terms of creation, entrepreneurs introduce new products or processes in the hope that they will enjoy temporary monopoly-like profits as they capture markets. In doing so, they make old technologies or products obsolete. This can be seen as an ''annulment'' of previous technologies, which makes them obsolete, and "destroys the rents generated by previous innovations."&lt;ref name="Aghion2002"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Philippe Aghion |first=Philippe |last=Aghion |year=2002 |title=Schumpeterian Growth Theory and the Dynamics of Income Inequality |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=855–82 |doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|855}}&lt;ref&gt;Also see {{cite book |first=Wendy |last=Carlin |first2=David |last2=Soskice |year=2006 |title=Macroeconomics: Imperfections, Institutions and Policies |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-877622-5 |chapter=Endogenous and Schumpeterian Growth |pages=529–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major model that illustrates [[Schumpeterian growth]] is the Aghion–Howitt model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philippe |last=Aghion |first2=Peter |last2=Howitt |year=1992 |title=A Model of Growth Through Creative Destruction |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=323–51 |doi=10.2307/2951599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aghion2002" /&gt;

===Institutions and growth===
According to [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James Robinson]], the positive correlation between high income and cold climate is a by-product of history. Europeans adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies, with different associated institutions. In places where these colonizers faced high mortality rates (e.g., due to the presence of tropical diseases), they could not settle permanently, and they were thus more likely to establish extractive institutions, which persisted after independence; in places where they could settle permanently (e.g. those with temperate climates), they established institutions with this objective in mind and modeled them after those in their European homelands. In these 'neo-Europes' better institutions in turn produced better development outcomes. Thus, although other economists focus on the identity or type of legal system of the colonizers to explain institutions, these authors look at the environmental conditions in the colonies to explain institutions. For instance, former colonies have inherited corrupt governments and geopolitical boundaries (set by the colonizers) that are not properly placed regarding the geographical locations of different ethnic groups, creating internal disputes and conflicts that hinder development. In another example, societies that emerged in colonies without solid native populations established better property rights and incentives for long-term investment than those where native populations were large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daron |last=Acemoglu |first2=Simon |last2=Johnson |first3=James A. |last3=Robinson |title=The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1369–401 |year=2001 |doi=10.1257/aer.91.5.1369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human capital and growth===
Many theoretical and empirical analyses of economic growth attribute a major role to a country's level of [[human capital]], defined as the skills of the population or the work force.  Human capital has been included in both neoclassical and endogenous growth models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=N. Gregory Mankiw |last=Mankiw |first=N.

A country's level of human capital is difficult to measure, since it is created at home, at school, and on the job.  Economists have attempted to measure human capital using numerous proxies, including the population's level of literacy, its level of numeracy, its level of book production/capita, its average level of formal schooling, its average test score on international tests, and its cumulative depreciated investment in formal schooling.  The most commonly-used measure of human capital is the level (average years) of school attainment in a country, building upon the data development of [[Robert Barro]] and Jong-Wha Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barro |first=Robert J. |first2=Jong-Wha |last2=Lee |year=2001 |title=International Data on Educational Attainment: Updates and Implications |journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=541–63 |doi=10.1093/oep/53.3.541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This measure is widely used because Barro and Lee provide data for numerous countries in five-year intervals for a long period of time.

One problem with the schooling attainment measure is that the amount of human capital acquired in a year of schooling is not the same at all levels of schooling and is not the same in all countries.  This measure also presumes that human capital is only developed in formal schooling, contrary to the extensive evidence that families, neighborhoods, peers, and health also contribute to the development of human capital.  Despite these potential limitations, Theodore Breton has shown that this measure can represent human capital in log-linear growth models because across countries GDP/adult has a log-linear relationship to average years of schooling, which is consistent with the log-linear relationship between workers' personal incomes and years of schooling in the [[Mincer earnings function|Mincer model]].&lt;ref name=Theodore&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breton |first=Theodore R. |year=2015 |title=Higher Test Scores or More Schooling?

[[Eric Hanushek]] and Dennis Kimko introduced measures of students' mathematics and science skills from international assessments into growth analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanushek |first=Eric A. |first2=Dennis D. |last2=Kimko |year=2000 |title=Schooling, Labor Force Quality, and the Growth of Nations |journal=American Economic Review |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=1184–208 |doi=10.1257/aer.90.5.1184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They found that this measure of human capital was very significantly related to economic growth.  Eric Hanushek and [[Ludger Wößmann]] have extended this analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanushek |first=Eric A. |first2=Ludger |last2=Woessmann |year=2008 |title=The Role of Cognitive Skills in Economic Development |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=607–68 |doi=10.1257/jel.46.3.607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanushek |first=Eric A. |first2=Ludger |last2=Woessmann |year=2011 |title=How Much Do Educational Outcomes Matter in OECD Countries? |journal=Economic Policy |volume=26 |issue=67 |pages=427–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0327.2011.00265.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Theodore Breton shows that the correlation between economic growth and students' average test scores in Hanushek and Wößmann's analyses is actually due to the relationship in countries with less than eight years of schooling.  He shows that economic growth is not correlated with average scores in more educated countries.&lt;ref name=Theodore/&gt; Hanushek and Wößmann further investigate whether the relationship of knowledge capital to economic growth is causal. They show that the level of students' cognitive skills can explain the slow growth in Latin America and the rapid growth in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hanushek | first = Eric | last2 = Woessmann | first2 = Ludger | title = The Knowledge Capital of Nations: Education and the Economics of Growth | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | year = 2015 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rIhLCAAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-262-02917-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy economic theories hold that rates of energy consumption and energy efficiency are linked causally to economic growth.

==Importance of long-run growth==
Over long periods of time, even small rates of [[exponential growth|growth]], such as a 2% annual increase, have large effects. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a 1.97% average annual increase in its inflation-adjusted GDP between 1830 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Officer, "What Was the U.K. GDP Then?" MeasuringWorth, 2011. URL:http://www.measuringworth.com/ukgdp/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, the GDP was 41,373 million pounds. It grew to 1,330,088 million pounds by 2008. A growth rate that averaged 1.97% over 178 years resulted in a 32-fold increase in GDP by 2008.

The large impact of a relatively small growth rate over a long period of time is due to the power of [[exponential growth]]. The [[rule of 72]], a mathematical result, states that if something grows at the rate of x% per year, then its level will double every 72/x years. For example, a growth rate of 2.5% per annum leads to a doubling of the GDP within 28.8 years, whilst a growth rate of 8% per year leads to a doubling of GDP within 9 years. Thus, a small difference in economic growth rates between countries can result in very different standards of living for their populations if this small difference continues for many years.

===Quality of life===
One theory that relates economic growth with quality of life is the "Threshold Hypothesis", which states that economic growth up to a point brings with it an increase in quality of life. But at that point – called the threshold point – further economic growth can bring with it a deterioration in quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Growth and Quality of Life: A Threshold Hypothesis|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.321.4576&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in an upside-down-U-shaped curve, where the vertex of the curve represents the level of growth that should be targeted. Happiness has been shown to increase with a higher [[GDP per capita]], at least up to a level of $15,000 per person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 "In Pursuit of Happiness Research. Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy?"] [[The Cato Institute]]. April 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic growth has the indirect potential to alleviate [[poverty]], as a result of a simultaneous increase in employment opportunities and increased [[labor productivity]].&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Claire Melamed, Renate Hartwig and Ursula Grant 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5752&amp;title=jobs-growth-poverty-employment Jobs, growth and poverty: what do we know, what don't we know, what should we know?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; A study by researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) of 24 countries that experienced growth found that in 18 cases, poverty was alleviated.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

In some instances, quality of life factors such as healthcare outcomes and educational attainment, as well as social and political liberties, do not improve as economic growth occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drèze|first1=Jean|last2=Sen|first2=Amartya|title=An uncertain glory India and its contradictions|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400848775}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=May 2016}}

Productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the [[United States]], where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

===Business cycle===
{{Details|Business cycle}}

Economists distinguish between short-run economic changes in [[production (economics)|production]] and long-run economic growth. Short-run variation in economic growth is termed the ''[[business cycle]]''. Generally, economists attribute the ups and downs in the business cycle to fluctuations in [[aggregate demand]]. In contrast, economic growth is concerned with the long-run trend in production due to structural causes such as technological growth and factor accumulation.

===Income equality===
{{POV section|date=September 2015|talk=RFC on relation of inequality to growth}}
{{Details|Economic inequality}}

Some theories developed in the 1970s suggested possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development.&lt;ref name=BergOstryEE&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Berg |first= Andrew G. |last2= Ostry |first2= Jonathan D. |year= 2011 |title= Equality and Efficiency |journal= Finance and Development |volume= 48 |issue= 3 |publisher= International Monetary Fund |url= http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/berg.htm |accessdate= July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BergOstrySD&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Berg |first2=Jonathan |last2=Ostry |year=2017 |title=Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin |journal=IMF Economic Review |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=792–815 |doi=10.1057/s41308-017-0030-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaldor |first=Nicoals |year=1955 |title=Alternative Theories of Distribution |journal=Review of Economic Studies |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=83–100 |doi=10.2307/2296292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later analysis, such as the political economy approach, developed by Alesina and Rodrik (1994) and Persson and Tabellini (1994), stressed the negative impacts of inequality on economic development; inequality generates a pressure to adopt redistributive policies that have an adverse effect on investment and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alesina |first=Alberto |first2=Dani |last2=Rodrik |year=1994 |title=Distributive Politics and Economic Growth |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=65–90 |doi=10.2307/2118470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Persson |first=Torsten |first2=Guido |last2=Tabellini |year=1994 |title=Is Inequality Harmful for Growth? |journal=American Economic Review |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=600–21 |jstor=2118070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, empirical tests of an extended version of Alesina and Rodrik's model by Li and Zou found that "income inequality is positively, and most of the time significantly, associated with economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hongyi |last=Li |first2=Heng‐fu |last2=Zou |doi=10.1111/1467-9361.00045 |title=Income Inequality Is Not Harmful for Growth: Theory and Evidence |journal=Review of Developmental Economics |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=318–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The credit market imperfection approach, developed by [[Oded Galor|Galor]] and Zeira (1993), argued that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galor |first=Oded |first2=Joseph |last2=Zeira |year=1993 |title=Income Distribution and Macroeconomics |journal=Review of Economic Studies |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=35–52 |doi=10.2307/2297811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Perotti (1996) showed that in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, while lower level of human capital is associated with lower growth and lower levels of economic growth. In contrast, his examination of the political economy channel found no support for the political economy mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perotti |first=Roberto |year=1996 |title=Growth, Income Distribution, and Democracy: What the Data Say |journal=Journal of Economic Growth |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=149–87 |doi=10.1007/BF00138861 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 review stated that high inequality lowers growth, perhaps because it increases social and political instability; however, changes in the degree of inequality have a relatively minor effect on growth.&lt;ref name="The New Growth Evidence"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Temple | first1 = J | year = 1999 | title = The New Growth Evidence | journal = Journal of Economic Literature | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–56 | doi = 10.1257/jel.37.1.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by [[Robert Barro]], found that there is "little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment". According to Barro, high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inequality and Growth in a Panel of Countries |journal=Journal of Economic Growth |year=2000 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–32 |first=Robert J. |last=Barro |doi=10.1023/A:1009850119329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton economist Roland Benabou's research shows that inequality does not matter per se to growth, but "inequality in the relative distribution of earnings and political power" does matter.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

According to Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry (2011) of the [[International Monetary Fund]], inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with subsequent economic growth.&lt;ref name="BergOstryEE" /&gt; Likewise, economists Dierk Herzer and Sebastian Vollmer found that increased income inequality reduces economic growth, but growth itself also increases income inequality in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herzer | first1 = Dierk | last2 = Vollmer | first2 = Sebastian | year = 2013 | title = Rising top incomes do not raise the tide | journal = Journal of Policy Modeling | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 504–19 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpolmod.2013.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, French economist [[Thomas Piketty]] postulated that in periods when the average annual rate on return on investment in capital (''r'') exceeds the average annual growth in economic output (''g''), the rate of inequality will increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piketty|first1=Thomas|title=Capital in the Twenty-first Century.|date=2014|publisher=Brilliance Audio|isbn=1491534656}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piketty, this is the case because wealth that is already held or inherited, which is expected to grow at the rate ''r'', will grow at a rate faster than wealth accumulated through labor, which is more closely tied to ''g''. An advocate of reducing inequality levels, Piketty suggests levying a global [[wealth tax]] in order to reduce the divergence in wealth caused by inequality.

====Equitable growth====
{{Main|Inclusive growth}}

While acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], [[poverty reduction]] and the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]], it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Claire Melamed, Kate Higgins and Andy Sumner (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4892&amp;title=millennium-development-goals-equitable-growth-policy-brief Economic growth and the MDGs] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anand|first1=Rahul|title=Inclusive growth revisited: Measurement and evolution|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/inclusive-growth-revisited-measurement-and-evolution|accessdate=13 January 2015|work=VoxEU.org|publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research|date=17 August 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anand|first1=Rahul|title=Inclusive Growth: Measurement and Determinants|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13135.pdf|number=WP/13/135|publisher=International Monetary Fund|location=Asia Pacific Department|accessdate=13 January 2015|series=IMF Working Paper|date=May 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the [[growth elasticity of poverty]] – can depend on the existing level of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranieri|first1=Rafael|last2=Ramos|first2=Raquel Almeida|title=Inclusive Growth: Building up a Concept|date=March 2013|volume=104|url=http://www.ipc-undp.org/pub/IPCWorkingPaper104.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2015|series=Working Paper|publisher=International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth|location=Brazil|issn=1812-108X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourguignon, Francois, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9w_lZjWGYNMC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27#PPA1,M1 "Growth Elasticity of Poverty Reduction: Explaining Heterogeneity across Countries and Time Periods"] in ''Inequality and Growth'', Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Ravallion, M.

=={{visible anchor|Environmental impact|Environmental impacts}}==
{{See also|The Limits to Growth}}
Critics such as the [[Club of Rome]] argue that a narrow view of economic growth, combined with globalization, is creating a scenario where we could see a systemic collapse of our planet's natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Donella H. Meadows, Jorgen Randers, Dennis L. Meadows. ''Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update''. White River Junction, Vermont : Chelsea Green, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan Schnaiberg. ''The Environment: From Surpus to Scarcity''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uneconomic Growth diagram.jpg|thumb|The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured.]]
Concerns about negative environmental effects of growth have prompted some people to advocate lower levels of growth, or the abandoning of growth altogether. In academia, concepts like [[uneconomic growth]], [[steady-state economy]] and [[degrowth]] have been developed in order to achieve this. In politics, [[Green party|green parties]] embrace the [[Global Greens Charter]], recognising that "... the dogma of economic growth at any cost and the excessive and wasteful use of natural resources without considering Earth's carrying capacity, are causing extreme deterioration in the environment and a massive extinction of species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.globalgreens.org/sites/globalgreens.org/files/GG_charter_2012_english.pdf |format=PDF contains full charter |title=Charter of the Global Greens |place=Dakar |date=2012 |website=Global Greens }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

Those more optimistic about the environmental impacts of growth believe that, though localized environmental effects may occur, large-scale ecological effects are minor. The argument, as stated by commentator [[Julian Lincoln Simon]], states that if these global-scale ecological effects exist, human ingenuity will find ways to adapt to them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Ultimate Resource]]'', Julian Simon, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===
{{see also|Economics of global warming}}

Up to the present, there is a close correlation between economic growth and the rate of [[carbon dioxide emissions]] across nations, although there is also a considerable divergence in [[carbon intensity]] (carbon emissions per GDP).&lt;ref&gt;Stern Review, Part III Stabilization. Table 7.1 p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the present, there is also a direct relation between global economic wealth and the rate of global emissions.&lt;ref name="Garrett 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10584-009-9717-9| title = Are there basic physical constraints on future anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide?| journal = Climatic Change| volume = 104| issue = 3–4| page = 437| year = 2009| last1 = Garrett | first1 = T. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Review]] notes that the prediction that, "Under business as usual, global emissions will be sufficient to propel greenhouse gas concentrations to over 550 ppm {{CO2}} by 2050 and over 650–700 ppm by the end of this century is robust to a wide range of changes in model assumptions." The scientific consensus is that planetary ecosystem functioning without incurring dangerous risks requires stabilization at 450–550 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;Stern Review Economics of Climate Change. Part III Stabilization p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, growth-oriented environmental economists propose government intervention into switching sources of energy production, favouring [[wind power|wind]], [[solar power|solar]], [[hydroelectric]], and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]. This would largely confine use of fossil fuels to either domestic cooking needs (such as for kerosene burners) or where [[carbon capture and storage]] technology can be cost-effective and reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaccard |first=M. 
 |year=2005 |title=Sustainable Fossil Fuels |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-67979-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Review]], published by the United Kingdom Government in 2006, concluded that an investment of 1% of GDP (later changed to 2%) would be sufficient to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and that failure to do so could risk climate-related costs equal to 20% of GDP. Because carbon capture and storage are as yet widely unproven, and its long term effectiveness (such as in containing carbon dioxide 'leaks') unknown, and because of current costs of alternative fuels, these policy responses largely rest on faith of technological change.

British conservative politician and journalist [[Nigel Lawson]] has deemed [[carbon emission trading]] an 'inefficient system of [[rationing]]'. Instead, he favours [[carbon tax]]es to make full use of the efficiency of the market. However, in order to avoid the migration of energy-intensive industries, the whole world should impose such a tax, not just Britain, Lawson pointed out. There is no point in taking the lead if nobody follows suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtclimate/170/7051604.htm|title=Examination of Witnesses (Questions 32–39)|date=16 May 2007|accessdate=2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declining resource quality===
{{See also |Mining |Peak minerals}}
Resource quality is composed of a variety of factors including ore grades, location, altitude above or below sea level, proximity to railroads, highways, water supply and climate. These factors affect the capital and operating cost of extracting resources. In the case of minerals, lower grades of mineral resources are being extracted, requiring higher inputs of capital and energy for both extraction and processing.  Copper ore grades have declined significantly over the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process

Offshore oil and gas have exponentially increased cost as water depth increases.

==Physical constraints==
{{See also | Steady-state economy#Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth}}
Some physical scientists like [[Albert Allen Bartlett|Al Bartlett]] regard continuous economic [[Exponential growth#Limitations of models|growth]] as unsustainable.&lt;ref name="Bartlett 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albartlett.org/presentations/arithmetic_population_energy.html |title=Arithmetic, Population and Energy |last=Bartlett |first=Albert Allen |authorlink=Albert Allen Bartlett |publisher=albartlett.org |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-07-22 |quote=You cannot sustain population growth and / or growth in the rates of consumption of resources.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/07/galactic-scale-energy/ |title=Galactic-Scale Energy |last=Murphy |first=Tom |work=Do the Math |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2014-07-22 |quote=continued growth in energy use becomes physically impossible within conceivable timeframes ... all economic growth must similarly end. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors may constrain economic growth – for example: finite, peaked, or [[resource depletion|depleted resources]].

[[Malthusianism|''Malthusians'']] such as [[William R. Catton, Jr.]] are skeptical of technological advances that improve resource availability. Such advances and increases in efficiency, they suggest, merely accelerate the drawing down of finite resources. Catton claims that increasing rates of resource extraction are "...stealing ravenously from the future".&lt;ref&gt;"Overshoot" by William Catton, p. 3 [1980]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9605">An '''environmental profit and loss account''' ('''E P&amp;L''') is a company's monetary valuation and analysis of its [[environmental impact]]s including its [[business operations]] and its [[supply chain]] from [[Life-cycle assessment#Cradle-to-gate|cradle-to-gate]].
An E P&amp;L internalizes externalities and monetizes the cost of business to nature by accounting for the [[ecosystem services]] a business depends on to operate in addition to the cost of direct and indirect negative impacts on the environment.  The primary purpose of an E P&amp;L is to allow managers and stakeholders to see the magnitude of these impacts and where in the supply chain they occur.

The E P&amp;L analysis provides a metric to measure and monitor the footprint of the company's operations and suppliers all the way to the initial raw materials.  It is a tool to build awareness of the importance of nature to the sustainability of businesses; enhance visibility across a company's supply chain and deepen understanding to focus sustainability efforts and implement better-informed operational decisions; improve specificity for risk management regarding environmental dependencies and impacts; and support a more [[holistic view]] of a company's performance, while bringing clarity and transparency to stakeholders at all levels and identifying new opportunities to enhance the sustainability of a company's products.

== Background ==
Conceived by PUMA Chairman, [[Jochen Zeitz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/18/puma-jochen-zeitz-environment-footprint_n_1101126.html|title=Puma Reveals Its £124m Ecological Footprint|date=19 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched by Sportlifestyle company PUMA and its parent company's sustainability initiative (PPR HOME), the first-ever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/puma-value-environmental-impact-biodiversity|title=Puma world's first major company to put a value on its environmental impact|first=Jo|last=Confino|date=16 May 2011|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; E P&amp;L was conducted on 2010 data and released in two phases. In May 2011 the valuation of PUMA's 2010 [[Greenhouse Gas]] Emissions (GHG) and water usage was announced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13410397|title=Puma reveals environmental impact|first=Richard|last=Anderson|date=16 May 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed in November 2011, by PUMA's overall E P&amp;L,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15756080|title=Puma costs environmental impact|date=16 November 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also included valuation results for other forms of [[air pollution]], [[land conversion]] and waste.

Simultaneously, the PPR Group announced in November 2011 that a Group E P&amp;L would be implemented across its Luxury and Sport &amp; Lifestyle brands by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/11/18/gucci-ysl-follow-puma-revealing-environmental-impact-costs|title=Gucci, YSL to Follow Puma in Revealing Environmental Impact Costs|first=Leslie|last=Guevarra|date=18 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
The E P&amp;L and the associated methodology were developed with the support of [[PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP]] and [[Trucost]] PLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-style.com/analysis/supply-chain-weighs-on-pumas-first-green-accounts_id111097.aspx|title=Supply chain weighs on Puma's first green accounts|date=17 May 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The E P&amp;L used existing input-output models and developed new valuation methodologies, building on a large volume of work in the fields of environmental and natural resource economics such as [[TEEB]], the UN study on [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]]. 

Kering, the parent company for Puma, has released its Environmental Profit and Loss Accounting methodology in an open source mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/37967-Kering-Open-Sources-Environmental-Profit-and-Loss-Account-Methodology-to-Catalyse-Corporate-Natural-Capital-Accounting|accessdate=13 August 2016|title=Kering Open-Sources Environmental Profit and Loss Account Methodology to Catalyse Corporate Natural Capital Accounting|date=May 19, 2015|author=Kering|via=CSRWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kering.com/sites/default/files/document/kering_epandl_methodology_and_group_results.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2016|title=Kering Environmental Profit &amp; Loss}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novo Nordisk]] is another company that has released its environmental profit and loss account&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2014/02/978-87-93178-02-1.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2016|title=Novo Nordisk’s environmental profit and loss account|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and methodology report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2014/02/978-87-93178-03-8.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2016|title=Methodology report for Novo Nordisk’s environmental profit and loss account|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 annual report of Philips mentioned that the company had an environmental impact of Euro 7.2 billion for that year. This assessment was made through an Environmental Profit and Loss Accounting process. The company mentioned that this monetary value has not considered various practices that has environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philips.com/c-dam/corporate/about-philips/sustainability/downloads/ecovision-methodologies/EPL-Account-methodology-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engagement ==
The UK government used the PUMA E P&amp;L as a case study for sustainable business in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair ([[DEFRA]]) Natural Environment White Paper in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Web/20114243.htm|title=U.K. Government White Paper Calls for Tracking Green Losses, Gains|date=22 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, [[Pavan Sukhdev]] who was the Study Leader of TEEB and the Special Advisor and Head of UNEP's Green Economy Initiative, referred to the PUMA E P&amp;L in his TED presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/pavan_sukhdev_what_s_the_price_of_nature.html|title=Put a value on nature!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sustainability authority, [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] includes the PUMA E P&amp;L in his "The Future Quotient: 50 Stars in Seriously Long-Term Innovation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111042028/http://www.thecro.com/content/future-quotient|title=The Future Quotient|work=CR Magazine|archivedate=11 January 2012|publisher=|url=http://www.thecro.com/content/future-quotient|author=John Elkington|author2=Charmian Love|author3=Alastair Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the October issue of ''[[The Harvard Business Review]]'' the PUMA E P&amp;L is included in "The Sustainable Economy" by [[Yvon Chouinard]], Jib Ellison, and Rick Ridgeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peoplesgrocery.org/fmd/files/Sustainable%20Economy%20HBR%20Oct%202011.pdf | title=The Sustainable Economy | work=The Harvard Business Review | date=October 2011 | author1=Yvon Chouinard|author2=Jib Ellison|author3=Rick Ridgeway | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112041748/http://www.peoplesgrocery.org/fmd/files/Sustainable%20Economy%20HBR%20Oct%202011.pdf | archivedate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Winter 2012 issue, the ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]'' published "Connecting Heart to Head" by Ram Nidumolu, [[Kevin Kramer]], &amp; Jochen Zeitz. The PUMA E P&amp;L is included as a business case study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/connecting_heart_to_head|title=Connecting Heart to Head (SSIR)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Jochen Zeitz spoke at His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales' Accounting For Sustainability Forum about the PUMA E P &amp;L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFVIv-32G8|title=Jochen Zeitz, CEO Sport and Lifestyle Group, CSO of PPR and Chairman of the Board of PUMA|first=|last=ThePrincesA4S|date=21 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puma's EP&amp;L accounting process has influenced other companies attempting natural capital accounting &lt;ref&gt;https://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/connecting-finance-and-natural-capital-case-study-for-eftec-natural-capital-statements/&lt;/ref&gt;. A smartphone app has been made available, free of cost, to help students of design and fashion, to understand the environmental impacts&lt;ref&gt;https://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/kering-and-parsons-school-of-design-develop-free-epl-app-for-fashion-students/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Critique ==
An assessment report indicated that preparing an EP&amp;L report can be expensive, while benefits being derived from the process is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bsl-lausanne.ch/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AssesofPotLimitationsValuExFinal-Report.pdf | title=Assessment of potentials and limitations in valuation of externalities | date=2014 | isbn=978-87-93178-33-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; EP&amp;L Accounting has also been considered as a first step in the process of ensuring that prices reflect the use of environmental goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ep_l.pdf | title=The Case for Environmental Profit and Loss Accounting | publisher=IUCN | author=Nathalie Olsen Head}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filipinos in Kuwait''' are either migrants from or descendants of the [[Philippines]] living in [[Kuwait]]. As of 2012, there are roughly 180,000 of these Filipinos in Kuwait.&lt;ref name="Arab1"/&gt; Most people in the Filipino community are migrant workers,&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=68858 Kuwait grants amnesty to illegal aliens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209230026/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=68858 |date=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and approximately 60% of Filipinos in Kuwait are employed as [[domestic worker]]s.&lt;ref name="Arab1"/&gt;

==Overseas employment==
In 2016, Kuwait was the sixth-largest destination of [[Overseas Filipino]] workers, with 90,000 hired or rehired in the nation in 2011, and accordingly Kuwait has been an important source of [[remittance]]s back to the Philippines, with over $105 million [[United States dollar|USD]] being remitted in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/publications/AG%202012-04%20-%20OFW.pdf|title=Overseas Filipino Workers At A Glance|date=May 2012|publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]]|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KCIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcic-asia.com/UserFiles/file/KCIC%20%20Weekly%20Analysis%20-%20May%2030%202010.pdf|title=Philippine Remittances Rising Despite Declines from Kuwait and Hong Kong|last=Zhang|first=Thomas|year=2010|publisher=Kuwait China Investment Company|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Filipino banks have [[correspondent account]]s with banks in Kuwait to allow for remittance transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smc.org.ph/MAPID/MAPID%20CD/Italy%20pdf%20file/012.III.3%20ANNEX%201%20Philippine%20Banks%20with%20Remittance%20Network%20Abroad.pdf|title=Philippine Banks With Remittance Networks Abroad|publisher=Scalabrini Migration Center|pages=5|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Filipino Worker's Resource Center (FWRC) located in [[Jabriya]], and it provides refuge for Filipino workers in Kuwait who have "[experienced] various forms of maltreatment from their employers such as fatigue, non-payment of salaries,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/184406/reftab/96/t/Seventy-distressed-HSWs-repatriated-to-Philippines/Default.aspx|title=Seventy Distressed HSWs Repatriated To Philippines|date=12 June 2012|publisher=Arab Times|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "lack of food [and] physical, verbal and sexual abuse".&lt;ref name="Arab2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/170034/reftab/96/t/131-distressed-Pinoys-fly-home-to-Philippines/Default.aspx|title=131 Distressed Pinoys Fly Home To Philippines|date=7 June 2012|publisher=Arab Times|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through assistance from the FWRC, the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait, the [[Philippine Overseas Employment Administration]], and Overseas Workers' Welfare Administration, hundreds of Filipinos in Kuwait have been repatriated to the Philippines due to these issues.&lt;ref name="Arab2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/274878/pinoyabroad/news/dfa-31-ofws-repatriated-from-kuwait-400-more-to-come-home-soon|title=DFA: 31 OFWs repatriated from Kuwait, 400 more to come home soon|date=20 September 2012|publisher=GMA News|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipino domestic servants in Kuwait are the most expensive overseas servants that can be hired, due to a minimum wage requirement by the Filipino government as well as high costs from recruitment agencies.&lt;ref name="KT1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=NTY1MjYxNTUzOQ|title=Cost of hiring maids rises sharply|last=Fattahova|first=Nawara|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Kuwait Times|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimum monthly wage of a Filipino maid is [[Kuwaiti dinar|KWD]] 110 per month ($365 USD), with an initial recruitment cost of KWD 850 ($2825 USD), with the price varying based on previous experience.&lt;ref name="KT1"/&gt;

The beginning of '''Georgian nationalism''' can be traced to the middle of the 19th century, when [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] [[Georgia under the Russian Empire|was part]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. From being more culture-focused in the Imperial Russian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] periods, it went through several phases, evolving into radical [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnocentric]] in the late 1980s and early in the post-Soviet independence years, and to a more inclusive and [[Civic nationalism|civic-oriented]] form in the mid-1990s.

== Emergence ==
Modern Georgian nationalism emerged in the middle of the 19th century as a reaction to the Russian annexation of fragmented Georgian polities, which terminated their precarious independence, but brought to the Georgians unity under a single authority, relative peace and stability. The first to inspire national revival were aristocratic poets, whose [[Romanticism|romanticist]] writings were imbued with patriotic laments. After a series of ill-fated attempts at revolt, especially, after the failed [[1832 Georgian plot|coup plot of 1832]], the Georgian elites reconciled with the Russian rule, while their calls for national awakening were rechanneled through cultural efforts. In the 1860s, the new generation of Georgian intellectuals, educated at Russian universities and exposed to European ideas, promoted national culture against assimilation by the Imperial center. Led by the literati such as [[Ilia Chavchavadze]], their program attained more nationalistic colors as the nobility declined and capitalism progressed, further stimulated by the rule of the Russian bureaucracy and economic and demographic dominance of the Armenian middle class in the capital city of [[Tbilisi]]. Chavchavadze and his associates called for the unity of all Georgians and put national interests above class and provincial divisions. Their vision did not envisage an outright revolt for independence, but demanded autonomy within the reformed Russian Empire, with greater cultural freedom, promotion of the Georgian language, and support for Georgian educational institutions and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|national church]], whose independence had been suppressed by the Russian government.{{sfn|Sabanadze|2010|loc=[http://books.openedition.org/ceup/573?lang=en#bodyftn5 Online]}}

Despite their advocacy of ethnic culture and demographic grievances over Russian and Armenian dominance in Georgia's urban centers, a program of the early Georgian nationalists was inclusive and preferred non-confrontational approach to inter-ethnic issues. Some of them, such as [[Niko Nikoladze]], envisaged the creation of a free, decentralized, and self-governing federation of the Caucasian peoples based on the principle of ethnically proportional representation.{{sfn|Sabanadze|2010|loc=[http://books.openedition.org/ceup/573?lang=en#bodyftn13 Online]}}

The idea of Caucasian federation within the reformed Russian state was also voiced by the ideologues of Georgian [[social democracy]], who came to dominate Georgian political landscape by the closing years of the 19th century. Initially, the [[Social Democratic Party of Georgia|Georgian Social Democrats]] were opposed to nationalism and viewed it as a rival ideology, but they remained proponents of [[self-determination]].{{sfn|Sabanadze|2010|loc=[http://books.openedition.org/ceup/573?lang=en#bodyftn25 Online]}} In the words of the historian [[Stephen F. Jones]], "it was socialism in Georgian colors with priority given to the defense of national culture."{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=254}} The Georgian social-democrats were very active in [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party|all-Russian socialist movement]] and after its split in 1905 sided with the [[Menshevik]] faction adhering to relatively liberal ideas of their Western European colleagues.{{sfn|Sabanadze|2010|loc=[http://books.openedition.org/ceup/573?lang=en#bodyftn21 Online]}}

== First Georgian republic ==
The [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution of 1917]] was perceived by the Georgian Mensheviks, led by [[Noe Zhordania]], as a breach of links between Russia and Europe.{{sfn|Sabanadze|2010|loc=[http://books.openedition.org/ceup/573?lang=en#bodyftn21 Online]}} When they declared Georgia an [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|independent democratic republic]] on 26 May 1918, they viewed the move as a tragic inevitability against the background of unfolding geopolitical realities.{{sfn|Sabanadze|2010|loc=[http://books.openedition.org/ceup/573?lang=en#bodyftn21 Online]}} 

As the new state faced a series of domestic and international challenges, the internationalist Social-Democratic leadership became more focused on narrower national problems.{{sfn|Sabanadze|2010|loc=[http://books.openedition.org/ceup/573?lang=en#bodyftn32 Online]}}{{sfn|Suny|1994|p=207}} With this reorientation to a form of nationalism, the Georgian republic became a "nationalist/socialist hybrid."{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=254}} The government's efforts to make education and administration more Georgian drew protests from ethnic minorities, further exacerbated by economic hardship and exploited for their political ends by the Bolsheviks who were opposed to the country's sovereignty. The government's response to dissent, including among the ethnic minorities, such as the [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] and [[Ossetians]], was frequently violent and excessive. The decision to resort to military solutions was driven by security concerns rather than readiness to settle ethnic scores.{{sfn|Jones|2009|pp=254–255}} Overall, the Georgian Mensheviks did not turn to authoritarianism and terror.&lt;ref name="suny06"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|title=A tolerant nationalism|journal=St. Petersburg Times|date=27 January 2006|url=http://en.zhamanak.1in.am/article/123/|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the events of that time played an important role in reinforcing stereotypes on all involved sides in the latter-day ethnic conflicts in Georgia.{{sfn|Jones|1997|p=508}}{{sfn|Cornell|2000|p=135}}

== Soviet Georgia ==
After the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] and its [[sovietization]] in 1921, followed by suppression of an [[August Uprising|armed rebellion]] against the new regime in 1924, many leading nationalist intellectuals went in exile in Europe. In the [[Soviet Union]], Georgian nationalism went underground or was rechanneled into cultural pursuits, becoming focused on the issues of language, promotion of education, protection of old monuments, literature, film, and sports. Any open manifestation of local nationalism was repressed by the Soviet state, but it did provide cultural frameworks and, as part of its policy of [[korenizatsiya]], helped institutionalize the Georgians as a "[[titular nationality]]" in the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]], allowing Georgia to develop its own national communist elite and cultural [[intelligentsia]].{{sfn|Sabanadze|2010|loc=[http://books.openedition.org/ceup/573?lang=en#bodyftn35 Online]}}{{sfn|Jones|2009|pp=255–256}} Thus, by maintaining the focus of Georgian nationalism on cultural issues, the Soviet regime was able to prevent it from becoming a political movement until the 1980s ''[[perestroika]]'' period.{{sfn|Jones|2009|pp=255–256}}

The late 1970s saw a re-emergence of Georgian nationalism that clashed with Soviet power. Plans to revise the status of [[Georgian language|Georgian]] as the official language of Soviet Georgia were drawn up in the Kremlin in early 1978, but after stiff and unprecedented public resistance the [[Soviet government|Soviet central government]] abandoned the plans. At the same time, it also abandoned similar revision plans for the official languages in the [[Armenian SSR|Armenian]] and [[Azerbaijani SSR|Azerbaijani SSRs]].

Georgian nationalism was eventually more tolerated during the waning years of the USSR due to [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Mikhail Gorbachev's]] Glasnost policy. The Soviet government attempted to counter the Georgian independence movement in the early 1990s with promises of greater decentralisation from Moscow.

The institution was started in response to the increasing worries of prostitution, the spread of venereal diseases and wavering moral values seen in the country, and sought to "rescue" women or girls who were deemed "[[Prostitution|prostitutes]]" and teach them how to support themselves through industrial training mainly through the laundries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSG00036|title=TheGlasgowStory: Glasgow Magdalene Institution|last=ABACUS|first=Scott Graham -|website=www.theglasgowstory.com|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Institution ==
With its establishment in 1812 it had originated on Parliamentary Road until it moved to [[Lochburn Home]] in 1864 where it remained until its closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/a-magdalene-laundry-that-was-neither-irish-nor-catholic-and-novel-it-inspired-1.2526837|title=A Magdalene laundry that was neither Irish nor Catholic, and novel it inspired|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|last1=Talbot|first1=Theresa|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was non-denominational and was funded by voluntary subscriptions – as well as the income generated from being a working laundry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/a-magdalene-laundry-that-was-neither-irish-nor-catholic-and-novel-it-inspired-1.2526837|title=A Magdalene laundry that was neither Irish nor Catholic, and novel it inspired|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women in the asylum were generally termed as prostitutes, however, it should be noted that this term was used in a very loose manner encompassing not only women who sold sex for money but also single mothers, socialists, mill girls and girls dressed 'immorally'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/nov2000.html|title=Magdalene Institution|website=special.lib.gla.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Glasgow, the Magdalene Asylum evolved into the Magdalene Institution with a new Glasgow System created to deal with court appearance of women who refused to be checked for venereal diseases by policemen. The Lock Hospital was set up in Rottenrow Lane in 1805 to treat women with venereal disease. Meanwhile, the Magdalene Institute took women who were free from syphilis, not pregnant, to be newly ‘fallen’ and willing to submit to discipline.

The Glasgow System, as it became known, saw unprecedented collusion between the local constabulary and the medical authorities. Women under suspicion could be forced to undergo an intimate examination by male police officers; if they showed signs of VD they would be incarcerated in the Lock Hospital without limit of time. Many were never released. The Glasgow system was deemed so successful it was adopted by several cities across Britain. The Lock Hospital didn’t close its doors until 1950.

The fifth annual report of the Magdalene Institute, written in 1864, said it was of “profound regret an of painful surprise” that the “resorts of profligacy should so much abound” in both Glasgow and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-magdalene-asylums-for-fallen-women-1-4382349|title=Scotland’s Magdalene Asylums for "fallen women"|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Glasgow, wayward girls were placed at the Magdalene Institute by parents or probation officers until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-magdalene-asylums-for-fallen-women-1-4382349|title=Scotland’s Magdalene Asylums for "fallen women"|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions Towards the Institution ==
Reactions to the Institution varied over time.

An advertisement in 1888 claimed: "nearly 5,000 young women have shared more or less in the benefits of the Institution since 1859. During the same period no fewer than 1,080 young women have been restored to parents or friends, and 942 have been placed in domestic service or other respectable employment, while thirty-two were sent abroad, thus making 2,054 who have been rescued from a life of shame and restored to society, after having received the usual education and training in the Homes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSG00036|title=TheGlasgowStory: Glasgow Magdalene Institution|last=ABACUS|first=Scott Graham -|website=www.theglasgowstory.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institution went unchecked until 1958 – when it was closed down – after the inmates staged a “riot” amid claims of abuse and ill treatment. The girls were all aged between 15 and 19 years of age and none had been convicted of a criminal offence. Despite this police all over the city were hunting for them and newspaper reports called on the public to be vigilant and look out for the girls, distinctive in their blue dresses and white aprons. Each time the girls were rounded up they staged another breakout, some escaping down the fire escape; others staged a rooftop protest. They vowed to keep escaping until their voices were heard. The “riot” lasted for three days. The final breakout occurred during a visit by officials from the Scottish home department who were investigating the series of events. There was an official inquiry into their claims of beatings, bullying and verbal abuse; as of March 2017 no one has been held accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/a-magdalene-laundry-that-was-neither-irish-nor-catholic-and-novel-it-inspired-1.2526837|title=A Magdalene laundry that was neither Irish nor Catholic, and novel it inspired|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Magdalene Institutions in Scotland, and Beyond ==
At their height the [[Magdalene asylum|Magdalene Asylums]], which were run around the world, had 20 refuges in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-magdalene-asylums-for-fallen-women-1-4382349|title=Scotland’s Magdalene Asylums for "fallen women"|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first in [[Edinburgh]] opened in 1797. In the capital, the charitable organisation, funded by church collections and private donations, opened in the Canongate in the Old Town, a popular location for street prostitutes. In the early 1800s, there were around 200 brothels in Edinburgh. The Magdalene Asylum was “sharply segregated place,” according to Scot-Pep, a sex worker’s rights organisation based in Edinburgh, with prostitutes kept away from those women of a “better order.” Women were kept in solitary confinement for the first three months “to eradicate the taint of moral contagion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-magdalene-asylums-for-fallen-women-1-4382349|title=Scotland’s Magdalene Asylums for "fallen women"|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One resident of the Edinburgh asylum, Mary Paterson, (originally from Glasgow) was murdered by [[Burke and Hare murders|Burke and Hare]] shortly after leaving the institution on 8 April 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-magdalene-asylums-for-fallen-women-1-4382349|title=Scotland’s Magdalene Asylums for "fallen women"|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, the [[Magdalene asylum|Magdalene Asylums]], or Magdalene Laundries, were usually run by Roman Catholic orders and different to the Scottish system. A scandal broke in 1993 after a mass grave containing 155 corpses was found in the convent grounds of one of the laundries in [[Dublin]]. A formal state apology was issued in 2013 and a £50 million compensation scheme for survivors of abuse was set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-magdalene-asylums-for-fallen-women-1-4382349|title=Scotland’s Magdalene Asylums for "fallen women"|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Glasgow Magdalene Institution and Popular Culture ==

The Glasgow Magdalene Institution has inspired popular culture through a novel like ''Penance'' by [[Theresa Talbot]] that was published in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stridentpublishing.co.uk/book-review/penance/|title=Penance - stridentpublishing.co.uk|newspaper=stridentpublishing.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a crime fiction novel based on the Glasgow Magdalene Institution. Theresa Talbot was born and raised in Glasgow to Irish parents and has always had an awareness of the Magdalene Institution. Through initial research for a radio series with the [[BBC]], she began to develop the inspiration and story for her novel. She based the novel as a crime narrative through dramatic licenses to give the women of the Glasgow Magdalene Institution a voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/a-magdalene-laundry-that-was-neither-irish-nor-catholic-and-novel-it-inspired-1.2526837|title=A Magdalene laundry that was neither Irish nor Catholic, and novel it inspired|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8689">There is a small community of '''Greeks in the Czech Republic'''. The Greek presence in [[Czech Republic]] is dated to the 20th century. Roughly 12,000 Greek citizens, mainly from [[Greek Macedonia]] in [[Northern Greece]], who [[refugees of the Greek Civil War|fled from]] the 1946-1949 [[Greek Civil War]] were settled in several formerly German inhabited areas in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloboda|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
The admission of Greek Communist refugees to Czechoslovakia at the end of the 1946-49 [[Greek Civil War]] was facilitated by members of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) living in exile in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. Though they initially expected that the refugees they would soon return to Greece, due to the development of the political situation they could predict no definite end to their stay in Czechoslovakia. As a result, many eventually naturalised as Czechoslovak citizens and generally assimilated, often intermarrying with local Czechs or the small but significant minority of Sudeten Germans allowed to remain in Czechoslovakia following its liberation from Nazi German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Králová|2009|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, these Greek refugees were resettled in houses which had formerly been owned by [[Sudeten Germans]] and were left unoccupied following the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zissaki-Healy|2004|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most were concentrated in or around the towns of Brno (Brünn in German), Ostrava, Opava, and Krnov (Jägendorf in German) in southern Silesia, where Greek farming expertise helped revive agricultural production on lands formerly worked by ethnic Germans. About 5,200 of the migrants consisted of unaccompanied children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloboda|2003|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The migrants were ethnically heterogeneous, consisting not just of [[Greek Macedonians]], [[Pontic Greeks]], and [[Caucasus Greeks]], as well as Slav-Macedonians, but also [[Aromanians in Greece|Aromanians]], [[Sephardi Jews]], and even a few Turkish-speaking Greeks or [[Urums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloboda|2003|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 1975, shortly after the overthrow of the Colonels' dictatorship and a programme of [[Metapolitefsi|political liberalisation in Greece]] which led to the legalisation of the KKE, several thousand young Greeks, including those born in Czechoslovakia, emigrated to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloboda|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older Greeks followed them some years later, after an arrangement was made between the Greek and Czechoslovak governments for them to receive their pensions in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloboda|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, there were just 3,443 people in Czechoslovakia who declared Greek ethnicity; almost all of those were in the Czech portion of the country, with just 65 in the Slovak portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloboda|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of those who did emigrate to (mainly northern) Greece continued to retain strong links with the Czech Republic, with a few even using their dual Greek-Czech national identitities and contacts to help establish trade links between the two countries.

==Language==
In their early days in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, ethnic Greek Macedonian and Slav Macedonian migrants used [[Greek language|Greek]] as their natural [[lingua franca]]; however in orphanages which housed unaccompanied child migrants, it was not uncommon for ethnic Greek children to become [[Multilingualism#Receptive bilingualism|receptively bilingual]] in the Slav-[[Macedonian language]] spoken by their playmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloboda|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, locally born members of the community showed increasing [[language shift]] towards [[Czech language|Czech]], and tended to have a somewhat weaker command of Greek. However, this may also have been a natural consequence of several factors, including: intermarriage with Czechs and Sudeten Germans, the communist Czechoslovak education system's emphasis on Russian as a second language at the expense of providing for minority-language education, and even the fact many ethnic Greek Macedonians residing in Czechoslovakia were actually [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]] and so somewhat more comfortable with the [[Pontic Greek]] dialect rather than the Standard (Demotic) Greek used by the majority of Greek speakers. In situations where families from these communities had ancestors originating in [[Southern Russia]], as was the case with those defined as [[Caucasus Greeks]], there had been a long tradition of using Russian as a second language after Pontic Greek anyway, but this was further reinforced in Soviet-dominated Czechoslovakia by the teaching of Russian in schools. Although a poor command of Modern Greek was previously often evident among the grandchildren of Greek refugees born in the 1980s and later,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloboda|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; those from families who returned to Greece from the mid-70s have now been fully re-assimilated into Greek society and the Modern Greek education system.  In fact, their multi-lingual background has enabled ethnic Greeks from Czechoslovakia (and elsewhere in the former Soviet Bloc) to develop and exploit a marked facility in foreign language learning and communication.


==Next Generation Migration - 2008 Greek economic crisis==

Except of the previous migration because of [[Greek Civil War]], the next generation migration was caused by the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] on 2008. The also known as "Greek brain drain". From 2008 a minimum of 200.000 young educated people left from Greece to find a job in Europe &amp; USA. The more desired countries were UK, Germany, the Netherlands, USA, and of course lot of people came also to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The reason of choosing the Czech Republic and Slovakia is the foreign companies - mostly IT companies - that reside in those countries, companies like AT&amp;T, IBM, RedHat and many more foreign or local companies that have many vacancies for IT people.

==Society aims==
The Guernsey Society aims are to promote, maintain and stimulate interest in all matters concerning the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], its past, present and future - and keeping alive the ''Spirit of Guernsey'' both in the islands and overseas.
*Publish ''The Review of the Guernsey Society'' three times a year - a high quality magazine with articles on Guernsey's past, present and future
*Organise meetings - both formal and informal - in [[Guernsey]], the [[United Kingdom]], and elsewhere
*Provide a network for anyone with an interest in Guernsey&lt;ref&gt;Society Aims - [http://www.guernsey-society.org.uk Guernsey Society web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Society==
The Guernsey Society was formed in 1943 to represent the interests of the island to the British Government during the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German Occupation]], and to establish a network for Guernsey evacuees in the United Kingdom.

The Society was the idea of three Guernseymen based in London: Sir [[Donald Banks]], Air Commodore Henry Le Marchant Brock and Colonel Guy Durand Ozanne. Banks became the first Chairman, and Brock became the first Secretary. Other notable founder members included: actor [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]], Professor [[John Le Patourel]], [[William Arnold (Bailiff)|Sir William Arnold]] and Professor [[Herbert John Fleure|Herbert Fleure]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock, H Le M, ''Twenty One Years Ago'', Quarterly Review of the Guernsey Society, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Society has published a regular magazine since 1945. ''The Bulletin'' appeared eight times during 1945 and 1946. It became ''Quarterly Review of the Guernsey Society'' in January 1947, and continued until 1971, when the frequency was reduced to three times a year, and the title changed to ''The Review of the Guernsey Society''. Since its inception it has published articles from a wide range of respected Guernsey figures including [[Ambrose Sherwill]], [[John Le Patourel]], [[James Marr (author)|James Marr]], [[Marie de Garis]] and [[TF Priaulx]].&lt;ref&gt;Foote, S, ''A Review of the Review'', Review of the Guernsey Society, Summer 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1944, the newly formed Society was instrumental in organising, together with prominent members of the Jersey Society in London, a symposium in Oxford to start planning for the future of the Channel Islands following their liberation from [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|Nazi Occupation]]. The result was the publication of a book, ''Nos Iles'', which was widely read by members of the [[States of Guernsey]] and [[States of Jersey]], and became known as "the Liberation Army's bible".&lt;ref&gt;Read, Brian Ahier, ''Jersey in London'', Seaflower Books, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society has also published a number of books on the island and its history:
*[[Ralph Durand|Durand, R]], ''Guernsey under German Rule'', 1946 - one of the first accounts to be published about life during the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German Occupation]]
*[[Eagleston, AJ]], ''Channel Islands Under Tudor Government'', 1951
*Members of the Guernsey Society, ''The Guernsey Farmhouse'', 1963 - a survey of the architecture of Guernsey farmhouses
*''Guernsey Ways'', 1966 - a selection of articles from the Review, published to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the [[Battle of Hastings]]
*[[James Marr (author)|Marr, LJ]], ''More Guernsey People'', 1992 - the sequel to Marr's ''Guernsey People'' biographical dictionary (published 1984)
* Johnston, Peter ''A Short History of Guernsey'', 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guernsey-society.org.uk/?page_id=500 A Short History of Guernsey], retrieved 15 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ralph Durand|Durand, R]], ''Guernsey under German Rule'', 2018 - the society published a new edition of this work, which had long been out of print, to mark the 75th Anniversary of the society. The new edition includes a Foreword by the Bailiff of Guernsey, [[Richard Collas|Sir Richard Collas]], and an introduction by Vice Chairman, Stephen Foote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guernsey-society.org.uk/?page_id=927 Guernsey Under German Rule] - Guernsey Society website, retrieved 22 Nov 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notability ==
Articles from ''The Review'', as well as other Society publications, have been influential and widely used as source material for authoritative works on the island's history. Examples include:
* ''The Guernsey Farmhouse'' provided the inspiration for John McCormack's ''The Guernsey House''.&lt;ref&gt;McCormack, John, ''The Guernsey House'', Phillimore, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marie de Garis]]' ''Folklore of Guernsey'' started off as a series of articles published in ''The Review'' during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;de Garis, Marie, ''Folklore of Guernsey'', La Société Guernesiaise, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
* The following published doctoral theses cite a number of articles from ''The Review'' amongst their references:
** Stevens-Cox, Gregory, ''St Peter Port 1680-1830: the history of an international entrepot'', Boydell Press (1999)
** Crossan, Rose-Marie, ''Guernsey 1814-1914: Migration and Modernisation'', Boydell Press (2007)
* Edward Chaney's series of articles (1994–95) about [[Gerald Basil Edwards|G B Edwards]], the reclusive author of [[The Book of Ebenezer Le Page]] formed the basis for the authoritative biography ''Genius Friend: G.B. Edwards and The Book of Ebenezer Le Page'', published by [http://www.blueormer.co.uk Blue Ormer Publishing] in 2015.
* The official history of the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands]], commissioned by the governments of [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] in 1970, lists among its references ''Nos Iles'' and Durand's ''Guernsey Under German Rule'' (see above).&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, Charles, ''The German Occupation of the Channel Islands'', Imperial War Museum (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eagleston's book ''The Tudor Administration of the Channel Islands'' is widely cited, and seen as the reference work for this period in the islands' history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12014363537640191578&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en Google Scholar citations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Society organises regular formal and informal meetings in London and Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey Society web site - [http://www.guernsey-society.org.uk/meetings.htm Meetings]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Society launched ''Donkipedia'', a wiki dedicated to the Bailiwick of Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donkipedia.org/ Donkipedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4760">[[Image:Kafna Village.jpg|thumb|300px|Kafna Village.]] 
The '''Irob people''' ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]]: ኢሮብ ''ʾirōb'', also spelled Erob) are an ethnic group who occupy a predominantly highland, mountainous area by the same name in northeastern [[Tigray Region]], Ethiopia. They speak the [[Saho language]]. The majority of them are  [[Ethiopian Catholic Church|Ethiopian Catholic]], and they are largely agriculturalists. The etymology of the name Irob is debatable, but the elders of the Irob say that the term was derived from Saho word "Oroba", meaning "welcome to our house". The boundaries of Irobland are, to an extent, identical to the [[Irob (woreda)|Irob]] woreda; both are bordered by the following areas: Dabri-Mela to the north, Hado to the east, the [[Afar Region]] to the east and south, Shoumezana and [[Gulomahda|Gulomakeda]] to the west, and [[Saesi Tsaedaemba]] to the south. The first two neighbors are Saho speakers and predominantly Muslim, the third are Muslim Afars, and the others are Tigrigna-speaking Christians.

==History==

[[Image:Irob boys in Alitena.jpg|thumb|300px|Irob boys in Alitena.]]  The capital (traditional center) of Irob is [[Alitena]].  Irobs trace their lineage to one man, Summe, son of Neguse Worede-Mehret, who according to the Irob oral history, migrated to the Irobland from Tsira'e in [[Kilite Awla'elo]], a part of Tigray, about 700 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} 

Despite their relatively small population, the Irob have been at the forefront of regional and national politics in Ethiopia. Starting with the [[Zemene Mesafint]], the Irob family of [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Shum]] Agame Woldu dominated Tigrayan politics. The dynasty included [[Dejazmach]] [[Sabagadis|Subagadis]] (whose rule extended to present-day Eritrea), Shum Agame Desta, Ras [[Sebhat Aregawi]], and many others including Emperor [[Yohannes IV]].

During the Italian invasion, Irob patriots, led by individuals such as Dejazmach [[Ayele Sebhat]] and Dejazmach [[Kassa Sebhat]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Mockler recounts how they attacked, and almost destroyed, an Italian column that had advanced from southern Eritrea, across the [[Danakil Depression]], to reach the edge of the [[Ethiopian highlands]].  (''Haile Selassie's War'' [New York: Olive Branch Press, 2003], pp. 66f)&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the anti-Italian resistance movement from their base on [[Mount Asimba]].  

In more recent times, many Irobs, such as Dr. [[Tesfay Debessay]], who was a leader of the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party]] (EPRP), played an important role in the struggle waged against the dictatorial junta led by Colonel [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]. 

[[Image:Assimba mountain in the distance.jpg|thumb|300px|Assimba mountain from a distance.]][[Image:Aiga Village.JPG|thumb|300px|Aiga Village.]] Moreover, the Irobland proper, particularly around the Assimba and Aiga localities, served as a base for several Ethiopian revolutionary movements, including EPRP and the [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]](TPLF). Aiga is also the location of significant battles during the Ethio-Eritrean border war (1998–2000), which ultimately lead to the removal of occupying Eritrean forces from the region.

==Lifestyle and Culture==

The Irob are divided into three major subgroup,s or ''Are'' (Houses): Adgadi-Are, Buknaiti-Are and Hasaballa. The Adgadi-Are and Hasaballa are predominantly Orthodox Christians, while Bouknaiti-Are consist of Catholics. 

The Irob economy is primarily based on agriculture, including animal husbandry.  The region is also renowned for its excellent honey.  In fact, the Miess /[[Tej]] or local "Beer"(honey-wine) made from the honey is praised throughout the region for its quality. 

In general, the Irob are a bicultural community.  With their Saho-speaking neighbors, they share a common language and certain social structures, such as a clan division system called ''Mela'', and the title ''Ona'' for their regional leaders. Many other cultural practices, including wedding ceremonies, dress, dance, and food; however, are more similar to their Tigrigna-speaking neighbors specially with the peoples of Agame. 

Irobs also have distinctive customs. For example, they have an elaborate poetry-telling tradition called ''Adar''.  The Irob men have a dance/step routine called ''Hora'' and ''Alkafo'', which was traditionally performed in preparation for battles and still commonly displayed during weddings and other ceremonies.

'''Koreans in the Arab world''' used to form a major part of the worldwide [[Korean diaspora]]. [[Koreans]] started coming to the [[Arab world]] in large numbers in early 1970s as [[foreign worker|migrant labourers]]; between 1975 and 1985, 1.1 million Koreans came for work, which made it the third-most popular destination for Korean emigrants.&lt;ref name="Seok"&gt;{{harvnb|Seok|1991|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVHnp2XSeioC&amp;pg=PA56 56]–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, most returned home or moved on to other countries, and {{as of|2014|lc=on}}, the [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]]'s own figures showed over 24 thousand of their nationals living in the region. However, [[South Korea]]n nationals are present in all of the region's countries, and [[North Korea]]n workers also have a growing presence in several of them.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011Overall"/&gt;

==History==
Though Korea had a long history of trading contact with the [[Arab world]] by means of intermediaries, there were no recorded Korean visitors before 1959, when two [[Islam in Korea|Korean Muslims]] went to [[Mecca]] for the [[hajj]].&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the first South Korean firm won a contract in the region, for highway construction in Saudi Arabia, and imported 218 South Korean construction workers, the first Korean residents, to assist in the project. The following year, 3,593 South Koreans went to Saudi Arabia for work. By 1977, migrants to Saudi Arabia alone composed nearly one-fifth of all registered emigration from South Korea, making it the third-most popular destination for emigrants (the top two being [[Japan]] and the [[United States]], each of which had longstanding Korean communities, [[Korean Americans]] and [[Zainichi Korean]]s).&lt;ref name="Bonacich"&gt;{{harvnb|Bonacich|Light|1991|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in the South Korean migrant worker population reflected a deliberate policy of the government to promote manpower exports; they had established a special department for this purpose as early as the mid-1960s, and in the 1970s, construction enterprises were given priority in order to facilitate their entry into overseas markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Park|1998|pp=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over two dozen [[list of South Korean companies|South Korean companies]] employed migrant labour, the largest such employer being [[Hyundai Construction]]; Koreans were described as having a "competitive advantage" over workers of other nationalities due to their discipline and level of skill, which some commentators attributed to South Korea's practise of universal male [[conscription]]. Unlike their Western competitors, Koreans worked around the clock in shifts; huge lighting systems were installed to facilitate night work.&lt;ref name="Steers"&gt;{{harvnb|Steers|1999|pp=107–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of migrants showed that 73% were between 25 and 40 years old; under half (48%) of the regular workers were married, while 69% of contract workers were.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seok|1991|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVHnp2XSeioC&amp;pg=58 58]–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The receiving countries were concerned about the effect that long-term residence of migrant workers could have on their societies; they preferred Korean workers because they were unaccompanied by family members and so stayed only for short periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Park|1998|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical length of an assignment in the region was three years.&lt;ref name="Steers"/&gt; Migration to the region would peak in 1982 and 1983.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; Wages were around four to five million won, roughly twice what could be earned in South Korea at the time, and workers typically remitted 80% of their salaries. Families used saved remittances to purchase houses or start businesses. However, migration was not a success for everyone: roughly one-in-ten workers returned from the Middle East reported a decrease in income, usually due to inability to find suitable work. The hot, dry climate and long work hours also resulted in health problems for many workers, and the medical bills whittled away at their savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seok|Yang|1992|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors in the late 1980s contributed to decreasing the amount of Korean migration. Increasing labour unrest initiated by South Korean workers provided one stimulus for the localisation of the workforce.&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt; South Korea's rising labour costs were another reason. During the latter half of the 1980s, the proportion of Korean labourers working on construction projects for Hyundai declined from 70% to only 20-30% during the 1980s, with the shortfall being taken up by local labourers instead.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kwon|O'Donnell|2001|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, only 56,000 South Korean migrant workers went abroad to any destination, a drop of over 70% since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Park|1998|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, the wage gap between South Korea and the rich countries of the Middle East had largely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seok|Yang|1992|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Korean population would shrink over the following decade before rebounding slightly to 13,008 by 2009. Over the next two years, the population would show rapid growth of nearly 27%, reaching 16,461 by 2011. Nearly three-quarters of that recent population growth was driven by increased migration to the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011Overall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MOFAT2009"&gt;{{harvnb|MOFAT|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in an echo of the South Korean policy of the 1970s and 1980s, the North Korean government has also been sending its workers abroad to earn hard currency for their country recently. {{As of|2009}}, there were estimated to be six thousand North Korean workers in various Arab countries, including Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen; like the South Koreans two decades earlier, they also work primarily in construction-related trades such as welding and carpentry.&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo20091225"&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/12/25/2009122500238.html|title=N.

==By country==

===Bahrain===
Bahrain was a minor destination for South Korean migrant workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; South Korea used to have an embassy in Bahrain from 1976 to 1999, but closed it in a round of cost-cutting measures after the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. However, South Korean companies continued to do business in various fields in Bahrain, including construction, heavy industry, power, [[desalination]] plants and [[electronic engineering]].&lt;ref name="GDN20120206"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=323148|title=New education exchange plans are on the way|periodical=Gulf Daily News|date=2012-02-06|accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, there were only about 70 South Koreans in Bahrain, primarily corporate assignees. However, the small population was enough to support a single Korean supermarket as well as a few Korean restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sf.koreatimes.com/article/54502|title=바레인 한인사회|work=Korea Times|date=2001-10-25|accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, South Korean consular statistics recorded 282 of their nationals living in Bahrain. Four had Bahraini nationality, while the other 278 were on temporary visas. Their population grew by about 15% since 2009. There were no [[international student]]s.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011Bahrain"/&gt; However, in 2012, in 2012, Bahrain and South Korea signed an agreement on promoting [[study abroad]] exchanges between the two countries.&lt;ref name="GDN20120206"/&gt;

===Iraq===
{{See also|Demographics of Iraq}}
The first group of nine South Korean workers arrived in [[Iraq]] in 1975; however, until the end of 1980, only a total of 1,958 registered emigrants went to the country. However, their numbers would increase along with the intensification of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]; from 1981 until 1985, Iraq was consistently the second to fourth-most popular Arab world destination for South Korean migrant labourers, a total of whom 66,665 went to the country during that period.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; In March 2003, then-[[President of South Korea|president]] [[Roh Moo-hyun]] agreed to dispatch a contingent of [[Military of South Korea|ROK army engineers]] to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/AsiaandthePacific/wm427.cfm?renderforprint=1|title=South Korean Troops to Iraq: A Boost for U.S.-ROK Relations|last=Hwang|first=Balbina|periodical=Heritage Foundation WebMemo|date=2004-02-13|accessdate=2009-05-22|issue=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the South Koreans expanded their presence, creating an entirely new division, the [[Zaytun Division]], consisting of 3,600 troops; they were sent to Iraq in September 2004.

===Jordan===
{{See also|Demographics of Jordan}}
[[Jordan]] was only a minor destination for South Korean migrant workers in the 1970s and 1980s. The first group of 90 migrant workers arrived in 1975; from then until 1985, a total of 12,544 came to the country. The number reached its peak with 2,404 in 1980 but fell to less than a quarter that level by 1985.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; By 2011, the country had the Arab world's seventh-largest Korean population. From 356 in 2009, the number of South Korean nationals grew by 66% to 592 in 2011. Among them, 48 were international students, while 544 held other types of visas; none had become Jordanian nationals. The vast majority (556, or 94%) lived in [[Amman]] or its surroundings, with another 14 living at [[Irbid]], and 22 in other places.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011Jordan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MOFAT2009"/&gt;

South Koreans in the country pursue a variety of professions.

By 2004, there were estimated to be at least 30 South Korean Christian missionary families living in [[Amman]].

===Libya===
{{See also|Demographics of Libya|Filipinos in Libya|Pakistanis in Libya}}
Though [[Libya]] did not receive its first South Korean workers until 1977, it quickly became a popular destination; it was the only Arab country which experienced consistent growth in the number of Korean workers between 1981 and 1985, and by 1985 it had already become the Arab world's second most popular destination, with 23,138 arrivals from South Korea. In total, from 1977 until 1985, 103,953 South Koreans came to Libya.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; However, virtually all returned home, and {{As of|2009|lc=on}}, it was estimated that only 854 South Korean nationals lived in the country.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2009"/&gt; The South Korean population fell a further 87% in the next two years, leaving just 111 South Koreans in the country.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011Libya"/&gt; Libya also has a Korean weekend school, founded in 2000; it enrolled 22 students from kindergarten to high school levels {{As of|2007|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIIED|2007|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181531/http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=686&amp;page=2&amp;key=6 재리비아주말한글학교]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea also dispatched labourers to Libya in the 1980s and 1990s; a batch of Northern construction workers arrived in Libya in 2008. There were estimated to be roughly 200 North Korean expatriates in Libya {{as of|2011|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://nk.joins.com/news/view.asp?aid=4772139|periodical=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|title=리비아 북한인 200명 왜 철수 안 시키나 {{bracket|Why the 200 North Koreans in Libya are not being evacuated}}|last=Yi|first=Yeong-jong|date=2011-02-25|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are construction workers, doctors, and nurses. They were not evacuated during the [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan civil war]] that year. South Korean official media reported that Pyongyang had explicitly ordered their nationals in Libya and Egypt not to return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2011/10/26/86/0401000000AEN20111026002200315F.HTML|periodical=[[Yonhap News]]|date=2011-10-26|accessdate=2011-10-30|title=N.

===Qatar===
{{See also|Demographics of Qatar}}
South Korea and [[Qatar]] established diplomatic relations in 1974, and two years later, the South Korean embassy opened in [[Doha]].&lt;ref name="CheongwadaeQatar"&gt;{{harvnb|Cheongwadae|2007|loc=[http://16cwd.pa.go.kr/cwd/en/pub/president/cnt0202010702.html President Roh Moo-hyun's Official Visit to the Qatar]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qatar]] was never a major destination for South Korean labourers; the first group of 636 workers did not arrive until 1976, and until 1985, only a total of 12,816 South Korean emigrants chose Qatar as their destination.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; Unlike in other countries in the region, Korean workers in Qatar did not just come as employees of Korean companies, but also as subcontractors of [[List of Japanese companies|Japanese companies]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CFR|1980|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qatar Airways]] is one of the major employers of South Koreans in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20111016000395|first=Hannah Stuart|last=Leach|date=2011-10-06|title=Competition high for 'flying girls'|periodical=Korea Herald|accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, South Korean consular statistics showed 2,184 of their nationals or former nationals living in the country, a decrease of 7.7% since 2009. 1,383 lived in [[Doha]], 467 in [[Mesaieed]], and 334 in [[Al Khor]]. Five were Qatari nationals, 112 were international students, and the remaining 2,067 had other types of visas.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011Qatar"/&gt;

In addition, an estimated 3,000 North Koreans lived in the country {{as of|2015|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="peninsula1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/352293/around-3-000-north-koreans-in-qatar|title=Around 3,000 North Koreans in Qatar|publisher=The Peninsula Qatar|date=13 September 2015|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accounted for approximately 40% of the working population of North Korean in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]] region at that time.&lt;ref name="peninsula1"/&gt; North Korean workers are reported to be among the lowest paid in the country, earning US$170/month, less than even [[Nepalis in Qatar|Nepali migrants]]; they perform low-skilled work such as [[plasterwork|plastering]] and [[brickwork|bricklaying]]. Their lives are subject to a great deal of official constraint, and they try to avoid contact with the South Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How's the Kimchi?

===Saudi Arabia===
{{See also|Demographics of Saudi Arabia|Filipinos in Saudi Arabia|Indonesians in Saudi Arabia|Turks in Saudi Arabia}}
South Korea established [[diplomatic relations]] with [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1962, and opened an embassy in [[Jeddah]] in 1973, which would later move to [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref name="CheongwadaeSaudi"&gt;{{harvnb|Cheongwadae|2007|loc=[http://16cwd.pa.go.kr/cwd/en/pub/president/cnt0202010502.html President Roh Moo-hyn's Official Visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour relations were especially a source of friction in Saudi Arabia; one eyewitness account by an American expatriate claims that Hyundai's management called in the [[Military of Saudi Arabia|Saudi military]] to put down a strike at the [[Jubail]] port construction project, and that the army then proceeded to arrest and execute several workers.&lt;ref name="Halliday"&gt;{{harvnb|Halliday|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2003|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean workers were also not afforded the opportunity for much social contact with their host population, though a few did [[religious conversion|convert]] to Islam.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; Migration to the country would peak in 1982 and 1983, with over 122,000 South Koreans entering Saudi Arabia in each of those years, making up over 70% of Korean migration to the region. However, by 1985, the number of South Koreans entering Saudi Arabia had fallen to 58,924, paralleling a downward trend in the whole region.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; Saudi Arabia's first school for South Korean nationals was established in 1992 in [[Jeddah]]; {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, it enrolled a total of 23 children at the kindergarten level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIIED|2007|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002012148/http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=690&amp;page=3&amp;key=6 젯다한국학교병설한글학교]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, South Korea closed their consulate in [[Jeddah]]. There was no known North Korean presence, and North Korea does not maintain diplomatic relations with the kingdom.&lt;ref name="CheongwadaeSaudi"/&gt; {{As of|2011}}, South Korean government figures showed 2,821 of their nationals or former nationals in the country, up by about 40% from 2,014 in 2011. This made them the second-largest Korean population in the region, having surpassed the population in Qatar which shrank during the same period. 43 were Saudi nationals, 65 were international students, and the remaining 2,713 had other kinds of visas. 1,479 lived in [[Damman]], 607 in [[Riyadh]], 394 in [[Jeddah]], 134 in [[Medina]], 100 in [[Jizan]], and 11 in [['Asir Province]].&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011SaudiArabia"&gt;{{harvnb|MOFAT|2011|pp=272&amp;ndash;273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOFAT2009"/&gt;

===United Arab Emirates===
[[File:North Korean migrant worker numbers in Asia map.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Number of North Korean migrant workers in Asia]]
{{see also|Expatriates in the United Arab Emirates}}
The United Arab Emirates received a small contingent of Korean migrant workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but it was never a major destination.&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; However, due to rapid growth since 2005, the country has come to have the Arab world's largest Korean population.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011UAE"/&gt; {{asof|2008}}, there were roughly 2,500 South Koreans living in [[Dubai]] alone, largely businessmen working at the 90 Korean companies which operated in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&amp;xfile=data/theuae/2008/february/theuae_february897.xml|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2009-05-22|title=South Korea to open consulate in Dubai|periodical=Khaleej Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid population growth continued through 2011; by that year, South Korean consular statistics showed 5,665 of their nationals or former nationals living in the UAE, giving it the region's largest South Korean population, with more than twice as large a population as that in Saudi Arabia. Five were Emirati nationals, fourteen were international students, and the rest had other types of visas. 3,276 lived in [[Dubai]], 1,982 in [[Abu Dhabi]], 141 in [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], 83 in [[Ajman]], 67 in [[Ras al-Khaimah]], 36 in [[Fujairah]], and 22 in [[Umm al-Quwain]].&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011UAE"/&gt;

Many South Koreans in the UAE are flight attendants working for [[Emirates Airlines]]; the number of Koreans working for Emirates Airlines increased from 15 in 1998 to 620 as of 2007, mostly based out of Dubai. Dubai has the UAE's largest community of South Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Korean Female Crew Capture Middle East|periodical=Chosun Ilbo|date=2007-05-04|accessdate=2007-05-04|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200705/200705040012.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510014534/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200705/200705040012.html|archivedate=10 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a consulate was not opened in Dubai until March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://are-dubai.mofat.go.kr/eng/af/are-dubai/mission/about/index.jsp|title=About us|publisher=The Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in Dubai|accessdate=2009-05-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405235607/http://are-dubai.mofat.go.kr/eng/af/are-dubai/mission/about/index.jsp|archivedate=5 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Abu Dhabi, Reem Investments plans to develop a residential complex for South Korean expatriates on [[Al Reem Island]], and have engaged Gansam Architects of Seoul to design its {{convert|22,000|m2}} cultural centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Claire|last=Ferris-Lay|title=Reem Island inks construction deal with Koreans|work=Construction Week|date=2012-01-17|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-15315-reem-island-inks-construction-deal-with-koreans/|accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also believed to be roughly 1,300 North Korean workers in the UAE, primarily in Dubai and [[Abu Dhabi]]. They earn between US$300 and $500 per month, but have to make so-called "loyalty payments" of $150 to $250 to the North Korean government. This has sparked discontent among the workers; in response, the North Korean government has sent security agents to patrol North Korean work camps and keep an eye out for people making critical comments.&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo20091225"/&gt; In 2010, a branch of the Pyongyang [[Okryu Restaurant]] opened in Dubai, staffed by waitresses from North Korea; the restaurant earns hard currency to supplement the North Korean state budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/31/132491605/dubai-restaurant-offers-a-taste-of-north-korea|first=Peter|last=Kenyon|title=Dubai Restaurant Offers A Taste of North Korea|date=2010-12-31|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Koreans in Morocco]] --&gt;
Other countries which received Korean migrant workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s include [[Yemen]], [[Oman]], and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Seok"/&gt; There are Korean weekend schools in [[Mauritania]] ([[Nouadhibou]]), [[Morocco]] ([[Rabat]] and [[Agadir]]) and [[Tunisia]] ([[Tunis]]).&lt;ref name="NIIED 2007"/&gt;

'''''Korkoro''''' ("Alone" in the [[Romani language|Romanes]]) is a 2009 French drama film written and directed by [[Tony Gatlif]], starring French actors [[Marc Lavoine]], [[Marie-Josée Croze]] and [[James Thiérrée]]. The film's cast were of many nationalities such as Albanian, Kosovar, Georgian, Serbian, French, Norwegian, and nine Romani people Gatlif recruited in [[Transylvania]].

Based on an [[anecdote]] about the [[World War II|Second World War]] by the [[Romani people|Romani]] historian Jacques Sigot, the film was inspired by a Romani who escaped the Nazis with help from French villagers. It depicts the rarely documented subject of [[Porajmos]] (the Romani Holocaust).&lt;ref name=Dimancherev/&gt; Other than a band of Romani people, the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy, a French teacher who was active in the French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for Romani. Gatlif had intended to make a documentary but the lack of supporting documents led him to present it as a drama.

The film premiered at the [[Montréal World Film Festival]], winning the Grand Prize of the Americas, amongst other awards.&lt;ref name="Montreal"/&gt; It was released in France as '''''Liberté''''' in February 2010, where it grossed $601,252; revenues from Belgium and the United States brought the total to $627,088.&lt;ref name=Box/&gt; The film's music, composed by Tony Gatlif and Delphine Mantoulet, received a nomination in the ''Best Music Written for a Film'' category at the 36th annual [[César Awards 2011|César Awards]].

''Korkoro'' has been described as a "rare cinematic tribute" to those killed in the Porajmos.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134736315/korkoro-freedoms-music-muffled-by-cliche |title=''Korkoro'': Freedom's Music, Amid The Din Of War |date=March 24, 2011 |author=Tobias, Scott |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |location=United States |work=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it received positive reviews from critics, including praise for having an unusually leisurely pace for a [[Holocaust]] film.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Critics regarded it as one of the director's best works, and with ''[[Latcho Drom]]'', the "most accessible" of his films. The film is considered to show Romani in a non-stereotypical way, far from their clichéd depictions as musicians.

== Plot ==
The film is set during World War II in rural [[Vichy France]], and begins with a nine-year-old French boy, Claude (Mathias Laliberté) escaping from an orphanage. He decides to avoid state protection. He meets a [[Romani people|Romani]] [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]], an extended family of 20 men, women and children, who decide to adopt him. The Romani start calling Claude, ''Korkoro'', the free one. Fascinated by their nomadic lifestyle, Claude decides to stay with them.&lt;ref name="Cath"/&gt;

The caravan sets up camp outside a small wine-growing village, hoping to find seasonal work in the vineyards and a place to sell their wares. The village, as was the trend, is divided into two factions—one welcomes the Romani, and the other sees them as an intrusion. Théodore Rosier ([[Marc Lavoine]]), the village mayor and  veterinarian, and Mademoiselle Lundi ([[Marie-Josée Croze]]), a school teacher and clerk in city hall, are two of the friendlier villagers. The Vichy France [[gendarmerie]] used the documentation made in the passports of its citizens to monitor their movements for which a threshold was set, along with imprisonment for violations This adversely affected the Romani. Lundi uses her powers as a clerk, and forges their passports, removing the documentation about their movements.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/movies/stories-of-war-through-a-gypsy-lens.html |title=Stories of War Through a Gypsy Lens |author=Saltz, Rachel |date=March 24, 2011 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when Rosier has an accident outside the village, he is rescued by the Romani, who treat the mayor with their traditional healing practices. He sells them his father's house, in order to protect them from the [[Fascist (epithet)|Fascist]] policy of imprisoning the homeless. Lundi enrolls the children in her school. The freedom-loving Romani recognize that these French are trying to help but struggled with life in a fixed place and the rules of formal education.

When the Nazis arrive, Rosier and Lundi are revealed to be members of the [[French Resistance]]; they are arrested and tortured during interrogation. The Nazis round up the Romani and send them to [[Concentration Camps|concentration camps]]. Claude, cared for by Rosier, chooses to go with the Romani.&lt;ref name="Cath"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=17639 |title=Film: ''Korkoro'' |author=Malone, Fr.

== Production ==
=== Background ===
{{further|Porajmos|Antiziganism}}
During World War II, the [[Porajmos]] was the attempt by [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]], [[Horthy's Hungary]] and their allies to exterminate the Romani people of Europe.&lt;ref name=matras&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://acqualuzminerale.com/~santiago.funes/paraacqua/rom_matras.pdf |title=A conflict of paradigms: review article |author=Matras, Yaron |journal=Romani Studies 5; [[Gypsy Lore Society]] |year=2004 |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=195 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yWTrYwAW?url=http://acqualuzminerale.com/~santiago.funes/paraacqua/rom_matras.pdf |archivedate=May 8, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Hitler]]’s rule, both Romanieand [[Jews]] were defined as "enemies of the race-based state" by the [[Nuremberg Laws]]; the two groups were targeted by similar policies and persecution, culminating in the near annihilation of both populations in Nazi-occupied countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Facts and Debates: The Roma Holocaust |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N00MTd_7hLIC&amp;pg=PA1 |author=Barsony, James |title=Pharrajimos: The Fate of the Roma During the Holocaust |isbn=978-1-932716-30-6 |pages=1–13 |year=2008 |location=New York City |publisher=The International Debate Education Association |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the death toll of Romani people in World War II range from 220,000 to 1,500,000.&lt;ref name="Milton estimates"&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=True Romanies and the Holocaust: A Re-evaluation and an overview |chapter-url=http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_e_holocaust_porrajmos&amp;lang=en&amp;articles= |author=Hancock, Ian |title=The Historiography of the Holocaust |isbn=1-4039-9927-9 |pages=383–396 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Eastern European Romani communities were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos was not well documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to [[Ian Hancock]], director of the Program of Romani Studies at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.geocities.com/~Patrin/lewy.htm |title=Downplaying the Porajmos: The Trend to Minimize the Romani Holocaust |author=Hancock, Ian |year=2000 |issue=Sept 23 |journal=Patrin|accessdate=July 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knwjmRoN?url=http://www.geocities.com/~Patrin/lewy.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long wanted to make a documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

=== Development ===
Gatlif's quest  began in 1970 when he approached [[Matéo Maximoff]], a French writer of Romani ethnicity. The two went to [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]] to interview the Romani who were initially not very forthcoming discussing the subject of Porajmos. Gatlif was also researching the ''[[Righteous among the Nations|Justes]]'', the French who attempted to shield the Romani from persecution.&lt;ref name=NovIview&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/romans/20100224.BIB4948/tony-gatlif-et-la-tragedie-oubliee.html |title=Tony Gatlif et la tragédie oubliée |last=Baltel |first=Sipa |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |language=French |location=Paris |work=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following former French President [[Jacques Chirac]]'s efforts to honour the ''Justes'',&lt;ref name=Chirac&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2007/01/18/jacques-chirac-fait-entrer-les-justes-au-pantheon_856858_3224.html |title=Jacques Chirac fait entrer les Justes au Panthéon et invite la France à regarder son histoire en face|author=Gurrey, Beatrice |date=January 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |language = French |location=Paris |work=[[Le Monde]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatlif came across Yvette Lundy,&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; a former schoolteacher in [[Gionges]], [[La Marne]], who had been deported for forging documents for the Romani.&lt;ref name="France3-Yvette"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://champagne-ardenne.france3.fr/info/yvette-lundy-inspire-un-film-a-tony-gatlif-61303952.html |title=Yvette Lundy, inspire un film à Tony Gatlif |language=French |location=Paris |author=LG |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |date=February 23, 2010 |work=[[France 3]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110724121615/http://champagne-ardenne.france3.fr/info/yvette-lundy-inspire-un-film-a-tony-gatlif-61303952.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatlif also got hold of an anecdote by Jacques Sigot, a historian who has documented the Porajmos,&lt;ref name=Camp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Actualite/La-victoire-de-Jacques-Sigot-alias-Tchopa-212393/ |title=La victoire de Jacques Sigot, alias Tchopa |language=French |author=Descalles, Julien |date=August 7, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |location=Paris |work=[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would later help with the story.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; The anecdote is about a Romani family saved from being sent to the camp at [[Montreuil-Bellay]] by a French lawyer who sold them his home for a single [[French franc|franc]]. Unable to adjust to a stationary lifestyle, the family took to the streets, which led to their arrest in northern France and eventual incarceration in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=NovIview/&gt;
  
The characters in ''Korkoro'' are drawn from Sigot's anecdote. The film traces the Romani ''familia''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s life during the war, from their disbelief at being forbidden to travel, their rejection by others when they stay in one place, to their arrest, incarceration, liberation with the help of a local French mayor and a notary, their struggle to live in a non-nomadic way, and then final arrest before being sent to the Death Camps. The character Théodore Rosier is based on the notary in the anecdote.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; The other ''Juste'' character, Lise Lundi, is based on [[Yvette Lundy]] and an old teacher of Gatlif's from Belcourt in Algeria who was a [[communist]] and an aide with the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] (National Liberation Front).&lt;ref name=NovIview/&gt;

Intended to be a documentary, ''Korkoro'' became a drama because of  the lack of sufficient supporting documents. Gatlif wrote the initial script in one month; further modifications later followed which made the film's style a narrative by the characters Rosier and Lundi. Gatlif used Lundy's help to write the scenes related to her,  to which he added his  own experiences with his teacher. The first appearance of the Romani in the film is inspired by the way the nomadic Romani showed up in the middle of nowhere after Gatlif had been working on the characterisation for over a year. Another year was spent in developing Taloche's character.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

=== Casting ===
Gatlif wanted to represent the entire Romani community in Félix Lavil dit Taloche's naiveté and purity. As an example, Taloche is shown as being afraid of ghosts, echoing the Romani phobia. For Taloche's role, Gatlif needed a musician with acrobatic skills; this proved very hard to find. In Paris at the [[Théâtre de la Ville]], he was impressed by [[James Thiérrée]], a grandson of [[Charlie Chaplin]]. A non-Romani, (though Chaplin's grandmother was Romani) Thiérrée learned [[Romani language|Romanes]] and [[Gypsy jazz|Romani swing music]] in six months.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

For Théodore Rosier, Gatlif wanted someone to emulate a typical Frenchman of the time,  with a "voice and face a little like that of [[Pierre Fresnay]], [[Maurice Ronet]], [[Jacques Charrier]] or [[Gérard Philippe]]", which he found in [[Marc Lavoine]].&lt;ref name=Press/&gt; [[Marie-Josée Croze]] was the obvious choice for Mademoiselle Lise Lundi. Gatlif had envisioned Lundi as a "Hitchcock character: fragile, mysterious and strong".&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;

Pierre Pentecôte, the militia character played by Carlo Brandt, was presented with a pitiful look, rather than with a villainous caricature.  His drooping hat and a few extra pounds symbolise the fat militia of the period. The orphan, P'tite Claude, was played by Mathias Laliberté. [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] was chosen by Gatlif for the role of Fernand because of his typical French looks. Puri Dai, the grandmother, was played by Raya Bielenberg, a Soviet-born Norwegian artist and 2005 recipient of [[Oslo City art award]] who uses music and dance to make the Romani culture better known in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bystyret.oslo.kommune.no/kultur_og_utdanning/prisvinnere_oversikt/article67080-5151.html |author=Web archives|title=Oslo City art award archive |language=Norwegian|location=Oslo |year=2005 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |work=Oslo Kommune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other notable characters in the movie, Darko, Kako, Chavo, Zanko and Tatane were played by [[Arben Bajraktaraj]], Georges Babluani, Ilijir Selimoski, Kevyn Diana and Thomas Baumgartner respectively.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; Levis, a minor character was played by then 11-year-old great-grandson of [[Django Reinhardt]], a virtuoso jazz guitarist and composer of [[Manouche]] Romani ethnicity.&lt;ref name=MondoTony&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tony-gatlif.mondomix.com/en/itw5617.htm |language=French |title=''Freedom'' |last=MiNiMuM |first=Benjamin |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |work=Mondomix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included people of many nationalities, Albanian, Kosovar, Georgian, Serbian, French and Norwegian along with the nine Romani people Gatlif found living in extreme poverty in [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; Arrangements were made for these Romani to stay in France for the three to four months it took to shoot the film.&lt;ref name=NovIview/&gt;

=== Filming ===
The film was shot in [[Loire]], in the [[Monts du Forez]], [[Rozier-Côtes-d'Aurec]] and [[Saint-Bonnet-le-Château]].&lt;ref name="Loc-France3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rhone-alpes-auvergne.france3.fr/info/rhone-alpes/tourne-dans-la-loire-liberte-sort-sur-les-ecrans-61324422.html |author=J, Sauvadon |title=Tourné dans la Loire, ''Liberté'' sort sur les écrans |work=[[France 3]] |language=French |location=Paris |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |date=February 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302091002/http://rhone-alpes-auvergne.france3.fr/info/rhone-alpes/tourne-dans-la-loire-liberte-sort-sur-les-ecrans-61324422.html |archivedate=March 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tools used in the movie, which were very similar to the ones employed in 1943, came from Transylvania. The barbed wire fences of the concentration camps are genuine ones built by the Nazis in [[Romania]] which can be differentiated from the ones used for cattle by their denser spacing.&lt;ref name=NovIview/&gt;

The male actors were asked to grow their hair and moustaches. The actors also had to diet to lose weight to achieve the look of World War II characters.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; The costumes had a faded look, a reflection that people of the period owned few clothes, often only two outfits. None of the actors knew the script in advance and were only informed each night before of what they were to do in their daily scenes. The Romani were not aware of the historic events that were the basis of the movie, and were only told that the story was set in hard times comparable to [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceaușescu]]'s tenure in Romania.&lt;ref name=NovIview/&gt; In the scene where the Romani revolt against the police over the death of Taloche, they were made aware of the character's death only when the scene was being shot, leading to a genuine outpouring of emotions, making their fight with the police appear more real. Gatlif later remarked in an interview that this scene stands for the actual revolt&lt;ref name=NovIview/&gt; by the Romani in Auschwitz on May 16, 1944.&lt;ref name=Aushbook&gt;{{cite book | title=Hitler's shadow war: the Holocaust and World War II  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytBtAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=auschwitz%2C+gypsy%2C+revolt&amp;q=%22Gypsies+revolted+and+refused%22#search_anchor | publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing | author=McKale, Donald M | year=2006 |page=362| isbn=978-1-58979-294-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thierrée was the only actor allowed to improvise. His characterisation of Taloche was built on spontaneity, and in many instances, Gatlif had no clue how he would act in a scene, such as in  the tap scene in which he plunges into a stairwell. In another scene, in which he dances with war music in the background, Thierrée pretended to make love to the earth like an animal. Gatlif, who had wanted the character to have the ability to  sense forthcoming danger, like animals often do, stated that Thierrée was suitable  for the role because he is very much an animal. The dance scene where Taloche is shown falling from a tree was done without [[stunt double]]s.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kino.com/press/pdfs/KORKORO_pressbook.pdf |title=Press Release document |work=Lorber Films |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401181237/http://www.kino.com/press/pdfs/KORKORO_pressbook.pdf |archivedate=April 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music plays a very important role in all of Gatlif's films, such as ''[[Latcho Drom]]'' and ''[[Gadjo dilo]]'', Scott Tobias noted in his review for [[NPR]].&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; ''Korkoro'' is no exception: the importance of music is evident from the opening credits in which barbed wire fences vibrate to the tune of plucked strings of a guitar and a [[cymbalum]] in line with the opening lines of the screenplay, "the barbed wire sings in the wind",&lt;ref name=MondoTony/&gt; to the oddest tools used to make music, such as the clanking of buckets and wagon wheels.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

The background score was composed by Tony Gatlif and Delphine Mantoulet. The main theme of the songs is the Romani association with France. Despite the sad story, there are cheerful tracks too, with pieces for the [[waltz]], [[tarantella]] and [[Java (dance)|java]]. The film's music plays a prominent role from the opening credits to [[Catherine Ringer]]'s track in the closing credits, "Les Bohemians", a waltz piece written by Gatlif and Mantoulet, which is described as setting the tone for the film.&lt;ref name=Soundmondo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monde&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cinema/article/2010/02/23/liberte-si-quelqu-un-s-inquiete-de-notre-absence_1310177_3476.html| title=''Liberté'' : Si quelqu'un s'inquiète de notre absence... |last=Mandelbaum |first=Jacques |authorlink = Jacques Mandelbaum|date=February 23, 2010|accessdate=July 15, 2011 |location=Paris |language=French |work=[[Le Monde]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Les Bohemians" is the first French song ever featured in a Gatlif movie. Gatlif chose Ringer for the track, inspired by the "blood in the mouth" feel to her voice. The song translates as "Good luck to you all, if anyone worries that we’re gone, tell them we’ve been thrown from the light and the sky, we the lords of this vast universe."&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; The java dance piece composed by Delphine accompanies a scene where the characters secretly congregate in a barn for dancing, signifying the scenario then when public gatherings were prohibited.&lt;ref name=MondoTony/&gt; The track "Un Poulailler A La Bastilles", sung by Gatlif's son Valentin Dahmani, plays on the existing racist stereotype of Romani as chicken thieves. The film also incorporates sound effects of horses, explosions and a watch mechanism. The soundtrack also has a tune of the "[[Le Temps des cerises]]", the revolutionary song of the [[Paris Commune]]. The music for the song's version in the movie was composed by Gatlif, using clockwork sounds and [[banjo]]. Other soundtrack vocalists included Kalman Urszuj, [[Sandu Ciorba]] and Ikola.&lt;ref name=Soundmondo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catherine-ringer.mondomix.com/fr/chronique5615.htm |title=''Liberté'' (Bande originale du film) |last=MiNiMuM |first=Benjamin |language=French |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |work=Mondomix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A soundtrack album was released in February, 2010. It was nominated for the [[César Awards 2011|César Award]] in 2011 in the category Best Music Written for a Film, but lost to [[Alexandre Desplat]]'s ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]''.&lt;ref name=Cesar/&gt; ''Korkoro''{{'}}s soundtrack is said to invoke mixed feelings like good humour, nostalgia and fear, creating a universe parallel to the film.&lt;ref name=Soundmondo/&gt;

== Themes and analysis ==
''Kokoro'' has been compared to ''[[Schindler's List]]'', a well-known American Holocaust drama.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  In his directing style Gatlif juxtaposed the vibrant Romani culture against the backdrop of war.&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt; In particular, reviewers commented on the subtle manner in which he dealt with the horrific aspects of war, and the manner in which he portrayed the Romani in a non-stereotypical racist way.  In addition to  the Romani characters, the film also has a spy for the French Resistance and a [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] orphan.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  Critics also made comparisons between the state of the Romani in the film, set during World War II, and their circumstances in the present.&lt;ref name=Movpic/&gt;

=== Holocaust elements ===
Critics compared ''Korkoro'' to [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''Schindler's List'' because of the sacrifices  Rosier made to protect the Romani from the Nazis. A review in ''Moving Pictures Network'' called it "Schindler's List minus the happy ending", citing a lack of comic relief, creating an inability to connect with the audience.&lt;ref name=Movpic&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.movingpicturesnetwork.com/24651/korkoro-freedom/ |title=''Korkoro'' (Freedom) |last=Hill |first=Bob |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |date=March 21, 2011 |work=Moving Pictures Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822002125/http://www.movingpicturesnetwork.com/24651/korkoro-freedom/ |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening scene, a close-up shot of barbed wire fences stretched along wooden posts with internment camp barracks in the background, is an image common to many Holocaust films, wrote Scott Tobias, who also commented on the "Schindlerian" actions of Rosier who gives his home to the Romani—an assessment backed up by Eric Hynes's review in ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out, New York]]''.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeOut"/&gt; Sophie Benamon at ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' observed that Gatlif dealt with the horrors of the Holocaust by hinting at them through symbolism, such as portraying an abandoned child, suggesting imprisoned parents, and a clock with [[Hebrew]] markings seen lying abandoned in the middle of the railroad tracks, implying the passage of a train taking Jews to a [[ghetto]].&lt;ref name=Express/&gt; Jr Glens Heath, writing for''[[Slant Magazine]]'', remarked that Gatlif's characterisation of the incomplete historic archives with which he was presented made the film a very "personal WWII historiography", where the characters "transcend victimisation" rather than mire themselves in melodrama, regarded as a typical Holocaust movie characteristic.&lt;ref name=Slant/&gt; Michael Nordine wrote for ''Hammer to Nail'' that this film cannot be compared with ''[[Life is Beautiful]]'' and other "uplifting tales" with Holocaust themes because of its straightforward portrayal of realistic events.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

=== Freedom as a theme ===
A few critics suggested freedom as a theme in light of the importance shown by the characters to it. True to its title, which is a Romani word for freedom,  Gatlif used his freedom to direct a tangential, poignant romantic story with the historical documents available to him, unlike other movies with similar themes, remarked [[Jacques Mandelbaum]] at ''[[Le Monde]]''.&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt; ''The Village Voice'' review declared that it is "a magnificent paean to the mad ecstasy of freedom".&lt;ref name="Village"/&gt; The ''Arizona Reporter'' review added that, for the Romani, freedom means "being able to keep in motion, that is, the journey, not the destination, is the reward". It observed the importance the characters give to freedom, citing the scene where Taloche becomes concerned that water is being "held against its will" in the taps, and "releases" it to overflow the sink onto the bathroom floor, and then the stairs, with Taloche blissfully sliding down the stairs as if he were on a Disney ride.&lt;ref name="Arizona"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azreporter.com/tt/index.php?id=1497 |title=''Korkoro'' (Freedom), Grade: B+ |author=Karten, Harvey |accessdate=July 15, 2011  |work=Arizona Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexis Campion at ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'' remarked that Gatlif has refreshingly portrayed the Romani as "free-spirited" characters and added that this historic film is a tribute to those free souls who take to the streets even today.&lt;ref name=Dimancherev/&gt; The ''[[Télérama]]'' review was of the opinion that the movie runs out of steam during the scenes depicting historic events, but gains momentum in the forests and on the roads, where its characters' passion for freedom, and hence Lavoine's and Croze's characters, get sidelined by that of Thierrée's, with his [[St. Vitus' dance]] and [[Dostoyevsky]]-like ruminations.&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt; It added that Taloche is the true "incarnation" of freedom.&lt;ref name=Tele&gt;{{cite news |url=http://television.telerama.fr/tele/films/liberte,13937539.php |title=La critique TV de Télérama |location=Paris |language=French |last=Odicino |first=Guillemette |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |work=[[Télérama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mirroring the current times ===
A section of critics wrote on the relevance of the movie to the current times. In an interview, Gatlif stated that he wanted the movie to mirror the current times, adding that the times have not changed much, and that while the political extermination has gone, the psychological and political views of Romani have not. He criticised the French law that allows wanderers to stay in one place only for 24 hours. He was also critical of the plight of Romani in Hungary, Romania and Italy.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; He went on that the state of the Romani now in many places, "with the rows of homeless people waiting for a bowl of soup with a tin can on their hands", is not very different from that in the concentration camps.&lt;ref name=NovIview/&gt; Gatlif also lashed out against the fact that until 1969, Romani were required to have their papers stamped at a police station or city hall whenever they arrived at or left a French village.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; Bob Hill at ''Moving Pictures Network'' remarked that the movie draws parallels to the fact that "we are once again veering toward a culture in which regimes and wealth determine who has the right to live free — and who has no rights at all", and cited present happenings such as the developments in the [[Middle East]], racial wars and inter-country disputes. It added that the movie makes the audience ask themselves if they live in a society that embraces or condemns diversity.&lt;ref name=Movpic/&gt;

== Release ==
The film premiered at the 2009 [[Montreal World Film Festival]], contending in the World Competition section, reserved for world and international premieres, for the awards [[Grand Prix des Amériques (film award)|Grand Prize of the Americas]], Special Grand Prix of the Jury, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Artistic Contribution, and Innovation Award.&lt;ref name="Montreal"/&gt; Alongside the film, Gatlif released a novel under the same name, ''Liberté'', which he co-authored with the French novelist Eric Kannay.

=== Critical response ===
The film's tone and narrative style received mixed response from the critics. Ronnie Scheib at ''Variety'' found it to be filled with excessive pathos, "shuttling between the trite and the sublime",&lt;ref name=Varrev/&gt; while Odile Tremblay (''Le Monde'') said in contrary that the film avoided excessive pathos, rendering it funny and tragic at the same time,&lt;ref name=Devoir/&gt; an observation that was supported by Jacques Mandelbaum at ''Le Devoir'', who wrote that the film mixes humour, sensitivity and drama.&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt; ''Hammer to Nail''{{'}}s review by Michael Nordine asserted that the film is "neither a pity party nor an emotionally manipulative attempt", but a straightforward portrayal of things as they were, citing Gatlif's portrayal of the Romani as "certainly sympathetic, but at no point does it seem overly so."&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; The film provided insufficient analysis on the "anti-roaming laws" and their targeting of the Romani, observed  the reviewer, to whom the Nazi and all other anti-Romani characters in the film came across as "one dimensional bigots".&lt;ref name="ECM"/&gt; Bob Hill (''Moving Pictures Network'') criticised that the film failed to strike an emotional chord, unlike other movies and books with a similar theme. He conceded it to be an "important, but not a great movie—or even a particularly good one, for that matter."&lt;ref name=Movpic/&gt; For a casual movie goer, he stated, "{{'}}''Korkoro''{{'}} feels like a slow burn, lagging on long after most of the audience has long since called it quits".&lt;ref name=Movpic/&gt; In defence of the film's incoherent narrative style, Jr Glenn Heath at ''Slant Magazine'' explained that Gatlif intended it less as a historical drama and more as evoking the sense of a memory, imbibing the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] techniques. Commenting on its tone, he wrote that "Korkoro is a reserved but lasting examination of collectively silent horror".&lt;ref name=Slant&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/korkoro/5360 |title=''Korkoro'' |last=Heath |first=Glenn Jr |date=March 22, 2011 |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |location=New York City |accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''L'Express'', Sophie Benamon declared that with the film's controlled pace, it keeps its viewers breathless and induces emotion.&lt;ref name=Express/&gt; Alexis Campion at ''Le Journal du Dimanche'' stated that the film transcends the stereotypes&lt;ref name=Dimancherev&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/Culture/Cinema/Actualite/Au-nom-des-Tsiganes-deportes-173957/ |title=Au nom des Tsiganes déportés |last=Campion |first=Alexis |date=February 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |language=French |location=Paris |work=[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the reviewer at ''Arizona Reporter'' noted that some might consider it to be stereotyping the Romani.&lt;ref name="Arizona"/&gt;

On Gatlif's direction, Odile Tremblay at ''Le Monde'' remarked that he had taken a heavy burden in directing a Holocaust movie along with coupling it with the "poetic effervescence" that the Romani are known for. He added that this can be regarded the best among his films.&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt; Michael Nordine characterised Gatlif's directorial style as passive and "documentarian", such that it "sometimes verges on emotional distance". "What easily noticeable flourishes he adds tend to be understated", he added.&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hammertonail.com/reviews/korkoro-film-review/ |title=''Korkoro'', The Unvanquished |last=Nordine |first=Michael |date=April 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |work=Hammer to Nail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Hynes at ''TimeOut'' lauded Gatlif's work in making a celebration of textures and music of the Romani out of a melodramatic story.&lt;ref name="TimeOut"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/arts-culture/film/1049587/korkoro |title=Gypsies flee Nazis in Tony Gatlif's WWII melodrama |author=Hynes, Eric |date=March 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 15, 2011|work=[[Time Out (company)|TimeOut New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''East County Magazine''{{'}}s negative review summed that Gatlif had too much faith on his audience, "expecting them to take everything at face value".&lt;ref name="ECM"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/node/6474 |title=On the Silver Screen : Stark Raving Nomad |last=Lafferty |first=Brian |date=June 18, 2011 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |location=California |work=East County Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's plotting and characterisation was regarded flimsy by Nick Schager at ''The Village Voice'', who added that the film's "robust emotion and cultural detail" offsets it.&lt;ref name="Village"/&gt; ''[[NPR|National Public Radio]]'' review by Scott Tobias stated that the film weds the exotic culture of the Romani to the cliched themes of a war film with its characterisation as its means. With a "Schindlerian" Theodore Rosier, a Dickensian Claude, a hinted romance between Rosier and Miss Lundi, and the clown-like Taloche, it added, Gatlif has "weaved a tapestry out of the authentic and the chintzy".&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; Joe Bendel at ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' stated that the film avoids simply depicting the Romani as victims, with its "decidedly unsentimental" central character, Taloche, who is "wild almost to the point of being feral".&lt;ref name="Epoch"/&gt; Sophie Benamon at ''L'Express'' declared that the madness of Taloche is the pivotal element of the film.&lt;ref name=Express/&gt; In Taloche's face, Nick Schager perceived that "the film seethes with full-bodied fury and anguish".&lt;ref name="Village"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/movies/korkoro-libert--1801658/ |title=''Korkoro''  |location=New York City |last=Schager |first=Nick |accessdate=July 4, 2011 |work=[[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arizona Reporter''{{'}}s review lauded "Taloche's manic antics" as "both the comic center of the film and a representation of the tragedy".&lt;ref name="Arizona"/&gt; Ronie Scheib (''Variety'') admired Taloche's characterisation, commenting on his acrobatic stunts and close-to-nature persona as gelling well with the film's title of "Freedom".&lt;ref name=Varrev/&gt; Lavoine's and Croze's characters also received a positive mention in the reviews at ''L'Express'' and ''The Epoch Times'',&lt;ref name="Epoch"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/arts-entertainment/movie-review-korkoro-53504.html |title=Chaplin's Grandson Embodies Romani Word for Freedom |author=Bendel, Joe |date=March 24, 2011 |work=[[The Epoch Times]] |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with Sophie Benamon at ''L'Express'' calling them "compelling".&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/cinema/liberte_850611.html |title=''Liberté'', maîtrisé et dynamique |last=Benamon |first=Sophie |accessdate=July 17, 2011 |date=February 23, 2010 |language=French |work=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Hirsch's cinematography can be regarded as a relief to the eyes from the film's gory Holocaust theme, stated Ronnie Scheib (''Variety'').&lt;ref name=Varrev/&gt; Jacques Mandelbaum at ''Le Devoir'' added that the beauty of scenes such as the arrival of the Romani in caravans in their first scene and the gentle music is a stark contrast to the harsh themes of concentration camps and extermination.&lt;ref name=Devoir&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cl-t175-503cl.privatedns.com/culture/cinema/264654/en-competition-au-33e-ffm-la-liberte-menottee |title=En compétition au 33e FFM – La liberté menottée |last=Tremblay |first=Odile |date=August 29, 2009 |language=French |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |location=Montreal |work=[[Le Devoir]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419005814/http://cl-t175-503cl.privatedns.com/culture/cinema/264654/en-competition-au-33e-ffm-la-liberte-menottee |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Odile Tremblay (''Le Monde'') made mention of a number of scenes, including the one where Taloche opens a tap to "free" water, and the scene with an abandoned watch implying the ghettos as the best moments of the film.&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt; Nick Schager (''The Village Voice'') stated that the film scores on its aesthetics in sequences depicting key elements, like the one with trains symbolising the Holocaust, and its detailed depiction of the characters' intimate practices, which bring depth to a rather predictable plot.&lt;ref name="Village"/&gt; Brian Lafferty (''East County Magazine'') criticised Julian Hirsch for making the sequences look dull and gloomy with insufficient lighting.&lt;ref name="ECM"/&gt; The tap scene received a special mention in ''L'Express''{{'}} review too.&lt;ref name=Express/&gt;

On its historical aspects,  Alexis Campion (''Le Journal du Dimanche'') stated that this is the first French film dealing with the Porajmos.&lt;ref name=Dimancherev/&gt; Ronnie Scheib (''Variety'') lauded the film on its exposure of the French [[gendarmerie]]'s role in the Holocaust, the reviewer added that this is the most "accessible" film of Gatlif after ''Latcho Drom''.&lt;ref name=Varrev&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940938?refcatid=31 |title=''Korkoro'' |last=Scheib |first=Ronnie |date=September 3, 2009 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in the ''[[Independent Catholic News]]'' said that the film provides one a chance to remember the forgotten aspects of World War II and to learn more about French prejudice and the persecution of the Gypsies.&lt;ref name="Cath"/&gt;

The movie received its highest rating of three stars from the reviewers at ''Le Journal du Dimanche''&lt;ref name=Dimancherev/&gt; and ''Slant Magazine''&lt;ref name=Slant/&gt; while ''Arizona Reporter'' gave it a B+ as per its grading system.&lt;ref name="Arizona"/&gt;

{{Lebanese people}}

'''Lebanese New Zealanders''' refers to citizens or permanent residents of [[New Zealand]] of Lebanese ancestry. The community is diverse, having a large [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] religious base, being mostly [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite Catholic]]s and [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], while also having a small [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] group of both the [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]] branches of [[Islam in Lebanon|Islam]].

[[Lebanon]], in both its modern-day form as the Lebanese state (declared in 1920, granted independence in 1943) and its historical form as the region of the Lebanon, has been a source of migrants to New Zealand for over two centuries. According to 2013 census, 1,044 Lebanese-descent people in New Zealand, with most of all people with Lebanese ancestry living in [[Auckland]] Region (44.0 percent), followed by the [[Wellington]] Region (22.4 percent), and the [[Otago]] Region (8.6 percent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/ethnic-profiles.aspx?request_value=24771&amp;tabname=Populationandgeography 2013 Census ethnic group profiles:

==History==
As part of a large scale emigration in the 1840s, numerous Lebanese (mostly [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]]) migrated in great numbers out of [[Lebanon]] to various destinations. Most emigrated to [[Brazil]] and other [[Latin American]] nations, particularly [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]]. Many also went to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[The United Kingdom]], [[The United Arab Emirates]] and others to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name = HindsightFeb2008&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2008/2143183.htm|title = El Australie - a history of Lebanese migration to Australia|work = Hindsight - [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]]|publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date = 2008-02-03|accessdate = 2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, New Zealand's Lebanese population is one of the older established non-English speaking minorities in the country (though many Lebanese people now speak English, to a greater or lesser extent). 

In the 1890s, there were increasing numbers of Lebanese immigrants to New Zealand, part of the mass emigration from the area of the Lebanon that would become the modern Lebanese state, and also from the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]] region of the border area with [[Syria]].

Some Lebanese people had settled in [[Auckland]] as early as 1890. The Lebanese blended into the community and attended local churches. Thanks to their language ability and entrepreneurial skills, along with a sense of belonging, gave them the sense confidence to integrate without losing their tradition and culture connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/middle-eastern-peoples/page-1 Te Ara - The Lebanese]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Lebanese settler Assid Corban and his family were instrumental in introducing commercial winemaking to New Zealand.

==Religious diversity==
In New Zealand, 49% of Lebanese are [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]], while a minority (8%) are [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]].&lt;ref name=reli&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/ethnic-profiles.aspx?request_value=24771&amp;tabname=Religion |title = 2013 Census ethnic group profiles: Lebanese - Religion |publisher = Statistics New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, 24.0 percent said they had no religion.&lt;ref name=reli&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/ethnic-profiles.aspx?request_value=24771&amp;tabname=Religion |title = 2013 Census ethnic group profiles: Lebanese - Religion |publisher = Statistics New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All main Lebanese religious groups &amp;mdash; Christians, including [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]], [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]],  [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkites]], [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestants]], Muslims, including [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shi'a]] and [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunnis]] denominations; [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], amongst others &amp;mdash; are now represented.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20694">This is a '''list of wealthiest charitable foundations''' worldwide.  It consists of the 37 largest [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|charitable foundations]], [[private foundation]]s engaged in philanthropy, and other [[charitable organization]]s.

Only [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|nonprofit foundations]] are included in this list. Organisations that are part of a larger company are excluded, such as [[holding companies]].

The entries are ordered by the size of the organisation's [[financial endowment]] (that is, the value of assets net of liabilities, or invested [[donation]]s). The endowment value is an estimate measured in [[United States dollar]]s, based on the [[exchange rate]]s on December 31, 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fxexchangerate.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to fluctuations in holdings, currency exchange and asset values, this list only represents the valuation of each foundation on a single day.

The '''marriage penalty''' in the [[United States]] refers to the higher taxes required from some married couples with both partners earning income that would not be required by two otherwise identical single people with exactly the same incomes. There is also a '''marriage bonus''' that applies in other cases. Multiple factors are involved, but in general, in the current U.S. system, single-income married couples usually benefit from filing as a married couple (similar to so-called [[income splitting]]), while dual-income married couples are often penalized. The percentage of couples affected has varied over the years, depending on shifts in tax rates.

==Progressive taxation rates combined with income splitting==
The US tax code fixes different income levels for passing from one [[marginal tax rate]] to another, depending on whether the filing is done as a single person or as a married couple. For lower incomes, the transition points for married couples are twice those for single persons, which benefits a couple that gets married if their incomes are sufficiently different. This is equivalent to "income splitting", meaning that the tax due is the same as if the two persons use the schedule for single persons, but with each declaring half the total income. At higher incomes, this equivalence is lost but there is still an advantage if the two incomes are sufficiently different. To make an extreme example, if one person had $466,950 taxable income in 2016 (with itemized deductions amounting to more than twice the standard deduction) and the other earned nothing, the tax due by the earner as a single person would be $466,950*0.396−$43,830.05 or $141,082.15, whereas filing jointly they would pay $466,950*0.396−$54,333.70 or $130,578.50,&lt;ref name=taxtable&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040tt.pdf TAX TABLE], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; a saving of $10,503.65.

If the incomes of the two persons are similar, then at the lower end of the tax schedule there is no difference between filing as singles and filing as a married couple (ignoring the question of deductions, see below). But at the higher end of the tax schedule, there is a penalty for a married couple whose incomes are similar, compared to what they would pay as singles.

For example, the following chart shows the US federal tax rates for 2013:

Under these tax rates, two single people who each earned $87,850 would each file as "Single" and each would pay a marginal tax rate of 25%. However, if those same two people were married, their combined income would be exactly the same as before (2 * $87,850 = $175,700), but the "Married filing Jointly" tax brackets would push them into a higher marginal rate of 28%, costing them an additional $879 in taxes.

In the most extreme case, two single people who each earned $400,000 would each pay a marginal tax rate of 35%; but if those same two people filed as "Married, filing jointly" then their combined income would be exactly the same (2 * $400,000 = $800,000), yet $350,000 of that income would be taxed as the higher 39.6% rate, resulting in a marriage penalty of $32,119 in extra taxes ($16,100 for the 39.6% bracket alone, plus the remainder is due to the higher phase out of the lower brackets.) Using the formulas for 2016 income, if both persons have a taxable income X greater than $415,050 then as singles each would pay 0.396X−$43830.05, whereas if they were married filing jointly they would pay 2(0.396X)−$54333.70, so they lose 2($43830.05)−$54333.70 or $33,326.40.&lt;ref name=taxtable/&gt;

In some couples, the greater earner may benefit from filing as married, while the lesser earner from not being married. For example, consider two single people, one with an income of $100,000 (and therefore paying a marginal rate of 28%) and the other with no income (and therefore paying no income tax). By being married and filing jointly, the $100,000 earner reduces his/her bracket to the 25% rate, receiving a "marriage bonus" for a net tax savings of $364, while the nonearner goes from the 10% bracket to the 25% bracket on the first dollars earned upon entering the workforce.

It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Harvey. 1977. "Is it time to abandon joint filing?", ''National Tax Journal'' 30 (December), 423-428.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, Michael. 1982. "On taxing marriages", ''National Tax Journal'' 35 (December), 507-510.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is mathematically impossible for a tax system to have all of (a) marginal tax rates that increase with income, (b) joint filing with income splitting for married couples, and (c) combined tax bills that are unaffected by two people's marital status.

==Deductions==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The US tax code allows taxpayers to claim deductions (such as charitable contributions, mortgage interest, or payments for state taxes) on their income. Taxpayers can choose either an automatic [[standard deduction]] or else can choose to [[Itemized deductions|itemize their deductions]]. Two single people filing separate returns can each choose the deduction policy that benefits them more, but a married couple filing a single return will both be forced to use the same method. For example, if one person has no significant deductions, the person can take the standard deduction ($6,100 as of 2013). A different person, who has, for example, $10,000 in charitable contributions, would be better off itemizing his deductions since the standard deduction is $6,100 (single, 2013 tax year).

If the two people are allowed to file separate tax returns, then each can claim the deduction policy that benefits them the most, and their total combined deduction would be $16,100 ($6,100 + $10,000). However, if the two people are combined on one "Married, filing jointly" tax return, then they would be forced to choose either itemizing their deductions ($10,000 combined) or else using the standard deduction ($6,100 per person or $12,200 combined). Either way, the married couple would receive less deductions than two otherwise identical single people with exactly the same income.

On the other hand, being married can result in less tax. If one person earns twice the sum of the [[standard deduction]] and the [[personal exemption]] (so he earns around $20,000 a year) and the other earns nothing, the wage earner would pay around 5% of his total income as tax as a single, but as a couple their taxable income would be zero so they would pay no tax.

== Social security/Medicare burden and subsidy to sole breadwinners and nonearning parents ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
In connection with other taxation issues in the United States, one concern is that these marriages are subsidizing one-earner/one-nonearner parent couples in Social Security and Medicare benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earnings Sharing in Social Security: Projected Impacts of Alternative Proposals Using the MINT Model|url=http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n1/v69n1p1.html|work=Social Security Bulletin Vol. 69 No.1|publisher=U.S. Social Security Administration Office of Retirement and Disability Policy|accessdate=3 April 2012|author=Howard M. Iams|author2=Gayle L. Reznik |author3=Christopher R. Tamborini |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[social security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], two-earner couples pay taxes that create a surplus or at least pay for their own benefits (and receive reduced benefits such as reduced survivor benefits), while one-earner couples pay insufficient taxes that create a deficit and receive an extra, unfunded benefit of 50% or more in Social Security (i.e., a total of 150% or more), and 100% or more in Medicare (i.e. a total of 200% or more).  

This problem is exacerbated by the fact Social Security and Medicare taxes are collected only on wage income, passive income such as capital and property earnings are exempt, and benefits are progressive.  This means that the chief tax burden for the programs is carried by two-earner families with wages that range between the mid-range and the cap and these families also receive fewer benefits than any other family structure or set-up.

=== Impact of current social security reform proposals and recent Medicare tax reform in the United States ===

Proposals to "raise the cap" will continue to place an extra burden on 2-earner families where each partner has earned income (not capital gains or other property-based income that is exempt from the tax).

The [[Affordable Care Act]] added a tax on passive income and capital gains to support Medicare {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}  but it is not known if this is sufficient to prevent the heavy burden faced by two-earner families in subsidizing sole breadwinner families and especially the burden faced by two-earner families with wages between the mid-range and the cap.  No such tax is yet imposed to support progressivity in Social Security benefits.

== Relationship to reduction of government debt ==

The [[Tax Policy Center]] also sees the current "marriage bonus" for sole breadwinners as the chief tax expenditure of the [[Bush tax cuts]] and a key contributor to the [[Federal debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxation and the Family: What are marriage penalties and bonuses?|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/key-elements/family/marriage-penalties.cfm|publisher=The Tax Policy Center|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Monetary Fund]] has called for the United States, Portugal and France, all countries with significant sovereign debt, to eliminate their practices, including [[income splitting]], that charge 2-earner families higher taxes over single income families (whether married or not).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yukhananov|first=Anna|title=IMF warns of slow progress achieving gender equality|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/23/us-imf-gender-idUSBRE98M11Q20130923|accessdate=26 November 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-US residents==
The marriage penalty can be even worse in cases where one spouse is not a citizen or resident of the United States {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=November 2013}}. Although that spouse cannot be required by US law to pay US taxes, since the US person is still required by law to file taxes on worldwide income, two choices are left. The US person may either file as 'Married Filing Separately' (or 'Head of Household' if they have at least one qualifying person who is not their spouse) or try to convince their spouse to voluntarily pay US income taxes on their income by filing a joint return. The former requires using the 'Married Filing Separately' or 'Head of Household' tax brackets, which are less beneficial than 'Married Filing Jointly'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p17.pdf] See sub-heading 'Non-resident Alien Spouse' under the 'Considered Unmarried' heading on page 22 (3rd column).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n1036.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://taxfoundation.org/blog/2013-tax-brackets]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter allows that person to use the more favorable 'Married Filing Jointly' tax brackets but requires paying tax on the non-US person's income, which would not be required for two otherwise identical single people.

The '''Mulagori''' ({{lang-ps|ملاګوري}}), also spelled Mullagori and  Mallagori, is sub section of [[Momand]] Pashtun [[Ghoryakhel]] confederacy. Predominantly, Mullagori live in the [[Mula Gori Tehsil]] of [[Khyber Agency]] in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], [[Pakistan]] and in [[Nangarhar Province]], [[Afghanistan]].

==Origins==
The Mulagori are believed to be one of the bravest tribes descended from [[Ghoryakhel]]. They were considered to be the fighters tribe of Pushtuns during the British rule in East India.  They settled just north of the [[Khyber Pass]] during the time when [[Islam]] was brought to [[South Asia]].

They hold to a tradition that when Muhammad of Ghor was killed by enemies, some of his family members came to the hills of Tatara in the [[Khyber Agency]] and laid the foundations for a village named Bara Dara. They felt safe there; at that time the hills were deeply forested, protecting them from enemies.  In addition, the forests provided wild fruits and vegetables sufficient for their survival.

The name Mulagori is derived from ''mulla'' (religious leader) and ''Ghori'' (from Muhammad of Ghor).  British colonial governmental records misspelled the word ''Ghori'' as ''Gori''. In his book, ''The Pathan Borderland'', [[James W. Spain]] believes the Mulagori to be the descendants of the Mulla Ghor (son of Ba-Yazid Ansari, the Pir Rokhan of the Pakhtuns, and Pir Tarik of the Mughals).&lt;ref&gt;"The Pathan Borderland" by [[James W. Spain]], Moutin, 1963.  ASIN: B0000CR0HH&lt;/ref&gt; The Pashtun historian [[Kakakhel (tribe)#Historical|Bahadur Shah Zafar Kaka Khel]], in his book ''Pukhtana da Tarikh pa Ranra key'', is of the opinion that the Mulagori are a subgroup of the [[Mohmand]] tribe.

Abdul Latif Yaad in his book ''Pukhtane Qabile'' writes that Mulagori are basically a part of Mohmands. He tells a story that once few persons in Mohmands went somewhere. One of them was a ''mullah'' he separated from them. One of the group members told that Mulla Gorai and after that, the person was known as Mullagoray. He adds that according to Famous Pashto Poet, Hamza Shinwari said Mulagoris are behaving and talking like Mohmands so they are basically a part of the Mohmands.

However, some oral sources has further clarified the situation about Mulagori's origin. They opine that Mulagori are in fact a section of Dawezai Momands. In the Dawezai area in Momand Agency, more than 600 Mulagori families still reside. On the basis of this, Mulagori are Mohmand / Momand, and in Momands belongs to Dawezai sub-section. Everywhere Mulagori resides near Momands, and in most cases are in matrimonial relations with them. Historically, Mulagori have remained in a very cordial relations with the other sections of Momands, and have supported each other's causes, in case of tribal wars with other tribes like Afridis etc.

=={{anchor|Sub-Tribes}}Sub-tribes==
The forefather of the Mulagori was said to have had four sons, and each son fathered a sub-section of the Mulagori tribe. The four sub-tribes are named for the sons:
*[[Pahar Khel Thal|Pahar Khel]]
*Taar Khel
*Daulat Khel 
*[[Ahmed Khel]]

Some other sub-tribes were also came into existence like:
*Miyan Khel
*Chamyar Khel (In Shakoor)
* Ara Khel (In Pir Sado)
* Ali Khan Khel (Pir Sado)
* Bayan Khel (Afghanistan)

=={{anchor|Livelihood}}Employment==
There are about 250 [[marble]] factories in the area, which employ not only Mallagori tribesmen but also the residents of nearby villages.

==Education==
The Mulagori are underserved in schools built by the Pakistani government. In a population of about 50,000, there is no middle (or high school) for girls and no college for boys. While the Pakistani government built a high school for Mulagori boys in 1975, there is no middle school for girls in the Mulagori area of the Khyber Agency. Although the [[Frontier Corps]] has opened a cadet college in the Mulagori area, despite promises no seats are given to Mulagori students. Former governor [[Iftikhar Hussain Shah]] promised to build a Higher Secondary School for Mallagori students when he visited [[Jamrud]]. Work begun on Lowara Mina High School; after six rooms were built, the government withdrew its support for the remainder of the project.

'''Nicole Hahn Rafter''' (1939–2016; English pronunciation: ni-kohl h-ah-n raf-ter) was a [[feminist criminology]] professor at [[Northeastern University]].&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;[http://www.cj.neu.edu/faculty_and_staff/research_faculty/nicole_rafter/ Nicole Rafter. (n.d.). College of Criminal Justice. Retrieved April 10, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629214622/http://www.cj.neu.edu/faculty_and_staff/research_faculty/nicole_rafter/ |date=June 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her [[bachelor of arts]] degree from [[Swarthmore College]] in [[Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name="Gustafson"&gt;Gustafson, J. (n.d.). Nicole Hahn Rafter-nicolerafter.com. Nicole Hahn Rafter-nicolerafter.com Retrieved April 3, 2010, from http://www.nicolerafter.com&lt;/ref&gt; achieved her Master of Arts in Teaching from [[Harvard University]], and obtained a Ph.D. in Criminal Justice from [[State University of New York]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt; She began her career as a high school and college English professor and switched to criminal justice in her mid-thirties.

In 1977, Rafter began teaching at Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice in Boston, Massachusetts. There she developed one of the country's first courses on women and crime as well as a course on crime films. In 1999, she resigned her position as a full-time professor to focus on her writing projects. She continued affiliation with Northeastern University as an adjunct professor overseeing dissertation students, but not teaching regular courses. In 2002 she resumed teaching at the College of Criminal Justice with a graduate course in Biological Theories of Crime.&lt;ref name="Gustafson"/&gt;

During the 1980s, Rafter began publishing her writings mainly focusing on the [[Incarceration of women|female prison system]]. She argued there have always been differences between the prison systems of the different sexes. She also asserted that academia has focused little on women since the majority of studies were done on male institutions by male writers. She wrote about the history of prisons for women, noting the differences between them and commenting on the effects that gender has on institutions.&lt;ref name="Gustafson"/&gt;

In 1988, Rafter published ''White Trash: the Eugenic Family Studies 1877-1919'', writing about the [[eugenic]] movement in the [[United States]] and the way in which the poor were shaped as inferior through heredity.&lt;ref name="Gustafson"/&gt; At the beginning of the 1990s, Rafter accounted for gender in the eugenic movement in the United States, showing how women were negatively affected with biological notions of being carriers of disease through reproduction.&lt;ref name="Gustafson"/&gt;

==Intellectual history==
Rafter achieved a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Criminal justice|Criminal Justice]] from [[State University of New York, Albany]], which sparked her academic career in [[feminist criminology]]. Thereafter, she began writing about delinquent individuals. Her first publication on this topic was in 1969, with her first group of writings was released throughout the 1980s.

Rafter began researching and creating arguments for the [[Feminism|feminis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t cause after her book ''White Trash: the Eugenic Family Studies 1877-1919.'' This led to her 1997 course at [[Northeastern University]] entitled Gender, Representation, and Social Control. This served to teach criminology students knowledge of the workings of prison institutions and their reciprocal influences.

In the 2000s she began focusing on the representation of [[crime film]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in mass media and culture. She explored this in her 2006 paper ''Shots in the Mirror: Crime Films and Society''. At the same time, she began research into the biological theories of crime. In 2004 she wrote ''Earnest A. Hooton and the Biological Tradition in American Criminology'', examining the historical importance of [[Earnest Hooton]]’s theories of biological explanations of crime while crediting Hooton with building a history for [[criminology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rafter|first=Nicole|date=2004-08-01|title=Earnest a. Hooton and the Biological Tradition in American Criminology*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2004.tb00535.x/abstract|journal=Criminology|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=735–772|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2004.tb00535.x|issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote an introduction for [[Cesare Lombroso]]’s ''Criminal Women'' in 2004.

In the first decade of the 21st century, Rafter published three works relating to crime films and criminology. These works include ''Badfellas: Movie Psychos, Popular Culture, and Law'', ''Shots in the Mirror: Crime Films and Society'', and ''Crime, Film, and Criminology: Recent Sex Crime Movies''.&lt;ref name="Gustafson" /&gt; In 2008 she published  ''The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime''.

==Contributions to feminist criminology==
Rafter contributed extensively to [[feminist criminology]] through her historical research of female prison systems, crime films and their social understandings of sex and crime being their reason for gendering. Her work has influenced the ways in which biological crime theorists have studied women. Her work of gender and justice has evolved with feminist criminological thinking.&lt;ref name="University"&gt;(n.d.). Nicole Rafter. College of Criminal Justice. Retrieved April 4, 2010, from http://www.cj.neu.edu/faculty_and_staff/research_faculty/nicole_rafter/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629214622/http://www.cj.neu.edu/faculty_and_staff/research_faculty/nicole_rafter/ |date=June 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafter contributed to feminist criminology through her research and literature on the female prison system starting in 1975. She wrote her last contribution in 1999. Arguing that research and writing at the time only focused on men and was written by men, Rafter led the way in documenting historical gender relations in prisons using, for example, the New York State Prison for Women at Auburn.&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;Rafter, Nicole H. (1982c). "Hard Times: the Evolution of the Women's Prison System and the Example of the New York State Prison for Women at Auburn, 1893-1933". In:  Rafter and Stanko, (Eds.), ''Judge, Lawyer, Victim, Thief: Women, Gender Roles, and Criminal Justice'' (Ch. 11). Boston: Northeastern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early article Rafter published in 1985 which has been cited six times claims that women in [[state prisons]] from 1800-1935 were only given partial justice documenting the differences and the emphasis given to male prison systems.&lt;ref name="partial"&gt;Rafter, Nicole H. (1985c). ''Partial Justice: Women in State Prisons, 1800-1935''. Boston, MA: Northeastern University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Rafter’s work on [[Incarceration of women|female prison systems]] occurred during the time when feminism was becoming a focal point in [[critical criminology]].

Rafter’s contributions to [[feminist criminology]] at [[Northeastern University]] in particular included her creating the syllabus for one of the first courses on women and crime and [[crime films]].&lt;ref name="Gustafson" /&gt; Rafter’s ''Shots in the Mirror: [[Crime Films]] and Society'' has been cited a total of twenty-one times which is indicative of her influence. Rafter's syllabus elaborates on how our depiction of on-screen crime in movies actually forms our understanding of everyday [[crime]] within society.  She argues within this book that crime films produce social hierarchies within crime that are reproduced in everyday life. Depicting, for example, the sexualized female character and the villainous man.&lt;ref name="shots"&gt;Rafter, Nicole H. (2006b). ''Shots in the Mirror: Crime Films and Society''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Rafter greatly contributed to the literature on crime films and their reproduction in everyday crime.

==Recognition==

Northeastern University recognizes one of Rafter’s areas of expertise as biological theories of crime.&lt;ref name="University"/&gt; Her historical account of eugenic family studies published in 1988 and, more recently, her book on the biological theories and writings of [[Earnest A. Hooton]], have both been cited five times. Allegedly, Rafter’s most influential contribution to feminist criminology was her re-translation and resource guide to [[Cesare Lombroso]]’s ''La Donna Delinquente'' in which she reinterprets women as being inferior and argues, therefore, their committing crimes at a lower level than male offenders.&lt;ref name="University" /&gt; Rafter has shown a large interest in the history of biological theories of crime and her translation of ''Criminal Woman'' persuades advances in further research of the history of criminology specifically surrounding crime and women.&lt;ref name="Gartner"&gt;Gartner, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Penguin Composition Rules''' were the guidelines written by typographer [[Jan Tschichold]] for use in composing the pages and typography of [[Penguin Books]]. The rules were embodied in a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. The booklet includes headings for various aspects of composition: Text Composition; Indenting of Paragraphs; Punctuation Marks and Spelling; Capitals, Small Capitals, and Italics; References and Footnotes; Folios; The Printing of Plays; The Printing of Poetry; Make-up.

Beyond this specific set of guidelines, Tschichold made further changes to Penguin's graphic standards. Penguin is well known for its standardized book covers and formats, as well as the diversity of the standards.&lt;ref&gt;The seeming contradiction between standardization and diversity is explained by the vast numbers of books produced by Penguin over many years.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jan Tschichold and Penguin==
Penguin Books was founded by Allen Lane in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152710/http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic look of Penguin was established before Lane brought Tschichold to Penguin in the late 1940s as head of typography and production. Tschichold was in England at Penguin between 1947 and 1949 before returning to Switzerland.

Tschichold's standardization of Penguin covers essentially took existing elements and refined them visually and refined their arrangement. Under Tschichold the covers included the use of [[Eric Gill|Eric Gill's]] [[Gill Sans]] typeface, which he was careful to have spaced evenly. According to Tschichold establishing this quality was not immediately embraced by the compositors; “Every day I had to wade through miles of corrections (often ten books daily). I had a rubber stamp made: ‘Equalize letter-spaces according to their visual value.’ It was totally ignored; the hand compositors continued to space out the capitals on title-pages (where optical spacing is essential) with spaces of equal thickness.”&lt;ref name="doubleday"&gt;Richard Doubleday, "[http://www.dis.uia.mx/conference/2005/HTMs-PDFs/PenguinBooks.pdf Jan Tschichold at Penguin Books: A Resurgance [sic&amp;#93; of Classical Book Design]" (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Gill Sans, Tschichold made use of Monotype [[Bembo]], Monotype [[Centaur (typeface)|Centaur]] (by [[Bruce Rogers (typographer)|Bruce Rogers]]) and Gill's [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typeface.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

The covers conformed to the golden ratio (4⅜" × 7⅛", 111mm × 181mm). For Penguin's distinctive orange color, Tschichold replaced it with a warmer tone.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

The '''Pulayar''' (also '''Pulaya''', '''Pulayas''', '''Cherumar''', '''Cheramar''' and '''Cheraman''') are one of the notable Community in South India in Hinduism, forming one of the main [[social groups]] in modern-day [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]] as well as in historical [[Tamil Nadu]] or Tamilakam.

== Traditions ==
Pulayars are noted for their music, craftsmanship, and for certain dances which include ''Kōlam-thullal'', a mask dance which is part of their exorcism rituals, as well as the [[Mudi-āttam]] or hair-dance which has its origins in a fertility ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignca.nic.in/ps_01021.htm|title=PRIMAL ELEMENTS:THE ORAL TRADITION}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14302">'''Reinforcement theory''' is a limited effects media model applicable within the realm of communication. The theory generally states that people seek out and remember information that provides cognitive support for their pre-existing attitudes and beliefs. The main assumption that guides this theory is that people do not like to be wrong and often feel uncomfortable when their beliefs are challenged.

Additionally, this theory focuses on the behavior to consequence connection within the ABC model.  This theory, in management, can also be referred to as [[operant conditioning]] or the [[law of effect]].  Quite simply, this theory notes that a behavior will continue with a certain level of frequency based on pleasant or unpleasant results.

==Politics==
Politics provides an excellent setting for the study of reinforcement theory. The statistics on [[Swing vote|undecided voters]] indicate that most people have pre-existing beliefs when it comes to politics. Relatively few people remain undecided late into high-profile elections. For example, about a month prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], less than one-fifth of likely voters claimed to be undecided (Sidoti, 2008). Much [[Political campaign|political advertising]] is targeted at these individuals not only because of their importance in the overall result, but also because they are the most susceptible to political persuasion (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997).

Part of the reason why undecided voters are frequent message targets can be found in reinforcement theory. Reinforcement theory predicts that people with already developed opinions will selectively attend to and cognitively incorporate information that supports their own views. Reinforcement theory has three primary mechanisms behind it: [[selective exposure theory|selective exposure]], [[selective perception]], and selective retention.

== Selective exposure ==

The primary basis for the [[selective exposure theory|selective exposure]] assumption can be located within [[cognitive dissonance]] theory, although contemporary work (Knobloch-Westerwick, 2014) draws on numerous theories. Basically, this theory states that people do not like to have previously-held beliefs challenged. When individuals encounter information that is discrepant from their own opinions, they seek to resolve the resultant disharmony somehow. People in general do not like to be wrong. A change or shift in attitude is sometimes interpreted as an admission that the original belief was inaccurate or inadequate. To avoid having their opinions challenged, research indicates that people tend to simply avoid information that might be discrepant in nature (Johnson-Cartee and Copeland, 1997). Support for this tendency to avoid dissonant messages can also be found in mood management theory. Basically, this theory states that people expose themselves to stimuli that are pleasurable and avoid stimuli that might induce a negative reaction (Zillman &amp; Bryant, 1985).

The selective exposure phenomenon focuses on how people manage to avoid incongruent information and primarily encounter information that supports predispositions. Obviously, most are not able to completely avoid all potentially challenging information. In these cases, message receivers may outright reject dissonant messages (Wheeless, 1974). The reasons for rejection are varied and plentiful. For example, the person might justify message rejection by attacking the source's credibility.

A topic as emotional and involving as political preference is especially subject to the selective exposure phenomenon. In fact, Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet (1948) found selective exposure early on to be a necessary link in their theory that campaigns primarily reinforce and activate preexisting political notions. The ever-increasing number of media options further facilitates the public's ability to selectively expose themselves to desired media messages. The explosion of the Internet has put the individual in the driver's seat with regard to what kind of information s/he will encounter. McLeod, Kosicki, and McLeod (2002) stated that information selection and "exposure is much more specialized and individualized" (p.&amp;nbsp;221) in the era of the World Wide Web. Furthermore, [[Cable television|cable channel]] options continue to multiply with specific, niche target audiences in mind. Some researchers worry that this increased level of fragmentation makes it possible for people to effectively avoid diverse viewpoints and perspectives (McLeod, Kosicki, &amp; McLeod, 2002). If a person limits his/her information acquisition to that which is only consistent with a personal point of view, s/he will surely not contribute to a fully informed electorate.

== Selective perception ==
It is not possible to completely avoid all discrepant messages. When exposure to a dissonant message has occurred, the phenomenon of selective perception often follows. This process simply means that people skew their perceptions to coincide with what they desire (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997). Perception is subjective and dependent on several factors; one factor, for example, is [[MIME|media type]]. Prior research indicates that people who actively process television news tend to engage in more individualized explanations of an event as opposed to those active processors of newspapers (McLeod, Kosicki, &amp; McLeod, 2002). The selective perception discussed here, however, is done in order to reduce dissonance with previously held beliefs (Wheeless, 1974). Several communication theories use this assumption of skewed perception as their basis (i.e., [[Hostile media effect|hostile media phenomenon]], third-person effect).

In the political realm, selective perception often occurs when a voter is presented with a candidate position that he or she does not agree with but supports the candidate otherwise. Sherrod (1971) found that "voters preferring a particular candidate do selectively perceive that candidate's position on an issue in such a way as to make it consistent with their own" (p.&amp;nbsp;554). He pinpointed three primary reasons why the initial disagreement happens. First, the candidate and voter may share political party affiliation, but may not agree on all of the issues. Second, the voter may simply be unaware of the candidate's actual position. Third, [[Peer pressure|social pressure]] to take a particular stand on an issue may exist that causes the voter to be incongruent with his or her preferred candidate (Sherrod, 1971). Selective Perception is not only associated with the voter and the candidate they affiliate with. Selective perception is also seen when someone attacks a political opponent by focusing on a particular issue they disagree with. Voters will ignore any common stances on issues with the opposition, and thus scorch the opponent on one main idea (Falcon, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poliscinewsreview.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/selective-perception-among-voters/|title=Selective Perception Among Voters|date=March 2, 2012|work=PoliSci News Review|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of political selective perception can be seen in Barry Ritholtz's Politics and Selective Perception chart. In this chart, we are given the unemployment numbers at specific points in time under different House Majorities. Selective perception allows the user to view this chart in any way they feel is deemed correct, though the chart doesn't reveal really anything about politics or unemployment (Ritholtz, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/11/politics-and-selective-perception/|title=Politics and Selective Perception|date=November 6, 2010|author=Barry Ritholtz|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sherrod (1971), there are three potential actions the voter may take to reduce dissonance in this situation. First, the voter may learn about the candidate's stand on the issue and then change either his or her opinion of the candidate or alter his or her own position on the issue in question to bring them in line. Second, the voter may still choose to disagree with the preferred candidate's position and instead will lessen the issue's personal importance. Last, the voter may engage in selective perception and actually misperceive the candidate's position to align better with the voter's own stand than it actually does. This does not require any change in attitude regarding either the candidate or the issue on the part of the voter. Sherrod's (1971) research found the third option to occur with the greatest frequency: he found that voters most often selectively misperceive a candidate's position on an issue rather than either change one's own view or relegate the issue to a status of lesser importance.

== Selective retention ==

The final mechanism behind reinforcement theory has to do with selective retention and recall. This phenomenon occurs when "people remember only those items that are in agreement with their predispositions" (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997, 94). The ease with which a person can recall information impacts the level and intensity of judgment related to the topic. For example, people who can easily recall an example related to the message are more likely to make an intense judgment about it (Shrum, 2002).

In general, most people are unable to accurately recall current event information presented on the news. Gunter (1991) found that only about 5% of television news viewers could accurately recall details of what they saw a short time after the newscast. Audience factors such as education and [[Social status|socio-economic status]] also affect recall ability (Surlin &amp; Gordon, 1976). Although additional variables such as news presentation and format affect information retention, people generally can better remember messages that are consistent with their own attitudes and beliefs (Wheeless, 1974). Surlin and Gordon (1976) found that political information in particular is more readily retained and summoned up when it supports preexisting beliefs and political opinions. Information that threatens such beliefs is more easily forgotten or lost. This phenomenon also extends to political advertising. Prior research found that a candidate's supporters could more easily bring to mind his/her [[Campaign advertising|political ad]] than the opponent's.

== Organizational Behavior ==
Moving away from politics and toward business organizational management, Stajkovic and Luthans (1997) ''"A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Organizational Behavior Modification on Task Performance 1975-1995".
illustrates that the classical behaviors that Watson(1913) and Pavlov (1927) and reinforcement theory (Ferster &amp; Skinner (1957), Skinner (1938,1966, 1969) and how behavior modification techniques can be applied to the human resources management within corporate organizational settings.  The below model provides a five-step application framework identifying, measuring, analyzing, contingently intervening in, and evaluating employee's task-related behaviors aimed at performance improvement.(Luthens &amp; Krietner (1975, 1985)

'''{{lang|es|Relaciones geográficas}}''' were a series of elaborate questionnaires distributed to the lands of King [[Philip II of Spain]] in the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] in [[North America]]. They were done so, upon his command, from 1579–1585.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Howard |title=The Hispanic American Historical Review |date=August 1964 |pages=341–374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a direct response to the reforms imposed by the {{lang|es|Ordenanzas}}, ordnances, of 1573.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Diaz |first=Lily |title=Introduction to the Relaciones Geográficas de Indias |url=http://www.mlab.uiah.fi/simultaneous/Text/Introduction_Relaciones.html |accessdate=29 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
These [[questionnaire]]s had upward of fifty questions that requested information on various aspects of the Spanish colonial life in each region or major town, in order to govern it more effectively.  Thus, these questionnaires had more of an administrative and functional purpose as opposed to intellectual gain.  These questionnaires are often times considered the first statistical study of the [[New World]], since they attempted to chart the lands, peoples, and trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=W|title=Mesoamerican Cultures: Relaciones Geográficas|year=2003|publisher=Bristol: Thoemmes|location=The Oxford Encyclopaedia, Or, Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and General Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of these questionnaires continues to grow over time due to these surveys being first-person information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz|first=Lily|title=Introduction to the Relaciones Geográficas De Indias|url=http://www.mlab.uiah.fi/simultaneous/Text/Introduction_Relaciones.html|accessdate=29 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
These extensive questionnaires have provided incredibly rich information with regard to 16th century ethnic groups in [[Mesoamerica]].  These questionnaires included questions regarding politics, taxes paid, the natural environment and resources, population history, settlement patterns, the language, markets and trade, native history and customs, maps, and the progress of the “missionization” program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-Columbian Civilizations|url=http://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/pre-Columbian-civilizations/109431#69401.toc|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These maps were created by indigenous people, sailors, local officials, and other individuals in New Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mundy|first=Barbara|title=The Mapping of New Spain: Indigenous Cartography and the Maps of the Relaciones Geográficas|year=1996|publisher=Chicago University|location=Chicago|pages=xviii-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these maps that were requested were often commissioned by artists and have now been linked to the [[Casta]] paintings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona|title=. Casta Painting: Images of Race in Eighteenth-century Mexico|year=2004|publisher=New Haven: Yale UP|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the period.

==Result==
These surveys were reported back to Spain’s King Phillip II and allowed the Spanish monarchy to have better control over the people and the politics in New Spain.  However, not all major cities and regions are accounted for because not all local officials returned the questionnaire or perhaps their response did not survive.  Along with this, since all people were allowed to send in a map it showed the bias of each social class and represented common issues of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mundy|first=Barbara|title=The Mapping of New Spain: Indigenous Cartography and the Maps of the Relaciones Geográficas|year=1996|publisher=Chicago University|location=Chicago|pages=xviii-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, this scientific process of data collection and statistics essentially built a bridge between two continents.  

Today, many of the manuscript versions of these questionnaires are found in four different locations: The [[General Archive of the Indies]] in Seville, the [[Real Academia de la Historia]] in Madrid, the Benson Library at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[Glasgow University Library|University of Glasgow Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=W|title=Mesoamerican Cultures: Relaciones Geográficas|year=2003|publisher=Bristol: Thoemmes|location=The Oxford Encyclopaedia, Or, Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and General Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shaikh of the [[India]]n state of  [[Rajasthan]] are part of the wider [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] community of [[South Asia]]. They form the largest single [[Muslim]] community of the state.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal  &amp; N.N Vyas pages 889 to 891 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of Rajasthani Shaikh community have also migrated to [[Pakistan]] after independence and have settled in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]].

==Origin and Present Circumstances==

The word '''Shaikh''' ({{lang-ar|''' شيخ '''}}), can means an elder of a tribe, a lord,  a revered old man, or [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]]. In [[Rajasthan]], the Shaikh community as elsewhere in [[South Asia]] are descendents of the converts of [[Vaishya]] and [[Brahmin]] communities to [[Islam]]. They speak [[Mewari]] among themselves, and [[Urdu]] with outsiders. The Shaikh are found mainly in the districts of [[Ajmer District|Ajmer]], [[Udaipur District|Udaipur]] and [[Jodhpur District|Jodhpur]]. Their main sub-divisions are the [[Silawat]] and [[Muslim Rangrez|Rangrez]].

The community is endogamous, and they practice both parallel cousin and cross-cousin marriages. Their main occupation is trade, and many are now engaged in the sale of textiles and gold. Some of the Shaikh own land, and are cultivators. In addition, some Shaikh have an expertise in cloth printing and wall painting. They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s and a fairly orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2901">In books and other works, a '''subtitle''' is an explanatory or alternate [[title (publishing)|title]]. As an example, [[Mary Shelley]] gave her most famous novel the title ''[[Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus]]''; by using the subtitle "the Modern Prometheus", she references the [[Prometheus|Greek Titan]] as a hint of the novel's themes.&lt;ref name="Cantor1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cantor|first=Paul A.|title=Creature and Creator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmU7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA103|year=1985|publisher=CUP Archive|page=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, subtitles were traditionally denoted and separated from the title proper by the conjunction "or", perhaps hinting at their function as an alternate title. A more modern usage is to simply separate the subtitle by punctuation, making the subtitle more of a continuation or sub-element of the title proper.

==Literature==
Subtitles for plays were fashionable in the [[Elizabethan era]]; [[William Shakespeare]] parodied this vogue by giving ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' his only subtitle, the deliberately uninformative ''What You Will'', implying that the subtitle can be whatever the audience wants it to be.&lt;ref name="ShakespeareRichmond2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richmond|first1=Kent|author2=William Shakespeare|title=Twelfth Night, Or, What You Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VmWSZMPMxQC&amp;pg=PA11|year=2004|publisher=Full Measure Press|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In printing, subtitles often appear below the title in a less prominent typeface or following the title after a colon.

Some modern publishers choose to forgo subtitles when republishing historical works, such as Shelley's famous story, which is often now sold simply as ''Frankenstein''.

In library cataloging the subtitle does not include an alternate title which is defined as part of the title proper; e.g. ''[[One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw]]'' would be filed as ''"One Good Turn" (title proper) "A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw" (subtitle)'', while ''[[Twelfth Night, or What You Will]]'' would be filed as ''"Twelfth Night, or What You Will" (title proper)''.

==Film and other media==
In film, this has been used in films such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' and ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)]]''.

Subtitles are also used to distinguish different installments in a series, instead of or in addition to a number, such as: ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', the second in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' series; ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'', the third in the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series; and ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', the second in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.

{{Pashtuns}}
The '''Tareen''' (or '''Tarin''') ({{lang-ps|ترین}}) is a tribe of Western [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] who inhabit Southern Afghanistan, the Balochistan province of Pakistan and Hazara region of northwestern Pakistan.&lt;ref name = "Caroe 1957"&gt;Caroe O. ''The Pathans 550 B.C.- A.D. 1957'' Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-577221-0}}. Page 521.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyat Khan 1865"/&gt;

==History==
Little is known of the Tareen prior to [[Muhammad Ghori]]'s incursions into [[India]] in the late 12th century. However, much of the tribe is still living a mostly nomadic life in their native lands of Afghanistan and Pishin(Present Pakistan).&lt;ref name="Panni 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ridgeway 1911"&gt;Ridgeway R. T. I. ''The Pathans'' (1911) Reprinted Peshawar, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tareen people identify with descent from Sharkbun, a grandson of [[Qais Abdur Rasheed]]. Tareen had three sons, Tor, Speen and Abdal (Durrani). The descendants of spin settled in [[Duki, Pakistan|Dukki]], [[Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]]. The descendants of tor settled in [[Pishin District|Pishin]] [[Balochistan]]. [[Durrani|Abdali-Durrani]] was an ancestor of the people of [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name = "Caroe 1957"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haider 1988"&gt;Haider G. R. ''The Pashtuns - a monograph on tribal claims of their origins'' (1988) University of Peshawar Press p 11 - 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sher Shah Suri]] brought the Tareen from the [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun lands]] to parts of central and northern [[India]] such as [[Bhagalpur]], [[Bihar]] and regions of contemporary [[Pakistan]].

At the time of [[Akbar the Great]], Alaf Khan was a Tareen leader in [[Bhagalpur]]. He was a [[Mansabdar]] (government official) of the "Chahr Hazari" rank.&lt;ref&gt;Mir Ali Wardi Khan ''Mansabdar aha Behar'' (1724) translation to Urdu 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardew C. H. H. ''Bhaugalpore: a short history'' (1894) Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]] (1628 to 1658) a group of Tareen/Tarin from [[Tarin Kowt]] emigrated to the area which is now the [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara area]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Panni 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazara"&gt;''Hazara District Gazetteer'' 1883 and 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, in about 1750, when [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], ruler of the [[Durrani]] Empire made incursions into northwestern [[India]], a contingent of Tareen from this area was raised to fight in the Third Battle of [[Panipat]], against the [[Maratha Empire]], in January 1761.&lt;ref&gt;P J Mayne, ''The North West Frontier and Northern Punjab under the Durrani Afghans'' (An Historical Study) pub Lahore, 1911. p 169&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1820 to 1849, [[Punjab]] came under [[Sikh]] control. The Tareen people resisted occupation with sometimes severe consequences.&lt;ref name="Hazara"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawalpindi Gazetteer 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 1849, the [[United Kingdom|British]] annexed [[Punjab]]. Initially, the Tareen resisted. Later, the Tareen reconciled themselves to the new situation and gradually found service with the [[British Raj]]. The Tareen worked in the military and civil administration.&lt;ref&gt;Spain J. W. ''The Pathan Borderland'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panni 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazara"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attock District Gazetteer 1892&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches (septs)==
According to [[Shah Ni'matullah Wali|Neamet Ullah]] in ''History of the Pashtuns'', Tareen, had three sons after which the branches of the Tareen descendants are named: Tor, Speen (Aspin or Spin) and Abdal (Durrani).&lt;ref name="Dorn"&gt;Dorn B. ''History of the Afghans: translated from the Persian of Neamet Ullah'' Third edition p42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elphinstone, II. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abdal are divided into the [[Zirak]], and the [[Panjpai]]. The [[Abdal]] became known as the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]].&lt;ref name="Hyat Khan 1865"&gt;Nawab Muhammad Hyat Khan, "Hayat i Afghan" (Orig. in Persian 1865) trans. by Priestley H. B. "Afghanistan and its Inhabitants", 1874; Reprint Lahore: Sang i Meel Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
The principal languages of Tareen is [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and while those living in Hazara Division of Pakistan have adopted [[Hindko]].&lt;ref name="Ridgeway 1911"/&gt; [[Persian language|Persian]] was once used as a formal language for official records and correspondence. Until the late 1800s, tombstones were also inscribed in Persian.&lt;ref name="Caroe 1957"/&gt; Tareen who have settled away from [[Pishin, Pakistan|Pishin]] have adopted their local languages but some remain bilingual.&lt;ref name="Hyat Khan 1865"/&gt;

==Diaspora==
===Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, Pakistan===
In the 1600 and 1700s, Tareen people of Tor descent of the Batezai clan moved to the [[Haripur District]] of the [[Hazara District|Hazara]] region of [[Khyber Pukhtunkhwa]] and established themselves there&lt;ref name="Panni 1969"&gt;Panni S. B. ''Tarikh i Hazara'' (1969) 2nd edition, Peshawar. p270 - 275.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hazara area, the Tareen people have adopted the ways of the people of the Hazara region.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad A. S. ''Report on the Hazara'' (1964) DC's Office Abbottabad Hazara District.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Small populations of the Tareen have settled in India since the 1100s, particularly near [[Bhopal]] and in [[Sambhal]] (Sarai Tareen) [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="Hyat Khan 1865"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panni 1969"/&gt;

===Afghanistan===
                      
Tareens in Afghanistan are found in provinces like [[Kandahar]], [[Oruzgan]], [[Helmand]], [[Herat]], Nangarhar, [[Ghazni]], Logar, [[Kabul]], Kunduz etc. In Oruzgan there is a town and provincial capital named Tareenkot. In Afghanistan the highest number of Tareens are of Bor Or abdali Tareen clan (e.g. now mostly known as Durrani after Ahmed shah Abdali) and than comes Tor Tareens number along with some Spin Tareens residing in few areas of Afghanistan and other Tareen branches.

===Balochistan===

Tareens in Balochistan reside in areas of [[Pishin District|Pishin]], [[Harnai]], Dukki, [[Gulistan, Balochistan|Gulistan]], [[Ziarat]], [[Quetta]], and [[Mastung District|Mastung]].

The '''Economic Liberty Act of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''' was adopted by the [[Parliament of Georgia]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/1405264&lt;/ref&gt; The act was introduced by President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] in September 2009, as a way of enacting principles based on the [[Rose Revolution]].  The act has been in force since January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gov.ge/files/34_32576_148262_GEORGIAADOPTSTHEECONOMICLIBERTYACT.pdf|title=Press Release|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Parliament of Georgia passed '''The Economic Liberty Act (ELA)''' in December 2011. Unlike the initial draft, the final act (a constitutional amendment) contained a reservation which states that a separate [[Organic law|Organic Law]] should define those cases in which the government will still be able to increase taxes without calling a [[Referendum|referendum.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23691|title=Civil.Ge {{!}} Revised 'Economic Liberty Act' Passed with Final Reading|last=Georgia|first=Civil|website=www.civil.ge|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Economic Liberty Act is the Organic Law of Georgia and is based on the 4th and 5th parts of Article 94 of the [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|Constitution of Georgia]] (Constitutional Law of Georgia No 4033 of July 1, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/1168565&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.ge/uploads/other/28/28803.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The act restricted the government from making changes to major economic policy without a [[popular referendum]]. It capped the government expenditures at 64% of the GDP, the [[Debt-to-GDP ratio|debt to GDP ratio]] at 60%, and the [[Budget deficits|budget deficit]] at 3% of the GDP. Some of these rules were known as the [[Euro convergence criteria|Maastricht criteria]], enshrined in the [[Stability and Growth Pact|EU Stability and Growth Pact]] and facilitating the smooth transition to the [[Eurozone]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa5oDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=economic+liberty+act+great+rebirth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P2oZdc0CeI&amp;sig=yfl3jCjk9jUieBF7DjiNzMkSnZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNs4nH0vfSAhWCqxoKHWzCDvUQ6AEIETAC#v=onepage&amp;q=economic%20liberty%20act%20great%20rebirth&amp;f=false|title=The Great Rebirth: Lessons from the Victory of Capitalism over Communism|last=Djankov|first=Simeon|date=2014-10-10|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780881326987|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act is intended to restrict the state’s ability to interfere in the affairs of the economy and grant power over tax changes to the people directly. While aiming at reducing the state expenses and debt by 30 and 60 percent respectively, it also explicitly prohibits the government from manipulating taxes without a popular referendum on rates and structure. Currently, the state budget is approximately 30% of the [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]], and public debt is over 38% of the GDP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16784">[[File:Philip iv and family.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Some of the principal actors in the ''Tour de Nesle Affair'', depicted in 1315, the year after the scandal broke: [[Philip IV of France]] (centre) and his family: l–r: his sons, [[Charles IV of France|Charles]] and [[Philip V of France|Philip]], his daughter [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], himself, his eldest son and heir [[Louis X of France|Louis]], and his brother, [[Charles of Valois]]]]

The '''Tour de Nesle affair''' was a [[scandal]] amongst the French royal family in 1314, during which [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret]], [[Blanche of Burgundy|Blanche]], and [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan]], the daughters-in-law of [[Philip IV of France|King Philip IV]], were accused of [[adultery]]. The accusations were apparently started by Philip's daughter, [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The ''[[Tour de Nesle]]'' was a tower in [[Paris]] where much of the adultery was said to have occurred. The scandal led to [[torture]], [[Capital punishment|executions]] and [[Incarceration|imprisonments]], with lasting consequences for the final years of the [[House of Capet]].

== Background ==
[[File:Isabella of France.jpg|left|thumb|[[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella of England]] first reported the rumours of adultery by her sisters-in-law to her father in Paris]]
The royal scandal occurred at the end of the difficult reign of Philip IV, known as ''"le Bel"'' (the Fair) because of his good looks. Philip IV was a strangely unemotional man; the contemporary [[Bernard Saisset|bishop of Pamiers]] described him as "neither a man nor a beast, but a statue";&lt;ref&gt;Weir, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; modern historians have noted that he "cultivated a reputation for Christian kingship and showed few weaknesses of the flesh."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Jones and McKitterick, p.394.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his reign, Philip had attempted to build up the authority and prestige of the French crown, raising fresh revenues, creating new institutions of government, engaging in wars against his rivals, and on occasion challenging the authority of the [[Catholic Church|Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallam and Everard, p.363.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before the crisis broke, Philip had been engaged in the liquidation of the order of the [[Knights Templar]] in France. By 1314, however, he was financially overstretched and in an increasingly difficult domestic political situation, and some have suggested that his weakened position contributed to the subsequent royal crisis.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Broad and Green, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip IV had three sons, [[Louis X of France|Louis]], [[Philip V of France|Philip]] and [[Charles IV of France|Charles]]. As was customary for the period, all three were married with an eye for political gain. Initially Philip had intended for Louis to marry [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan]], the eldest daughter of [[Otto IV, Count of Burgundy]], but in the end chose [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret]], the daughter of [[Robert II, Duke of Burgundy]], in 1305, and arranged for his middle son Philip to marry Joan in 1307. His youngest son Charles married [[Blanche of Burgundy|Blanche]], another of Otto's daughters, in 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, p.250; Brown, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three marriages had fared differently. Louis' is considered to have been an unhappy match; Louis, known as "the Quarreler" and "the Headstrong", is said to have preferred playing [[real tennis]] to spending time with the "feisty and shapely" Margaret.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Weir, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles, a relatively conservative, "strait-laced"&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p.101.&lt;/ref&gt; and "stiff-necked"&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p.97.&lt;/ref&gt; individual, had an unexceptional marriage. Philip, in contrast, became noted for his unusual generosity to his wife Joan;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt; the pair had a considerable number of children in a short space of time and Philip wrote numerous, if formulaic, love letters to his wife over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Philip the Fair married his daughter, [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], to [[Edward II of England]] in 1308 in an attempt to resolve the tensions of his twin problems of conflict over the contested territories of [[Gascony]] and [[Flanders]]. Isabella's marriage proved difficult, largely due to Edward's intimate relationship with his close friend and possible lover, [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]]. Isabella looked frequently to her father for help addressing the problems in her English marriage.&lt;ref&gt;See Weir, chapter two.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The scandal ==
[[File:Tour.de.Nesle.png|thumb|left|225px|A 19th-century representation of the ''[[Tour de Nesle]],'' where much of the adulterous activity was alleged to have occurred, by [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]]]

Most accounts of the scandal begin with the visit of the king and queen of England to the queen's father in France during 1313. During the visit, Louis and Charles had had a satirical [[Puppetry|puppet show]] put on for their guests, and after this Isabella had given new embroidered [[Coin purse|purses]] both to her brothers and to their wives.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Weir, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Isabella and Edward held a large dinner in London to celebrate their return and Isabella apparently noticed that the purses she had given to her sisters-in-law were now being carried by two [[Normans|Norman]] knights, [[Walter of Aunay]] (also known as Gautier of Aunay) and [[Philip of Aunay]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Isabella concluded that the pair must have been carrying on an illicit affair, and appears to have informed her father of this during her next visit to France in 1314.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, p.92, 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip IV placed the knights under surveillance for a period, and the scandal began to take shape. The accusations centred on suggestions that Blanche and Margaret had been drinking, eating and engaging in adultery with Gautier and Philip of Aunay in the ''[[Tour de Nesle]]'' over a period.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Weir, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tour de Nesle'' was an old guard tower in [[Paris]] next to the river [[Seine]] and had been bought by Philip IV in 1308.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Lorentz and Sandron, p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; The third sister-in-law, Joan, was initially said to have been present on some of these occasions and to have known of the affair; later accusations were extended to have included suggestions that she had also been involved in adultery herself.

Most historians have tended to conclude that the accusations against Blanche and Margaret were probably true, although some are more skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;See Weir, pp99–100 for an argument in favour of the accusations; Hallam and Everard, p.363 for an alternative argument.&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts have suggested that Isabella's accusations were politically motivated; she had just given birth to her son, [[Edward III of England|Edward]], and in theory the removal of all three of her sisters-in-law might have made his accession to the French throne more likely.&lt;ref&gt;See references in Hallam and Everard, p.363.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that this seems an unlikely plan, given the normal probability that at least one of the three brothers would have successfully remarried and enjoyed a male heir in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;Hallam and Everard, p.363; Weir, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that Philip IV's unpopular [[Grand Chamberlain of France|chamberlain]]
[[Enguerrand de Marigny]] might have been responsible for framing the knights and women involved.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the period of surveillance,  Philip IV broke the news of the accusations publicly and arrested all involved. There are some suggestions that Walter and Philip of Aunay attempted to escape to England but in due course both knights were interrogated and tortured by French officials.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt; Both confessed to adultery and were found guilty, therefore, of ''[[lèse majesté]]''.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Blanche and Margaret were tried before the ''[[Paris Parlement]]'' and found guilty of adultery. The two women had their heads shaven and were sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, pp99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan was also tried before the ''Parlement'' but was found innocent, partially as a result of her husband Philip's influence.

== Impact ==

The ''Tour de Nesle'' scandal led to the imprisonment of Blanche and Margaret, and the execution of their lovers.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Having been tortured, the guilty knights Gautier and Philippe were then killed; most histories agree that they were first [[Castration|castrated]] and then either [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn and quartered]]&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; or [[Flaying|flayed]] alive, [[Breaking wheel|broken on a wheel]] and then hanged.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The episode came as a severe shock to Philip IV and some suggest that it contributed to his death later that same year.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Isabella was criticized by some in France for failing to stand by her sisters-in-law, although this passed with time;&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Isabella's own marriage failed catastrophically in due course, with many historians believing that she was responsible for the murder of her husband Edward in 1327 after Isabella's seizure of power in England with her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger de Mortimer]] in 1326.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[papal conclave, 1314–16|gap in the papacy]] between the death of [[Clement V]] in 1314 and the election of [[John XXII]] in 1316, Margaret's marriage to Louis could not be annulled, and she was imprisoned in an underground cell at [[Château Gaillard]] castle.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Louis succeeded to the throne later that year after the death of Philip IV, being officially crowned in August 1315. Margaret, however, was still alive but promptly died under suspicious circumstances, possibly murdered, on 14&amp;nbsp;August, whilst still imprisoned. Louis remarried five days later to [[Clementia of Hungary]], the niece of Louis' own uncle and close advisor, [[Charles of Valois]]. Louis himself died a year later after falling ill following a challenging game of tennis.&lt;ref&gt;Gillmeister, pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Château-Gaillard in black and white.jpg|400px|thumb|alt=The grassy outer bailey of Château Gaillard; the land slopes away to a ditch, separating the outer bailey from the middle bailey. Parts of the wall surrounding the middle bailey still stand. To the right is part of the wall of the outer bailey. In the background the keep rises above the walls of the inner bailey.|The ruins of [[Château Gaillard]], where [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret]] and [[Blanche of Burgundy|Blanche]] were imprisoned after their sentencing for [[adultery]] in 1314]]

Joan was placed under house arrest at [[Château de Dourdan|Dourdan]] in the aftermath of the ''Parlement'' acquittal amidst suggestions that she might also have been having an adulterous affair herself, but enjoyed the continuing support of her husband, Philip.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Brown, p.138.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip campaigned for her release, which was forthcoming the next year and Joan returned to court. It is unclear why Philip stood by her in the way that he did. One theory has been that he was concerned that if he was to abandon Joan, he might also lose [[County of Burgundy|Burgundy]], which he had gained through their marriage; another theory suggests that he was in truth very deeply in love with her.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; With the death after a few days of the baby King [[John I of France]], Joan served as Philip's queen consort for several years; after Philip's death, she inherited the [[County of Artois]] from her mother and finally died in 1330.

Blanche remained in prison at Château Gaillard as well for eight years until 1322, when Charles assumed the throne. Upon becoming king, Charles still refused to release Blanche, instead annulling their marriage and having Blanche consigned to a [[Convent|nunnery]].&lt;ref&gt;Echols and Williams, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles remarried immediately afterwards to [[Marie of Luxembourg, Queen of France|Marie of Luxembourg]]; Blanche died the next year, her health broken from the years spent underground.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

== Aftermath and legacy ==
The affair badly damaged the reputation of women in senior French circles, contributing to the way that the [[Salic Law]] was implemented during subsequent arguments over the succession to the throne.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; When [[Louis X of France|Louis]] died unexpectedly in 1316, supporters of his eldest daughter [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]] found that suspicions hung over her parentage following the scandal and that the French nobility were increasingly cautious over the concept of a woman inheriting the throne – Louis' brother, [[Philip V of France|Philip]] took power instead.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip died unexpectedly young as well, and his younger brother [[Charles IV of France|Charles]] did not live long after remarrying after his coronation, similarly dying without male heirs. The interpretation of the [[Salic Law]] then placed the French succession in doubt. Despite [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]], the son of [[Charles of Valois]], claiming the throne with French noble support, [[Edward III of England]], the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]] was able to press his own case, resulting in the ensuing [[Hundred Years War]] (1337–1453).&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p.106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The affair would also have an impact in European culture. Scholars studying the theme of [[courtly love]] have observed that the narratives about adulterous queens die out shortly after the ''Tour de Nesle'' scandal, suggesting that they became less acceptable or entertaining after the executions and imprisonments in the French royal family.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, pp.171–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the affair was used by the French dramatist [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]] as the basis for his play ''[[La Tour de Nesle]]'' in 1832, "a romantic thriller reconstructing medieval crimes on a grand scale".&lt;ref&gt;McGraw-Hill, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tour de Nesle'' guard-tower itself was destroyed in 1665.&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt; ''Le Roi de fer'' (1955), the first novel of [[Maurice Druon]]'s seven-volume series ''[[Les Rois maudits]]'' (''The Accursed Kings''), describes the affair and the subsequent executions in lurid and imaginative detail.

'''Tunumiit oraasiat''' or '''East Greenlandic''' ([[Kalaallisut]]: ''tunumiusut'', East Greenlandic: ''tunumiisut'') is a variety of [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] spoken in eastern [[Greenland]] by the [[Tunumiit]]. It is generally considered a divergent dialect of Greenlandic, but verges on being a distinct language.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Tersis, in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZTG-Jx7sE0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Variations on polysynthesis: the Eskaleut languages]'' Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mennecier, Philippe (1995).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1993">The '''Wagher''' caste is found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]]. They are also known as Vaghers, they are Rajput born and one of the brave caste but have no connection with the [[Vager]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1448-1453&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The Waghers are principally found in [[Devbhumi Dwarka district]]. &amp; [[Jamnagar district]]. They are said to have migrated from [[Kutch]], and their ancestor Jam Hamirji Jadeja, a [[Rajput]] from Kutch married a [[Garasia]] girl from Padli near Hamusar. Situated at Gopi road.  They are [[Hindu]] as well as [[Muslim]] by religion. The community is thus one of the many mixed [[Rajput]] groups such as the [[Khant (caste)|Khant]] found in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1448-1453&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The community still speak [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], and are endogamous. They have several clans, the main ones being the Kamora,Manek,Hathal, vagha,Ker,kara,bhiyani,hadani,jodhani,punsiya,Sumaniya, Jam, Maliyani, Bhathad, Bathiya, Gohil, Parmar, Gad, Giggla, Mapani, Tilayat, Bhaya, Makawana, Sameja, Notiyar, Bhatti, Bhagad, Bhaya etc. The community maintain the practice of clan exogamy.  They are a major landowning community in the [[Devbhumi Dwarka district]].  The community is mainly into Farming, Seafaring, Fishing (Muslim Wagher)  etc and also like other [[Gujarat]] castes, they have migrated to other parts of [[India]] and overseas in search of work.

Women have been involved in aviation from the [[Timeline ofwomen in aviation|beginnings]] of both lighter-than air travel and as [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s and space travel were developed. Women pilots were also called "aviatrices" (singular: "aviatrix"). Women have been flying powered aircraft since 1908, however most, prior to 1970, were restricted to working privately or in support roles in the [[aviation]] industry.{{sfn|Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|2013}} Aviation also allowed women to "travel alone on unprecedented journeys."{{sfn|Dall'Acqua|1986|p=1}} Women who have been successful in various aviation fields have served as [[Mentorship|mentors]] to younger women, helping them along in their careers.{{sfn|Olsen|2016}}

Within the first two decades of powered flight, women on every continent except Antarctica had begun to fly, perform in aerial shows, parachute, and even transport passengers. They were increasingly involved in establishing distance records, aerobatic records and pressing for airplanes to be used for disaster and public health services. During World War II, women from every continent helped with war efforts and though mostly restricted from military flight many of the female pilots flew in auxiliary services. In the 1950s and 1960s, women were primarily restricted to serving in support fields like flight simulation training, air traffic control, and as flight attendants. Since the 1970s, women have been allowed to participate in military service in most countries.

Women's participation in the field of aviation has increased over the years. In the United States, in 1930, there were around 200 women pilots but in five years there were more than 700.{{sfn|Gant|2001|pp=11–12}} [[Women of Aviation Worldwide Week]] has reported that after 1980, the increase in gender parity for women pilots in the [[United States]] has been stagnant.{{sfn|Goyer|2012}} Women flying commercial airlines in [[India]] make up 11.6% of all pilots. The global number of women airline pilots is 87%.{{sfn|Sinha|2014}}

== History ==
[[File:Aida-1903.jpg|thumb|[[Aida de Acosta]], 1903 flying Alberto Santos-Dumont's airship N° 9]]
The first woman known to fly was [[Élisabeth Thible]], who was a passenger in an untethered [[hot air balloon]], which flew above Lyon, France in 1784.{{sfn|Jessen|2002|p=xi}} Four years later, [[Jeanne Labrosse]] became the first woman to fly solo in a balloon and would become the first woman to parachute, as well.{{sfn|Sinclair|2012|p=179}}{{sfn|Centennial of Women Pilots|2009}} [[Sophie Blanchard]] took her first balloon flight in 1804, was performing as a professional [[Balloon (aeronautics)|aeronaut]] by 1810 and was made [[Napoleon]]'s chief of air service in 1811.{{sfn|Holmes|2013|pp=4–6}} Blanchard, the first woman who was a professional in the air, died in a spectacular crash in 1819.{{sfn|Walsh|1913|p=12}} In June 1903, [[Aida de Acosta]], an American woman vacationing in Paris, convinced [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], pioneer of [[dirigible]]s to allow her to pilot his airship, becoming probably the first woman to pilot a motorized aircraft.{{sfn|Ruiz|Korrol|2006|p=188}}

The first machine-powered flight was accomplished by the [[Wright brothers|Wright Brothers]] on December 17, 1903. Both brothers felt that it was important to recognize the contributions of [[Katharine Wright|Katherine Wright]] to their work.{{sfn|Women in Aviation International|2003}} She found teachers who could help with the Wright's flying experiments.{{sfn|Wright Brothers Aeroplane Company|2013}} Katherine, while she didn't fly with her brothers until later in 1909,{{sfn|Women in Aviation International|2003}} knew "everything about the working of their machines."{{sfn|''The World Magazine''|1909}} Katherine supported them financially, giving them her savings and also supported them emotionally.{{sfn|''The Oregon Daily Journal''|1909|p=34}} When Orville Wright was injured in 1908, Katherine moved close to the hospital to take care of him.{{sfn|''Harrisburg Daily Independent''|1908|p=1}} Later, after the Wright brothers patented their aircraft in 1906, she worked as their executive secretary.{{sfn|Wright Brothers Aeroplane Company|2013}} In 1909, she traveled to Europe to become the social manager for her brothers.{{sfn|Wright Brothers Aeroplane Company|2013}} Her brothers were very [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] and relied on Katherine to help promote their work.{{sfn|Gabrielli|2003}} Katherine was considered the "silent partner" of the Wright Brothers by ''[[The Word (magazine)|The World Magazine]]''.{{sfn|''The World Magazine''|1909}} The ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|Saint Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' called her the "inspiration of her brothers in their experiments."{{sfn|''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''|1909|p=6}}

As [[World War II]] began, women became involved in combat. In the United States, prior to the war, pilots typically flew only in good weather, so that they could judge ground position. Flying in combat required pilots to fly in varying conditions, and a push for instrument training began. By 1944 around 6,000 women had been trained as [[Link Trainer]] operators and were teaching male pilots how to read instruments. [[WAVES]] like [[Patricia W. Malone]] transitioned after the war to commercial [[flight simulation]] instruction, where women dominated the industry of flight training operators.{{sfn|Best|n.d.|p=49}}

In 1939, [[Jacqueline Cochran]] wrote to the first lady, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], about using women pilots in the military.{{sfn|Texas Women's University|2013}} Later, [[Nancy Harkness Love]] also made a similar request to the US Army, however both women's ideas were put on hold until 1942.{{sfn|Texas Women's University|2013}} General [[Henry H.

Organizations were formed, such as the [[Australia Women's Pilot's Association]] (AWPA).{{Sfn|Bridges|Neal-Smith|2014|p=168}} Another organization was the [[Whirly-Girls]], started by [[Jean Ross Howard Phelan]] in 1955 for women helicopter pilots. She started the group as an informal interest group, but formalized it in order to better help the members network and support each other in the male-dominated field.{{sfn|Weitekamp|2005|pp=55–56}}

[[Pakistan]] modeled its air force on the [[Royal Air Force|British Royal Air Force]] during the late 1950s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, air travel was expensive and few people of color could afford to fly. U.S. segregation laws were slowly being overturned to lift barriers for not only travel, but for employment opportunities.{{sfn|Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|2007}}{{sfn|Brownlee|2013}} Coupled with the influx of workers from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean, and the independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean, British need for labor in the post-war period made recruiting of 'coloured labour' in the same period a necessity.{{sfn|Brown|1995}} The following decades would increasingly see more women from former colonies enter aviation.{{sfn|Southern African Women in Aviation and Aerospace|2012}}{{sfn|République Tunisienne Ministère du Transport|2013}}{{sfn|''The Jamaica Observer''|2010}}{{sfn|Somali Aviation Resource Center|2013}}{{sfn|McKenzie|2013}}{{sfn|''The National Mirror''|2014}}{{sfn|

In the 1960s, stewardesses, as flight attendants were known, were considered glamorous and exotic adventurers. Frank Sinatra's song ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' gave birth to the jet set.{{sfn|Handy|2014}} Adding to the allure, Bernard Glemser's novel, ''Girl on a Wing'', and the British movie based on it, ''[[Come Fly with Me (film)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1963), depicted stewardesses as stylish seekers of romance.{{sfn|''Variety''|1962}} Wearing custom-fitted uniforms, attendants were career women, whose looks, marital status and childlessness were guarded by industry executives, much as Hollywood starlets had been. On the one hand, they were to project an ideal of womanhood, but on the other, they were used to sell airline travel through their sexuality. The double-standard that they faced as well as the glamorous lifestyle they lived, shot to the best-seller's list with the publication in 1967 of the book, ''[[Coffee, Tea or Me?]]''{{sfn|Handy|2014}} In 1963, stewardesses who held a press conference on airlines' policy of retiring stewardesses at 32, caught the attention of the country. The press conference focused attention on the airlines narrow standard of "feminine allure".{{sfn|Barry|2006}}

In 1960, [[Olga Tarling]] became the first woman [[air traffic controller]] in Australia{{sfn|Bridges|Neal-Smith|2014|pp=168–169}} and [[Yvonne Sintes|Yvonne Pope Sintes]] and Frankie O'Kane become the first female British air traffic controllers.{{sfn|Gough-Cooper|2013}} That same year, [[Alia Menchari]] became the first woman [[Tunisia]]n pilot.{{sfn|République Tunisienne Ministère du Transport|2013}} In 1961, [[Lucille Golas]] attained the first pilot license for a woman in [[Guyana]] to assist her husband in his mining business.{{sfn|''Guyana Chronicle''|2014}} Asegedech Assefa became the first Ethiopian woman to earn a pilot's license in 1962.{{sfn|''Tadias Magazine''|2010}} That same year, Jacqueline Cochran became the first woman to fly a jet across the Atlantic Ocean.{{sfn|Centennial of Women Pilots|2009}}

A privately funded project, of [[William Randolph Lovelace II|William Lovelace]], the [[Mercury 13|Woman in Space Program]] recruited women pilots in the U.S. to test them for suitability for the space program. Thirteen of the recruits passed [[NASA]]'s physical requirements. Scheduled for additional testing, the [[United States Navy]] canceled use of their facilities as there were no NASA officials involved. Public hearings were held by a special Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics in 1962. Because NASA required all astronauts to attain an engineering degree and be graduates of military jet piloting test programs, none of the women could meet the entry prerequisites. The subcommittee took no action after the hearing. The following year, [[Valentina Tereshkova]],{{sfn|Weitekamp|2004}} an amateur Russian parachute jumper became the first woman in space.{{sfn|Sharp|2013}}

In 1963, [[Betty Miller (pilot)|Betty Miller]] became the first woman to fly solo across the [[Pacific Ocean]]{{snf|Knox|2013}} and [[Anne Spoerry]], a French doctor living in [[Kenya]] became the first female member of the [[Amref Health Africa|African Medical and Research Foundation]]'s "Flying Doctors", operating her plane through the bush to provide needed medical assistance in remote areas.{{sfn|Deedes|2001}} In 1964, women again made history when [[Jerrie Mock|Geraldine Mock]] became the first woman to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe.{{sfn|Centennial of Women Pilots|2009}}

Because of the unpopularity of the [[Vietnam War]] in the United States, men were not volunteering at high enough rates; however, many women were being turned away because of limits on women's work in the military. In 1967, a law was passed allowing more women into the military and to be promoted to high ranks.{{sfn|McLean|2001}} In 1969, [[Kucki Low|Kucki von Gerlach]] obtained the first pilot's license issued to a woman in [[South West Africa]], now [[Namibia]].{{sfn|Southern African Women in Aviation and Aerospace|2012}} That same year, [[Turi Widerøe]] of [[Norway]] became the first female pilot for [[Scandinavian Airlines]].{{sfn|''Scandinavian Traveler''|2016}} Turi Widerøe had for years been a pilot for her fathers company [[Widerøe]], which today is the largest regional airline in the Scandinavian countries. Turi Widerøe is still today recgognized as the western worlds first woman commercial pilot for a major airlines after she joined Scandinavian Airlines in 1967.

===1970s===
[[File:UPT_Class_77-08.jpg|thumb|USAF Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training Class 77-08]]
Until the 1970s, aviation had been a traditionally male occupation in the United States. Commerce Department regulations virtually required pilots to have flown in the military to acquire sufficient flight hours, and until the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force and Navy barred women from flying{{sfn|Getline|2005}} and they were routinely denied work in commercial piloting.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=55}} The military did not open fighter jet flights to women until 1993.{{sfn|Skogen|2014|p=16}} Women eventually began to enter U.S. major commercial aviation in the 1970s and 1980s, with 1973 seeing the first female pilot at a major U.S. airline, [[American Airlines]]. American also promoted the first female captain of a major U.S. airline in 1986 and the following year had the first all-woman flight crew.{{sfn|Anderson|2002}} In other countries, women were starting to fly as pilots, such as [[Turi Widerøe]], who was hired in late 1968, for [[Scandinavian Airlines|Scandinavian Airlines System]] and [[Aeroflot]] had already hired women pilots.{{sfn|Charlton|1973}}

In the 1970s, women were again, for the first time since WWII, permitted to fly in the United States Armed Forces, beginning with the Navy and the Army in 1974, and then the Air Force in 1976.{{sfn|Ganson|2015}} By the mid-1970s, women were predicting that there would be a large increase in female pilots because of the [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] movement.{{sfn|''The Index-Journal''|1974|p=15}} [[Louise Sacchi]] was the first international woman ferry pilot who flew planes across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans over 340 times, more than any other non-airline pilot.{{sfn|The Ninety Nines|n.d.}} In 1971 she set a speed record by flying a single-engine land plane from New York to London in 17 hours and 10 minutes, a record that still stands today.{{sfn|The Ninety Nines|n.d.}}{{sfn|Parrack|2006}} Sacchi was the first woman to win the [[Godfrey L.

In 1975 [[Yola Cain]] became the first Jamaican-born commercial pilot and flight instructor.{{sfn|Smalling|1990|p=50}} The following year, Cain became the first female pilot with the [[Jamaica Defence Force]] and in the 1980s would become the first woman pilot for [[Air Jamaica Express|TransJamaica Ltd.]] Four years later, in 1979, Jamaican [[Maria Ziadie-Haddad]], became one of the first women in the Western Hemisphere to become a commercial jet airline pilot when she was hired as the first woman pilot of [[Air Jamaica]], as a [[Boeing 727]] second officer.{{sfn|''The Jamaica Observer''|2010}} Another Jamaican, [[Michele Yap]] became the first female airline captain in the Caribbean flying the [[Leeward Islands Air Transport]]'s [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|Twin Otter]] in 1988.

At the close of the century, legal efforts to eliminate barriers of race and sexism in the aviation sector resulted in industry modifications in hiring practices. In the United States, in the late 1970s the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] found violations of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which the court monitored over the next decades and decreed in 1995 had been sufficiently addressed.{{sfn|Hansen|Oster, Jr.|1997|pp=117–119}} In Africa, lack of a strong national carrier resulted in many tourism routes being overtaken by European airlines, but growth in the sector during the 1980s and 1990s saw that 26% of the market share on intercontinental flights were run by Africans.{{sfn|Otieno|2013}} In [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean, growth in the tourism sector through the 1990s, led to dramatic expansion of the civil aviation sector, with many countries seeing airport expansions.{{sfn|West|2001|pp=307, 401, 419, 526, 699}} In military services, women's roles increased during the period in North America, Europe and Asia.{{sfn|Becraft|1990}}

Today women's participation in the aviation sector is still low, but growing. As of 2010, just over 7% of certified civilian pilots (both private and commercial) in the United States were women.{{sfn|Federal Aviation Administration|2010}} As of July 2014, approximately 5.12% of certified airline or commercial pilots in the United States are women.{{sfn|Carsenat|Rossini|2014}} Canada has seen an increase to 18% of women in [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] jobs.{{sfn|Parker|2016|pp=24–27}} Overall, in 2008, there were only 16% of women working in the manufacturing of aircraft and spacecraft.{{sfn|Poole|2008}} Women who work as [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace engineers]] made up only 25% in the field in 2014.{{sfn|Marcus|2014}} Women make up less than 6% of senior executive level positions in airline companies, as of 2015.{{sfn|Centre for Aviation|2015}}

In Japan, the first female captain for commercial passenger flights was Ari Fuji, who began flying as captain for [[JAL Express]] in July 2010.{{sfn|Wang|2010}} In terms of tourism-driven growth in the aviation sector, throughout the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia-Pacific region]], there is a shortage of pilots, which is driving gender biases to be pushed aside for women to be hired. [[Vietnam Airlines]], a major carrier in one of fastest-growing aviation markets, has created flight-schedules that allow flexibility to deal with personal demands. [[EasyJet Plc]] provides scholarships for women pilots to help offset the high cost of training and [[EVA Air]] has actively recruited candidates from university programs.{{sfn|Boudreau|Nguyen|2016}}

In Africa, many of the trained pilots migrate to the [[Middle East]] or Asia where opportunities for career advancement and more sophisticated facilities exist. [[Women Aviators in Africa]] was founded in 2008 in an attempt to mentor and inspire young women to train in the aviation industry, as estimates for women in the field fall considerably below 6%. Though there is a high level of need across Africa for rural aviation, there is insufficient infrastructure to support expansion. Grass-roots efforts have seen success with training for bush pilots in transport, medical assistance and policing. Efforts are on-going to increase the numbers of women because women are less likely to move to other areas if they as able to find sufficient employment and opportunities in their own communities.{{sfn|Grant|2011}} As of 2016, seven of the top ten markets in terms of growth-speed of aviation were in Africa.{{sfn|Boudreau|Nguyen|2016}}

Women often had to work hard to prove themselves as capable as men in the field. [[Clare Boothe Luce|Clare Booth Luce]] wrote, "Because I am a woman, I must make unusual efforts to succeed. If I fail, no one will say, 'She doesn't have what it takes.' They will say, 'Women don't have what it takes.'"{{Sfn|Gibson|2013|p=2}} Pioneer aviator, [[Claude Grahame-White]] felt that women were "not 'temperamentally suited' to handle the controls of an airplane."{{Sfn|Crouch|2003|p=308}}

During the first National [[Women's Air Derby]] in 1929, women flying the race faced "threats of sabotage and headlines that read, 'Race Should Be Stopped.'"{{sfn|Gant|2001|pp=11–12}} Because flying was considered dangerous, many [[Aerospace manufacturer|aircraft manufacturers]] in the late 1920s hired women as sales representatives and flight demonstrators. "The reasoning was that if a woman could fly an airplane, it really could not be that difficult or dangerous."{{Sfn|Bednarek|Bednarek|2003|p=49}}{{Sfn|Crouch|2003|p=308–309}}

Despite women's participation in airplane aviation from the beginning, in 1986 a spokesperson for the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Airline Pilot's Association]] said that the reason there were only two women [[Boeing 747]] captains at the time was "because women in aviation are a relatively recent phenomenon and everything in the airlines industry is done by seniority".{{sfn|Dean|1986|pp=1–4}} This also ignores the fact that [[Helen Richey]] became the first woman to fly a commercial airliner in 1934. She quit that job in ten months because the all-male pilot's union would not admit her and she rarely got to fly.{{sfn|Holden|2001}}

There are some passengers who will not fly an airplane piloted by a woman. In 1991, a passenger on [[SN Brussels Airlines]] refused to fly on a plane piloted by Barbara Collinet.{{sfn|''La Libre''|2003}} In 2011, an [[IndiGo|IndiGo Airlines]] flight was delayed nearly 2 hours because a passenger "caused a ruckus over the fact that the plane's pilot was a woman".{{sfn|''The Huffington Post''|2011}} Biases toward women's traditional roles with men in the cockpit and women serving beverages and blankets have become ingrained, forcing women who want to fly to struggle with the attitudes of both co-workers and society.{{sfn|Boudreau|Nguyen|2016}} In 2016, seven passengers from an [[American Airlines]] flight en route from Miami to Buenos Aires disembarked when they learned that their crew was an all-woman crew.{{sfn|Lavalle|2016}}

'''Zoe Laskari''' ({{lang-el|Ζωή Λάσκαρη}}, {{IPA-el|zoˈɛː ˈlaskari|pron}}; 12 December 1942 – 18 August 2017) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] film and stage actress.

==Life==
Zoe Laskari was born Zoe Kouroukli in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], on 12 December 1942&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stoxos.gr/2017/08/blog-post_870.html|title=Zoe Laskari's parents' death|language=el|date=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; -- not 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topontiki.gr/article/234122/zoi-laskari-deite-spanies-photo-apo-lampero-parti-gia-ta-40a-genethlia-tis-star|title=A December 1983 article covering the celebration of her 40th birthday|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zoelaskari.gr/%ce%b2%ce%b9%ce%bf%ce%b3%cf%81%ce%b1%cf%86%ce%af%ce%b1|title=Βιογραφία|publisher=zoelaskari.gr||language=Greek|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finos Film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finosfilm.com/movies/artistView/552|title=Ζωή Λάσκαρη|publisher=finosfilm.com|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as had been misreported during her lifetime and after her death -- into a [[middle class]] family which had a long tradition of service to the [[Hellenic Army]]. Her father was murdered during the German occupation in late 1943&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and her mother in 1949 during the civil war, both by Communists.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; 

She was raised by her maternal grandparents. In 1959, she won the title of [[Star Hellas]] (Miss Greece) - in order to participate to the pageant she added two years to her age to be of age and went on to represent [[Greece]] at the [[Miss Universe]] pageant in [[Long Beach, California]] where she made it to the semifinals. However, while her being in the [[United States]], it was revealed that she was still legally a minor, having obscured her true age. She refused to return to Greece and stayed in [[New York City]] for about 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zoelaskari.gr/%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%AF%CE%B1|title=Βιογραφία - zoelaskari.gr|publisher=zoelaskari.gr|accessdate=16 September 2018|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==

==Career==
Due to her success at the beauty pageant, director [[Giannis Dalianidis]], offered her the starring role in ''O katiforos'', a 1961 film, whose success gave her a rapid popularity and she shortly signed an exclusive contract with the biggest Greek film production company at the time, [[Finos Film]].&lt;ref name="Finos Film"/&gt; The films in which she appeared ranged from dramas to comedies and [[Musical film|musicals]]. Some of her later movies were ''Stefania'' (1966) and ''[[Oi Thalassies oi Hadres]]'' (1967). Other Laskari film hits were ''Nomos 4000'', ''Merikoi to protimoun kryo'', ''Koritsia gia filima'', ''Dakrya gia tin Ilektra'', ''Mia kyria sta bouzoukia'' and ''Marihouana stop''.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0489598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her stage work included famous plays like [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'', the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]] ''[[The Trojan Women]]'' by [[Euripides]] and [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]''. Her theatrical hits include the play ''Oi erastes tou Oneirou'' which was also her first play in [[Athens]].
