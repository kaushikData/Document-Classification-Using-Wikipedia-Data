The '''8th G7 Summit''' was held in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], [[France]] between June 4 to 6, 1982.  The venue for the summit meetings was at the [[Palace of Versailles]].''&lt;ref name="j-mofa1"&gt;Japan, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] ([[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|MOFA]]): [http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2000/past_summit/table_e/index.html  Summit Meetings in the Past.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Group of Seven]] (G7) is an unofficial forum which brings together the heads of the richest industrialized countries: [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] (since 1976)&lt;ref name="saunders1"&gt;Saunders, Doug.

==Issues==
The summit was intended as a venue for resolving differences among its members. As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions.&lt;ref name="reinalda205"/&gt;

'''Actor–observer asymmetry''' (also '''[[#bias|actor–observer bias]]''') explains the errors that one makes when forming attributions about the behavior of others {{harv|Jones|Nisbett|1971}}. When people judge their own behavior, and they are the actor, they are more likely to attribute their actions to the particular situation than to a generalization about their personality. Yet when an observer is explaining the behavior of another person (the actor), they are more likely to attribute this behavior to the actors' overall disposition rather than to situational factors. This frequent error shows the bias that people hold in their evaluations of behavior {{harv|Miller|Norman|1975}}. Because people are better acquainted with the situational (external) factors affecting their own decisions, they are more likely to see their own behavior as affected by the social situation they are in. However, because the situational effects of anothers' behavior are less accessible to the observer, observers see the actor's behavior as influenced more by the actor's overall personality. The actor-observer asymmetry is a component of the [[ultimate attribution error]].
Sometimes the Actor–observer asymmetry is defined as the fundamental attribution error &lt;ref&gt;"Fundamental Attribution Error." The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science, edited by W. Edward Craighead, and Charles B. Nemeroff, Wiley, 3rd edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; which is when people tend to focus on the internal, personal characteristic or disposition as cause of a behavior rather than the external factors or situational influences.&lt;ref&gt;McCornack Steven and Joseph Ortiz. Choices and connections 2nd edition, Bedford, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The actor-observer asymmetry tends to happen in event where people express behavioral emotion, such a first meeting, a blind date, a shopping at a supermarket etc... (Jones &amp; Nisbett, 1972). From a study by Jhonson and Sheldon (1993) when asking people which object they have noticed when talking with another person, their common answers were based on their own thought and the other person appearance &lt;ref&gt;Forgas, Joseph P, and Kipling D. Williams. The Social Self: Cognitive, Interpersonal and Inter-group Perspectives. Hoboken: Taylor and Francis, 2014. Internet resource.&lt;/ref&gt;

This term falls under "[[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]" or "[[attribution theory]]". The specific hypothesis of an actor-observer asymmetry in attribution (explanations of behavior) was originally proposed by [[Edward E. Jones|Jones]] and [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] (1971), when they claimed that "actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor” {{harv|Jones|Nisbett|1971|p=93}}. Supported by initial evidence, the hypothesis was long held as firmly established, describing a robust and pervasive phenomenon of [[social cognition]].

However, a [[meta-analysis]] of all the published tests of the hypothesis between 1971 and 2004 {{harv|Malle|2006}} yielded a contradictory finding: there was no actor-observer asymmetry of the sort {{harvtxt|Jones|Nisbett|1971}} had proposed. {{harvtxt|Malle|2006}} interpreted this result not so much as proof that actors and observers explained behavior exactly the same way but as evidence that the original hypothesis was fundamentally flawed in the way it framed people's explanations of behavior—namely, as attributions to either stable dispositions or to the situation. Against the background of a different theory of explanation, {{harvtxt|Malle et al.|2007}} tested an alternative set of three actor-observer asymmetries and found consistent support for all of them. Thus, the actor-observer asymmetry does not exist in one theoretical formulation (traditional attribution theory) but does exist in the new alternative theoretical formulation. {{harvtxt|Malle|2011}} argues that this favors the alternative theoretical formulation, but current textbooks have not yet fully addressed this theoretical challenge.{{as of?|date=June 2016}}

Considerations of actor-observer differences can be found in other disciplines as well, such as philosophy (e.g. [[privileged access]], [[incorrigibility]]), management studies, artificial intelligence, semiotics, anthropology, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Malle et al.|2007}} for relevant references.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and initial formulation==
The background of this hypothesis was in the 1960s, with social psychology's increasing interest in the [[cognition|cognitive]] mechanisms by which people make sense of their own and other people's behavior. This interest was instigated by [[Fritz Heider|Fritz Heider's]] (1958) book, ''[[#CITEREFHeider1958|The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations]]'', and the research in its wake has become known as "[[attribution (psychology)|attribution]] research" or "[[attribution theory]]."

The specific hypothesis of an "actor–observer asymmetry" was first proposed by [[social psychology|social psychologists]] [[Edward E. Jones|Jones]] and [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] in 1971. Jones and Nisbett hypothesized that these two roles (actors and observers) produce asymmetric explanations.{{sfn|Jones|Nisbett|1971|p=80}} Their research findings showed that “there is pervasive tendency for actors to attribute their actions to situational requirements, whereas observers tend to attribute the same actions to stable personal dispositions”.{{sfn|Jones|Nisbett|1971|p=80}} For example, a student who studies hard for an exam is likely to explain her own (the actor's) intensive studying by referring to the upcoming difficult exam (a situational factor), whereas other people (the observers) are likely to explain her studying by referring to her dispositions, such as being hardworking or ambitious.

==Early evidence and reception==
Soon after the publication of the actor-observer hypothesis, numerous research studies tested its validity, most notably the first such test by {{harvtxt|Nisbett et al.|1973}}. The authors found initial evidence for the hypothesis, and so did {{harvtxt|Storms|1973}}, who also examined one possible explanation of the hypothesis: that actors explain their behaviors by reference to the situation because they attend to the situation (not to their own behaviors) whereas observers explain the actor's behavior by reference to the actor's dispositions because they attend to the actor's behavior (not to the situation). Based largely on this initial supporting evidence, the confidence in the hypothesis became uniformly high.

==Recent evidence==
Over 100 studies have been published since 1971 in which the hypothesis was put to further tests (often in the context of testing another hypothesis about causal attributions). {{harvtxt|Malle|2006}} examined this entire literature in a [[meta-analysis]], which is a robust way of identifying consistent patterns of evidence regarding a given hypothesis across a broad set of studies. The result of this analysis was stunning: across 170 individual tests, the asymmetry practically did not exist. (The average effect sizes, computed in several accepted ways, ranged from d = -0.016 to d = 0.095; corrected for [[publication bias]], the average effect size was 0.) Under circumscribed conditions(i.e. if the actor was portrayed as highly idiosyncratic, or in negative events), it could sometimes be found, but under other conditions, the opposite was found. The conclusion was that the widely held assumption of an actor-observer asymmetry in attribution was false.{{sfn|Malle|2006|p=895}}

In contrast to the {{harvtxt|Malle|2006}} article, other research has shown a strong presence of the actor-observer asymmetry even in instances with familiar people. {{harvtxt|Krueger et al.|1996}} conducted a study on pairs of university dorm roommates who liked and knew one another well. The researchers aimed for familiar pairs of participants was to discover whether or not actor-observer asymmetry existed in conditions that might atypically work against it. Previous literature suggests that actor-observer asymmetry would not be present in situations where the actors and the observers were familiar with each other, which is why Krueger and colleagues wanted to perform the study with familiar pairs. Each participant answered three questionnaires where the final scores were weighed against each other in order to understand the presence of actor-observer asymmetry. The results showed that gender did not affect the findings, so whether or not the pairs were the same or opposite sex was not a mediator for the data. The researchers found that actors were aware of the actor-observer asymmetry, but the observers were not, which is typically what happens in everyday life. Krueger and colleagues showed another side to the actor-observer asymmetry, wherein it is present even among familiar people.

Even more recent evidence was published on the social acceptability of actions and the speed with which an observer's perception of an actor's moral character are determined and affected by actor-observer asymmetry.  {{harvtxt|Critcher et al.|2012}} conducted two experiments in order to support the idea that an immoral action is quickly followed by a negative evaluation of the actor's moral character by the observer.  On the other hand, a morally good decision by an actor is readily given a positive evaluation of that actor's moral character.  This is due to the fact that actions are observed as having been made with a degree of certainty and intentionality on the part of the actor, and more distinct motives are the underlying cause of these actions, thus creating more contrasted evaluations of the actor by the observer.

==Theoretical reformulation==
The result of the meta-analysis implied that, across the board, actors and observers explain behaviors the same way. But all the tests of the classic hypothesis presupposed that people explain behavior by referring to "dispositional" vs. "situational" causes. This assumption turned out to be incorrect for the class of behavioral events that people explain most frequently in real life {{harv|Malle|Knobe|1997}}: intentional behaviors (e.g., buying a new car, making a mean comment). People explain unintentional behaviors in ways that the traditional disposition-situation framework can capture, but they explain intentional behaviors by using very different concepts (Buss, 1978; {{harvnb|Heider|1958}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=Allan|title=Causes and reasons in attribution theory: A conceptual critique|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1978|volume=36|issue=11|pages=1311–1321|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.11.1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent empirical theory of how people explain behavior was proposed and tested by {{harvs|last1=Malle|year1=1999|year2=2004 |txt }}, centering on the postulate that intentional behaviors are typically explained by reasons—the mental states (typically beliefs and desires) in light of which and on the grounds of which the agent decided to act (a postulate long discussed in the [[philosophy of action]]). But people who explain intentional behavior have several choices to make, and the theory identifies the psychological antecedents and consequences of these choices:

{{ordered list|type=lower-latin
  | giving either reason explanations or "causal history of reason (CHR) explanations" (which refer to background factors such as culture, personality, or context—causal factors that brought about the agent's reasons but were not themselves reasons to act);
  | giving either desire reasons or belief reasons;
  | linguistically marking a belief reason with its mental state verb (e.g., "She thought that..."; "He assumes that...").
}}

Empirical studies have so far supported this theoretical framework.&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see {{harvnb|Malle|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this framework, the actor-observer asymmetry was then reformulated as in fact consisting of three asymmetries: that actors offer more reason explanations (relative to CHR explanations) than observers do; that actors offer more belief reasons (relative to desire reasons) than observers do; and that actors use fewer belief reason markers than observers do {{harv|Malle|1999}}. {{harvtxt|Malle et al.|2007}} tested these asymmetries across 9 studies and found consistent support for them. In the same studies they also tested the classic person/disposition vs. situation hypothesis and consistently found no support for it.

Thus, people do seem to explain their own actions differently from how they explain other people's actions. But these differences do not lie in a predominance of using "dispositional" vs. "situational" causes. Only when people's explanations are separated into theoretically meaningful distinctions (e.g., reasons vs. causal history of reason explanations) do the differences emerge.

In addition, an alternative theory has been proposed called the folk-conceptual theory.{{sfn|Kiesler|Lee|Kramer|2006}}{{sfn|Malle|2011}} In contrast to the actor-observer asymmetry, it posits that people's explanations of behavior varies based on three key parameters (these parameters being: use of reason explanations vs. causal history explanations, use of belief reasons vs. desire reasons, and the use of mental state markers).

===Implications===
The choices of different explanations for intentional behavior (reasons, belief reasons, etc.) indicate particular psychological functions. Reasons, for example, appear to reflect (among other things) psychological closeness. People increase reason explanations (relative to CHR explanations) when they explain their own rather than another person's behavior {{harv|Malle et al.|2007}}, when they portray another person in a positive light {{harv|Malle et al.|2007}}, and when they explain behaviors of nonhuman agents for whom they have ownership and affection (e.g., a pet fish; {{harvnb|Kiesler|Lee|Kramer|2006}}). Conversely, people use fewer reasons and more CHR explanations when explaining behaviors of collectives or aggregate groups {{harv|O'Laughlin|Malle|2002}}. Actor-observer asymmetries can therefore be seen as part of a broader continuum of psychological distance people have to various kinds of minds (their own, others', groups', animals' etc.).

==Cultural differences==
Cultural differences may impact how certain behaviors or actions are attributed and interpreted. Current research supports the idea that Western culture emphasizes individualism, whereas East Asian cultures emphasize collectivism.The fundamental attribution error differs in those cultures. In the [[Individualistic]] cultures people tend to favor dispositional explanations for behavior. Whereas, in the [[collectivist]] cultures where P. B. Smith and Bond (1994) implied that the fundamental attribution error is minimal or even absent, so they tend to focus on situational explanation for behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Krull Douglas S., Michelle Hui-Min Loy, Jennifer Lin, Ching-Fu Wang, Suhong Chen, and Xudong Zhao Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin Vol 25, Issue 10, pp. 1208 - 1219 October 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;]] . {{harvtxt|Masuda|Nisbett|2001}} found when viewing an underwater scene Americans focused more on fish in the foreground and the direction they were swimming within the tank than the background of the environment. This supports the idea that Americans are more like to attribute behavior to dispositional cue that are directly present in the environment or foreground. This is opposed to Japanese participants who focused on the fish, but additionally focused on the background of the environment (plants, other animals). This shows how people from East Asian cultures are more likely to attribute behavior to both dispositional and situational cues in the environment. In addition, {{harvtxt|Choi|Nisbett|2008}} found that when situational constraints of participants in an experiment were made more salient that only the East Asian participants had an increased perception of the situational constraints and made their judgments accordingly. This is opposed to North American participants who showed little to no change in perception of the situational constraints as they were made more salient. Additionally, it has differed in religious perspective. Protestant are most likely to focus on internal factor whether than external for behavior. Unlike the Catholic who would tend to focus on the external factor. The cause is that Protestant rely too much on correlational evidence without evidence of causality (MacKinnon, 2008). It is also cause by the fact that Protestant have stronger faith and are more aware of the soul's condition than Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Li Y, Johnson K, Cohen A, Williams M, Knowles E, Chen Z. Fundamental(ist) attribution error: Protestants are dispositionally focused. Journal Of Personality And Social Psychology. February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Related but distinct concepts==

===&lt;span id="bias"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Actor-observer "bias"===
Instead of speaking of a hypothesis of an actor-observer asymmetry, some textbooks and research articles speak of an "actor-observer bias." The term "[[bias]]" is typically used to imply that one of the explainers (either the actor or the observer) is biased or incorrect in their explanations. But which one—the actor or the observer—is supposed to be incorrect is not clear from the literature. On the one hand, [[Lee Ross|Ross's]] (1977) hypothesis of a "[[fundamental attribution error]]" suggests that observers are incorrect, because they show a general tendency to overemphasize dispositional explanations and underemphasize situational ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Lee|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1977|volume=10|pages=173–220|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60357-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Nisbett and Wilson (1977) argued that actors don't really know the true causes of their actions (the so-called "[[introspection illusion]]") and often merely invent plausible explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1977 |title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes |journal= Psychological Review |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=231–259 |ref=harv |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.231|last1=Nisbett |first1=Richard E. |last2=Wilson |first2=Timothy D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Jones|Nisbett|1971}} themselves did not commit to calling the hypothesized actor-observer asymmetry a bias or an error. Similarly, recent theoretical positions consider asymmetries not a bias, but rather the result of multiple cognitive and motivational differences that fundamentally exist between actors and observers.{{sfn|Malle et al.|2007|p=508}}{{sfn|Robins et al.|1996|p=387}}

===Self-serving bias===
The actor-observer asymmetry is often confused with the hypothesis of a [[self-serving bias]] in attribution — the claim that people choose explanations in a strategic way so as to make themselves appear in a more positive light. The important difference between the two hypotheses is that the assumed actor-observer asymmetry is expected to hold for all events and behaviors (whether they are positive or negative) and require a specific comparison between actor explanations and observer explanations. The self-serving bias is often formulated as a complete reversal in actors' and observers' explanation tendencies as a function of positive vs. negative events.{{sfn|Malle|2006|p=896}} In traditional attribution terms, this means that for positive events (e.g., getting an A on an exam), actors will select explanations that refer to their own dispositions, (e.g., "I am smart") whereas observers will select explanations that refer to the actor's situation (e.g., "The test was easy"); however, for negative events (e.g., receiving an F on the exam), actors will select explanations that refer to the situation, (e.g., "The test was impossibly hard") whereas observers will select explanations that refer to the actor's dispositions (e.g., "She is not smart enough").

===Positivity bias===
The actor-observer asymmetry can seem similar to the hypothesis of a positivity bias in attribution- the claim that people are biased toward favorable evaluations. This hypothesis states that people will attribute their behavior with positive consequences to internal factors and their behavior with negative consequences to external factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Pligt|first1=Joop|title=Actors' and Observers' attributions, self-serving bias and positivity bias|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1983|volume=13|issue=1|pages=95–104|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420130107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positivity bias is described in terms of the actors attributions of their own behavior. This means that people will attribute their behavior which received a positive consequence (passes their driving test and receiving their drivers license) to an internal factor (I really know the material). However, people will attribute their behavior in which they received a negative consequence (failing a driving test) to an external factor (the sun was in my eyes).

===Correspondence bias===
Observers attribute actions of others to their future behavior. Witnessing one's actions brings the witness to attribute those same actions to that person's future behavior. This explains why first impressions are so important to us. Once an action is seen, it is hard for the observer to imagine any other differing behaviors from the actor. However, on the other hand, it is hard for actors to attribute one action they have made to their whole behavior. They view themselves as more responsive, and therefore believe themselves to be in control of all situational matters. As the actor can attribute every action in the past he/she has done, the observer can only attribute the one action that is witnessed to that actor. Therefore, will attribute dispositional, rather than situational means to the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Daniel|last2=Malone|first2=Patrick|title=The correspondence bias|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1995|volume=117|issue=1|pages=21–38|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.21|pmid=7870861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BBC Genome Project''' is a digitised, searchable database of programme listings initially based upon the contents of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' from the first issue in 1923, to 2009.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About this project|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/about|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV listings post 2009 can be accessed via [https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl6p/2010/01/01 BBC Programmes site]

==History==
===Prior===
BBC Genome is not the BBC's first online searchable database; in April 2006 the BBC gave the public access to Infax, the BBC's programme database at the time. Infax contained around 900,000 entries, but not every programme ever broadcast, and it ceased operation in December 2007.&lt;ref name="About Infax"&gt;{{cite web|title=About This Prototype|url=http://open.bbc.co.uk/cataloguemeta/2005/11/about_this_prototype.html|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613100552/http://open.bbc.co.uk/cataloguemeta/2005/11/about_this_prototype.html|archivedate=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front page of the website is still available to see via the [[Internet Archive]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060512054648/http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax here.] After Infax ceased, a message on the website said that it would be incorporating in the information into individual programme pages.&lt;ref name="Prototype End"&gt;{{cite web|title=This experimental prototype trial has now concluded|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/catalogue_offline.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it was replaced by the database Fabric but this is only for internal use within the BBC.

==''Radio Times''== 
[[File:BBC Genome OCR error.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of an OCR error (since corrected) in Genome. The text, "Uza TarbuclC's Christmas", should read "[[Liza Tarbuck]]'s Christmas".]]
In December 2012, the [[BBC]] completed a digitisation exercise, scanning the listings from [[Radio Times]] of all BBC programmes 1923-2009 from an entire run of about 4,500 copies of the magazine.&lt;ref name="Kelion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20625884|title=BBC finishes Radio Times archive digitisation effort|last=Kelion|first=Leo|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified around five million programmes, involving 8.5 million actors, presenters, writers and technical staff.&lt;ref name="Kelion" /&gt; The listings are as published, in advance, and so do not include late changes or cancellations which were reflected on Infax. However, they do include huge numbers of early radio and television broadcasts, and "DJ shows" from [[BBC Radio 1]] and [[BBC Radio 2]] which were rarely kept officially, which were not listed on Infax (which also did not usually include repeats of archived programmes prior to 1976) because they were not in the BBC archives.

The issues were scanned at high resolution, producing [[TIF]] images and [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) was then used to turn the text from the page into searchable text on the Genome database.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;

BBC Genome was released for public use on 15 October 2014.&lt;ref name="Hilbish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/posts/Genome-The-Radio-Times-Archive-is-now-live|title=Genome – Radio Times archive now live|last=Bishop|first=Hilary|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|title=BBC digitises Radio Times back issues|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/16/bbc-digitises-radio-times-back-issues-genome-project|newspaper=Guardian|date=16 October 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of this project is to allow researchers to be able to find out information easier and to help [[BBC Archives]] to build up a picture of what exists and what is currently missing from the archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC's Genome Project offers radio and TV archive listings|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29643662|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweney|first1=Mark|title=BBC digitises Radio Times back issues|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/16/bbc-digitises-radio-times-back-issues-genome-project|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrections to OCR errors and changes to advertised schedules are being [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]],&lt;ref name="Hilbish" /&gt; with over 285,000 user generated edits accepted after editorial review as of mid-December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1964-04-20|title=BBC One London - 20 April 1964 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
name="FAQs-what"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs - BBC Genome|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/faqs#what|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 September 2017 |quote=Once you edit an entry your suggestion will be validated, and if accepted, Genome will be changed. If your suggestion does not match the magazine, we will include your edit in the additional data we are gathering for use at a later date.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each listing entry has a unique identifier which may be expressed as a URL. For example, the very first screening of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' is &lt;tt&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/8f81c193ba224e84981f353cae480d49&lt;/tt&gt;. A broadcast programme may have more than one such identifier, if it was broadcast (and thus listed) on repeat occasions, or in different regions.

The '''Blue Guides''' are a series of detailed and authoritative [[Guide book|travel guidebooks]] focused on [[art]], [[architecture]], and (where relevant) [[archaeology]] along with the history and context necessary to understand them. A modicum of practical travel information, with recommended restaurants and hotels, is also generally included.

The first Blue Guide – ''London and its Environs''  – was published in 1918 by the Scottish brothers [[James Fullarton Muirhead|James]] and [[Findlay Muirhead]].  The Muirheads had for many years been the English-language editors of the famous German ''[[Baedeker Guides|Baedeker]]'' series. When they also acquired the rights to [[John Murray III]]’s famous travel “[[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers|handbooks]]” they established the Blue Guides as heir to the great 19th century guide book tradition.

==History==
===Precursors===
In 1828, [[Karl Baedeker]] (1801–59) published his first guidebook, ''Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln'' and in 1836 John Murray III’s (1808–92) first ''Handbook'' was released (''Handbook for Travellers on the Continent''). The first ''Baedeker'' in English, ''The Rhine'' (1861), was published jointly by Baedeker and Murray. These handbooks were to become the standard for English travellers for the remainder of the 19th Century.

[[James Fullarton Muirhead|James Muirhead]] (1853–1934) began working for Baedeker in 1878, preparing a ''Handbook for Travellers to London''. Findlay Muirhead (1860–1935), graduate of the [[University of Edinburgh]], left his studies at [[Leipzig]] in 1887 to join his brother at Baedeker. For almost the next 30 years the brothers were responsible for all English language ''Baedekers'', including compiling guides to Britain, the US and Canada. Following the outbreak of [[World War I]], the Muirhead brothers found themselves out of a job. They acquired the rights to Murray’s ''Handbooks'' in 1915 from the cartographical publisher [[Edward Stanford]], who had bought them 14 years earlier from [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray IV]]. In the same year they established their company, [[Muirhead’s Guide-books Limited]].

===The Blue Guides and the ''Guides Bleu''===
{{main|Guide Bleu}}

A 1917 agreement with French publisher [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] allowed co-publication in English and French of guidebooks under the names ''Blue Guides'' and ''Guides Bleus'', respectively. Hachette’s existing ''Guides Joannes'' had blue covers, while ''Baedeker''’s guides had red covers. The first Blue Guide, ''Blue Guide London and its Environs'', was published in 1918. Two years later, Hachette published ''Guide Bleu Londres et ses Environs''.  The Hachette relationship with the Blue Guides ended in 1933.

===1931-82===
The Blue Guides were acquired by [[Ernest Benn Limited]] in 1931. (Litellus) [[Russell Muirhead]] (1896-1976), Findlay’s son, became the series editor in 1934. He retired in 1963, remaining a consulting editor until 1965 when the Muirhead family’s connection with the series ended.

In 1963, [[Stuart Rossiter]] (1923-82) was appointed editor and in 1967 the first of Rossiter’s “scrupulously edited guides, compiled for the independent educated traveller wanting to avoid the monotony of international uniformity” (''Blue Guide Greece'') was compiled by Rossiter himself and published. ''Blue Guide Rome and Environs'', by [[Alta Macadam]], was released in 1971. Her Italy titles thereafter become some of the best selling Blue Guides and included ''Sicily'' (1975), ''Northern Italy'' (1978), ''Florence'' (1982), ''Venice'' (1980), ''Tuscany'' (1993), and ''Umbria'' (1993), all frequently updated and re-issued. Other key Blue Guide authors are and have been [[Ian Robertson (writer)|Ian Robertson]] (''Spain'', ''Portugal'', ''Ireland'', ''Austria'', ''Switzerland'', ''Cyprus'', ''France'', &amp; ''Paris and Versailles''), [[John Tomes (writer)|John Tomes]] (''Scotland'', ''Wales''), [[Ian Ousby]] (''England''), [[Paul Blanchard (Travel Guide Writer)|Paul Blanchard]] (''Italy'').

===1982 to present===
In 1982, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W.W. Norton]] of New York became the United States co-publisher, selling all Blue Guides in that country. Two years later, the Blue Guides were acquired by [[A&amp;C Black]] (Publishers) Limited, themselves later acquired by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] Plc, publishers of the [[Harry Potter]] books among others. In 2004, [[Somerset Books]], a small, London-based, family-owned travel publisher known for its ''Visible Cities'' guides, acquired the Blue Guides.  A year later published its first original title, ''Blue Guide Northern Italy''.

'''Colossus''' was a set of [[computer]]s developed by British [[cryptanalysis|codebreakers]] in the years 1943–1945 to help in the [[cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]]. Colossus used [[vacuum tube|thermionic valves (vacuum tubes)]] to perform [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean]] and counting operations. Colossus is thus regarded{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, ''Introduction'' p. 2}} as the world's first [[computer programming|programmable]], [[electronics|electronic]], [[digital electronics|digital]] computer, although it was programmed by switches and plugs and not by a [[stored-program computer|stored program]].{{sfn|Sale|2000}}

Colossus was designed by research telephone engineer [[Tommy Flowers]] to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) at [[Bletchley Park]]. [[Alan Turing]]'s use of probability in cryptanalysis (see [[Banburismus]]) contributed to its design. It has sometimes been erroneously stated that Turing designed Colossus to aid the [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Golden | first = Frederic | title = Who Built The First Computer? |magazine=Time Magazine | volume = 153 | issue = 12 | date = 29 March 1999 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990596,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's machine that helped decode [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] was the electromechanical [[Bombe]], not Colossus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Copeland | first = Jack | author-link = Jack Copeland | title = Colossus: The first large scale electronic computer | url = http://www.colossus-computer.com/colossus1.html#sdfootnote96sym|website=Colossus-computer.com|accessdate = 21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype, '''Colossus Mark 1''', was shown to be working in December 1943 and was in use at Bletchley Park by early 1944. An improved '''Colossus Mark 2''' that used [[shift register]]s to quintuple the processing speed, first worked on 1 June 1944, just in time for the [[Normandy landings]] on D-Day.{{sfn|Flowers|1983|p=246}} Ten Colossi were in use by the end of the war and an eleventh was being commissioned.{{sfn|Flowers|1983|p=246}} Bletchley Park's use of these machines allowed the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to obtain a vast amount of high-level [[military intelligence]] from intercepted [[wireless telegraphy|radiotelegraphy]] messages between the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] (''OKW'') and their [[Wehrmacht|army]] commands throughout occupied Europe.

The existence of the Colossus machines was kept secret until the mid-1970s, although some of its personnel and secret information undoubtedly fueled further development in the U.S. in the late 1940s; the machines and the plans for building them had previously been destroyed in the 1960s as part of the effort to maintain the secrecy of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRprCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59&amp;dq=Bletchley+destroyed+Colossus+machines+and+plans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtu67YkvDVAhXnzIMKHQd3BUUQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bletchley+destroyed+Colossus+machines+and+plans&amp;f=false|title=Who Broke the Wartime Codes?|first=Nicola|last=Barber|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Capstone|accessdate=26 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aslrCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417&amp;dq=Tommy+Flowers+destroyed+Colossus+machines+and+plans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBv4O4k_DVAhUJ3IMKHebLA-QQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Tommy+Flowers+destroyed+Colossus+machines+and+plans&amp;f=false|title=Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2000: International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptographic Techniques Bruges, Belgium, May 14-18, 2000 Proceedings|first=Bart|last=Preneel|date=26 June 2003|publisher=Springer|accessdate=26 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deprived most of those involved with Colossus of the credit for pioneering electronic digital computing during their lifetimes.

The Colossus computers were used to help decipher intercepted radio [[teleprinter]] messages that had been [[encryption|encrypted]] using an unknown device. Intelligence information revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems ''"Sägefisch"'' (sawfish). This led the British to call encrypted German teleprinter traffic "[[Fish (cryptography)|Fish]]",{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11A Fish Machines, (c) The German Ciphered Teleprinter, p. 4}} and the unknown machine and its intercepted messages "[[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]]" (tunafish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1MC2d2LPAcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Codebreakers+:+the+inside+story+of+Bletchley+Park,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Introduction+to+fish&amp;f=false|title=Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park|first1=F. H.|last1=Hinsley|first2=Alan|last2=Stripp|date=26 October 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=26 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Germans increased the security of their operating procedures, British cryptanalysts [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#Diagnosis|diagnosed]] how the unseen machine functioned and built an imitation of it called "[[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#British Tunny|British Tunny]]".

It was deduced that the machine had twelve wheels and used a [[Vernam cipher]]ing technique on message characters in the standard 5-bit [[ITA2]] telegraph code. It did this by combining the [[plaintext]] characters with a stream of [[Key (cryptography)|key]] characters using the [[XOR]] [[Boolean function]] to produce the [[ciphertext]].

In August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings. These were intercepted and worked on at Bletchley Park. First, [[John Tiltman]], a very talented GC&amp;CS cryptanalyst, derived a [[key stream]] of almost 4000 characters.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Budianski, Stephen ''Colossus, Codebreaking and the Digital Age'' pp. 55–56}} Then [[Bill Tutte]], a newly arrived member of the Research Section, used this key stream to work out the logical structure of the Lorenz machine. He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the χ (''[[chi (letter)|chi]]'') and ψ (''[[psi (letter)|psi]]'') wheels, the remaining two he called μ (''[[Mu (letter)|mu]]'') or "motor" wheels. The ''chi'' wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the ''psi'' wheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Tutte, William T. ''My Work at Bletchley Park'' p. 357}}

With a sufficiently random key stream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an uneven [[frequency distribution]] of the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext. The Tunny machine did this well. However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system. This was achieved by [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#Differencing|"differencing"]] in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11C Wheel Patterns, (b) Differenced and Undifferenced Wheels, p. 11}} After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was the [[electromechanical]] [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ]] (''Schlüsselzusatzgerät'', cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11A Fish Machines, (c) The German Ciphered Teleprinter, p. 4}}

[[File:Lorenz SZ40 cipher machine (TUNNY) - National Cryptologic Museum - DSC07883.JPG|right|upright=1.35|thumbnail|A Lorenz SZ40 machine on display at the National Cryptologic Museum, Fort Meade, Maryland, USA.]]

In order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed. The first was "wheel breaking", which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels. These patterns were set up on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages. Each transmission, which often contained more than one message, was enciphered with a different start position of the wheels. Alan Turing invented a method of wheel-breaking that became known as [[Turingery]].{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, ''Turingery'' pp. 378–385}} Turing's technique was further developed into "Rectangling", for which Colossus could produce tables for manual analysis. Colossi 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 had a "gadget" to aid this process.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 24 – Rectangling: 24B Making and Entering Rectangles pp. 114–115, 119–120}}

The second task was [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#Steps in Wheel Setting|"wheel setting"]], which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message, and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11E The Tunny Network, (b) Wheel-breaking and Setting, p. 15}} It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed. To discover the start position of the ''chi'' wheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions. The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the key stream, which was generated internally, in a  simulation of the unknown German machine. After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likely ''chi''-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in processed ciphertext.{{sfn|Small|1944|p=15}} Colossus produced these frequency counts.

By using differencing and knowing that the ''psi'' wheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of the ''chi''-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random. This became known as [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#The "1+2 break in"|Tutte's "1+2 break in"]].{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Budiansky, Stephen, ''Colossus, Codebreaking, and the Digital Age'' pp. 58–59}} It involved calculating the following Boolean function:
::::&lt;big&gt;∆Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ∆Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ∆&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ∆&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = '''•'''&lt;/big&gt;
and counting the number of times it yielded "false" (zero). If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the "set total", it was printed out. The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the ''chi''-1 and ''chi''-2 wheels.{{sfn|Carter|2008|pp=18–19}}

This technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all five ''chi'' wheels. From this, the de-''chi'' (D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which the ''psi'' component could be removed by manual methods.{{sfn|Small|1944|p=65}} If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-''chi'' version of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, "wheel setting" of the ''chi'' wheels was considered to have been achieved,{{sfn|Small|1944|p=15}} and the message settings and de-''chi'' were passed to the "[[Testery]]". This was the section at Bletchley Park led by Major [[Ralph Tester]] where the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|loc=34 minutes in}}

Colossus could also derive the start position of the ''psi'' and motor wheels, but this was not much done until the last few months of the war, when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.

==Design and construction==
Colossus was developed for the "[[Newmanry]]",{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 3 Organisation: 31 Mr Newman's section, p. 276}} the section headed by the mathematician [[Max Newman]] that was responsible for machine methods against the twelve-rotor [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ40/42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine]] (code named Tunny, for tunafish). The Colossus design arose out of a prior project that produced a counting machine dubbed "[[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]". Although it proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process, it was initially unreliable. The electro-mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to synchronise two looped [[punched tape|paper tapes]], one containing the enciphered message, and the other representing part of the key stream of the Lorenz machine,{{sfn|Anderson|2007|p=8}} also the tapes tended to stretch when being read at up to 2000 characters per second.

Tommy Flowers [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]&lt;ref&gt;Flowers had been appointed MBE in June 1943&lt;/ref&gt; was a senior electrical engineer and Head of the Switching Group at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]]. Prior to his work on Colossus, he had been involved with GC&amp;CS at Bletchley Park from February 1941 in an attempt to improve the [[Bombe]]s that were used in the cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine.{{sfn|Randell|1980|p=9}} He was recommended to Max Newman by Alan Turing, who had been impressed by his work on the Bombes.{{sfn|Budiansky|2000|p=314}} The main components of the Heath Robinson machine were as follows.
* A tape transport and reading mechanism that ran the looped key and message tapes at between 1000 and 2000 characters per second.
* A combining unit that implemented the logic of [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#Tutte's "1+2 break in"|Tutte's method]].
* A counting unit that had been designed by [[C. E. Wynn-Williams]] of the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE) at Malvern, which counted the number of times the logical function returned a specified [[truth value]].

Flowers had been brought in to design the Heath Robinson's combining unit.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 15 Some Historical Notes, 15A First Stages in Machine Development, (c) Heath Robinson, p. 33}} He was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc= Flowers, Thomas H. ''Colossus'' p. 96}} He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves ([[vacuum tube]]s and [[thyratron]]s) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism,{{sfn|Flowers|1983|p=244}} so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill. Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, ''Machine against Machine'' p. 72}} Additionally, the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage to reduce the thermal stress. The valves themselves were soldered in to avoid problems with plug-in bases, which could be unreliable.{{citation needed|reason=There is no mention of these newly added points in Copeland (2006)|date=January 2018}} Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, ''Machine against Machine'' p. 74}} Flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc= Flowers, Thomas H.

During the development of the prototype, an improved design had been developed – the Mark 2 Colossus. Four of these were ordered in March 1944 and by the end of April the number on order had been increased to twelve. Dollis Hill was put under pressure to have the first of these working by 1 June.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 15 – Some Historical Notes, 15C Period of Expansion, (b) Colossus, p. 35}} The first Mark 2 Colossus, containing 2400 valves, became operational at 08:00 on 1 June 1944 after which [[Allen Coombs]] took over leadership of Colossus production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Randell | first = Brian | author-link = Brian Randell | last2 = Fensom | first2 = Harry | last3 = Milne | first3 = Frank A. | title = Obituary: Allen Coombs | newspaper = The Independent | date = 15 March 1995 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-allen-coombs-1611270.html | accessdate = 18 October 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Colossi were delivered at the rate of about  one a month.

[[File:Wartime photo of Colossus 10.png|right|thumbnail|upright=2.25|Colossus 10 with its extended bedstead in Block H at [[Bletchley Park]] in the space now containing the Tunny galley of [[The National Museum of Computing]] ]]
The main units of the Mark 2 design were as follows.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc= Flowers, Thomas H. ''Colossus'' p. 96}}{{sfn|Flowers|1983|pp=249–252}}
* A tape transport with an 8-photocell reading mechanism.
* Five 6-bit [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] [[shift register]]s.
* Twelve thyratron ring stores that simulated the Lorenz machine generating a bit-stream for each wheel.
* Panels of switches for specifying the program and the "set total".
* A set of function units that performed [[Boolean algebra|Boolean]] operations.
* A "span counter" that could suspend counting for part of the tape.
* A master control that handled clocking, start and stop signals, counter readout and printing.
* Five electronic counters.
* An electric typewriter.

Most of the design of the electronics was the work of Tommy Flowers, assisted by William Chandler, Sidney Broadhurst and Allen Coombs; with Erie Speight and [[Arnold Lynch]] developing the photoelectric reading mechanism.{{sfn|Flowers|1983|pp=243, 245}} Coombs remembered Flowers, having produced a rough draft of his design, tearing it into pieces that he handed out to his colleagues for them to do the detailed design and get their team to manufacture it.{{sfn|Coombs|1983}} The Mark 2 Colossi were both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than the prototype.&lt;ref&gt;For comparison, later [[stored-program computer]]s such as the [[Manchester Mark 1]] of 1949 used 4050 valves,{{citation | last = Lavington | first = S. H. | title = The Manchester Mark 1 and Atlas: a Historical Perspective | journal= Communications of the ACM – Special issue on computer architecture|volume=21|issue=1| url=http://www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/cda5106/summer03/papers/mark1.atlas.1.pdf | date = July 1977 | accessdate = 8 February 2009 |doi=10.1145/359327.359331|pages=4–12}} while [[ENIAC]] (1946) used 17,468 valves.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design overcame the problem of synchronizing the electronics with the message tape by generating a [[clock signal]] by reading the sprocket holes of the message tape. The speed of operation was thus limited by the mechanics of reading the tape. The tape reader was tested up to 9700 characters per second (53&amp;nbsp;mph) before the tape disintegrated. So 5000 characters/second ({{convert|40|ft/s|m/s mph||abbr=on|sigfig=3}}) was settled on as the speed for regular use. Flowers designed shift registers,{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc= Flowers, Thomas H. ''Colossus'' p. 100}} one being used for each of the five channels of the punched tape. The shift register stored successive bits from each of the tape channels and delivered five successive characters (either Z or ΔZ according to switch selection) to the processors. The five-way parallelism&lt;ref&gt;This would now be called a [[systolic array]]&lt;/ref&gt; enabled five simultaneous tests and counts to be performed giving an effective processing speed of 25,000 characters per second. {{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc= Flowers, Thomas H. ''Colossus'' p. 100}} The computer used algorithms devised by [[W. T. Tutte]] and colleagues to decrypt a Tunny message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/about/professor-william-t-tutte/biography-professor-tutte#bletchley|title=Biography of Professor Tutte - Combinatorics and Optimization|date=13 March 2015|website=Uwaterloo.ca|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Colossus computer selection panel.png |right|upright=1.35 |thumbnail |Colossus selection panel showing selections amongst others, of the far tape on the bedstead, and for input to the algorithm: Δ'''Z''', Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; and Δ&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The Newmanry was staffed by cryptanalysts, operators from the [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS)]] – known as “Wrens” – and engineers who were permanently on hand for maintenance and repair. By the end of the war the staffing was 272 Wrens and 27 men.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 15 – Some Historical Notes, 15C Period of Expansion, (b) Colossus, p. 35}} 

The first job in operating Colossus for a new message, was to prepare the paper tape loop. This was performed by the Wrens who stuck the two ends together using [[Bostik]] glue, ensuring that there was a 150-character length of blank tape between the end and the start of the message.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 5 Machines: 53 Colossus 53A Introduction, p.333}} Using a special hand punch they inserted a start hole between the third and fourth channels {{frac|2|1|2}} sprocket holes from the end of the blank section, and a stop hole between the fourth and fifth channels {{frac|1|1|2}} sprocket holes from the end of the characters of the message.{{sfn|Flowers|1983|pp=241,242}}{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 5 Machines: 53 Colossus 53B The Z stream, p.333}} These were read by specially positioned photocells and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended. The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the "near" or the "far" tape.{{sfn|Fensom|2006|p=303}}

After performing various resetting and zeroizing tasks, the Wren operators would, under instruction from the cryptanalyst, operate the "set total" decade switches and the K2 panel switches to set the desired algorithm. They would then start the bedstead tape motor and lamp and, when the tape was up to speed, operate the master start switch.{{sfn|Fensom|2006|p=303}}

==Programming==
[[File:Colossus computer Q panel.png |right|upright=1.35 |thumbnail |Colossus K2 switch panel showing switches for specifying the algorithm (on the left) and the counters to be selected (on the right).]]
Howard Campaigne, a mathematician and cryptanalyst from the US Navy's [[OP-20-G]], wrote the following in a foreword to Flowers' 1983 paper "The Design of Colossus".{{quote|My view of Colossus was that of cryptanalyst-programmer. I told the machine to make certain calculations and counts, and after studying the results, told it to do another job. It did not remember the previous result, nor could it have acted upon it if it did. Colossus and I alternated in an interaction that sometimes achieved an analysis of an unusual German cipher system, called "Geheimschreiber" by the Germans, and "Fish" by the cryptanalysts.{{sfn|Flowers|1983|pp=239–252}} }}

Colossus was not a [[stored-program computer]]. The input data for the five parallel processors was read from the looped message paper tape and the electronic pattern generators for the ''chi'', ''psi'' and motor wheels.{{sfn|Small|1944|p=108}} The programs for the processors were set and held on the switches and jack panel connections. Each processor could evaluate a Boolean function and count and display the number of times it yielded the specified value of "false" (0) or "true" (1) for each pass of the message tape.

Input to the processors came from two sources, the shift registers from tape reading and the thyratron rings that emulated the wheels of the Tunny machine.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 5 Machines: 53 Colossus, pp. 333–353}} The characters on the paper tape were called '''Z''' and the characters from the Tunny emulator were referred to by the Greek letters that Bill Tutte had given them when working out the logical structure of the machine. On the selection panel, switches specified either '''Z''' or '''ΔZ''', either &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; or '''Δ'''&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; and either &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; or '''Δ'''&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; for the data to be passed to the jack field and 'K2 switch panel'. These signals from the wheel simulators could be specified as stepping on with each new pass of the message tape or not.

The K2 switch panel had a group of switches on the left hand side to specify the algorithm. The switches on the right hand side selected the counter to which the result was fed. The plugboard allowed less specialized conditions to be imposed. Overall the K2 switch panel switches and the plugboard allowed about five billion different combinations of the selected variables. {{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 5 Machines: 53 Colossus 53A Introduction, p.333}}

As an example: a set of runs for a message tape might initially involve two ''chi'' wheels, as in Tutte's 1+2 algorithm. Such a two-wheel run was called a long run, taking on average eight minutes unless the parallelism was utilised to cut the time by a factor of five. The subsequent runs might only involve setting one ''chi'' wheel, giving a short run taking about two minutes. Initially, after the initial long run, the choice of next algorithm to be tried was specified by the cryptanalyst. Experience showed, however, that decision trees for this iterative process could be produced for use by the Wren operators in a proportion of cases.{{sfn|Budiansky|2006|p=62}}

==Influence and fate==
Although the Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines with programmability, albeit limited by modern standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/BriefHistofComp.html#Col|title=A Brief History of Computing. Jack Copeland, June 2000|website=Alanturing.net|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not a general-purpose machine, being designed for a range of cryptanalytic tasks, most involving counting the results of evaluating Boolean algorithms.

A Colossus computer was thus not a fully [[Turing complete]] machine. However, [[University of San Francisco]] professor Benjamin Wells has shown that if all ten Colossus machines made were rearranged in a specific [[Computer cluster|cluster]], then the entire set of computers could have simulated a [[universal Turing machine]], and thus be Turing complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wells | first = Benjamin |  title = Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Unconventional Computation 2009 (UC09), Ponta Delgada, Portugal: Advances in I/O, Speedup, and Universality on Colossus, an Unconventional Computer  | journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 5175 | pages = 247–261 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin, Heidelberg | date = 2009 | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1612096 | isbn = 978-3-642-03744-3  | accessdate = 2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a computer as a general purpose machine — that is, as more than a [[calculator]] devoted to solving difficult but specific problems — did not become prominent until after World War II.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Colossus and the reasons for its construction were highly secret, and remained so for 30 years after the War. Consequently, it was not included in the [[history of computing hardware]] for many years, and Flowers and his associates were deprived of the recognition they were due. Colossi 1 to 10 were dismantled after the war and parts returned to the Post Office. Some parts, sanitised as to their original purpose, were taken to Max Newman's [[Royal Society]] [[Computing Machine Laboratory]] at [[Manchester University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Brief History of Computing | publisher = alanturing.net | accessdate = 26 January 2010 | url = http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/BriefHistofComp.html#ACE }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tommy Flowers was ordered to destroy all documentation and burnt them in a furnace at Dollis Hill. He later said of that order:
{{quote|That was a terrible mistake. I was instructed to destroy all the records, which I did. I took all the drawings and the plans and all the information about Colossus on paper and put it in the boiler fire. And saw it burn.{{sfn|McKay|2010|pp=270–271}} }} Colossi 11 and 12, along with two replica Tunny machines, were retained, being moved to [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]'s new headquarters at [[Eastcote]] in April 1946, and again with GCHQ to [[Cheltenham]] between 1952 and 1954.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, et al. ''Mr Newman's section'' pp. 173–175}} One of the Colossi, known as ''Colossus Blue'', was dismantled in 1959; the other in 1960.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, et al. ''Mr Newman's section'' pp. 173–175}} There had been attempts to adapt them to other purposes, with varying success; in their later years they had been used for training.{{sfn|Horwood|1973}} [[I. J. Good|Jack Good]] related how he was the first to use Colossus after the war, persuading the US [[National Security Agency]] that it could be used to perform a function for which they were planning to build a special-purpose machine.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, et al. ''Mr Newman's section'' pp. 173–175}} Colossus was also used to perform character counts on [[one-time pad]] tape to test for non-randomness.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, et al. ''Mr Newman's section'' pp. 173–175}}

A small number of people who were associated with Colossus—and knew that large-scale, reliable, high-speed electronic digital computing devices were feasible—played significant roles in early computer work in the UK and probably in the US. However, being so secret, it had little direct influence on the development of later computers; it was [[EDVAC]] that was the seminal computer architecture of the time. In 1972 [[Herman Goldstine]], who was unaware of Colossus and its legacy to the projects of people such as Alan Turing ([[ACE (computer)|ACE]]), Max Newman ([[Manchester computers]]) and [[Harry Huskey]] ([[Bendix G-15]]), wrote that,

{{quote|Britain had such vitality that it could immediately after the war embark on so many well-conceived and well-executed projects in the computer field.{{sfn|Goldstine|1980|p=321}} }}

Professor [[Brian Randell]], who unearthed information about Colossus in the 1970s, commented on this, saying that:
{{quote|It is my opinion that the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer.{{sfn|Randell|1980|p=87}} }}

Randell's efforts started to bear fruit in the mid-1970s, after the secrecy about Bletchley Park was broken when Group Captain Winterbotham published his 1974 book ''The Ultra Secret''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Winterbotham | first = F.W. | author-link = F.W.

&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2000, a 500-page technical report on the Tunny cipher and its cryptanalysis—entitled ''General Report on Tunny''{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945}}—was released by GCHQ to the national [[Public Record Office]], and it contains a fascinating [[paean]] to Colossus by the cryptographers who worked with it:
{{quote|It is regretted that it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the fascination of a Colossus at work; its sheer bulk and apparent complexity; the fantastic speed of thin paper tape round the glittering pulleys; the childish pleasure of not-not, span, print main header and other gadgets; the wizardry of purely mechanical decoding letter by letter (one novice thought she was being hoaxed); the uncanny action of the typewriter in printing the correct scores without and beyond human aid; the stepping of the display; periods of eager expectation culminating in the sudden appearance of the longed-for score; and the strange rhythms characterizing every type of run: the stately break-in, the erratic short run, the regularity of wheel-breaking, the stolid rectangle interrupted by the wild leaps of the carriage-return, the frantic chatter of a motor run, even the ludicrous frenzy of hosts of bogus scores.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 5 Machines: 51 Introductory, (j) Impressions of Colossus, p. 327}} }}

The reconstruction is on display, in the historically correct place for Colossus No. 9, at [[The National Museum of Computing]], in H Block [[Bletchley Park]] in [[Milton Keynes]], Buckinghamshire.

In November 2007, to celebrate the project completion and to mark the start of a fundraising initiative for The National Museum of Computing, a Cipher Challenge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cipher Challenge | url=http://www.tnmoc.org/cipher1.htm | accessdate=1 February 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801175842/http://www.tnmoc.org/cipher1.htm | archivedate=1 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pitted the rebuilt Colossus against radio amateurs worldwide in being first to receive and decode three messages enciphered using the [[Lorenz SZ42]] and transmitted from radio station DL0HNF in the ''Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum'' computer museum.

Nevertheless, the victor's 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz laptop, running his own code, took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels. The German codebreaker said: "My laptop digested ciphertext at a speed of 1.2&amp;nbsp;million characters per second—240 times faster than Colossus. If you scale the CPU frequency by that factor, you get an equivalent clock of 5.8&amp;nbsp;MHz for Colossus.

The Cipher Challenge verified the successful completion of the rebuild project. "On the strength of today's performance Colossus is as good as it was six decades ago", commented Tony Sale.

==Other meanings==
{{see also|List of fictional computers}}
There was a fictional computer named ''Colossus'' in the 1970 movie ''[[Colossus: The Forbin Project]]'' which was based on the 1966 novel ''[[Colossus (novel)|Colossus]]'' by [[Dennis Feltham Jones|D. F. Jones]]. This was sheer coincidence as it pre-dates the public release of information about Colossus, or even its name.

[[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' (1999) also contains a fictional treatment of the historical role played by Turing and Bletchley Park.

A '''source code repository''' is a file archive and web hosting facility where a large amount of [[source code]], for software or for [[web page]]s, is kept, either publicly or privately. They are often used by [[open-source software]] projects and other multi-developer projects to handle various versions. They help developers submit patches of code in an organized fashion. Often these web sites support [[version control]], [[Bug tracking system|bug tracking]], [[release management]], [[mailing list]]s, and [[wiki]]-based documentation...

People who write software retain their copyright when their software is posted to any code hosting facilities, including the "non-gnu" section of [[GNU Savannah]]—with the exception of contributors to [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF)-copyrighted programs at GNU Savannah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AssignCopyright |title = Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation |website = Gnu.org |date = 18 October 2014 |accessdate = 2015-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = terms of use |url = http://slashdotmedia.com/terms-of-use/ |website = Sourceforge |quote = PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF ANY COPYRIGHTS, ...

[[File:Ansel Adams and camera.jpg|thumb|Ansel Easton Adams (1902–1984), an American [[photographer]] and [[environmentalist]], photo by [[J. Malcolm Greany]]]]

'''Conservation photography''' is the active use of the [[photographic process]] and its products, within the parameters of [[photojournalism]], to [[advocate]] for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] outcomes.

Conservation photography combines [[nature photography]] with the proactive, issue-oriented approach of [[documentary photography]] as an agent for protecting [[nature]] and improving the [[biosphere]] and [[natural environment]]. Conservation Photography furthers [[environmental conservation]], [[wildlife conservation]], [[habitat conservation]] or cultural conservation by expanding public awareness of issues and stimulating remedial action.

==History==
[[File:Carleton E. Watkins - Mt. Broderick, Nevada Fall - SFM.95.98 01 d02.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Carleton Watkins|Carleton E. Watkins]] (1829–1916) of Mt. Broderick and Nevada Fall (700 ft.) at Yosemite Valley in 1861]]
[[File:Ansel Adams-Half Dome, Apple Orchard, Yosemite.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Ansel Adams]] of Yosemite Half Dome, Apple Orchard, trees with snow on branches in April 1933]]
Photography has developed as a powerful medium to empower conservation. Photography has served this role since the 1860s, although not widely acknowledged as such.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example are the powerful images of [[Carleton Watkins]] which were successfully used to stimulate the establishment of [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1864 and [[William Henry Jackson]] and [[Ansel Adams]] who advocated for expansion and continued funding of the park.

Renewed emphasis on photography-for-conservation arose at the beginning of the 21st century, primarily in response to the human-caused [[environmental crisis]], recognizing that the global pattern of [[ecosystem]] degradation was not sustainable.

The modern field of conservation photography was formalized in October 2005 with the founding of the [[International League of Conservation Photographers]] by photographer [[Cristina Mittermeier]], during the 8th [[World Wilderness Congress]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. Prior to 2005 "conservation photography" was not widely recognized as a discipline.

==Definition==
[[File:Seashell vendor.jpeg|thumb|Photo of a vendor in Tanzania in 2000 selling to tourists [[threatened species]] [[seashell]]s which have been taken alive from the sea, killing the animal inside.]]

Conservation and photography appear as two distinct fields, but their combined impact can be profound. Simply put, conservation photography is photography that empowers or enables conservation.

According to the acclaimed photographer, [[Joel Sartore]], “the typical nature photograph shows a butterfly on a pretty flower. The conservation photograph shows the same thing, but with a bulldozer coming at it in the background. This doesn’t mean there’s no room for beautiful pictures, in fact we need beautiful images just as much as the issues. It does mean that the images exist for a reason; to save the Earth while we still can.”

The serious conservation photographer brings to their work a deep empathy for the natural world. Proper use of the resulting images has the power to bring about positive change.

Conservation photographs fall into two broad categories, both of which are equally valuable:

*The snapshot: upon seeing a striking scene one pulls out a cell phone or point-and-shoot camera, and snaps some quick framed pictures without expending too much time or effort.
*The carefully crafted image:: One sees the same scene, but instead of quickly shooting it and moving on, they take a series of skillfully crafted, high-quality images that tell the story in a more powerful way. Dramatic framing enhances the influence of a picture.

Such photographs have a stronger impact on the audience. One may also proactively seek opportunities to take crafted conservation pictures. Determined effort can result in excellent photo stories that can move people’s hearts and minds.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Gp-esso.jpg|thumb|Photo of [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[Esso]] /[[ExxonMobil in 2003]]]]
[[File:2011 flooding in Ayutthaya Province-EO-1 merged.jpg|thumb|True-colour [[satellite image]] showing [[flood]]ing in Ayutthaya and Pathum Thani Provinces in Central [[Thailand]] (right), compared to before the flooding (left) in 2011]]
In order to create an impact, conservation pictures should be put to work for specific causes. Though not every picture may find an immediate use, a carefully catalogued archive of conservation pictures can help increase impact of conservation related news stories, provide material for public awareness campaigns, including [[internet activism]] and sometimes serve as [[Investigative journalism]] evidence in court proceedings. Images of habitat destruction, especially in [[protected area]]s, can be important as legal evidence against the activity.
;Specialty fields
Several specialty fields benefit from their use of conservation photography, these include:
* [[Conservation movement]], to protect animals, fungi, plants and their habitats
** [[Conservation biology]], the science of the protection and management of biodiversity
** [[Conservation genetics]] - "an interdisciplinary science that aims to apply genetic methods to the conservation and restoration of biodiversity."
** [[Conservation (ethic)]], an ethic of resource use, allocation, and protection, especially of the natural environment
** [[Conservation organization]] typically an environmental organization
** [[Conservation movement|Conservationist]], a person who advocates for conservation of animals, fungi, plants and their habitats
** [[Energy conservation]], the reduction of non-renewable energy consumption
** [[Habitat conservation]], a land management practice that seeks to conserve, protect and restore, habitat areas for wild animals, fungi and plants
** [[Water conservation]], reducing the use of water to protect the environment
** [[Wetland conservation]], protecting wetlands to conserve their ecological processes
** [[Wildlife management]], multidisciplinary practices, including conservation of species and their habitats
** [[Conservation authority (Canada)]]
** [[Marine conservation]], the protection and preservation of ecosystems in oceans and seas
** [[Soil conservation]], management strategies for prevention of soil being eroded from the earth’s surface or becoming chemically altered
* [[Conservation-restoration]], the profession devoted to the preservation of cultural resources
** [[Art conservation]], protecting works of art

==Organizations==
There are many [[environmental organization]]s that effectively use conservation photography to help advocate their goals. Just a few are:


*[[ARKive]] is a global initiative with the mission of "promoting the conservation of the world's threatened species, through the power of wildlife imagery", which it does by locating and gathering films, photographs and audio recordings of the world's [[species]] into a centralised [[Digital data|digital]] [[archive]]. Its current priority is the completion of audio-visual profiles for the c. 17,000 species on the [[IUCN Red List]] of [[threatened species]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/about/|title=About ARKive|work=ARKive|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sanctuary Asia]] is [[India]]'s first and one of its leading [[Environmentalism|environmental]] [[news magazine]]s. It was founded in 1981 to raise awareness among [[Indian people]] of their disappearing [[natural heritage]]. The magazine is attractively packaged&lt;ref&gt;Various authors, India, pp. 76; [[Lonely Planet]] Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; with colored photographs. The ''Sanctuary Photo Library''' is a melting pot of natural history visuals, information and resources used to produce some of the finest wildlife and nature calendars, posters, slide shows, exhibitions and other products available in India.
*[[Sierra club]] maintains a publishing imprint, [[Sierra Club Books]], publishing books on environmental issues, wilderness photographic essays, nature guides, and other related subjects. They publish the Sierra Club Calendars, perennial bestsellers, featuring photographs by well-known nature photographers such as [[Galen Rowell]].
*The [[International League of Conservation Photographers]] (iLCP) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to furthering environmental and cultural conservation through ethical photography. A project-driven organization, it partners with leading conservation groups, scientists, and policy makers worldwide in order to produce high-quality documentary images that depict both the beauty of the natural world and the challenges it faces.

'''''Corliss v. Wenner''''', 34 P.3d 1100 (Idaho 2001), was a case decided by the Court of Appeals of [[Idaho]] that rejected the [[common law]] distinctions between [[lost, mislaid, and abandoned property]] and [[treasure trove]].&lt;ref&gt;Casner, A.J. et al.  ''Cases and Text on Property, Fifth Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
Four pounds of gold coins dating from 1857 to 1914 were found during the excavation of a driveway in [[Blaine County, Idaho]].  The court awarded the property to the owner of the [[locus in quo]] instead of the finder and rejected the distinctions between categories of lost property as anachronistic in situations in which personal property is buried or hidden on privately owned realty. .&lt;ref&gt;Casner, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reproduction of the page from [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''Relación de las cosas de Yucatán'', which gives a purported correspondence between letters of the [[Spanish language|Spanish alphabet]] and Maya glyphs, and which has become known as the '''de Landa alphabet''']]
The '''de Landa alphabet''' is the correspondence of [[Spanish language|Spanish letters]] and [[glyph]]s written in the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya script]], which the 16th-century bishop of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Diego de Landa]] recorded as part of his documentation of the [[Maya civilization]]. With the aid of two Maya informants familiar with the script, de Landa made an attempt to provide a transcribed "A, B, C" for the Maya script with the intent of providing a key to its decipherment and translation. Despite its inaccuracies, the information provided by him would much later prove to be crucial to the mid-20th century breakthrough in the [[decipherment]] of the Maya script, starting with the work of the Soviet [[epigraphy|epigrapher]] and [[Mayanist]], [[Yuri Knorozov]]. 

The "alphabet," along with some passages of explanatory notes and examples of its use in Maya writing, was written as a small part of de Landa's ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]'' ("Account of the matters of Yucatán"), which also documented many aspects of the culture and practices of the indigenous [[Maya peoples]] that he had seen and been told of when he was living among them in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. His work was actually written after he had been recalled back to [[Spain]] to face trial by Inquisition for allegations of improper behaviour while there, and he wrote it as a defense of his mission there. The work was soon thereafter almost forgotten. Lost to scholarship for several centuries, an abridged copy of it was later rediscovered by the French antiquarian scholar [[Brasseur de Bourbourg]] in the 19th century.

Then a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to use its de Landa alphabet passages to decipher the unknown script because the De Landa script was an [[alphabet]], but the extant Maya texts are [[logosyllabic]]. It has been theorized that De Landa might have unwittingly created a spurious writing system by a fundamental lack of understanding of how logosyllabic writing systems function as well as by tenuous access to reliable sources.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that the pre-existing establishments, such as the Mayan religious order, were all destroyed by invading Spanish belligerents, such as De Landa, to make way for [[Christian]] enlightenment. In furtherance of this goal, nearly all the Mayan texts were destroyed, in deference to writings that conform to [[Bible|Biblical]] doctrine.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

It was not until the early 1950s that Knorozov published his landmark paper, analyzing it and other inscriptions in a new light, that substantial progress began to be made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7742">[[File:Dir command in Windows Command Prompt.png|300px|thumb|right|Screenshot of a [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Command Prompt]] window showing a directory listing.]]

In [[computing]], a '''directory''' is a [[file system]] cataloging structure which contains references to other [[computer file]]s, and possibly other directories. On many computers, directories are known as '''folders''', or '''drawers''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Using The AMIGA Workbench |date=July 1991 |publisher=Commodore-Amiga |chapter=Chapter 1: Tutorial |page=46 |quote=The path specifies the disk name, or location, and all of the drawers that lead to the specified file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[analogy|analogous]] to a [[workbench]] or the traditional office [[filing cabinet]].

Files are organized by storing related files in the same directory. In a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[file system]] (that is, one in which files and directories are organized in a manner that resembles a [[tree structure|tree]]), a directory contained inside another directory is called a '''subdirectory'''.  The terms '''parent''' and '''child''' are often used to describe the relationship between a subdirectory and the directory in which it is cataloged, the latter being the parent. The top-most directory in such a filesystem, which does not have a parent of its own, is called the '''root''' directory.

==Overview==
[[File:Files11_directory_hierarchy.svg|thumb|Diagram of a hierarchical directory tree. The root directory is here called "MFD", for Master File Directory.]] &lt;!-- this Files-11 structure is not a tree, this image has to be replaced, or the problematic link from Dir 3 to File 2 needs to be modified and explained as a symbolic link (Unix parlance) or shortcut (Microsoft Windows parlance). --&gt;
Historically, and even on some modern [[embedded system]]s, the file systems either had no support for directories at all, or only had a "flat" [[directory structure]], meaning subdirectories were not supported; there were only a group of top-level directories, each containing files. In modern systems, a directory can contain a mix of files and subdirectories.

A reference to a location in a directory system is called a [[Path (computing)|path]].

In many [[operating system]]s, programs have an associated [[working directory]] in which they execute. Typically, file names accessed by the program are assumed to reside within this directory if the file names are not specified with an explicit directory name.

Some operating systems restrict a [[computer user|user's]] access to only their [[home directory]] or project directory, thus isolating their activities from all other users. In early versions of Unix the root directory was the home directory of the [[root user]], but modern Unix usually uses another directory such as /root for this purpose.

In keeping with [[Unix philosophy]], Unix systems treat directories as a type of file.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bga.org/~lessem/psyc5112/usail/concepts/filesystems/everything-is-a-file.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310211947/http://www.bga.org/~lessem/psyc5112/usail/concepts/filesystems/everything-is-a-file.html |date=March 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folder metaphor===
[[File:Crystal folder.png|thumb|right|Sample folder icon (from [[KDE]]).]]
The name ''folder'', presenting an analogy to the [[file folder]] used in offices, and used in a hierarchical file system design for the [[Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting]] (ERMA) Mark 1 published in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnard III|first1=G. A.|last2=Fein|first2=L.|title=Organization and Retrieval of Records Generated in a Large-Scale Engineering Project|journal=Proceedings of the Eastern Joint Computer Conference|date=1958|pages=59-63|doi=10.1109/AFIPS.1958.75|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/afips/1958/5053/00/50530059-abs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[Xerox Star]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn4vC80Pv6Q/|title="Xerox Star User Interface (1982)"|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in almost all modern [[operating system]]s' desktop environments. Folders are often depicted with [[Computer icon|icon]]s which visually resemble physical file folders.

There is a difference between a ''directory'', which is a [[file system]] concept, and the [[graphical user interface]] metaphor that is used to represent it (a ''folder'').  For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] uses the concept of [[Special Folders|special folders]] to help present the contents of the computer to the user in a fairly consistent way that frees the user from having to deal with absolute directory paths, which can vary between versions of Windows, and between individual installations. Many operating systems also have the concept of "smart folders" or [[virtual folder]]s that reflect the results of a file system search or other operation. These folders do not represent a directory in the file hierarchy. Many [[email client]]s allow the creation of folders to organize email. These folders have no corresponding representation in the filesystem structure.

In computing, a directory and a folder are the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

If one is referring to a ''container of documents'', the term ''folder'' is more appropriate. The term ''directory'' refers to the way a structured list of document files and folders is stored on the computer. The distinction can be due to the way a directory is accessed; on Unix systems, /usr/bin/ is usually referred to as a directory when viewed in a [[command line]] [[Command-line interface|console]], but if accessed through a graphical [[file manager]], users may sometimes call it a folder.

==Lookup cache==
{{expand section|date=December 2013}}
Operating systems that support hierarchical filesystems (practically all modern ones) implement a form of [[Cache (computing)|caching]] to [[Random-access memory|RAM]] of recent [[Path (computing)|path]] lookups. In the [[Unix]] world, this is usually called '''Directory Name Lookup Cache''' (DNLC), although it is called '''dcache''' on [[Linux]].&lt;Ref name="dlnc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfs-perf/results/cel/dnlc.html|title=Close-To-Open Cache Consistency in the Linux NFS Client|publisher=Citi.umich.edu|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For local filesystems, DNLC entries normally expire only under pressure from other more recent entries. For [[distributed file system|network file system]]s a [[Cache coherence|coherence mechanism]] is necessary to ensure that entries have not been invalidated by other clients.&lt;Ref name="dlnc"/&gt;

'''Drostdy Museum'''  is located in  [[Swellendam]], [[South Africa]].The building was built in 1747 by the [[Dutch East India Company]] as a residence for the Magistrate. Soon afterwards, a jail, a house for the secretary, a mill and various outbuildings were erected.
It was bought by the South African Government and established as a Museum in 1939.

The '''Dublin Core Schema''' is a small set of [[Controlled vocabulary|vocabulary terms]] that can be used to describe digital resources (video, images, web pages, etc.), as well as physical resources such as books or CDs, and objects like artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/ |title=DCMI Type Vocabulary |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full set of Dublin Core [[metadata]] terms can be found on the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ |title=DCMI Metadata Terms |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original set of 15 classic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/specifications/ |title=DCMI Specifications |website=dublincore.org |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; metadata terms, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES),&lt;ref name="DCMES"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is endorsed in the following standards documents:

Dublin Core metadata may be used for multiple purposes, from simple resource description to combining metadata vocabularies of different [[Metadata#Standards|metadata standards]], to providing interoperability for metadata vocabularies in the [[linked data]] cloud and [[Semantic Web]] implementations.

==Background==
"Dublin" refers to [[Dublin, Ohio]], USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincore.org/news/1995/1995-03-01_the-oclcncsa-metadata-workshop-the-essential-elements-of-network-object-description/|title=DCMI: The OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop: The Essential Elements of Network Object Description|author=|date=|website=www.dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by the [[OCLC]] (Online Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA). "Core" refers to the metadata terms as "broad and generic being usable for describing a wide range of resources".&lt;ref name="DCMES"/&gt; The semantics of Dublin Core were established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from [[librarianship]], [[computer science]], [[text encoding]], [[museum]]s, and other related fields of scholarship and practice.

Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core community focused on "[[application profile]]s" &amp;ndash; the idea that metadata records would use Dublin Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements. During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium's work on a generic [[data model]] for metadata, the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF, more recently in the context of the [[linked data]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCMI Metadata Basics|publisher=dublincore.org/metadata-basics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dublin Core Metadata Initiative''' (DCMI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/ |title=DCMI Home: Dublin Core® Metadata Initiative (DCMI) |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an open forum for the development of interoperable online [[metadata standards]] for a broad range of purposes and of business models. DCMI's activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops, standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an independent entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=OCLC Research and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative | url=http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/past/orprojects/dublincore/default.htm | accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of the standard==
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. '''Simple Dublin Core''' comprised 15 elements; '''Qualified Dublin Core''' included three additional elements (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.

Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the '''DCMI Metadata Terms''' as a single set of terms using the [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] data model.&lt;ref name="dublincore1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ |title=DCMI Metadata Terms |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full set of elements is found under the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges, which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/|title=DCMI: Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description|author=|date=|website=dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dublin Core Metadata Element Set===
The original '''DCMES''' Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements:&lt;ref name="DCMES"/&gt;
# Title
# Creator
# Subject
# Description
# Publisher
# Contributor
# Date
# Type
# Format
# Identifier
# Source
# Language
# Relation
# Coverage
# Rights

Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a NISO standards, Z39.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007.  ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the [[ISO/IEC 19788]]-2 Metadata for learning resources (MLR) &amp;ndash; Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC36|ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36]].

Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core Metadata Registry.&lt;ref name="registry"&gt;[http://dcmi.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/dcregistry/ Dublin Core Metadata Registry]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Encoding examples====
: {{code|2=html5|1=&lt;meta name="DC.Format" content="video/mpeg; 10 minutes" /&gt;}}
: {{code|2=html5|1=&lt;meta name="DC.Language" content="en" /&gt;}}
: {{code|2=html5|1=&lt;meta name="DC.Publisher" content="publisher-name" /&gt;}}
: {{code|2=html5|1=&lt;meta name="DC.Title" content="HYP" /&gt;}}

====Example of use [and mention] by WebCite====
On the "archive form" web page for [[WebCite]] it says,&lt;ref name="WebCite form"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcitation.org/archive |title= WebCite archive form |website=[[WebCite]] |quote=These are Dublin Core elements. Entering these will help you to correctly cite the URL. [...]}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part: "Metadata (optional): These are Dublin Core elements. [...]".

===Qualified Dublin Core===
(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/07/11/dcmes-qualifiers/ |title=Dublin Core Qualifiers |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Subsequent to the specification of the original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.

Element refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the ''Dumb-Down Principle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/|title=DCMI: DCMI Grammatical Principles|author=|date=|website=www.dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that an application that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery.

In addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes include [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]] and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation, for example, "2000-12-31" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may still be useful to a '''human reader'''.

'''Audience, Provenance''' and '''RightsHolder''' are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15 elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core. DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type. This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.&lt;ref name="registry"/&gt;

===DCMI Metadata Terms===
The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary.&lt;ref name="dublincore1"/&gt; This set includes the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in ''italic''), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique URI in the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms, and all are defined as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] properties.

==Syntax==
Syntax choices for Dublin Core metadata depends on a number of variables, and "one size fits all" prescriptions rarely apply. When considering an appropriate syntax, it is important to note that Dublin Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent and are equally applicable in a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation both by machines and by human beings.

The '''Dublin Core Abstract Model'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/|title=DCMI: DCMI Abstract Model|author=|date=|website=dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a reference model against which particular Dublin Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such a reference model allows implementers to gain a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between different syntax.

==Notable applications==
One [[Document Type Definition]] based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework (OMF) specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/osrt/omf/|title=m e t a l a b open source metadata framework|author=|date=|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMF is in turn used by [[Rarian]] (superseding [[ScrollKeeper]]), which is used by the [[GNOME]] desktop and [[KDE]] help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server. [[PBCore]] is also based on Dublin Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pbcore.org/schema/|title=PBCore Schema – PBCore|last=|first=|date=|website=pbcore.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-19|quote=PBCore is built on the foundation of the Dublin Core (ISO 15836), an international standard for resource discovery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zope]] [[Zope Content Management Framework|CMF's]] Metadata products, used by the [[Plone (software)|Plone]], [[ERP5]], the Nuxeo CPS [[Content management system]]s, [[SimpleDL]], and [[Fedora Commons]] also implement Dublin Core. The [[EPUB]] [[e-book]] format uses Dublin Core metadata in the [[OPF (file format)|OPF file]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0_latest.htm#Section2.2 |title=Open Packaging Format (OPF) § Publication Metadata |website=[[International Digital Publishing Forum]] |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GeographBrowseScreenshot.png|thumb|300px|The map browsing interface, showing [[thumbnail]] photos for each completed "geograph"]]

'''Geograph Britain and Ireland''' is a [[Web application|web-based]] project, initiated in March 2005, to create a freely accessible archive of geographically located photographs of Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name="Geograph.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk|title=Geograph|website=www.geograph.org.uk|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Photographs in the Geograph collection are chosen to illustrate significant or typical features of each 1&amp;nbsp;km × 1&amp;nbsp;km (100&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]]) grid square in the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] and the [[Irish national grid reference system]].&lt;ref name=geo_suppl&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/article/Geograph-or-supplemental Hawgood D. Geograph or supplemental (June 2007)] (accessed 13 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
There are 331,957 such grid squares containing at least some land (at low tide).&lt;ref name=overview_stats&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/statistics.php Geograph: Overview Statistics for Geograph British Isles] (accessed 24 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Each page uses a [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]].

Geographs are being collected for all parts of Great Britain and Ireland. The [[Channel Islands]] fall outside Britain's grid system, but may be geographed using their local [[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]] grid.

The project is sponsored by [[Ordnance Survey]], and extracts from the OS Landranger 1:50,000 scale maps illustrate the grid square pages.

Geograph Project Limited, is a Charity Registered in England and Wales, and the name Geograph is trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/article/About-Geograph-page About Geograph] (accessed 25 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Photographs can be contributed by any registered user, although they must be approved by a panel of moderators before appearing on the website. The main aim of moderation is to make the site 'classroom ready' so that inappropriate images are rejected. The activity of taking photographs for the project is known as ''geographing''. All images are licensed by the contributors using the [[Creative Commons]] ''cc-by-sa 2.0'' licence which permits modification and redistribution of the images under certain conditions. Contributors should be aware that they are granting everyone an irrevocable licence to use their image(s); it is very difficult to get an image removed once it appears on the website. Photo resolution is a minimum of 640 by 480 pixels, with options for higher resolutions.

The entire archive of images with [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] metadata is being made available for download via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrents.geograph.org.uk/|title=Geograph Torrents|website=torrents.geograph.org.uk|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an incentive to increase coverage, participants are awarded a point each time they contribute the first photograph classified as a ''geograph'' to a grid square.&lt;ref name=telegraph2712&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/3966478/Modern-Domesday-book-builds-photo-archive-of-UK.html | title= Modern Domesday book' builds photo archive of UK | date= 27 December 2008| first= Matthew | last= Moore | publisher= [[Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate= 27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, no limit to the number of images per square, and some squares have over 1000 images.

Some participants combine geographing with other outdoor location sports such as [[Letterboxing (hobby)|letterboxing]], [[geocaching]], [[trigpointing]], [[benchmarking (geolocating)|benchmarking]], and [[peak bagging]].

==Types of image==
[[Image:NS6469 harvest.jpg|thumb|Typical rural geograph image]]
[[Image:Holywood.jpg|thumb|Typical urban geograph image]]
[[Image:Happy in the Snow (geograph 3307950).jpg|thumb|Typical wildlife supplemental image]]
Geograph images are classified by site moderators as:
* '''Geograph''' – an image which usefully illustrates or characterises the area in which it was taken;
* '''Accepted''' – an image which adds useful information about a square but which does not meet the requirements of a geograph; this includes close-ups, interiors, aerial shots, photos taken from outside the grid square, moveable objects that can't be shown on maps and silhouetted images;&lt;ref name=geo_suppl/&gt; Previously 'supplemental', now split into subcategories of 'Close Look', Inside', 'Aerial', 'Cross Grid' and 'Extra'
* '''Rejected''' – an image that does not meet the requirements of the Geograph Project.

There is a special classification of image that is known as a '''First Geograph''' – the first image uploaded of a particular grid square which meets the requirements to be a geograph. Later a new system of points, where contributors can gain '''Second''', '''Third''' and '''Fourth''' points, was introduced. Similar to the first point system, this time a contributor gains a point depending on how many other geographers have submitted geographs to that square. For example, a square with one geograph by one contributor would have second, third and fourth points available. The same situation would apply if the first contributor has submitted many geographs in that square. The relevant date is when the photo was submitted, rather than taken.

A contributor gains a TPoint ('''Time-gap Point''') by submitting a photo that was taken over five years after the most recent image for that square. A contributor can also gain a TPoint by submitting an historic photo to a square that was taken at least 5 years away from any other photograph in the square.

The site also provides a count of the number of grid squares each contributor has photographed (Personal Points)

Some of the common themes for geograph photos include:
* [[Physical geography|Physical landscape]]
* Human [[land use]]
* [[Built environment]]
* Social interaction
* [[Geology]]
* [[Flora]] and [[fauna]]
* [[Local history]]&lt;ref name=geo_suppl/&gt;

==Statistics==
[[Image:Malvern Rise - geograph.org.uk - 2000000.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The 2,000,000th ''submitted'' image, Malvern Rise near to [[Dover]]]]
[[Image:Geographsmillionth.jpg|thumb|right|150px|1,000,000th image shows Minor road near [[Aberuchill Castle|Aberuchill]]]]

As of 19 July 2017, the project had over 5 million photographs contributed by over 12,500 contributors, covering over 97% of Great Britain and over 40% of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/statistics.php|title=Geograph:: Statistics|website=www.geograph.org.uk|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were an average of 19.7 images per grid square.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/numbers.php Geograph: Progress So Far] (accessed 19 July 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geograph Conference==

'''First Geograph Conference'''

On Wednesday 17 February 2010, Geograph British Isles organised its first conference for contributors to the project. About 80 contributors attended to discuss the project in both plenary and break-out sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/discuss/index.php ''Geograph website forum passim''] (Registration required) (accessed 26 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The event was hosted by Geograph's sponsor, Ordnance Survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2010/feb/geograph.html  ''Ordnance Survey press release''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605232653/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2010/feb/geograph.html |date=5 June 2011 }} (accessed 26 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It took place at the Ordnance Survey head office at [[Romsey]] near [[Southampton]] and was reported by geography-related media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spatialnews.geocomm.com/dailynews/2010/feb/18/news6.html ''SpatialNews'' website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711084803/http://spatialnews.geocomm.com/dailynews/2010/feb/18/news6.html |date=11 July 2011 }} (accessed 26 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directionsmag.com/press.releases/?duty=Show&amp;id=43891 ''Ordnance Survey press release''] (accessed 26 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second Geograph Conference'''

On Wednesday 4 April 2012 a second conference took place at The Circle in [[Sheffield]]. It took stock of where the project was at that time, as it neared 3 million submissions; and put forward potential solutions that could secure its financial future in the years ahead.

'''Third Geograph Conference'''

The third conference took place at The [[Edinburgh]] Training and Conference Venue on Saturday 8 June 2013. Subjects discussed included funding of the project, educational use of the images and the moderation procedures applied to contributors' submissions.

'''Fourth Geograph Conference'''

For the fourth conference the venue returned to [[Southampton]] and the Ordnance Survey's new headquarters building at Adanac Park on Friday 27 June 2014. Subjects discussed included the quality of submitted photographs and titles, the production of good quality descriptions, local studies, as well as the funding of the project, educational use of the images and the moderation procedures applied to contributors' submissions as in 2013.

'''Fifth Geograph Conference'''

For the fifth conference Geograph members gathered at [[Peterborough]]. On the Friday afternoon conference attendees visited a brickworks just outside the city. The conference itself was held at [[Peterborough Museum &amp; Archives|Peterborough Museum]]: this included a talk on the [[William Smith (geologist)|geologist William Smith]]. Walks around the city centre and local waterways concluded the proceedings.

==Tools and facilities==
The site has a number of tools for making use of the photographs.  Collectively known as '''Collections''', the site front page now features a ''Collection of the week''.  The various techniques include (with examples):
* Shared Descriptions, a simple method of grouping images by a common topic
* Articles, a longer text-and-image article by one or more authors
* Galleries, a forum-like mechanism where people list similar photos
* Geotrips, where photographs, a GPS track file, and a written description combine to illustrate a day out or an expedition.

Contributors can choose to add meta-data to each image, in the form of ''Subject'' and ''Tags'', to go along with the geo-tagging by location.  All of this allows the use of a Browser to allow the relatively large archive to be searched.  There are other methods of search, of course, ranging from Simple text search to tagged searches and complex searches.

Because of the geographic indexing of the pictures, it is possible to summon a page for an individual 1-km square.  These square pages all provide a ''/link'' page which links to internal and external tools, such as a wide range of other mapping sites, and the various national historical artefacts databases.

The site has a lot of detailed statistics, but can also create personal profile and personal coverage maps.  It started as a game, and many of the tools support personal achievement and goals.

== Long term archival ==

The site's 5 million plus photographs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/4018397|title=Portland Arms Hotel, Galston (C) Leslie Barrie|website=www.geograph.org.uk|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been selected for long term [[web archiving]] by the [[British Library]] in their UK Web Archive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/target/31653948 Geograph British Isles in UK Web Archive] (accessed 26 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many photographs have been transferred to [[Wikimedia Commons]], and the photos are used throughout thousands of [[Wikipedia]] articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Geograph|title=Category:Images from the Geograph British Isles project - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although automatic blanket transfers have not occurred since about 1.8 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Batch_uploading/Geograph|title=Commons:Batch uploading/Geograph - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons_talk:Batch_uploading/Geograph#End_of_the_batch|title=Commons talk:Batch uploading/Geograph - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; tools and advice for transferring are provided for each photo on its re-use page.

==Sister projects==
In 2009, a sister project, [[Geograph Deutschland]] was launched, covering Germany.&lt;ref name=Germany&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geo-en.hlipp.de/ |title=Welcome to Geograph Deutschland |publisher=Geograph |language=German |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geograph Ireland]] currently co-exists with Geograph Britain and Ireland, but may split into a separate project.&lt;ref name=Eire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geograph.ie/ |title=Welcome to Geograph Ireland |publisher=Geograph |accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geograph Channel Islands]] covers the [[Channel Islands]].&lt;ref name=CI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel-islands.geographs.org/ |title=Welcome to Geograph Channel Islands |publisher=Geograph |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Giles v. Harris''''', 189 U.S. 475 (1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Giles v. Harris|189|475|1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early 20th-century [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld a state constitution's requirements for voter registration and qualifications. Although the plaintiff accused the state of discriminating in practice against black citizens, the Court found that the requirements applied to all citizens and refused to review the results "in practice," which it considered overseeing the state's process. As there was no stated intent in law to disfranchise blacks, the Court upheld the state law.

The African-American educator [[Booker T. Washington]] secretly arranged for funding and representation for Jackson W. Giles in this lawsuit and the ensuing ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904).  He worked extensively behind the scenes to direct and raise funds for other lawsuits and segregation challenges as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon, ''Constitutional Commentary'', vol.17, 2000, pp.13-14] Accessed 10 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[plaintiff]], Jackson W. Giles, sued on behalf of more than 5000 black citizens of [[Montgomery, Alabama]], such as himself in seeking to have the [[United States district court|federal court]] require the state to register them to vote. The suit was brought in response to a number of provisions in the Alabama state constitution, which combined to prevent blacks from being able to register. Giles was literate and had voted in Montgomery for 30 years, from 1871 to 1901, before the new constitution was passed.

One of the new provisions held that any person registered before January 1, 1903, as most whites were, would thereafter be registered for life. That was a type of [[grandfather clause]]. Any person not registered at that time, as most blacks were not, would have to satisfy a number of requirements before being allowed to register. They included a test of the potential registrant's understanding of the duties and obligations of citizenship. This test was administered by white election officials, who conducted it in a subjective manner that resulted in most whites' being approved to register and most blacks being rejected. 

The district court dismissed the case on the grounds that the suit was not seeking enough in damages to bring it within the [[jurisdiction]] of the federal courts. At the time, a statute was in place requiring that cases brought under [[federal question jurisdiction]] satisfy an [[amount-in-controversy]] requirement of $2000. Giles had not specified any amount of monetary damages. The plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court. He appealed against the decision.

==Issue==
Did federal courts have the authority to hear a case brought against state government officials based on the assertion that those officials were part of a statewide conspiracy to deprive blacks of the right to vote?

==Decision==
The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], decided to uphold the dismissal of the case, for two reasons: 
* First, the Court noted that the plaintiffs were asserting that the entire registration system was unconstitutional, but the only relief they sought was to be registered. The Court suggested that it would solve nothing for the names of the plaintiffs to be added to the voter rolls while the entire voting process remained illegal.
* Second, the Court noted that under the doctrine set forth in ''[[Hans v. Louisiana]]'' (1890), the [[Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] prohibited the plaintiff from suing the state directly in a [[United States federal court]]. Since the federal court has no power to issue an order to the state, the only way that the plaintiff's ability to vote could be enforced would be for the court to monitor the entire election process, which would be difficult in light of the overwhelming desire of the white population to prevent blacks from voting.

===Dissenting opinions===
Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] and Justice [[David Josiah Brewer]] both dissented from the Court's opinion. Harlan contended that the court could have resolved the issue based on the amount-in-controversy requirement and did not need to address the power of the federal courts to hear the merits of this suit. Harlan and Brewer both asserted that if the question was solely one of the power of federal courts to hear the case, the Court should find that such power exists.

==Aftermath==
In ''Giles v. Teasley'', Jackson Giles sought to meet some of the Court's grounds for its rulings, but his challenge was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Richard M. |last=Valelly |title=The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2004 |page=140 |isbn=0-226-84528-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until many years later that the Court overturned ''Giles v. Harris'' in a series of cases: they established that the right to vote was protected by the [[equal protection clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment, and federal courts have broad power to address deprivations of constitutional rights of citizens within states. After congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the federal government was authorized to oversee, monitor and enforce voter registration and elections to ensure that African Americans (and other minorities) were allowed to register and vote. It still took years and more court cases to achieve.

When ''Giles v. Harris'' was brought to the Supreme Court, some members of the Court (and the Executive Branch) did not conceive of exercising such federal powers years after Reconstruction had ended. However, the legislative branch had exercised such power in challenges until the time of ''Giles v. Harris.'' In the 19th century, the House Elections Committee repeatedly [[unseated members of the United States Congress|refused to seat]] members reported elected by their states when it found that the voting or registration process had been compromised. Since the excluded members were inevitably Democrats, partisan politics could play a role in these decisions; certainly such members were unseated only when Republicans held the majority in the House. After the ''Giles v. Harris'' ruling, the legislative branch stopped unseating members because of such concerns. The issue of disenfranchisement of blacks was repeatedly brought up by concerned congressmen. For instance, in the 1920s, a Republican representative proposed readjusting apportionment to decrease southern seats in relation to the populations they had disfranchised. By that time, the Southern Democrats had so much power that they could defeat any such proposals.

President Bush therefore formed the Commission, but gave it a broad mandate not only to look into any errors behind the [[Iraq]] intelligence, but also to look into intelligence on WMD programs in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Libya]], as well as to examine the capabilities of the Intelligence Community to address the problem of [[nuclear proliferation|WMD proliferation]] and "related threats." However, the commission was not directed to examine the extent to which the [[Bush administration (2000)|Bush administration]] may have manipulated the intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Following intense study of the American Intelligence Community, the Commission delivered its report to the President on March 31, 2005, the so-called Robb-Silberman Report.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"&gt;{{cite web|date=April 1, 2005 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0401-10.htm |title=Intelligence Analysts Whiffed on a 'Curveball' |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Greg Miller and Bob Drogin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803124926/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0401-10.htm |archivedate=August 3, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
Regarding Iraq, the Commission concluded that the [[United States Intelligence Community]] was wrong in almost all of its pre-war judgments about [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction]] and that this constituted a major [[intelligence failure]].

{{quote|The Intelligence Community's performance in assessing Iraq's pre-war weapons of mass destruction programs was a major intelligence failure. The failure was not merely that the Intelligence Community's assessments were wrong. There were also serious shortcomings in the way these assessments were made and communicated to policymakers.|[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/wmd/index.html Unclassified version of the commission's report], p. 46}}

The Commission's report also described systemic analytical, collection, and dissemination flaws that led the intelligence community to erroneous assessments about Iraq's alleged WMD programs. Chief among these flaws were "an analytical process that was driven by assumptions and inferences rather than data", failures by certain agencies to gather all relevant information and analyze fully information on purported centrifuge tubes, insufficient vetting of key sources, particularly the source "[[Curveball (informant)|Curveball]]," and somewhat overheated presentation of data to policymakers.

The 601-page document detailed many U.S. intelligence failures and identified intelligence breakdowns in dozens of cases.  Some of the conclusions reached by the report were:

*the report notes in several places that the commission's mandate did not allow it "to investigate how policymakers used the intelligence they received from the Intelligence Community on Iraq's weapons programs,"&lt;ref name="VV"&gt;{{cite web |date= April 7, 2005&lt;!-- 11:50 AM--&gt;| url = http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0515,vest,62865,6.html| title = Big Lies, Blind Spies, and Vanity Fair| publisher = sundaytelegraph | accessdate = 2007-07-24 | first = Jason | last = Vest | authorlink = Jason Vest | quote=Footnote 274 [of the Iraq Intelligence Commission] elaborates, explaining that 'when [DIA] pressed for access to Curveball, [BND] said that Curveball disliked Americans and that he would refuse to speak to them.' }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*One of the main and crucial intelligence sources for the case in Iraq was an informant named Curveball.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;  Curveball had never been interviewed by American intelligence until after the war and was instead handled exclusively by [[List of intelligence agencies of Germany|German intelligence agents]], who regarded his statements as unconvincing.  An October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate that concluded Iraq "has" [[biological weapons]] was "based almost exclusively on information obtained" from Curveball, according to the report.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;
*Information about aluminum tubes to be used as [[gas centrifuge|centrifuges]] in a nuclear weapons program were found by the commission to be used for conventional [[rocket (weapon)|rockets]].
*The [[Niger uranium forgeries|Niger Yellowcake scandal]] was due to American intelligence believing "transparently [[forged document]]s" purporting to show a contract between the countries. There were "flaws in the [[letterhead]], [[forged signature]]s, misspelled words, incorrect titles for individuals and government entities".&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;
*While there were many reports that Curveball was actually the cousin of one of [[Ahmed Chalabi]]'s top aides, the IIC, while discovering that at least two INC defectors were fabricators, said it was "unable to uncover any evidence that the INC &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Iraqi National Congress]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or any other organization was directing Curveball."&lt;ref name="LATIMES" /&gt;

==Recommendations ==

The report also looked forward, recommending a large number of organizational and structural reforms.  Of the 74 recommendations to the President, he fully accepted 69 in a public statement released on June 29, 2005.

The Commission's mission is, in part, "to ensure the most effective counter-proliferation capabilities of the United States and response to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] and the ongoing threat of terrorist activity."  With regard to Iraq, the commission was meant to "specifically examine the Intelligence Community's [[National Intelligence Estimate|intelligence prior]] to the initiation of Operation Iraqi Freedom and compare it with the findings of the [[Iraq Survey Group]] and other relevant agencies or organizations concerning the capabilities, intentions, and activities of Iraq relating to the design, development, manufacture, acquisition, possession, proliferation, transfer, testing, potential or threatened use, or use of Weapons of Mass Destruction and related means of delivery."

==Commission members==

Commission members are:

* [[Laurence Silberman]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], retired [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] [[US federal judge|judge]], [[U.S. Deputy Attoney General|Deputy Attorney General]] under Presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]], [[US Ambassador to Yugoslavia|Ambassador to Yugoslavia]], et al., co-Chairman
* [[Charles Robb]], [[Democratic Party (US)|Democrat]], former [[U.S. Senator]] from and [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] of [[Virginia]], co-Chairman
* [[John McCain]], Republican, U.S. Senator from [[Arizona]]
* [[Lloyd Cutler]], Democrat, former [[White House counsel]] to Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]].  Cutler changed status to "[[Of Counsel]]" shortly after the Commission formed.
* [[Patricia Wald]], Democrat, retired judge of the [[DC Court of Appeals]].
* [[Rick Levin]], then-President of [[Yale University]].
* Retired [[Admiral]] [[Bill Studeman]], former [[Deputy Director of the CIA]] and [[Director of the NSA]].
* [[Charles M. Vest]], former President of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]
* [[Henry Rowen|Henry S. Rowen]], former [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs]], Chairman of the [[National Intelligence Council]], and President of [[RAND]].

The first seven members of the panel were appointed on February 6, 2004, the date of the executive order which created it. The final two members, Vest and Rowen, were appointed on February 13.

Days before the American commission was announced, the government of the [[United Kingdom]], the U.S.'s primary ally during the [[2003 Iraq War|Iraq War]], announced a similar commission to investigate British intelligence, known as the [[Butler Inquiry]] or the Butler Review.

The commission was independent and separate from the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|9-11 Commission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1632">The '''It Came From Canada Archive''' was an online archive of rare, long-lost, and relatively unknown Canadian music, created by [[Beau Levitt]] and [[Kevin McGowan]] in 2007. 

An independent project, without any corporate or government funding, itcamefromcanada was created as a place for recording artists (or their families) and fans to find their old LP records online, listed with some biographical information, if any is available. 

The site featured many artists that may never have had any exposure outside of their own communities, or even outside of their own homes. Levitt and McGowan find these LPs on their travels across Canada, and document them as best they can, and offer MP3 samples so fans can hear their favourite old songs. 

The site was supported by many of the artists it has documented, and many provide additional biographical information to expand the articles.

The name of the It Came From Canada Archive was inspired by, but has no relation to, [[Og Music]]'s ''[[It Came from Canada]]'' compilations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2231">A '''jurat''' (through legal [[French language|French]] from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|juratum}}'', "sworn", from ''{{lang|la|jurare}}'', "to swear") is a clause at the foot of an [[affidavit]] showing when, where, and before whom the actual oath was sworn or affirmation was made.&lt;ref name="burrill"&gt;{{cite book |first= Alexander Mansfield |last= Burrill |title= A Law Dictionary and Glossary |edition= 2nd |chapter= jurat |location= New York |publisher=  Baker, Voorhis |year= 1867 |page= 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English and American law==
In English and American law, a jurat is that part of an [[affidavit]] which contains the names of the parties swearing the affidavit, the actual statement that an oath or affirmation has been made, the person before whom it was sworn, the date, place and other necessary particulars. The jurat is usually located on the bottom of a document. A typical form would be ''Sworn to before me this DD day of Month, 20__,'' with the signature of the witness, often a [[notary public]], the venue, and sometimes other particulars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Piombino |first= Alfred |title= Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for Vermont Notaries, Commissioners &amp; Justices of the Peace |year= 1996 |publisher= East Coast Publishing |isbn= 0-944560-97-0 |pages= 65–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Old forms of jurats ran as ''Juratum...die...coram...'', which then gave in English ''Sworn this...day of...before me''.&lt;REF name="burrill"/&gt;

Additionally, this term can be used for certain electronic forms, (such as electronically filed tax returns in certain states), where the taxpayer(s) attest to the truth of the information contained.  In the case of an electronically filed tax return, the taxpayer has to provide certain specific information—a social security number for example—to "sign" the jurat.  Having done this, the electronically submitted return is considered to have the same legal effect as if the taxpayer had actually and physically signed the return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irs.gov/irb/2005-14_IRB/ar10.html |title= Internal Revenue Bulletin:  2005-14 |date= April 4, 2005 |publisher= [[Internal Revenue Service]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Kidnapping}}

In [[criminal law]], '''kidnapping''' is the unlawful carrying away ([[asportation]]) and confinement of a person against their will.  Thus, it is a composite crime.  It can also be defined as false imprisonment by means of abduction, both of which are separate crimes that when committed simultaneously upon the same person merge as the single crime of kidnapping.  The asportation/abduction element is typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear.  That is, the perpetrator may use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle, but it is still kidnapping if the victim is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly, e.g.,  in the belief it is a taxicab.

Kidnapping may be done to demand for [[ransom]] in exchange for releasing the victim, or for other illegal purposes. Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping.&lt;ref name="kidnapping"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of kidnapping    |id=''Sources:'' [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/kidnapping Cornell University Law School.] [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/kidnap Cambridge English Dictionary.] [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/kidnapping English Oxford Living Dictionaries.] [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kidnap Merriam-Webster Dictionary] |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Named forms==
* [[Bride kidnapping]] is a term often applied loosely, to include any bride "abducted" against the will of her parents, even if she is willing to marry the "abductor". It still is traditional amongst certain [[nomad]]ic peoples of [[Central Asia]].  It has seen a resurgence in [[Kyrgyzstan]] since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the subsequent erosion of women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/more4/documentaries/doc-feature.jsp?id=6&amp;pageParam=2 |title=Bride Kidnapping - a Channel 4 documentary |publisher=Channel4.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Express kidnapping]] is a method of abduction used in some countries, mainly from [[Latin America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Garcia Jr |author2=Juan A. |url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_12/issue_14/business_05.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730214339/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_12/issue_14/business_05.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 30, 2007 |title=Express kidnappings |accessdate=December 7, 2006 |publisher=Thepanamanews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; where a small ransom, that a company or family can easily pay, is demanded.
* [[Tiger kidnapping]] is taking a [[hostage]] to make a loved one or associate of the victim do something: e.g. a child is taken hostage to force the shopkeeper to open the safe.  The term originates from the usually long preceding observation, like a tiger does on the prowl.

==By jurisdiction==

===Canada===
[[:wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Kidnapping and Unlawful Confinement|Kidnapping]] that does not result in a [[Murder (Canadian law)|homicide]] is a [[hybrid offence]] that comes with a maximum possible penalty of [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]] (18 months if tried summarily).  A murder that results from kidnapping is classified as 1st-degree, with a sentence of life imprisonment that results from conviction (the mandatory penalty for [[murder under Canadian law]]).

===Netherlands===
Article 282 prohibits hostaging (and 'kidnapping' is a kind of 'hostaging').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/TweedeBoek/TitelXVIII/Artikel282/geldigheidsdatum_25-12-2012|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|last=|first=|date=|website=wetten.overheid.nl|publisher=|language=Dutch|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part 1 of Article 282 allows sentencing kidnappers to maximum imprisonment of 8 years or a fine of the fifth category.&lt;ref name="c5"&gt;€ 78,000&lt;/ref&gt; Part 2 allows maximum imprisonment of 9 years or a fine of the fifth category&lt;ref name="c5" /&gt; if there are serious injuries. Part 3 allows maximum imprisonment of 12 years or a fine of the fifth category&lt;ref name="c5" /&gt; if the victim has been killed. Part 4 allows sentencing people that collaborate with kidnapping (such as proposing or make available a location where the victim hostaged). Part 1, 2 and 3 will apply also to them.

===United Kingdom===
Kidnapping is an [[Common law offence|offence under the common law]] of [[England and Wales]]. Lord Brandon said in 1984 R v D:&lt;ref&gt;The Law Reports. Lord Brandon: R v D [1984] AC 778, [1984] 3 WLR 186, [1984] 2 All ER 449, 79 Cr App R 313, [1984] Crim LR 558, [[House of Lords|HL]], reversing [1984] 2 WLR 112, [1984] 1 All ER 574, 78 Cr App R 219, [1984] Crim LR 103, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|First, the nature of the offence is an attack on, and infringement of, the personal liberty of an individual. Secondly, the offence contains four ingredients as follows: (1) the taking or carrying away of one person by another; (2) by [[Force (law)|force]] or [[fraud]]; (3) without the consent of the person so taken or carried away; and (4) without [[lawful excuse]].&lt;ref name="RvD"&gt;Lord Brandon: R v D [1984] AC 778 at 800, HL.

In all cases of kidnapping of children, where it is alleged that a child has been kidnapped, it is the absence of the consent of that child which is material. This is the case regardless of the age of the child. A very small child will not have the understanding or intelligence to consent. This means that absence of consent will be a necessary inference from the age of the child. It is a question of fact for the jury whether an older child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to consent.&lt;ref name="R v D 1984 AC 778, HL"&gt;R v D [1984] AC 778, HL&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Brandon said: "I should not expect a jury to find at all frequently that a child under fourteen had sufficient understanding and intelligence to give its consent."&lt;ref&gt;R v D [1984] AC 778 at 806, HL&lt;/ref&gt; If the child (being capable of doing so) did consent to being taken or carried away, the fact that the person having custody or care and control of that child did not consent to that child being taken or carried away is immaterial. If, on the other hand, the child did not consent, the consent of the person having custody or care and control of the child may support a defence of lawful excuse.&lt;ref name="R v D 1984 AC 778, HL"/&gt; It is known as [[Gillick competence]].&lt;ref&gt;For the Charging child abduction and kidnapping in the same indictment see: R v C [1991] 2 FLR 252, [1991] Fam Law 522, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Restriction on prosecution, no prosecution may be instituted, except by or with the consent of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], for an offence of kidnapping if it was committed against a child under the age of sixteen and by a person connected with the child, within the meaning of section 1 of the [[Child Abduction Act 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Child Abduction Act 1984]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/37/section/5 section 5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104185020/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/37/section/5 |date=January 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidnapping is an [[indictable-only offence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/kidnapping_false_imprisonment/ |title=Kidnapping - False Imprisonment:Offences against the Person: Sentencing Manual: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service |publisher=Cps.gov.uk |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112014642/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/kidnapping_false_imprisonment/ |archive-date=2012-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidnapping is punishable with imprisonment or fine at the discretion of the court.

A parent should only be prosecuted for kidnapping their own child "in exceptional cases, where the conduct of the parent concerned is so bad that an ordinary right-thinking person would immediately and without hesitation regard it as criminal in nature".&lt;ref name="R v D 1984 AC 778, HL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Times]] |title=The Law Explored: abduction and false imprisonment |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/columnists/article2316202.ece |author=Gary Slapper|date=23 August 2007 |location=London |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Kidnapping in the United States}}
Law in the United States follows from English common law. Following the highly publicized 1932 [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], [[US Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Federal Kidnapping Act]], which authorized the [[FBI]] to investigate kidnapping at a time when the Bureau was expanding in size and authority.  The fact that a kidnapped victim may have been taken across state lines brings the crime within the ambit of federal criminal law.

Most states recognize different types of kidnapping and punish accordingly. E.g. New York bases its definition of first-degree kidnapping on the duration and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law |edition=2nd|author=The Gale Group |year=2008 |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/kidnapping |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several deterrents to kidnapping in the United States of America. Among these are:

# The extreme logistical challenges involved in successfully exchanging the money for the return of the victim without being apprehended or surveiled.
# Harsh punishment. Convicted kidnappers face lengthy prison terms. If a victim is brought across state lines, federal charges can be laid as well.
# Good cooperation and information sharing between law enforcement agencies, and tools for spreading information to the public (such as the [[AMBER Alert]] system).

One notorious failed example of kidnap for ransom was the 1976 [[Chowchilla kidnapping|Chowchilla bus kidnapping]], in which 26 children were abducted with the intention of bringing in a $5-million ransom.

In the past, and presently in some parts of the world (such as southern [[Sudan]]), kidnapping is a common means used to obtain [[slavery|slave]]s and money through ransom. In less recent times, kidnapping in the form of [[shanghai (verb)|shanghai]]ing (or "[[Impressment|pressganging]]") men was used to supply merchant ships in the 19th century with [[sailor]]s, whom the law considered [[unfree labour]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''LGBT''', or '''GLBT''', is an [[initialism]] that stands for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]]. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism '''LGB''', which was used to replace the term ''gay'' in reference to the LGBT [[LGBT community|community]] beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Acronyms, Initialisms &amp; Abbreviations Dictionary,'' Volume 1, Part 1.

Lesbians who held the [[essentialism|essentialist]] view, that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor "lesbian" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1991), p. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Bisexual and transgender people also sought recognition as legitimate categories within the larger minority community.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"&gt;{{cite web | last=Swain | first=Keith W. | title=Gay Pride Needs New Direction | publisher=[[Denver Post]] | date=21 June 2007 |url = http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6198394?source=rss |accessdate= 2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elation of change following group action in the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leli |first=Ubaldo |first2=Jack | last2=Drescher |title=Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician's Guide |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2005|isbn= 0-7890-2576-0|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJryCzrZmYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first= Jonathan |first2=Karen |last2=Yescavage |title= Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of The Others |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004|isbn= 1-56023-287-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SOe4igsrbgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{like whom|date=September 2018}} said that transgender people were acting out [[stereotypes]] and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to [[coming out|come out]] and be honest about their identity.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"/&gt; Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other [[gender]] and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.&lt;ref name="Exhibition Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalgraphics.org/out-of-the-closet |website=[[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]]|accessdate=1 October 2016|title=Out of the Closet and Into the Streets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1988, activists began to use the initialism LGBT in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PiglAQAAIAAJ Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting], American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people gain equal respect .&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term ''LGBT'' has been a positive symbol of inclusion.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shankle |first=Michael D. |title=The Handbook of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Public Health: A Practitioner's Guide To Service |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2006|isbn= 1-56023-496-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUUyLSKD5voC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;

Despite the fact that ''LGBT'' does not nominally encompass all individuals in smaller communities (see Variants below), the term is generally accepted to include those not specifically identified in the four-letter initialism.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; Overall, the use of the term ''LGBT'' has, over time, largely aided in bringing otherwise marginalized individuals into the general community.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; Transgender actress [[Candis Cayne]] in 2009 described the LGBT community "the last great minority", noting that "We can still be harassed openly" and be "called out on television".&lt;ref name="Advocate 2009-03"&gt;{{cite news|title=I Advocate...|date=March 2009|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|publisher=Issue #1024|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to years of lobbying from users and LGBT groups to eliminate discrimination, the online social networking service [[Facebook]], in February 2014, widened its choice of gender variants for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/13/transgender-facebook-expands-gender-options |title=Facebook expands gender options: transgender activists hail 'big advance' | date=14 February 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/02/14/confused-by-facebooks-new-gender-options-heres-what-they-mean/ |title=Confused by Facebook's new gender options?

In 2016, [[GLAAD]]'s Media Reference Guide states that ''LGBTQ'' is the preferred initialism, being more inclusive of younger members of the communities who embrace ''[[queer]]'' as a self-descriptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=Expanding the Acronym: GLAAD Adds the Q to LGBT|url=http://www.advocate.com/media/2016/10/26/expanding-acronym-glaad-adds-q-lgbt|publisher=Advocate|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many variants exist including variations that change the order of the letters; ''LGBT'' or ''GLBT'' are the most common terms.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; Although identical in meaning, ''LGBT'' may have a more [[feminist]] connotation than ''GLBT'' as it places the "L" (for "lesbian") first.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; ''LGBT'' may also include additional Qs for "[[queer]]" or "[[questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]]" (sometimes abbreviated with a question mark and sometimes used to mean anybody not literally L, G, B or T)  producing the variants "LGBTQ" and "LGBTQQ"".&lt;ref name="In-Between Bodies"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bloodsworth-Lugo | first=Mary K. | title=In-Between Bodies: Sexual Difference, Race, and Sexuality | publisher=SUNY Press | year=2007|isbn= 0-7914-7221-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ph74JKY_5dwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girls' Violence"&gt;{{cite book | last=Alder | first=Christine | first2=Anne |last2=Worrall | title=Girls' Violence: Myths and Realities | publisher=SUNY Press | year=2004|isbn=0-7914-6110-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O0ye93mW0eUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocacy Research in "&gt;{{cite book | last=Cherland | first=Meredith Rogers | first2= Helen J. |last2=Harper | title=Advocacy Research in Literacy Education: Seeking Higher Ground | publisher=Routledge | year=2007|isbn= 0-8058-5056-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ct_5Cf1aH0kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, it is sometimes stylized as "LGB&amp;T",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender couples urged to research honeymoon destinations|url=http://ilga.org/lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-couples-urged-research-honeymoon-destinations/ |accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National LGB&amp;T Partnership|url=http://lgbt.foundation/policy-research/The-National-LGB-T-Partnership/|publisher=The National LGB&amp;T Partnership|accessdate=14 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525203730/http://lgbt.foundation/policy-research/The-National-LGB-T-Partnership/|archivedate=25 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] uses the term ''LGBTIQ'' in its manifesto and official publications.&lt;ref name=LGBTIQGreens&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lgbtiq-greens.greenparty.org.uk/ |title=Green Party LGBT Group Website |publisher=Lgbtiq-greens.greenparty.org.uk |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EqualityForAll&gt;{{cite web|title=EQUALITY FOR ALL|url=https://www.greenparty.org.uk/resources/LGBTIQ_Manifesto_v4%20FINAL.pdf |publisher=Green Party of England and Wales|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PinkNewsLGBTIQGreen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Nick|title=Green Party wants every teacher to be trained to teach LGBTIQ issues |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/05/01/green-party-wants-every-teacher-to-be-trained-to-teach-lgbtiq-issues/ |accessdate=3 May 2015 |work=[[PinkNews]] |date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[pansexual]]'', ''omnisexual'', ''fluid'' and ''queer-identified'' are regarded as falling under the umbrella term ''bisexual'' (and therefore are considered a part of the [[bisexual community]]).

In Canada, the community is identified as LGBTQ2S- Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Two Spirit.

=== Transgender inclusion ===
The gender identity "transgender" has been recategorized to trans* by some groups, where trans (without the asterisk) has been used to describe [[trans men]] and [[trans women]], while trans* covers all non-cisgender ([[genderqueer]]) identities, including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, [[genderfuck]], genderless, [[agender]], non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit, [[bigender]], and trans man and trans woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/01/10/trans_what_does_it_mean_and_where_did_it_come_from.html |title=What Does Trans* Mean, and Where Did It Come From?' | first=Hugh|last= Ryan| date=10 January 2014 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vadenprd.stanford.edu/special-topics/lgbtq-health/glossary |title=Glossary of Transgender Terms |date=14 February 2014 |work=Vaden Health Center Stanford University |accessdate=21 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521105407/http://vadenprd.stanford.edu/special-topics/lgbtq-health/glossary |archivedate=21 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the term ''transsexual'' commonly falls under the umbrella term ''transgender'', but some transsexual people object to this.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt;

=== Other variants ===

Writing in the [[BBC News Magazine]] in 2014, [[Julie Bindel]] questions whether the various gender groupings now, "bracketed together" ... "share the same issues, values and goals?"  Bindel refers to a number of possible new initialisms for differing combinations and concludes that it may be time for the alliances to be reformed or finally go "our separate ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28130472|title=Viewpoint: Should gay men and lesbians be bracketed together?|author=[[Julie Bindel]]|date=2 July 2014|work=[[BBC News Magazine]]|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Chat''''' ([[French language|French]] for "the [[cat]]") was a Belgian daily comic strip, created by [[Philippe Geluck]] and published in the newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' from March 22, 1983 until March 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/948/Kunst-Literatuur/article/detail/1564937/2013/01/19/De-Kat-verdwijnt-na-dertig-jaar-uit-Waalse-kranten.dhtml|title='De Kat' verdwijnt na dertig jaar uit Waalse kranten|website=Hln.be|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its run it quickly became one of the bestselling [[Franco-Belgian comics]] series and the [[mascot]] of ''[[Le Soir]]''. While virtually an icon in [[Wallonia]] he's far less well known in [[Flanders]].

==Concept==
''Le Chat'' is an adult, human-sized obese, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cat who typically wears a suit. He always has the same physical expression. He often comes up with elaborate reasonings which lead to hilariously absurd conclusions e.g. by taking metaphors literally or by adding increasingly unlikely ''what-ifs'' to ordinary situations.

One page in length, it appeared weekly in the "Victor" supplement of Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]''. For Le Chat's 20th anniversary in 2003, Le Soir allowed Geluck to illustrate that day's entire newspaper. An exhibition of Le Chat's history (and that of his creator), "Le Chat s'expose", was first held at the Autoworld Motor Museum in Brussels in Spring 2004, and has since toured Europe. In March–October 2006 it even appeared at Les Champs Libres in [[Rennes]].

==In popular culture==
As part of the [[Brussels' Comic Book Route]] a wall in the Zuidlaan/Boulevard du Midi in [[Brussels]] was dedicated to "Le Chat"&lt;ref&gt;[http://jawwalchat.com] {{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1993.

On October 11, 2008 Le Chat received his own market place in [[Hotton]] in the Belgian province Luxembourg. A statue of him, sculpted by François Deboucq, was placed in the center, depicting him holding an umbrella which rains water down from inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotton.be/commune/autres-services/citoyennete/une-place-du-chat-a-hotton|title=Une Place du Chat à Hotton — Commune de Hotton|website=Hotton.be|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2015 it was announced that "Le Chat" would receive his own museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.francais/magazine/1.2382131|title=Le Chat de Geluck aura son musée à Bruxelles|website=Deredactie.be|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7544">[[File:Cy Young HOF plaque.jpg|right|thumb|Cy Young, the all-time leader in innings pitched]]
In [[baseball]], [[innings pitched]] (IP) are the number of [[inning]]s a [[pitcher]] has completed, measured by the number of [[Batter (baseball)|batter]]s and [[baserunner]]s that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game.  Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched.  One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning.

This is a list of the top 100 [[Major League Baseball]] pitchers who have accumulated the most innings pitched of all time.

Cy Young is the all-time leader in innings pitched with 7,356, and the only pitcher to throw more than 7,000 innings. Pud Gavin is the only other pitcher in MLB history to throw more than 6,000 innings.

These mythological monarchs supposedly ruled Fib, the reigns of these monarchs are mostly legendary and begin in the 7th century BCE with king Fib.

'''Luther Jacob Goodall''' (December 30, 1924 &amp;ndash; February 21, 1972) was an American professional football player and wrestler, known by his ringname '''Luther Lindsay''' or '''Lindsey''', who competed throughout the [[United States]] with the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] as well as international promotions such as [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], Joint Promotions and [[Stampede Wrestling]].

One of the first [[African American]] wrestlers to become a major star,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=B5BF374A-88C0-41ED-A732FB5B91606D73 |title=The Wrestling Gospel According to Mike Mooneyham - Rufus R.

For much of the early 1950s and '60s, Lindsay was billed as the U.S. Colored (or Negro) Heavyweight Champion and took part in the first interracial professional wrestling matches held in the United States. Between 1953 and 1956, he faced [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lou Thesz]] in a series of matches. Although largely resulting in time limit draws, he was the first African-American to make a challenge to the title and earned Thesz's respect during these bouts publicly praising his wrestling ability.

He was considered one of the top submission wrestlers of his day working with [[Don Leo Jonathan]] and [[Stu Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/jonathan.html |title=SLAM! Wrestling Hall of Fame: Don Leo Jonathan |accessdate= |date=2008-01-12 |publisher=SLAM! Sports }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay was one of the few men who bested him in the infamous "[[Hart Dungeon]]" and later became one of Hart's best friends. Hart reportedly carried a picture of him in his wallet until his death.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Heath. ''Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling''. Toronto: CanWest Books, 2005. (pg. 66) {{ISBN|0-9736719-8-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was held in high regard by his fellow wrestlers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchsavage.com/dutchanswers2.html |title=Dutch's Answers, Page 2 |accessdate= |author=Savage, Dutch |authorlink=Dutch Savage |year=2003 |publisher=DutchSavage.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Lou Thesz, [[James J.

==Career==

===Early career===
Luther Goodall was born on a farm outside [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on December 30, 1924. He moved to [[Sedalia, North Carolina|Sedalia]] but later resided in [[Gibsonville, North Carolina]]&lt;ref name="LegacyofWrestling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/Wrestlers_G-N.html |title=Lindsey, Luther |accessdate= |author=Hornbaker, Tim |year=2007 |work=Wrestlers - Last Names Beginning with G-N |publisher=LegacyOfWrestling.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later played college football for [[Norfolk State University|Norfolk State]]&lt;ref name="Daily Times-News"&gt;''"Wrestler Luther Lindsey Is Dead"''. &lt;u&gt;Daily Times-News.&lt;/u&gt; 23 Feb 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and nearby [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]] where he was also a [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association|CIAA]] wrestling champion. Although excelling in athletics as an All-American Negro [[Tackle (American and Canadian football)|tackle]]-[[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]], state [[Racial segregation|segregation]] laws prohibited him from playing against white athletes.&lt;ref name="Chappell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Resource_Center/interviews/jacobs/jacobs03.htm |title=The Abe Jacobs Interview |accessdate= |author=Chappell, David |year=2005 |work=Mid-Atlantic Gateway Interviews |publisher=MidAtlanticGateway.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217213351/http://midatlanticgateway.com/Resource_Center/interviews/jacobs/jacobs03.htm |archivedate=2010-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played two years of professional football in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] for the [[Canadian Football League]].&lt;ref name="LegacyofWrestling"/&gt; Lindsey began wrestling professionally making his debut in 1950 or 1951. Taking the surname of his wife, Gertrude Lindsey,&lt;ref name="LegacyofWrestling"/&gt; his earliest recorded match was against Al Tucker in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] for promoter Leonard Schwartz on November 21, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/Results_-_Chicago_1951.html |title=Chicago Wrestling Results - 1951 |accessdate= |author=Hornbaker, Tim |year=2007 |publisher=LegacyOfWrestling.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1953, Lindsay was billed as the U.S. Colored or Negro Heavyweight Champion. He was one of the few African-Americans in professional wrestling and, in accordance with state segregation laws at the time, he was only allowed to travel with and compete against other African-American wrestlers during his early career.&lt;ref name="Thatcher"/&gt; One of his most frequent opponents was [[Shag Thomas]] who he later claimed knew better than any other opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingperspective.com/blacklikeme.html |title=Black Like Me |accessdate= |authors=Phantom of the Ring, Paul MacArthur, David Skolnick, ed. |year=2000 |publisher=''Wrestling Perspective'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1950s, he became the first African-American south of [[Washington, D.C.]] to compete in a wrestling event when he faced [[Ron Wright (wrestler)|Ron Wright]] in [[Kingsport, Tennessee]]. Although the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] was brought in amid fears of [[race riot|rioting]], the crowd unexpectedly favored Lindsay against Wright. As a result of Lindsay's success in the area, other African-American wrestlers were also brought into the area such as [[Bearcat Wright]] and [[Bobcat Brown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Interviews/ronwright-2.htm |title=KM Interviews... Ron Wright |accessdate= |author=Webber, Steve |authorlink= |author2=Ron Gott  |date=2002-11-11 |work= |publisher=KayfabeMemories.com |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Northwest Wrestling===
In early 1953, he appeared in Washington where he faced [[George Dusette]], the [[Masked Marvel (wrestler)|Masked Marvel]], [[Carl Engstrom]], [[Walter Kameroff]], [[Jack Kiser (wrestler)|Jack Kiser]], [[Bronko Lubich]], [[Axel Cadier]]. He was involved in a battle royal which included Kiser, Lubich, Cadier, [[Bud Rattal]] and [[Paul DeGalles]] in [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] on May 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/Nos.011-020.html |title=Washington State Results, Parings - 1953 |accessdate= |year=2003 |work=The WAWLI Papers #012 |publisher=WrestlingClassics.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, he faced [[Lou Thesz]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and the two fought to a time limit draw. This was the first of several meetings between the two champions and the first time the title was defended against an African-American opponent. A rematch one week later in Tacoma also resulted in a draw.&lt;ref name="NWA1953"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/nwa/world/nwa-h-matches/nwa-h-matches1952.html |title=Records of N.W.A. World Heavyweight Championship Matches: 1952-53 |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |year=2003 |work= |publisher=Puroresu Dojo |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, Lindsay defeated [[Bronko Nagurski]] in a best 2-of-3 match during the main event at the [[Tacoma Armory]]. Nagurski had pinned him after a series of [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|flying tackles]] and a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Body press|full body press]], however Lindsay recovered to score the second fall after making Nagurski submit to a [[neckbreaker]]. Lindsay was eventually awarded the match when referee Freddie Steele disqualified Nagurski after refusing to break a hold. According to promoter [[Paavo Ketonen]], the winner was to receive a title shot against Lou Thesz for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

He was one of several wrestlers who challenged the [[Seattle Ramblers]] to a football game known as the "Muscle Bowl" at [[Lincoln High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Lincoln Bowl]] on October 11. The event was attended by 7,265 fans and was successful in raising as much as $5,000 for the Associated Boys' Clubs of the Tacoma-area. Among the wrestlers who participated, a half-dozen were former [[college football|collegiate football]] stars including Lindsay, [[Pepper Gomez]] and [[Frank Stojack]]. Bronko Nagurski also participated in a dozen plays. Other wrestlers included Ivan Kameroff, the Masked Marvel, Dr. John Gallagher, The Ram, Abe Yourist and Glen Detton. Despite the addition of several players loaned by the Seattle Ramblers, most notably Mel Light, they lost the game 20-6. Lindsay injured his right [[Little finger|pinky finger]] during the game, however the wrestlers later celebrated at Steve's Restaurant.

On October 16, he took part in a 7-man battle royal involving Don Kindred, Bronko Nagurski, Dale Kiser, "Red" Vagnone, Jack O’Reilly, Jack Kiser and the eventual winner Carl Engstrom. Lindsay was the fifth man eliminated in the battle royal and, that same night, fought Jack O’Reilly to a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/REDUXNos.51-60.html |title=Nagurski To Appear Here |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |year=2003 |work=WAWLI Redux No. 55-56 |publisher=WrestlingClassics.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407190620/http://www.wrestlingclassics.com/wawli/REDUXNos.51-60.html |archivedate=2003-04-07 |dead-url=yes |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He faced Lou Thesz again in a series of matches during late-November. Their first meeting in Tacoma, on November 24, resulted in another draw however he lost to Thesz in Tacoma on November 27 and in Eugene the next night.&lt;ref name="NWA1953"/&gt;

On January 10, he won his first major title winning the vacant [[NWA Hawaii Tag Team Championship]] with [[Bobby Burns]] in Honolulu. He faced Thesz again the following spring where they fought to another draw in Portland on April 29 and Seattle on April 1, 1954. On April 9, he lost to Thesz via disqualification in Yakima.&lt;ref name="NWA1954"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/nwa/world/nwa-h-matches/nwa-h-matches1954.html |title=Records of N.W.A. World Heavyweight Championship Matches: 1954-55 |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher=Puroresu Dojo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, he toured Northern Ontario with [[Ricky Waldo]] and [[Jim Mitchell (wrestler)|The Black Panther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/04/26/1014103.html |title=Northland Wrestling: The Golden Decade |accessdate= |author=Howard, Gary |date=2005-06-01 |publisher=SLAM! Sports }}&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Jack Claybourne]] won the NWA Canadian Open Tag Team titles from [[Harold Sakata|Tosh Togo]] &amp; [[Pat Fraley]] (substituting for [[Kazuo Okamura|Great Togo]]) in Toronto on September 28. Later that year, he wrestled for promoter [[Ed Don George]] making occasional appearances at [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]] where he faced [[Johnny Molinda]], [[Danno O'Shocker]] and [[Danny Malone]] during the next two months.&lt;ref name="Buffalo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steelbeltwrestling.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Buffalo - 1954 |accessdate= |author=Luce, Don |date=2006-04-30 |publisher=SteelBeltWrestling.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They lost the titles to [[Ivan Kalmikoff|Ivan]] &amp; [[Karol Kalmikoff]] in Toronto on December 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garywill.com/toronto/title-ctt.htm |title=Title History: Canadian Open Tag Team Title |accessdate= |author=Will, Gary |authorlink= |work=Gary Will's Toronto Wrestling History |publisher=GaryWill.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213142631/http://www.garywill.com/toronto/title-ctt.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2012 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following night he fought Danno O'Shocker to a draw at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. This was his last match in the Buffalo area.&lt;ref name="Buffalo"/&gt;

During the summer of 1955, he and George Dusette won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship from [[Bulldog Curtis]] &amp; [[Tommy Martinez]] on May 15. While still defending the tag team titles, he fought Lou Thesz to another draw in Portland on June 8.&lt;ref name="NWA1954"/&gt; He and Dusette eventually lost the titles to [[Doug Donovan]] &amp; Ivan Kameroff on June 11.&lt;ref name="Gamble"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/27872/Official-411-Wrestling-Almanac-For-June-(Part-1).htm |title=Official 411 Wrestling Almanac For June (Part 1) |accessdate= |author=Gamble, Ron |date=2003-06-03|publisher=411mania.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NWA Texas===
Later that year, Lindsay was brought to Texas by promoter [[Morris Sigel]]. As the state began complying with national de-segregation laws, Sigel promoted the first interracial wrestling match in the state pitting Lindsay against [[Hisao Tanaka|Duke Keomuka]] in one of the biggest matches of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/story4.htm |title=Chapters 19-20: The Fifties |accessdate= |author=Hess, Jason |date=2002-06-23 |work=Archived Sunday Punch Columns |publisher=[[Cauliflower Alley Club]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919145320/http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/story4.htm |archivedate=2008-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay would also face Lou Thesz in Dallas on September 20, 1955 in yet another draw.&lt;ref name="NWA1954"/&gt;

In January 1956, he entered the [[Dallas]]-[[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] area then promoted by [[Ed McLemore]]. On January 10, he faced Duke Keomuka in a best 2-of-3 falls match at [[Dallas Sportatorium|The Sportatorium]]. Although taking the first pinfall, Keomuka pinned Lindsay with the help of outside interference by [[Tiny Mills]]. When referee Roy Carter was knocked unconscious outside the ring, wrestler [[Danny McShain]] made the count after Lindsay pinned Keomuka. Although controversial, the third fall was granted to Lindsay by referee decision.

A week later, Lindsay met Keomuka in a best 3-of-5 falls match which stipulated that their cornermen, Danny McShain and Tiny Mills, were to be locked in cages to prevent outside interference. However, both men broke out of their cages during the match and began brawling in the ring. The four men were broken up by referees Ray Gunkel and [[Otto Kuss]] who were forced to declare a no-contest. Later during the main event between McShain and Mills, Lindsay appeared to help McShain in his match. He and McShain later took on Duke Keomuka &amp; Tiny Mills for the [[WCWA Texas Tag Team Championship|NWA Texas Tag Team Championship]] in a best-of-3 falls match at The Sportatorium on January 24. He and McShain lost the third fall by disqualification when Lindsay threw Mills over the top rope.

He returned to the area four months later teaming with [[Pepper Gomez]] in a best 2-of-3 falls match against [[Michael DiBiase|"Iron" Mike DiBiase]] and [[Danny Plechas]] as one of a series of matches for the vacant NWA Texas Tag Team titles on May 22. Plechas pinned Gomez for the third fall and, despite an argument for the match to be awarded to Gomez and Lindsay, Mike DiBiase and Danny Plechas were declared the winners.

Both teams claimed the title however and a rematch was scheduled several days later. He and Gomez were forced to forfeit the match when Lindsay injured his leg during the match. Both Lindsay and Gomez faced Mike and Danny Plechas in singles matches later that night. Lindsay defeated Danny Plechas via disqualification when his partner interfered. Gomez lost his bout with Mike DiBiase when he was counted out.

He was scheduled to face Duke Keomuka in the opening rounds of a tournament to meet NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz. However, reportedly flying in from Canada, his plane was grounded due to bad weather and was substituted by Tex Brady. Defeating Duke Keomuka on December 11, Lindsay earned a title shot at then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz. In his tenth meeting with Thesz, the two met in a best 2-of-3 falls match at The Sportatorium on December 18. Thesz scored the first pinfall and, while Lindsay rallied to take the second, Thesz took the third fall for the victory. According to ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', Lindsay posted a $5,000 guarantee to face Thesz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/Results_-_Dallas56.html |title=Dallas Wrestling Results - 1956 |accessdate= |author=Hornbaker, Tim |publisher=LegacyOfWrestling.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; He again met Thesz in Houston where they fought to another draw on January 20.

===From Honolulu to Portland===
During a brief stint in [[50th State Big Time Wrestling]], he enjoyed a brief reign as [[NWA Hawaii United States Heavyweight Champion]] before losing the title back to [[Curtis P. Iaukea|King Curtis Iaukea]] in June 1964. On July 28, 1964, Lindsay was part of an 18-man battle royal which featured [[Gene Kiniski]], [[Harold Sakata|Tosh Togo]], [[Tor Kamata|Mr. Moto]] and King Curtis Iaukea. This event was later aired on the first episode of ''Big Time Wrestling'', a weekly television show which broadcast the first wrestling matches from the [[Honolulu International Center]], and was attended by over 14,000 fans (5,300 of these watched the event live at the Civic Auditorium). The following night, he appeared in the main event against King Curtis Iaukea for the [[NWA Pacific International Championship|NWA Hawaii United States Championship]] which sold out the Civic Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.50thstatebigtimewrestling.com/history2.html |title=The History of Pro-Wrestling in Hawaii |accessdate= |author=Atkinson, Bill |year=2007 |publisher=50thStateBigTimeWrestling.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling===
Lindsay joined a number of other African-American wrestlers in the Mid-Atlantic territory for promoter [[Jim Crockett]] and, during a televised match at the television studio in late 1966, an incident between Lindsey and [[Ike Eakins]] caused [[WDBJ]] to cancel Crockett's weekly television show ''All Star Wrestling''. Eakins reportedly used a racial slur about Lindsay.  Management at WDBJ said if Eakins didn't apologize on the air the next week, they would throw the show off the air. Reportedly Eakins came out and instead of apologizing, he used the slur again and that was the last wrestling show recorded at WDBJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Almanac/tv_history/tv_studios/wdbj/studio_wdbj.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303230027/http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Almanac/tv_history/tv_studios/wdbj/studio_wdbj.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-03-03 |title=WDBJ Studio Wrestling: Television History on the Mid-Atlantic Gateway |accessdate= |authors=Dick Boune, Thom Brewer, Carroll Hall |year=2006 |work=Studio Wrestling: A Guide to TV Studios that were home for Wrestling in the Mid-Atlantic Area |publisher=MidAtlanticGateway.com |pages= |language= |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lindsay remained in the promotion defeating [[Pedro Godoy]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] on January 31, 1967.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lukebrown.freeservers.com/whats_new.html |title=Match Results: 1959-1971 |accessdate= |author=Kerby, Carl |authorlink= |year=2003 |work= |publisher=LukeBrown.com |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Lindsay scored a string of victories the following spring defeating Art Nelson, Bill Bowman, Bobby Paul, Frank Morrell and Johnny Heidman within a six-week period. Despite losing a rematch to Frank Morrell in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] on February 11, he and Frank Hester defeated Joe Soto and Tony Romano in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] the following week. On the night of February 21, 1972, Lindsay was facing local wrestler Bobby Paul at [[Grady Cole Center|Park Center]] in Charlotte. After only ten minutes into the match, Lindsay pinned his opponent with a diving belly-flop. He apparently suffered a fatal heart attack when he made the pin and died on top of his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dory-funk.com/kay-fabe.html |title=Old School Wrestling Stories |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |year=2007 |work= |publisher=Dory-Funk.com |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lindsay did not respond to the referee after scoring the pinfall, the police were called.&lt;ref name="Daily Times-News"/&gt; Lindsay was taken back to the dressing room where he was declared dead shortly thereafter. His body was kept at his old alma mater, [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]], for a week before his burial.&lt;ref name="Chappell"/&gt; His funeral was attended by several well-known wrestlers including [[Les Thatcher]] who was one of the pallbearers.&lt;ref name="Thatcher"/&gt;

==Structure==
The encyclopaedia was published in 23 volumes. The first five volumes are introductory, and consist of a series of lengthy articles on various sociological and historical subjects. They are titled as follows:
* Volume 1:'' Hindustan ani Jaga'' (हिंदुस्तान अाणि जग, India and the World)
* Volume 2: ''Vedavidya'' (वेदविद्या, Vedic Knowledge)
* Volume 3: ''Buddhapurva Jaga'' (बुद्धपूर्व जग, The World Before Buddha)

'''Mil Máscaras''' (born '''Aaron Rodríguez Arellano''', July 15, 1942) is a Mexican ''[[Lucha libre|luchador]]''.

Máscaras is one of the original "Big Three" of the [[lucha libre]] tradition in Mexico (the other two being [[El Santo]] and [[Blue Demon]]). He is considered one of the most influential wrestlers of all time for enhancing and popularizing the lucha libre style around the world both in the ring and as the star of 20 films. He is also an accomplished artist and cultural ambassador from his native country and has appeared on three of its postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Filmfax|pages=48–52|issue=1|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of one of Mexico's most prominent wrestling families—his brothers José and Pablo respectively wrestle as [[Dos Caras]] and [[Sicodelico|Sicodélico]], José's older son Alberto wrestles as [[Alberto El Patron]], José's younger son Guillermo wrestles as [[El Hijo de Dos Caras]] (an identity that Alberto had once used), and Pablo's son Aaron is better known as [[Sicodelico, Jr.]]. Máscaras was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2010, and the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2012. His ring name is Spanish for "'''Thousand Masks'''".

==Professional wrestling career==
[[File:Mil Mascaras vs El Canek.jpg|thumb|left|Mascaras wrestling one of his greatest rivals, [[Canek (wrestler)|Canek]], in 2009]]
Mil Máscaras made his professional wrestling debut in April 1965 in [[Guadalajara]]. Máscaras became popular in Mexico for being one of the best conditioned luchadores in the heavyweight division, which was dominated by foreigners at the time.&lt;ref name=MondoMil&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=Mil Mascaras|pages=93–99|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also his size which permitted him to wrestle in the US and Japan under the heavyweight division. Máscaras was one of the first masked luchadores outside of Mexico to play a non-[[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] role. He rarely resorted to rule breaking, instead relying on his repertoire of moves and counter-moves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puroresu.com/wrestlers/mascaras/ Mil Mascaras]&lt;/ref&gt; Máscaras was also one of the first wrestlers to introduce the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|high-flying moves]] of lucha libre, such as the [[plancha]] and [[Suicide Dive|tope suicida]], to Japanese fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puroresudojo.com/articles/sayama-mascaras.html Interview: Mil Mascaras and Satoru Sayama]&lt;/ref&gt; This brought him international fame as one of the first high-flyers, something he was not considered in Mexico where he fell under the mat-power category.

Máscaras made his international wrestling debut in 1968 at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium|Olympic Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles]], getting involved in [[feud (professional wrestling)|rivalries]] against the likes of [[Ernie Ladd]], [[John Tolos]], [[Black Gordman]] and [[The Great Goliath|Goliath]]. In [[Mexico City]], he unmasked [[El Halcon]] in a triangular tournament that included [[Alfonso Dantés]] in the 1970s.  Owing to the limited spread of news at the time, he repeated the feat in a Japanese ring, winning by submission.

Máscaras performed for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) during the '70s. In his Japanese debut on February 19, 1971, he defeated [[Kantaro Hoshino]] in [[Tokyo]]. It was during this time that he had his best known international feud with American masked wrestler [[Dick Beyer|The Destroyer]]. During the '70s, Máscaras also had feuds with Mexican wrestlers such as TNT, [[Canek (wrestler)|Canek]], El Halcon, and [[Angel Blanco]]. These feuds took place mostly in Mexico and the US, and were broadcast on [[Spanish language]] stations in the U.S. Máscaras was also the heavyweight champion of the IWA wrestling promotion, which was founded by [[Eddie Einhorn]], and still holds the title to this day.

In 1974, Máscaras was World Champion for a short-lived but very exciting promotion, the [[International Wrestling Association (1970s)|International Wrestling Association]], which promoted in the New York City area.  He had major title defenses at Roosevelt Stadium, in Jersey City, NJ, against top competitors such as Ivan Koloff and Ernie Ladd.

Mil Máscaras appeared in [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now called WWE). He performed at [[Madison Square Garden]] several times after a ban on masked wrestlers was lifted for him, making him the first masked wrestler in the Garden, he defeated [[Don Jardine|The Spoiler]] (who was not permitted to wear his mask). During this time, he feuded with [[Superstar Billy Graham]] over the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]].

[[File:Mil mascaras.jpg|thumb|Mil Máscaras in one of his more colorful outfits]]
Máscaras made many appearances during the 80s and the 90s at the [[World Wrestling Council]] in Puerto Rico.

Máscaras also wrestled in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), where his most notable match was a match with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout|Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout]]'' on February 6, 1990 in the [[Memorial Coliseum (Corpus Christi)|Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.169)&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 1991, at the age of 49, Máscaras won his final title, the WWA (Mexico) World Heavyweight Championship. He held the title until 1994 and assumed a state of semi-retirement after his final reign.&lt;ref name=semiretirement&gt;Slagle, Steve. [http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/mascarasbio.html Photos &amp; Bios – Mil Máscaras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401165734/http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/mascarasbio.html |date=2009-04-01 }} WrestlingMuseum.com (2000). Retrieved December 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Máscaras' first American [[pay-per-view]] appearance was competing in [[WWE|WWF]]'s [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 ''Royal Rumble'']] match. He eliminated himself, diving off the top rope out of the ring onto [[Pierroth, Jr.]], whom he himself had just eliminated. Such a move is common in lucha libre but it is technically a mistake in the Royal Rumble as it leads to elimination.

On December 5, 2002, Máscaras defeated [[Manny Fernandez (wrestler)|Manny Fernandez]] at the inaugural show for Legacy Wrestling Enterprises in Fort Worth, TX. On July 25, Mascaras celebrated his 50th in-ring anniversary to the day by teaming with his brother Sicodelico and his nephew El Hijo De Dos Caras to face one of his greatest rivals, Canek, along with Negro Navarro and Rey Bucanero in a special six man tag.

===Film career===
Máscaras also starred in a series of 20 [[Lucha film|luchador action films]] beginning with his self-titled debut in 1966 at age 24. In 1966, Mexican movie producer [[Luis Enrique Vergara]] was looking for a new "enmascarado" to star in his wrestling/horror movies which were then the rage of Mexican cinema. Mil Máscaras was the first Lucha Libre personality that was created specifically to be a movie star, since his whole persona and flashy look was designed initially for the movies. (His real life wrestling career grew out of the excitement generated by his film appearances.)

[[File:Mil Mascaras en Morbido 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Máscaras at a red carpet event]]
Vergara's two regular movie stars had suddenly become unavailable. [[El Santo|Santo]] had walked out on him over a contract dispute, and [[Blue Demon]] was injured unexpectedly and would require a prolonged time-out. Not wanting to stop making his successful cinematic quickies, Vergara decided to transform Lucha Libre newcomer Mil Máscaras as the star of his next two movies. Mil began a movie career that has continued to this day, appearing in a total of 20 Mexican horror/wrestling/action films.

The first film, simply entitled ''Mil Mascaras'' (1966) was shot in black &amp; white, and made Mil out to be a sort of super-hero. The film gave Mil Máscaras a comic book-style origin story, which seems to have been somewhat swiped from the then-popular ''[[Doc Savage]]'' pulp novels that were selling very well in science-fiction bookstores in the mid-60's. According to the script, Mil was an infant who was found clutched in his dead mother's arms in a war-torn area of Europe during World War 2 and was sent to an orphanage. A group of scientists (not affiliated with any particular country) adopts the boy, secretly using him as a guinea pig, subjecting the child to an intensive regimen of physical exercise and mental training as he matures.

When he reaches adulthood, Mil is something of a superman (although without actual super powers); both his mind and his body have been developed to perfection. The scientists then send him out into the world to help downtrodden people everywhere, to fight criminals and to right wrongs, and just basically help make the world a better place.

The plots of the first two films were rather lackluster. In both ''Mil Mascaras'' (1966) and its sequel ''Los Canallas'' (also 1966), Mil gets to fight a rather ordinary gang of thugs and a crooked fight promoter who are bullying the locals in some backwater burg in Mexico. Mil's second film ''Los Canallas'' and all of them thereafter were shot in Color.

Federico Curiel directed Mil's next two films in 1968, both of which feature American horror star [[John Carradine]] as a bad guy. Mil's missions were becoming a bit more meaningful by this time. In ''Enigma of Death'', Mil faces off against Carradine who plays the leader of an underground Nazi organization (who disguises himself as a circus clown!), while in ''Las Vampiras'', Mil goes up against a secret cult of female vampires led by a very manic Carradine.

In 1970, Curiel directed Mil in two of his team-up movies. ''The Mummies of Guanajuato'' teamed Mil up with both Blue Demon and El Santo in what became the highest-grossing Mexican wrestler film of all time, pitting the three enmascarados against a group of re-animated mummies.

''The Champions of Justice'' (also 1970) saw Mil in action with fellow wrestlers Blue Demon, [[Tinieblas]], El Medico Asesino and La Sombra Vengadora (who all joined together as sort of a super-team to fight monsters, mad scientists, criminals, evil dwarves or whatever else crossed their paths.) The producers employed a gaggle of masked midget wrestlers in a number of their luchador films in the 70s.

Over the next few years, a number of other team-up movies were made, most co-starring Mil Máscaras, who by this time was becoming the King of the Team-up Movies. ''Champions of Justice Return'' (1972) was very similar to the first Champions film, only with El Fantasma Blanco sitting in for El Medico Asesino, El Rayo de Jalisco replacing Tinieblas, and El Avispon Escarlata replacing La Sombra Vengadora. (Mil didn't appear in the third and final "Champions" film because it would've involved traveling to a foreign country where it was filmed.)

However, in 1973, he teamed up again with Tinieblas and El Fantasma Blanco in two more films, ''Macabre Legends of the Colony'' and ''The Mummies of San Angel'' (which both resemble "Champions Of Justice" films, in spite of the Blue Demon's conspicuous absence from the casts). ''Theft of the Mummies of Guanajuato'' (1972) teamed up Mil with the Blue Angel and El Rayo De Jalisco.

Mil then co-starred with super-star strongman [[Sergio Oliva]] in ''Black Power'' (1973). He fought alongside the then-famous [[Superzan]] in ''Vampires of Coyoacan'' (1973) and later joined forces once again with El Santo and Blue Demon in 1977's ''Mystery in Bermuda'', which most Mexi-cinema fans consider to be the last real entry in the then fading Mexican wrestling/horror genre.

Mil also appeared in a solo movie of his own, ''A Rose in the Ring'' (1972) and years later, he even teamed up with Santo's son [[El Hijo del Santo]] in ''The Lawless Frontier'' (1983), making Mil Máscaras the only Mexican superhero to ever co-star with both Santos, father and son. In the late 80's, Mil appeared in two more wrestling films, ''[[La Verdad de la Lucha]]'' and ''[[La Llave Mortal]]''.

Mil's film career lay dormant after 1990 for 17 years, but he more recently resumed appearing in movies. In 2007, Máscaras starred in ''[[Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy]]'' (also known as ''Mil Mascaras: Resurrection''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmvsam.com |title=MMvsAM}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first lucha film featuring any of the so-called "Big Three" stars of the genre (Máscaras, Blue Demon, Santo) to be produced in [[English language|English]]. The film screened at festivals around the world garnering awards and award nominations along with positive critical reviews.&lt;ref name="popmatters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/mil-mascaras-resurrection|title=PopMatters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mjsimpson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/reviews/milmascarasresurrection.html |title=mjsimpson |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123115026/http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/reviews/milmascarasresurrection.html |archivedate=2009-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film enjoyed almost continuous popularity and publicity for several years after its debut, including two magazine cover articles as late as 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmvsam.com/reviews.shtml |title=Mil Mascaras vs. The Aztec Mummy (aka Mil Mascaras: Resurrection) &amp;#124; Press |publisher=Mmvsam.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in a 2008 film entitled ''[[Academy of Doom]]'', and a 2015 film called ''[[Aztec Revenge]]''.

===Criticism===
Multiple wrestlers have publicly complained of Máscaras' unwillingness to [[Sell (professional wrestling)|sell]] moves and put opponents [[List of professional wrestling terms#Over|over]]. One of the most vocal critics is [[Mick Foley]] who, in his book ''[[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|Have a Nice Day!]]'', complained about Máscaras' refusal to sell moves in their match.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.169-171)&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''A Lion's Tale'', [[Chris Jericho]] describes the stories of Máscaras' large ego and states that, if anything, "The tales were toning it down."&lt;ref&gt;Jericho, Chris. A Lion's Tale: Around the World in Spandex&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 shoot interview, Superstar Billy Graham said that, during their series of matches, Máscaras was unwilling to sell properly. In September 2012, while announcing an [[Alberto Del Rio]] match at WWE's "Night of Champions" pay-per-view, [[John Layfield]] called Máscaras "the most egomaniacal, selfish human being that ever lived."

Máscaras has attributed these claims to cultural differences in the sport: {{Quote|text=One problem is that in the U.S. some wrestlers focus more on their image than their skills. I understand because I understand the business. I don't criticize them for that, but they should understand that for me wrestling means something more. If a guy doesn't execute a move, I don't pretend that he did. If I miss a move, then I don't ask anyone to make me look good. |sign=[[Mil Mascaras]]|source=''Filmfax'', pp.51–52, issue 1, 2012}}

===Legacy===
[[File:WWE Hall of Fame 2012 Mil Mascaras.jpg|thumb|WWE Hall of Fame 2012 Mil Máscaras]]
In 1975, Máscaras was voted "The Most Popular Wrestler of the Year" by the company that now publishes the US magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/pwi/pwimpoty.htm Wrestling Information Archive – Pro Wrestling Illustrated Award Winners – Most Popular Wrestler of the Year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905045036/http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/pwi/pwimpoty.htm |date=2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satoru Sayama]], the original [[Tiger Mask (professional wrestling)|Tiger Mask]], has described Máscaras' impact on Japanese professional wrestling, "If it weren't for Mil Máscaras, there would be no [[Jushin Thunder Liger|Jushin Liger]], no [[Último Dragón]] or the [[Masanori Murakawa|Great Sasuke]] today,".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=9D757C0F-3048-826A-C4A84E2793E5A01B The Wrestling Gospel According to Mike Mooneyham] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113174457/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=9D757C0F-3048-826A-C4A84E2793E5A01B |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Máscaras' success in the US also paved the way for other luchadores such as [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Mysterio, Jr.]], who has become one of the most popular luchadores in US wrestling. Even after reaching the age of 70 Máscaras continues to perform sporadically. In 2001, he was inducted into the Southern California Pro-Wrestling Hall of Fame.

In 2006, Máscaras was honored by the [[Cauliflower Alley Club]], a fraternal organization of both retired and active wrestlers. [[Dick Beyer|The Destroyer]], one of Máscaras legendary rivals, presented him with an award at the event. The Destroyer also commented on Máscaras' wrestling style, "He was the best competitor that I ever wrestled. He never gave you anything – it's true – but I didn't give him anything either. You talk about a [[Shoot wrestling|shoot]] or a half-shoot, and that's the kind of match that it was."&lt;ref&gt;[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/06/11/1625969.html CANOE – SLAM!

On October 7, 2011, Máscaras returned to Japan to celebrate the 40th anniversary of his debut in the country. He teamed with [[Dos Caras]] and [[Satoru Sayama|Original Tiger Mask]] to defeat [[Nobuhiko Oshima|CIMA]], [[Último Guerrero]] and [[Tiger Mask IV]] in a six-man tag team match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iheartdg.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1318025912&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=&amp; CIMA @ Mascaras Anniversary – 07 Oct 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Máscaras was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by his nephew Alberto Del Rio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_54321.shtml|title=WWE News: First inductee into 2012 WWE Hall of Fame announced at Smackdown TV taping (w/video)|date=October 17, 2011|last=Caldwell|first=James|accessdate=October 17, 2011|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2013, Máscaras, along with Dos Caras, took part in a [[Tokyo Gurentai]] event in Tokyo's [[Korakuen Hall]]. In the main event, the two defeated [[Kazuhiko Masada|Mazada]] and [[Kazushige Nosawa|Nosawa Rongai]] to win the [[Tokyo World Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=Gurentai120413&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battle-news.com/battle/2013/12/002048.php|script-title=ja:マスカラス兄弟で日本最後の編隊飛行と思われたが、まさかのタッグ王座奪取！ドス・カラスは現役続行に意欲!?|date=December 4, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2013|work=Battle News|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Máscaras has never been unmasked in the ring, and like most masked luchadores, he goes to great lengths to conceal his true appearance and personal life. Máscaras has two brothers who wrestled, Dos Caras and [[Sicodélico]]. He has two sons and two daughters with his first wife, who died in 1975, and two daughters with his second wife, whom he married in 1995. His nephews are [[Alberto Del Rio]] (also known as Dos Caras, Jr., El Hijo de Dos Caras and Alberto El Patrón); the current [[El Hijo de Dos Caras]]; [[Sicodélico, Jr.]]; and [[Hijo Del Sicodelico]].

Máscaras is an avid golfer and plays in many charity golf tournaments around the world, including annually at the Los Angeles Police Memorial Foundation Celebrity Golf Tournament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lapmf.org/golf.htm |title=Los Angeles Police Memorial Foundation - Golf |publisher=Lapmf.org |date=2014-05-31 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with pro wrestling, Máscaras is a fan of [[Japanese martial arts]], and has practised [[judo]], [[aikido]], [[jujutsu]], [[karate]] and [[kendo]], among others. He trained jujutsu under a [[Mitsuyo Maeda]] student, and also trained under [[Professor Tanaka]].&lt;ref name=Sayama&gt;[http://www.puroresu.com/articles/sayama-mascaras.html Interview between Satoru Sayama and Mil Máscaras], Puroresu Dojo, August 3, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Máscaras started learning martial arts as a counter to [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] attempts, and recalls several wrestlers who tried to shoot on him and whom he had to legitimately submit.&lt;ref name=Sayama/&gt;

'''Mustafa Kemal Atatürk''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʊ|s|t|ə|f|ə|_|k|ə|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|_|ˈ|æ|t|ə|t|ɜr|k}}; {{IPA-tr|mustaˈfa ceˈmal aˈtaˌtyɾc|lang}}; 19 May 1881 &lt;small&gt;([[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's personal life#Birth date|conventional]])&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 10 November 1938) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[field marshal]] (''[[Mareşal (Turkey)|Mareşal]]''), [[revolutionary]] statesman, [[author]], and [[Father of the Nation|founder]] of the [[Republic of Turkey]], serving as its first [[President of Turkey|President]] from 1923 until his death in 1938. Ideologically a [[Secularism|secularist]] and [[Turkish nationalism|nationalist]], [[Atatürk's Reforms|his policies]] and theories became known as [[Kemalism]].

Atatürk came to prominence for his role in securing the Ottoman Turkish victory at the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]] (1915) during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=zurcher142&gt;Zürcher, ''Turkey : a modern history'', 142&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Empire's [[Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|defeat and subsequent dissolution]], he led the [[Turkish National Movement]], which resisted the mainland Turkey's partition among the victorious Allied powers. Establishing a provisional government in the  present-day Turkish capital [[Ankara]], he defeated the forces sent by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], thus emerging victorious from what was later referred to as the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. He subsequently proceeded to abolish the decrepit [[Ottoman Empire]] and proclaimed the foundation of the Turkish Republic in its place.

As the president of the newly formed Turkish Republic, Atatürk initiated a rigorous program of political, economic, and cultural reforms with the ultimate aim of building a modern, progressive, and secular [[Nation state|nation-state]]. He made [[primary education]] free and compulsory, opening thousands of new schools all over the country. He also introduced the Latin-based [[Turkish alphabet]], replacing the old [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]]. Turkish women received [[Women's rights|equal civil and political rights]] during Atatürk's presidency ahead of many Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Women in Turkish politics|women were given voting rights]] in local elections by Act no. 1580 on 3 April 1930 and a few years later, in 1934, full universal suffrage, earlier than most other countries in the world.&lt;ref name="tempo"&gt;''Türkiye'nin 75 yılı'' , Tempo Yayıncılık, İstanbul, 1998, p.48,59,250&lt;/ref&gt;

His government carried out a policy of [[Turkicisation]] trying to create a homogeneous and unified nation.&lt;ref name="Tormented by history: nationalism in Greece and Turkey"&gt;{{cite book |last = Sofos |first = Umut Özkırımlı &amp; Spyros A. |title = Tormented by history: nationalism in Greece and Turkey |year = 2008 |publisher = Columbia University Press |location = New York |isbn = 9780231700528 |page = 167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Citizenship and Minorities: A Historical Overview of Turkey's Jewish Minority"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Toktas |first = Sule |title = Citizenship and Minorities: A Historical Overview of Turkey's Jewish Minority |journal = Journal of Historical Sociology |year = 2005 |volume = 18 |issue = 4 |url = https://www.academia.edu/761586 |accessdate = 7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1915"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Jongerden |editor1-first = Joost |title = Social relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870–1915 |publisher = Brill |location = Leiden |isbn = 978-90-04-22518-3 |page = 300 |editor2-last = Verheij |editor2-first = Jelle |date = 2012-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Atatürk, non-Turkish minorities were pressured to [[Citizen, speak Turkish!|speak Turkish]] in public,&lt;ref name="Turkey beyond nationalism: towards post-nationalist identities"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last = Kieser |editor-first = Hans-Lukas |title = Turkey beyond nationalism: towards post-nationalist identities |year = 2006 |publisher = Tauris |location = London |isbn = 9781845111410 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VKVSHjjUT2UC |edition = [Online-Ausg.] |accessdate = 7 January 2013 |page = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; non-Turkish toponyms and last names of minorities had to be changed to [[Surname Law|Turkish renditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Öktem |first = Kerem |title = The Nation's Imprint: Demographic Engineering and the Change of Toponymes in Republican Turkey |journal = European Journal of Turkish Studies |year = 2008 |issue = 7 |url = http://ejts.revues.org/index2243.html |accessdate = 18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Aslan |first = Senem |title = Incoherent State: The Controversy over Kurdish Naming in Turkey |journal = European Journal of Turkish Studies.

==Early life==
{{Further|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's personal life}}

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was born (under the name Ali Rıza oğlu Mustafa) in the early months of 1881, either in the Ahmet Subaşı neighbourhood or at a house (preserved as a museum) in Islahhane Street (now Apostolou Pavlou Street) in the Koca Kasım Pasha neighbourhood in [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]] (Selanik),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Méropi Anastassiadou |author2 = Méropi Anastassiadou-Dumont |title = Salonique, 1830–1912: une ville ottomane à l'âge des Réformes |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qSjAqaQTI7EC&amp;pg=PA71 |year = 1997 |publisher = BRILL |isbn = 978-90-04-10798-4 |page = 71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ottoman Empire]] (Thessaloniki in present-day [[Greece]]), to [[Ali Rıza Efendi]], a militia officer, title-deed clerk and lumber trader, and [[Zübeyde Hanım]]. Only one of Mustafa's siblings, a sister named [[Makbule Atadan|Makbule (Atadan)]] survived childhood; she died in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Cemal Çelebi Granda |title = Cemal Granda anlatıyor |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hFcwAQAAIAAJ |year = 2007 |publisher = Pal Medya ve Organizasyon |isbn = 978-9944-203-01-2 }} {{page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Andrew Mango]], his family was Muslim, [[Turkish language|Turkish-speaking]] and precariously middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Mango]] ''Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey'', Overlook Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-58567-334-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=ZhvATKOVHcelcN3GoPkL&amp;ct=result&amp;id=nu68vd_AmuYC&amp;dq=Andrew+Mango&amp;q=Turkish+speaking+family+#search_anchor p. 25], p.27ff. – "Feyzullah's family is said to have come from the country near Vodina (now Edhessa in western Greek Macedonia). The surname Sofuzade, meaning 'son of a pious man', suggests that the ancestors of Zübeyde and Ali Rıza had a similar background. Cemil Bozok, son of Salih Bozok, who was a distant cousin of Atatürk and, later, his ADC, claims to have been related to both Ali Rıza's and Zübeyde's families. This would mean that the families of Atatürk's parents were interrelated. Cemil Bozok also notes that his paternal grandfather, Safer Efendi, was of Albanian origin. This may have a bearing on the vexed question of Atatürk's ethnic origin. Atatürk's parents and relatives all used Turkish as their mother tongue. This suggests that some at least of their ancestors had originally come from Turkey, since local Muslims of Albanian and Slav origin who had no ethnic connection with Turkey spoke Albanian, Serbo-Croat or Bulgarian, at least so long as they remained in their native land.'' ''But in looks Atatürk resembled local Albanians and Slavs.[...] But there is no evidence that either Ali Riza or Zübeyde was descended from such Turkish nomads." page 28; "It is much more likely that Atatürk inherited his looks from his Balkan ancestors.[...] But Albanians and Slavs are likely to have figured among his ancestors."&lt;/ref&gt; His father Ali Rıza is thought to have been of [[Albanians|Albanian]] origin by some authors;&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Andrew, ''Atatürk: the biography of the founder of modern Turkey'', (Overlook TP, 2002), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com.tr"&gt;Jackh, Ernest, ''The Rising Crescent'', (Goemaere Press, 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pxs-DAIVxqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Rising+Crescent&amp;hl=tr&amp;ei=bI7GTNu-J4i8vgPS0dzQDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Turkish%20mother&amp;f=false p. 31, ''Turkish mother and Albanian father'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p. 144"&gt;Isaac Frederick Marcosson, ''Turbulent Years'', Ayer Publishing, 1969, [https://books.google.com/books?id=399LkTqBLdAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Isaac+Frederick+Marcosson%22&amp;hl=tr&amp;ei=inXGTMnzJYSuvgPPvLTZDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ali%20Riza&amp;f=false p. 144.]&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to [[Falih Rıfkı Atay]], [[Vamık Volkan|Vamık D.

Later, he attended the Şemsi Efendi School (a private school with a more secular curriculum) at the direction of his father. His parents wanted him to learn a trade, but without consulting them, Mustafa Kemal took the entrance exam for the Salonica Military School (''Selanik Askeri Rüştiyesi'') in 1893. In 1896, he enrolled into the [[Monastir Military High School]]. On 14 March 1899,&lt;ref name="Genelkurmay1"&gt;T. C.

Shortly after graduation, he was arrested by the police for his anti monarchist activities. Following a  confinement of several months he was released only with the support of Rıza Pasha, his former school director.&lt;ref name="Atay"&gt;Falih Rıfkı Atay: Çankaya, Pozitif Yayınları, İstanbıl, 2004 {{ISBN|975-6461-05-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release, Mustafa Kemal was assigned to the [[Fifth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fifth Army]] based in [[Damascus]] as a Staff [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]]&lt;ref name="Genelkurmay1"/&gt; in the company of Ali Fuat (Cebesoy) and [[Lütfi Müfit Özdeş|Lütfi Müfit]] (Özdeş).&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''ibid'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a small secret revolutionary society of reformist officers led by a merchant [[Mustafa Cantekin|Mustafa Elvan]] (Cantekin) called [[Vatan ve Hürriyet]] ("Motherland and Liberty"). On 20 June 1907, he was promoted to the rank of [[Senior Captain]] (''Kolağası'') and on 13 October 1907, assigned to the headquarters of the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]] in [[Bitola|Manastır]].&lt;ref name="Genelkurmay2"&gt;T.C. Genelkurmay Başkanlığı Yayınları, ''ibid'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], with membership number 322, although in later years he became known for his opposition to, and frequent criticism of, the policies pursued by the CUP leadership. On 22 June 1908, he was appointed the Inspector of the Ottoman Railways in [[Eastern Rumelia]] (''Doğu Rumeli Bölgesi Demiryolları Müfettişi'').&lt;ref name="Genelkurmay2"/&gt; In July 1908, he played a role in the [[Young Turk Revolution]] which seized power from Sultan [[Abdülhamid II]] and restored the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|constitutional monarchy]].

He was proposing depolitization in the army, a proposal which was disliked by the leaders of the CUP. As a result, he was sent away to [[Tripolitania Vilayet]] (present [[Libya]], then an Ottoman territory) under the pretext of  suppressing a tribal rebellion towards the end of 1908.&lt;ref name="Atay"/&gt; According to Mikush however, he volunteered for this mission.&lt;ref&gt;D.V.Mikusch: Zwichen Europe und Asien (translation Esat Mermi Erendor),İkarus Yyın, İstanbul,1981 {{ISBN|978-605-5834-32-6}} p.67&lt;/ref&gt;  He suppressed the revolt and returned to İstanbul in January 1909.

In April 1909 in İstanbul, a group of soldiers began a counter revolution (see [[31 March Incident]]). Mustafa Kemal was instrumental in suppressing the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kinross: ''Rebirth of a Nation'' (translation Ayhan Tezel), Sander yayınları, İstanbul,1972 p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, he was assigned to the Ottoman [[Tripolitania Vilayet]] (present-day [[Libya]]) to fight in the [[Italo-Turkish War]], mainly in the areas near [[Benghazi]], [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] and [[Tobruk]] against a 150,000-strong Italian amphibious assault force,&lt;ref name="Italian-Turkish War page 96"&gt;The History of the Italian-Turkish War, William Henry Beehler, page 96&lt;/ref&gt; which had to be countered by 20,000 Bedouins&lt;ref name="Italian-Turkish War page 14"&gt;The History of the Italian-Turkish War, William Henry Beehler, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; and 8,000 Turks&lt;ref name="Italian-Turkish War page 14"/&gt; A short time before Italy declared war, a large portion of the Ottoman troops in Libya were sent to the Ottoman province of [[Yemen]] in order to put down the rebellion there, so the Ottoman government was caught with inadequate resources to counter the Italians in Libya; and the British government, which controlled the  [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Sudan]], did not allow sending additional Ottoman troops to Libya through Egypt. Ottoman soldiers like Mustafa Kemal went  to Libya either dressed as Arabs (risking imprisonment if noticed by the British authorities in Egypt), or through very few available ferries (the Italians, who had superior naval forces, effectively controlled the sea routes to Tripoli). However, despite all the hardships, Mustafa Kemal's forces in Libya managed to repel the Italians on a number of occasions, such as the [[Battle of Tobruk (1911)|Battle of Tobruk]] on 22 December 1911. During the Battle of Derna on 16–17 January 1912, while Mustafa Kemal was assaulting the Italian-controlled fortress of Kasr-ı Harun, two Italian planes dropped bombs on the Ottoman forces and a piece of [[limestone]] from a damaged building's rubble entered Mustafa Kemal's left eye; which caused a permanent damage on his left eye's tissue, but not total loss of sight. He received medical treatment for nearly a month; he attempted to leave the Red Crescent's health facilities after only two weeks, but when his eye's situation worsened, he had to return and resume treatment. On 6 March 1912 Mustafa Kemal became the Commander of the Ottoman forces in Derna. He managed to defend and retain the city and its surrounding region until the end of the Italo-Turkish War on 18 October 1912. Mustafa Kemal, [[İsmail Enver|Enver Bey]], [[Ali Fethi Okyar|Fethi Bey]] and the other Ottoman military commanders in Libya had to return to [[Ottoman territories in Europe|Ottoman Europe]] following the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]] on 8 October 1912. Losing the war, the Ottoman government had to surrender [[Tripolitania]], [[Fezzan]] and [[Cyrenaica]] (3 provinces forming present-day Libya) to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] with the secret [[Treaty of Ouchy]] (the public version is the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1912)]]) signed ten days later, on 18 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Erik Goldstein |title = Wars and Peace Treaties: 1816 to 1991 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KWWKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |year = 2005 |publisher = Routledge |page = 37 |isbn = 9781134899128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 1912, Mustafa Kemal arrived at his new headquarters on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula and during the [[First Balkan War]], he took part in the amphibious landing at [[Bolayır|Bulair]] on the coast of [[Thrace]] that was commanded by [[Binbashi|Binbaşı]] [[Ali Fethi Okyar|Fethi Bey]], but this offensive was repulsed during the [[Battle of Bulair]] by [[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]'s 7th Rila Infantry Division&lt;ref&gt;Richard C.

In June 1913, during the [[Second Balkan War]], he took part in the Ottoman Army forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kemal-Ataturk |title = Kemal Atatürk |work = Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date = 2017-11-21 |language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; commanded by [[Kaymakam]] [[İsmail Enver|Enver Bey]] that recovered [[Dimetoka]] and [[Edirne]] (Adrianople, the capital city of the Ottoman Empire between 1365 and 1453, thus of utmost historic importance for the Turks) together with most of eastern [[Thrace]] from the Bulgarians.

In 1913, he was appointed the Ottoman military attaché to [[Balkans|all Balkan states]] (his office was in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria) and promoted to the rank of [[Kaymakam]] ([[Lieutenant Colonel]] / [[Colonel]]) on 1 March 1914.&lt;ref name="Genelkurmay1"/&gt;

[[File:Mustafa Kemal during the Gallipoli Campaign.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonel Mustafa Kemal Bey in the trenches of [[Gallipoli]] with his soldiers, 1915]]

In 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered the [[European theatre of World War I|European]] and [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatres]] of World War I allied with the [[Central Powers]]. Mustafa Kemal was given the task of organizing and commanding the 19th Division attached to the [[Fifth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fifth Army]] during the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]]. Mustafa Kemal became the front-line commander after correctly anticipating where the Allies would attack and holding his position until they retreated. Following the Battle of Gallipoli, Mustafa Kemal served in [[Edirne]] until 14 January 1916. He was then assigned to the command of the [[XVI Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XVI Corps]] of the [[Second Army (Ottoman Empire)|Second Army]] and sent to the [[Caucasus Campaign]] after the massive Russian offensive had reached key Anatolian cities. On 7 August, Mustafa Kemal rallied his troops and mounted a counteroffensive.&lt;ref name=lengyel68&gt;Lengyel, ''They called him Atatürk'', 68&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his divisions captured [[Battle of Bitlis|Bitlis]] and [[Muş]], upsetting the calculations of the Russian Command.&lt;ref name=kinross100&gt;Patrick Kinross, ''Atatürk: The Rebirth of a Nation'', 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this victory, the [[Committee of Union and Progress|CUP]] government in Constantinople proposed to establish a new army in [[Hejaz]] (''Hicaz Kuvve-i Seferiyesi'') and appoint Mustafa Kemal to its command, but he refused the proposal and this army was never established.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica&gt;Ana Britannica (1987) Vol. 2 (Ami – Avr): ''Atatürk, Mustafa Kemal''. Page: 490.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, on 7 March 1917, Mustafa Kemal [[Pasha]] was promoted from the command of the XVI Corps to the overall command of the Second Army, although the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Czar's armies]] were soon withdrawn when the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] erupted.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt;&lt;ref name=lengyel68/&gt;

In July 1917, he was appointed to the command of the [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh Army]], replacing [[Fevzi Çakmak|Fevzi Pasha]] on 7 August 1917, who was under the command of the German general [[Erich von Falkenhayn]]'s [[Yildirim Army Group]] (after the British forces of General [[Edmund Allenby]] captured [[Jerusalem]] in December 1917, Erich von Falkenhayn was replaced by [[Otto Liman von Sanders]] who became the new commander of the Yıldırım Army Group in early 1918.)&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; Mustafa Kemal Pasha could not get along well with General von Falkenhayn and, together with [[İsmet İnönü|Miralay İsmet Bey]], wrote a report to [[Grand Vizier]] [[Talaat Pasha]] regarding the grim situation and lack of adequate resources in the Palestinian front; but Talaat Pasha ignored their observations and refused their suggestion to form a stronger defensive line to the north, in [[Ottoman Syria]] (in parts of the [[Beirut Vilayet]], [[Syria Vilayet|Damascus Vilayet]] and [[Aleppo Vilayet]]), with Turks instead of Germans in command.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; Following the rejection of his report, Mustafa Kemal resigned from the Seventh Army and returned to Constantinople.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; There, he was assigned with the task of accompanying the crown prince (and future sultan) [[Mehmed VI|Mehmed Vahideddin]] during his train trip to [[Austria-Hungary]] and Germany.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; While in Germany, Mustafa Kemal visited the German lines in the west European front and came to the conclusion that the [[Central Powers]] would soon lose the war.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; He did not hesitate to openly express this opinion to Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] and his high-ranking generals in person.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; During the return trip, he briefly stayed in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] and [[Vienna]] for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt;

When [[Mehmed VI]] became the new Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in July 1918, he called Mustafa Kemal Pasha to Constantinople, and in August 1918 assigned him to the command of the Seventh Army in Palestine.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; Mustafa Kemal arrived in [[Aleppo]] on 26 August 1918, then continued south to his headquarters in [[Nablus]]. The Seventh Army was holding the central sector of the front lines. On 19 September, at the beginning of the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], the Eighth Army was holding the coastal flank, but fell apart and Liman Pasha ordered the Seventh Army to withdraw to the north in order to prevent the British from conducting a short envelopment to the [[Jordan River]].

According to Lord Kinross, Mustafa Kemal was the only Turkish general in the war who never suffered a defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kinross, ''Rebirth of a Nation'' (translation Ayhan Tezel), Sander yayınları, İstanbul,1972 p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

The war ended with the [[Armistice of Mudros]] which was signed on 30 October 1918, and all German and Austro-Hungarian troops in the Ottoman Empire were granted ample time to withdraw. On 31 October, Kemal was appointed to the command of the Yıldırım Army Group, replacing Liman von Sanders. He organized the distribution of weapons to the civilians in [[Antep]] in case of a defensive conflict against the invading Allies.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt;

Mustafa Kemal Pasha's last active service in the Ottoman Army was organizing the return of the Ottoman troops left behind to the south of this line. In early November 1918, the Yıldırım Army Group was officially dissolved and Mustafa Kemal returned to an [[Occupation of Constantinople|occupied Constantinople]], the Ottoman capital, on 13 November 1918.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; For a period he worked at the headquarters of the Ministry of War (''Harbiye Nezareti'') in Constantinople and continued his activities in this city until 16 May 1919.&lt;ref name=AnaBritannica/&gt; Along the established lines of the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] (British, Italian, French and Greek forces) occupied [[Anatolia]]. The occupation of Constantinople, which was followed by the [[occupation of İzmir]] (the two largest Ottoman cities in that period) sparked the establishment of the [[Turkish National Movement]] and the Turkish War of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Kemal Pasha's speech on his arrival in Ankara in November 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

His first goal was the establishment of an organized national movement against the occupying forces. In June 1919, he issued the [[Amasya Circular]], declaring the independence of the country was in danger. He resigned from the Ottoman Army on 8 July and the Ottoman government issued a warrant for his arrest. Later, he was condemned to death.

On 4 September 1919, he assembled a congress in [[Sivas]]. Those who opposed the Allies in various provinces in Turkey issued a declaration named ''[[Misak-ı Millî]]'' ("National Pact"). Mustafa Kemal was appointed as the head of the executive committee of the congress. This gave Mustafa Kemal the legitimacy he needed for his future politics.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kinross: ''Rebirth of a Nation'' (translation Ayhan Tezel), Sander yayınları, İstanbul,1972 p.293&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Sivas Congress]].)

The [[Ottoman general election, 1919|last election]] to the [[Parliament of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman parliament]] held in December 1919 gave a sweeping majority to candidates of the "Association for Defense of Rights for Anatolia and Roumelia (''Anadolu ve Rumeli Müdafaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti'')", headed by Mustafa Kemal, who himself remained in Ankara. The fourth (and last) term of the parliament opened in Constantinople on 12 January 1920. It was dissolved by British forces on 18 March 1920, shortly after it adopted the ''Misak-ı Millî'' ("National Pact"). Mustafa Kemal called for a national election to establish a new Turkish Parliament seated in Ankara&lt;ref name=feroz50&gt;Ahmad, ''The Making of Modern Turkey'', 50&lt;/ref&gt; – the "[[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]]" (GNA). On 23 April 1920, the GNA opened with Mustafa Kemal as [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Turkey|the speaker]]; this act effectively created the situation of [[diarchy]] in the country.

On 10 August 1920, the Ottoman [[Grand Vizier]] [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] signed the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], finalizing plans for the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], including the regions that Turkish nationals viewed as their heartland. Mustafa Kemal insisted on the country's complete independence and the safeguarding of interests of the Turkish majority on "Turkish soil". He persuaded the GNA to gather a National Army. The GNA Army faced the Caliphate army propped up by the Allied occupation forces and had the immediate task of fighting the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia#Military|Armenian forces]] in the [[Turkish–Armenian War|Eastern Front]] and the [[Hellenic Army#History|Greek forces]] advancing eastward from Smyrna (modern-day [[İzmir]]) that they [[Occupation of Smyrna|had occupied]] in May 1919, on the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Western Front]]. In January 1920, Mustafa Kemal advanced his troops into Marash where the [[Battle of Marash]] ensued against the [[French Armenian Legion]]. The battle resulted in a Turkish victory alongside the massacres of 5,000–12,000 Armenians spelling the end of the remaining Armenian population in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Ataturk, Mustafa Kemal |url = http://www.armenian-genocide.org/kemal.html |work = Information about the Armenian Genocide |publisher = Armenian National Institute |accessdate = 21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Documents on British Foreign Policy'', vol. vii, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerr.

After a series of battles during the Greco-Turkish war, the Greek army advanced as far as the [[Sakarya River]], just eighty kilometers west of the GNA.

After this victory, on 19 September 1921, Mustafa Kemal Pasha was given by the [[Grand National Assembly]] the rank of [[Mareşal (Turkey)|Mareşal]] and the title of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Gazi]]. The Allies, ignoring the extent of Kemal's successes, hoped to impose a modified version of the Treaty of Sèvres as a peace settlement on Ankara, but the proposal was rejected. In August 1922, Kemal launched an all-out attack on the Greek lines at [[Afyonkarahisar]] in the [[Battle of Dumlupınar]] and Turkish forces regained control of Smyrna on 9 September 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Greco-Turkish wars, Britannica CD 99&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 1922, Mustafa Kemal sent a telegram to the [[League of Nations]] saying that the Turkish population was so worked up that the Ankara Government would not be responsible for massacres.&lt;ref&gt;James, Edwin L.

With the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, efforts to modernise the country started. The new government analyzed the institutions and constitutions of Western states such as France, Sweden, Italy, and Switzerland and adapted them to the needs and characteristics of the Turkish nation. Highlighting the public's lack of knowledge regarding Kemal's intentions, the public cheered: "We are returning to the days of the [[The first four Sunni Caliphs and the Sunnah|first caliphs]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 394&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal placed [[Fevzi Çakmak]], [[Kâzım Özalp]] and [[İsmet İnönü]] in political positions where they could institute his [[Atatürk's Reforms|reforms]]. Mustafa Kemal capitalized on his reputation as an efficient military leader and spent the following years, up until his death in 1938, instituting political, economic, and social reforms. In doing so, he transformed Turkish society from perceiving itself as a Muslim part of a vast Empire into a modern, democratic, and secular nation-state. This had a positive influence on human capital because what from now on mattered at school was science and education; Islam was concentrated in mosques and religious places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Baten, Jörg |title = A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present. |date = 2016 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |page = 226 |isbn = 9781107507180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic policies===
Mustafa Kemal's basic tenet was the complete independence of the country.&lt;ref name=mango367&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; He clarified his position:{{bquote|...by complete independence, we mean of course complete economic, financial, juridical, military, cultural independence and freedom in all matters. Being deprived of independence in any of these is equivalent to the nation and country being deprived of all its independence.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Nonneman, Analyzing Middle East foreign policies and the relationship with Europe, Published 2005 Routledge, p. 204 {{ISBN|0-7146-8427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He led wide-ranging reforms in social, cultural, and economical aspects, establishing the new Republic's backbone of legislative, judicial, and economic structures. Though he was later idealized by some as an originator of sweeping reforms, many of his reformist ideas were already common in Ottoman intellectual circles at the turn of the 20th century, and were expressed more openly after the [[Young Turk Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Hanioglu2011p55"&gt;{{cite book |author = M. Şükrü Hanioğlu |title = Atatürk: An Intellectual Biography |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dNFhZzug6tMC&amp;pg=PA55 |accessdate = 4 June 2013 |date = 9 May 2011 |publisher = Princeton University Press |isbn = 978-1-4008-3817-2 |page = 55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mustafa Kemal created a banner to mark the changes between the old Ottoman and the new republican rule. Each change was symbolized as an arrow in this banner. This defining ideology of the Republic of Turkey is referred to as the "Six Arrows", or [[Kemalist ideology]]. Kemalist ideology is based on Mustafa Kemal's conception of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Turkey of Atatürk: social process in the Turkish reformation'', 245&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamentals of nationalism, populism and [[Statism|etatism]] were all defined under the Six Arrows. These fundamentals were not new in world politics or, indeed, among the elite of Turkey. What made them unique was that these interrelated fundamentals were formulated specifically for Turkey's needs. A good example is the definition and application of secularism; the Kemalist secular state significantly differed from predominantly Christian states.

====Emergence of the state, 1923–1924====

During the [[one-party state]], the candidates had only one party's (CHP) list to join.]]

Mustafa Kemal's private journal entries dated before the establishment of the republic in 1923 show that he believed in the importance of the sovereignty of the people. In forging the new republic, the Turkish revolutionaries turned their back on the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Constantinople and its Ottoman heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 391–392&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, they made [[Ankara]] the country's new capital and reformed the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey|Turkish postal service]]. Once a provincial town deep in Anatolia, Ankara was thus turned into the center of the independence movement. Atatürk wanted a "direct government by the Assembly"&lt;ref name="Mango, Atatürk, 362"&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 362&lt;/ref&gt; and visualized a [[representative democracy]], [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the National Parliament would be the ultimate source of power.&lt;ref name="Mango, Atatürk, 362"/&gt;

In the following years, he altered his stance somewhat; the country needed an immense amount of reconstruction, and that "direct government by the Assembly" could not survive in such an environment. The revolutionaries faced challenges from the supporters of the old Ottoman regime, and also from the supporters of newer ideologies such as communism and fascism. Mustafa Kemal saw the consequences of fascist and communist doctrines in the 1920s and 1930s and rejected both.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, ''Atatürk and the Modernization of Turkey'', 252&lt;/ref&gt; He prevented the spread into Turkey of the [[totalitarian]] party rule which held sway in the Soviet Union, Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 501&lt;/ref&gt; Some perceived his opposition and silencing of these ideologies as a means of eliminating competition; others believed it was necessary to protect the young Turkish state from succumbing to the instability of new ideologies and competing factions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The heart of the new republic was the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Mustafa Kemal.&lt;ref name="single"&gt;Koçak, Cemil (2005) "Parliament Membership during the Single-Party System in Turkey (1925–1945)", ''European Journal of Turkish Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; The elections were free and used an egalitarian electoral system that was based on a general ballot.&lt;ref name="single"/&gt; Deputies at the GNA served as the voice of Turkish society by expressing its political views and preferences. It had the right to select and control both the government and the Prime Minister. Initially, it also acted as a legislative power, controlling the executive branch and, if necessary, acted as an organ of scrutiny under the [[Turkish Constitution of 1921]].&lt;ref name="single" /&gt; The [[Turkish Constitution of 1924]] set a loose [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislative]] and the executive organs of the state, whereas the separation of these two within the [[judiciary]] system was a strict one. Mustafa Kemal, then the President, occupied a powerful position in this political system.

The one-party regime was established ''de facto'' in 1925 after the adoption of the 1924 constitution. The only political party of the GNA was the "Peoples Party", founded by Mustafa Kemal on 9 September 1923. (But according to the party culture the foundation date was the opening day of Sivas Congress on 4 September 1919). On 10 November 1924 it was renamed ''Cumhuriyet Halk Fırkası'' or [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (the word ''fırka'' was replaced by the word ''parti'' in 1935).

====Civic independence and the Caliphate, 1924–1925====
Abolition of the [[Caliphate]] was an important dimension in Mustafa Kemal's drive to reform the political system and to promote the national sovereignty. By the consensus of the Muslim majority in early centuries, the caliphate was the core political concept of [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=13296 |title = Review: Revivalism, Shi'a Style |publisher = The National Interest |date = 3 January 2007 |accessdate = 6 September 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080213114848/http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=13296 |archive-date = 13 February 2008 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abolishing the [[sultanate]] was easier because the survival of the Caliphate at the time satisfied the partisans of the sultanate. This produced a split system with the new republic on one side and an Islamic form of government with the Caliph on the other side, and Mustafa Kemal and İnönü worried that "it nourished the expectations that the sovereign would return under the guise of Caliph."&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 403&lt;/ref&gt; Caliph [[Abdülmecid II]] was elected after the abolition of the sultanate (1922).

The caliph had his own personal treasury and also had a personal service that included military personnel; Mustafa Kemal said that there was no "religious" or "political" justification for this. He believed that Caliph Abdülmecid II was following in the steps of the sultans in domestic and foreign affairs: accepting of and responding to foreign representatives and reserve officers, and participating in official ceremonies and celebrations.&lt;ref name="Mango, Atatürk, 401"&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 401&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to integrate the powers of the caliphate into the powers of the GNA. His initial activities began on 1 January 1924, when&lt;ref name="Mango, Atatürk, 401"/&gt; İnönü, Çakmak and Özalp consented to the abolition of the caliphate. The caliph made a statement to the effect that he would not interfere with political affairs.&lt;ref name="Calipinternational"/&gt; On 1 March 1924, at the Assembly, Mustafa Kemal said:

{{bquote|The religion of Islam will be elevated if it will cease to be a political instrument, as had been the case in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 404&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 3 March 1924, the caliphate was [[Ottoman Caliphate#Abolition|officially abolished]] and its powers within Turkey were transferred to the GNA. Other Muslim nations debated the validity of Turkey's unilateral abolition of the caliphate as they decided whether they should confirm the Turkish action or appoint a new caliph.&lt;ref name="Calipinternational"&gt;Majid Khadduri (2006) War and peace in the law of Islam, The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd., {{ISBN|1-58477-695-1}}-page 290-291&lt;/ref&gt; A "Caliphate Conference" was held in Cairo in May 1926 and a resolution was passed declaring the caliphate "a necessity in Islam", but failed to implement this decision.&lt;ref name="Calipinternational"/&gt;

Two other Islamic conferences were held in Mecca (1926) and Jerusalem (1931), but failed to reach a consensus.&lt;ref name="Calipinternational"/&gt; Turkey did not accept the re-establishment of the caliphate and perceived it as an attack to its basic existence; while Mustafa Kemal and the reformists continued their own way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Oktay |last = Eksi |title = Paralardaki resimler |url = http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=8711441&amp;yazarid=1 |work = [[Hurriyet]] |quote = İsmet Paşa "kurumlaşma" ile neyi kastettiğini de şöyle anlattı:&lt;br /&gt;Biz Cumhuriyeti kurduğumuz zaman onu yaşatıp yaşatamayacağımız en büyük sorun idi.

On 8 April 1924, [[sharia]] courts were abolished with the law "Mehakim-i Şer'iyenin İlgasına ve Mehakim Teşkilatına Ait Ahkamı Muaddil Kanun".&lt;ref name="Hanioglu2011p158"&gt;{{cite book |author = M.

The removal of the caliphate was followed by an extensive effort to establish the separation of governmental and religious affairs. Education was the cornerstone in this effort. In 1923, there were three main educational groups of institutions. The most common institutions were [[medrese]]s based on Arabic, the Qur'an and memorization. The second type of institution was idadî and sultanî, the reformist schools of the [[Tanzimat]] era. The last group included colleges and minority schools in foreign languages that used the latest teaching models in educating pupils. The old medrese education was modernized.&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; Mustafa Kemal changed the classical Islamic education for a vigorously promoted reconstruction of educational institutions.&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; Mustafa Kemal linked educational reform to the liberation of the nation from [[dogma]], which he believed was more important than the Turkish War of Independence. He declared:

{{bquote|Today, our most important and most productive task is the national education [unification and modernization] affairs. We have to be successful in national education affairs and we shall be. The liberation of a nation is only achieved through this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.meb.gov.tr/Stats/apk2001ing/Section_0/AtaturksViewon.htm |title = Atatürk's views on education |accessdate = 20 November 2007 |author = Republic of Turkey Ministry of National Education |publisher = T.C. Government }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the summer of 1924, Mustafa Kemal invited American educational reformer [[John Dewey]] to Ankara to advise him on how to reform Turkish education.&lt;ref name=dew&gt;Wolf-Gazo, ''John Dewey in Turkey: An Educational Mission'', 15–42.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[public education]] reforms aimed to prepare citizens for roles in public life through increasing the public literacy. He wanted to institute compulsory primary education for both girls and boys; since then this effort has been an ongoing task for the republic. He pointed out that one of the main targets of [[education in Turkey]] had to be raising a generation nourished with what he called the "public culture". The state schools established a common curriculum which became known as the "unification of education."

[[File:Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1928).jpg|thumb|upright|Atatürk with his [[top hat]]]]
[[File:Ataturk-hatreform.jpg|thumb|upright|Atatürk with his [[Panama hat]] just after [[s:tr:Atatürk'ün Kastamonu Nutku|the Kastamonu speech]] in 1925]]

Unification of education was put into force on 3 March 1924 by the Law on Unification of Education (No. 430). With the new law, education became inclusive, organized on a model of the civil community. In this new design, all schools submitted their curriculum to the "[[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]]", a government agency modelled after other countries' ministries of education. Concurrently, the republic abolished the two ministries and made clergy subordinate to the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|department of religious affairs]], one of the foundations of [[secularism in Turkey]]. The unification of education under one curriculum ended "clerics or clergy of the Ottoman Empire", but was not the end of religious schools in Turkey; they were moved to higher education until later governments restored them to their former position in secondary after Mustafa Kemal's death.

Beginning in the fall of 1925, Mustafa Kemal encouraged the Turks to wear modern European attire.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;İğdemir, ''Atatürk'', 165–170&lt;/ref&gt; He was determined to force the abandonment of the sartorial traditions of the Middle East and finalize a series of dress reforms, which were originally started by [[Mahmud II]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The [[Fez (hat)|fez]] was established by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826 as part of the Ottoman Empire's modernization effort. The [[s:tr:Şapka İktisası Hakkında Kanun|Hat Law of 1925]] introduced the use of Western-style hats instead of the fez. Mustafa Kemal first made the hat compulsory for civil servants.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The guidelines for the proper dressing of students and state employees were passed during his lifetime; many civil servants adopted the hat willingly. In 1925, Mustafa Kemal wore a [[Panama hat]] during a public appearance in [[Kastamonu]], one of the most conservative towns in Anatolia, to explain that the hat was the headgear of civilized nations. The last part of reform on dress emphasized the need to wear modern Western suits with neckties as well as Fedora and Derby-style hats instead of antiquated religion-based clothing such as the veil and turban in the [[s:tr:Bazı Kisvelerin Giyilemiyeceğine Dair Kanun|Law Relating to Prohibited Garments of 1934]].

Even though he personally promoted modern dress for women, Mustafa Kemal never made specific reference to women's clothing in the law, as he believed that women would adapt to the new clothing styles of their own free will. He was frequently photographed on public business with his wife [[Lâtife Uşaklıgil]], who covered her head in accordance with Islamic tradition. He was also frequently photographed on public business with women wearing modern Western clothes. But it was Atatürk's adopted daughters, [[Sabiha Gökçen]] and [[Afet İnan]], who provided the real role model for the Turkish women of the future. He wrote: "The religious covering of women will not cause difficulty ... This simple style [of headcovering] is not in conflict with the morals and manners of our society."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Atatürkism, Volume 1 (Istanbul: Office of the Chief of General Staff, 1982), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 1925, Mustafa Kemal's view on religious insignia used outside places of worship was introduced in his [[s:tr:Atatürk'ün Kastamonu Nutku|Kastamonu speech]]. This speech also had another position. He said: {{bquote|In the face of knowledge, science, and of the whole extent of radiant civilization, I cannot accept the presence in Turkey's civilized community of people primitive enough to seek material and spiritual benefits in the guidance of sheiks. The Turkish republic cannot be a country of sheiks, dervishes, and disciples. The best, the truest order is the order of civilization. To be a man it is enough to carry out the requirements of civilization. The leaders of dervish orders will understand the truth of my words, and will themselves close down their lodges [tekke] and admit that their disciplines have grown up.&lt;ref name=mango435&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 435&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:tr:Atatürk'ün Kastamonu Nutku|Kastamonu Nutku]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 2 September, the government issued a decree closing down all Sufi orders and the [[Zawiyya|tekkes]]. Mustafa Kemal ordered their dervish lodges to be converted to museums, such as [[Mevlana Museum]] in Konya. The institutional expression of Sufism became illegal in Turkey; a politically neutral form of Sufism, functioning as social associations, was permitted to exist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The abolition of the caliphate and other cultural reforms were met with fierce opposition. The conservative elements were not happy and they launched attacks on the Kemalist reformists.&lt;ref name="Calipinternational"/&gt;

====Opposition to Mustafa Kemal in 1924–1927====
[[File:50 Kurus à l'effigie de Kemal Ataturk.jpg|thumb|Kemal Atatürk on a coin]]
[[File:Mustafa Kemal during his Anatolian tours.ogv|thumb|Atatürk during one of his Anatolian tours]]

In 1924, while the "Issue of Mosul" was on the table, [[Sheikh Said]] began to organize the [[Sheikh Said Rebellion]]. Sheikh Said was a wealthy Kurdish{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} [[tribal chief]] of a local [[Naqshbandi]] order. He emphasized the issue of religion; he not only opposed the abolition of the Caliphate, but also the adoption of civil codes based on Western models, the closure of religious orders, the ban on polygamy, and the new obligatory civil marriage. Sheikh stirred up his followers against the policies of the government, which he considered anti-Islamic. In an effort to restore Islamic law, Sheik's forces moved through the countryside, seized government offices and marched on the important cities of [[Elazığ]] and [[Diyarbakır]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kinross, ''Atatürk: The Rebirth of a Nation'', 397&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the government saw the Sheikh Said Rebellion as an attempt at a counter-revolution. They urged immediate military action to prevent its spread. The "Law for the Maintenance of Public Order" was passed to deal with the rebellion on 4 March 1925. It gave the government exceptional powers and included the authority to shut down subversive groups, but was repealed on 4 March 1929.

There were also parliamentarians in the GNA who were not happy with these changes{{who|date=September 2015}}. So many members were denounced as opposition sympathizers at a private meeting of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) that Mustafa Kemal expressed his fear of being among the minority in his own party.&lt;ref name="PRP"&gt;Mango, Atatürk, 418&lt;/ref&gt; He decided not to purge this group.&lt;ref name="PRP"/&gt; After a [[Censure|censure motion]] gave the chance to have a breakaway group, [[Kazım Karabekir]], along with his friends, established such a group on 17 October 1924. The censure became a confidence vote at the CHP for Mustafa Kemal. On 8 November, the motion was rejected by 148 votes to 18, and 41 votes were absent.&lt;ref name="PRP"/&gt; CHP held all but one seat in the parliament. After the majority of the CHP chose him&lt;ref name="PRP"/&gt; Mustafa Kemal said, "the Turkish nation is firmly determined to advance fearlessly on the path of the republic, civilization and progress".&lt;ref name="PRP"/&gt;

On 17 November 1924, the breakaway group established the [[Progressive Republican Party (Turkey)|Progressive Republican Party]] (PRP) with 29 deputies and the first multi-party system began. Some of Mustafa Kemal's closest associates who had supported him in the early days of the War of Independence such as [[Rauf Orbay|Rauf Bey]] (later Rauf Orbay), [[Refet Bele|Refet Pasha]] and [[Ali Fuat Cebesoy|Ali Fuat Pasha]] (later Ali Fuat Cebesoy) were among the members of the new party. The PRP's economic program suggested liberalism, in contrast to the [[state socialism]] of CHP, and its social program was based on conservatism in contrast to the [[modernism]] of CHP. Leaders of the party strongly supported the Kemalist revolution in principle, but had different opinions on the cultural revolution and the principle of [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiker, ''Book Review of Zürcher's "Political Opposition in the Early Turkish Republic: The Progressive Republican Party, 1924–1925"'', 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; The PRP was not against Mustafa Kemal's main positions as declared in its program; they supported establishing secularism in the country and the civic law, or as stated, "the needs of the age" (article 3) and the uniform system of education (article 49).&lt;ref name="Mango 419"&gt;Mango, Atatürk, 419&lt;/ref&gt; These principles were set by the leaders at the onset. The only legal opposition became a home for all kinds of differing views.

During 1926, a plot to assassinate Mustafa Kemal was uncovered in İzmir. It originated with a former deputy who had opposed the abolition of the Caliphate. Investigation shifted from an inquiry into the planners to an investigation ostensibly to uncover subversive activities but in truth used to undermine those disagreeing with Mustafa Kemal's cultural revolution. The sweeping investigation brought a number of political activists before the tribunal, including Karabekir, the leader of PRP. A number of surviving leaders of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], who were at best second-rank in the Turkish movement, including [[Mehmet Cavit Bey|Cavid]], Ahmed Şükrü, and Ismail Canbulat, were found guilty of treason and hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Touraj Atabaki, Erik Jan Zürcher, 2004, Men of Order: authoritarian modernization under Atatürk and Reza Shah, I.B.Tauris, {{ISBN|1-86064-426-0}}, page 207&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations found a link between the members of the PRP and the Sheikh Said Rebellion. The PRP was dissolved following the outcomes of the trial. The pattern of organized opposition, however, was broken. This action was the only broad political purge during Atatürk's presidency. Mustafa Kemal's saying, "My mortal body will turn into dust, but the Republic of Turkey will last forever," was regarded as a will after the assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsk.mil.tr/eng/Anitkabir/p24.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505055349/http://www.tsk.mil.tr/eng/Anitkabir/p24.html |date=5 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following 1926, Mustafa Kemal introduced a radical departure from previous reformations established by the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Daisy"/&gt; For the first time in history, Islamic law was separated from secular law, and restricted to matters of religion.&lt;ref name="Daisy"&gt;Daisy Hilse Dwyer, (1990), "Law and Islam in the Middle East", page 77, {{ISBN|978-0-89789-151-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal said:

{{bquote|We must liberate our concepts of justice, our laws and our legal institutions from the bonds which, even though they are incompatible with the needs of our century, still hold a tight grip on us.&lt;ref&gt;Atillasoy, Atatürk : The First President and Founder of the Turkish Republic, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 1 March 1926, the Turkish [[Criminal law|penal code]] was passed. It was modelled after the Italian Penal Code. On 4 October 1926, [[Sharia|Islamic courts]] were closed. Establishing the civic law needed time, so Mustafa Kemal delayed the inclusion of the principle of [[laïcité]] until 5 February 1937.

Ottoman practice discouraged social interaction between men and women in keeping with Islamic practice of [[sex segregation and Islam|sex segregation]]. Mustafa Kemal began developing social reforms very early, as was evident in his personal journal. He and his staff discussed issues like abolishing the [[Hijab|veiling of women]] and the integration of women into the outside world. The clue on how he was planning to tackle the issue was stated in his journal in November 1915:

{{bquote|The social change can come by (1) educating capable mothers who are knowledgeable about life; (2) giving freedom to women; (3) a man can change his morals, thoughts, and feelings by leading a common life with a woman; as there is an inborn tendency towards the attraction of mutual affection.&lt;ref name=mango164&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 164&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mustafa Kemal needed a new civil code to establish his second major step of giving freedom to women. The first part was the education of girls and was established with the unification of education. On 4 October 1926, the new Turkish civil code passed. It was modelled after the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. Under the new code, women gained equality with men in such matters as inheritance and divorce. Mustafa Kemal did not consider gender a factor in social organization. According to his view, society marched towards its goal with men and women united. He believed that it was scientifically impossible for him to achieve progress and to become civilized if the gender separation continued as in Ottoman times.&lt;ref&gt;Tüfekçi, ''Universality of Atatürk's philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; During a meeting he declaimed:

{{bquote|''To the women'': Win for us the battle of education and you will do yet more for your country than we have been able to do. It is to you that I appeal.&lt;br /&gt; ''To the men'': If henceforward the women do not share in the social life of the nation, we shall never attain to our full development. We shall remain irremediably backward, incapable of treating on equal terms with the civilizations of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, ''Atatürk: The Rebirth of a Nation'', p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1927, the [[State Art and Sculpture Museum]] ({{lang-tr|Ankara Resim ve Heykel Müzesi}}) opened its doors. The museum highlighted sculpture, which was little practised in Turkey owing to the Islamic tradition of avoiding idolatry. Mustafa Kemal believed that "culture is the foundation of the Turkish Republic,"&lt;ref name=atillasoy15&gt;Atillasoy, ''Atatürk : first president and founder of the Turkish Republic'', 15&lt;/ref&gt; and described modern Turkey's ideological thrust as "a creation of patriotism blended with a lofty humanist ideal." He included both his own nation's creative legacy and what he saw as the admirable values of global civilization. The pre-Islamic [[Turkic peoples|culture of the Turks]] became the subject of extensive research, and particular emphasis was laid upon Turkish culture widespread before the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civilizations. He instigated study of [[History of Anatolia|Anatolian civilizations]]—[[Phrygians]] and [[Lydians]], [[Sumer]]ians and [[Hittites]]. To attract current public attention to past cultures, he personally named the "[[Sümerbank]]" (1932) after the Sumerians, and the "[[Etibank]]" (1935) after the Hittites. He also stressed the folk arts of the countryside as a wellspring of Turkish creativity.

[[File:Ataturk-20 September 1928.jpg|thumb|left|upright|President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk introducing [[Turkish alphabet|the new Turkish alphabet]] to the people of [[Kayseri]] on 20 September 1928]]

In the spring of 1928, Mustafa Kemal met in Ankara with several linguists and professors from all over Turkey where he unveiled to them a plan of his to implement a new alphabet for the written Turkish language based on a modified [[Latin alphabet]]. The new [[Turkish alphabet]] would serve as a replacement for the old [[Arabic script]] and as a solution to the literacy problem in Turkey, as the Arabic script does not feature any [[vowel]]s while [[Turkish phonology#Vowels|the Turkish language has eight]]. When he asked them at how long it would take, in their professional opinion, to implement the new alphabet into the Turkish language, most of the professors and linguists said between three and five years. Mustafa Kemal was said to have scoffed and openly stated, "we shall do it in three to five months".{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Over the next several months, Mustafa Kemal pressed for the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet as well as made public announcements to the upcoming overhaul of the new alphabet. On 1 November 1928 he introduced the new Turkish alphabet and abolished the use of Arabic script. At the time, literate citizens of the country comprised as little as 10% of the population. Dewey noted to Mustafa Kemal that learning how to read and write in Turkish with the Arabic script took roughly three years with rather strenuous methods at the elementary level.&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; They used the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Language]] written in the Arabic script with Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]] loan vocabulary.&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; The creation of the new Turkish alphabet as a variant of the Latin alphabet was undertaken by the ''Language Commission'' ({{lang-tr|Dil Encümeni}}) with the initiative of Mustafa Kemal.&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; The tutelage was received from an Ottoman-Armenian scientist [[Hagop Dilaçar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Türkeş, Atatürk'ün imzasını hatırlattı |url = http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2005/04/25/yazar/dundar.html |quote = Atatürk'ün imzasını bir Ermeni güzel yazı hocasının çizdiğini duymuş muydun? |work = [[Milliyet]] |first = Can |last = Dündar |date = 25 April 2005 |language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Turkish newspapers|Turkish newspaper]] using the new alphabet was published on 15 December 1928.

Mustafa Kemal promoted modern [[teaching method]]s at the primary education level, and Dewey took a place of honour.&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; Dewey presented a paradigmatic set of recommendations designed for developing societies that are moving towards modernity in his "Report and Recommendation for the Turkish educational system."&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; He was interested in [[adult education]] for the goal of forming a [[Skill (labor)|skill base]] in the country. Turkish women were taught not only child care, dress-making and household management, but also skills needed to join the economy outside the home. Turkish education became a state-supervised system, which was designed to create a skill base for the social and economic progress of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Özelli, ''The Evolution of the Formal Educational System and Its Relation to Economic Growth Policies in the First Turkish Republic'', 77–92&lt;/ref&gt; His "unified" education program was designed to educate responsible citizens as well as useful and appreciated members of society.&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; Turkish education became an integrative system, aimed to alleviate poverty and used [[female education]] to establish [[gender equality]]. Atatürk himself put special emphasis on the education of girls and supported [[coeducation]], introducing it at university level in 1923–24 and establishing it as the norm throughout the educational system by 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, ''Atatürk and the Modernization of Turkey'', 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Atatürk's reforms on education made education much more accessible: between 1923 and 1938, the number of students attending primary schools increased by 224% from 342,000 to 765,000, the number of students attending middle schools increased by 12.5 times, from around 6,000 to 74,000 and the number of students attending high schools increased by almost 17 times, from 1,200 to 21,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Kapluhan |first = Erol |year = 2011 |title = Türkiye Cumhuriyeti'nde Atatürk Dönemi Eğitim Politikaları (1923–1938) ve Coğrafya Eğitimi |url =  |accessdate =  |publisher = [[Marmara University]] |type = PhD thesis |language = Turkish |pages = 203–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mustafa Kemal generated media attention to propagate modern education during this period. He instigated official education meetings called "Science Boards" and "Education Summits." to discuss the quality of education, training issues and certain basic educational principles. He said, "our schools [curriculum] should aim to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn and to achieve." He was personally engaged with the development of two textbooks. The first one was ''{{lang-tr|Vatandaş İçin Medeni Bilgiler}}'' (1930). The second, ''Geometry'' (1937), was a text for high schools. The ''Vatandaş İçin Medeni Bilgiler'' (''Civic knowledge for the citizens'') introduced the science of comparative government and explained the means of administering public trust by explaining the rules of governance as applied to the new state institutions.

====Opposition to Mustafa Kemal in 1930–1931====
[[File:Ataturk and Fethi Okyar.jpg|thumb|Mustafa Kemal with the [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] leader [[Ali Fethi Okyar]] and his daughter in [[Yalova]], on 13 August 1930]]
On 11 August 1930, Mustafa Kemal decided to try a multiparty movement once again and asked Ali Fethi Okyar to establish a new party. He insisted on the protection of secular reforms. The brand-new [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] succeeded all around the country. Without the establishment of a real political spectrum, once again, the party became the center to opposition of Atatürk's reforms, particularly in regard to the role of religion in public life.

On 23 December 1930, a chain of violent incidents occurred, starting with the rebellion of Islamic fundamentalists in [[Menemen]], a small town in the Aegean region. This so-called [[Menemen Incident]] was considered a serious threat against secular reforms.

In November 1930, Ali Fethi Okyar dissolved his own party. A more lasting [[multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey]] began in 1945. In 1950, the CHP released the majority position to the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]]. There are arguments that Mustafa Kemal's single party rule did not promote [[direct democracy]]. The reason experiments with [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] failed during this period was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, Mustafa Kemal's biographer [[Andrew Mango]] said: "between the two wars, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies. Atatürk's enlightened authoritarianism left a reasonable space for free private lives. More could not have been expected in his lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 536&lt;/ref&gt; Even though, at times, he did not appear to be a democrat in his actions, he always supported the idea of building a [[civil society]]: a system of voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions as opposed to the force-backed structures of the state. In one of his many speeches about the importance of democracy, Mustafa Kemal said in 1933:

{{bquote|Republic means the democratic administration of the state. We founded the Republic, reaching its tenth year. It should enforce all the requirements of democracy as the time comes.&lt;ref&gt;İnan, ''Atatürk Hakkında Hatıralar ve Belgeler'', 260&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Modernization efforts, 1931–1938====

In 1931, Mustafa Kemal established the [[Turkish Language Association]] for conducting research works in the [[Turkish language]] ({{lang-tr|Türk Dil Kurumu}}). The [[Turkish Historical Society]] ({{lang-tr|Türk Tarih Kurumu}}) was established in 1931, and began maintaining archives in 1932 for conducting research works on the [[history of Turkey]].&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ted.org.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313AAF6AA849816B2EF01E9BE68C047FEF5 |title = About Us |accessdate = 1 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071117232115/http://www.ted.org.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313AAF6AA849816B2EF01E9BE68C047FEF5 |archivedate = 17 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 1928, he established the [[Turkish Education Association]],&lt;ref name="TED" /&gt; which supported intelligent and hard-working children in financial need, as well as making material and scientific contributions to the educational life. In 1933, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk ordered the reorganization of [[Istanbul University]] into a modern institution and later established [[Ankara University]] in the capital city.&lt;ref&gt;Saikal, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qFhU3kWXLvEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ataturk+and+islam&amp;as_brr=1 Democratization in the Middle East: Experiences, Struggles, Challenges]'', 95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ataturk visits a school.jpg|thumb|left|Atatürk visits [[Istanbul University]] after its reorganization with the University Law of 31 May 1933, which introduced [[mixed-sex education]] to the academies, colleges and universities in Turkey.

[[File:Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1936).jpg|thumb|left|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk during a coffee and smoking break, 1936]]

Mustafa Kemal dealt with the translation of scientific [[terminology]] into Turkish.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey"&gt;Geoffrey L. Lewis (1999), The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success, [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-19-823856-8}}-page 66&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted the Turkish language reform to be methodologically based. Any attempt to "cleanse" the Turkish language of foreign influence without modelling the integral structure of the language was inherently wrong to him. He personally oversaw the development of the [[Sun Language Theory]] ({{lang-tr|Güneş Dil Teorisi}}), which was a [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory which proposed that all human languages were descendants of one [[Central Asian]] primal language. His interest started with the works by the French scientist [[Hilaire de Barenton]] titled ''L'Origine des Langues, des Religions et des Peuples'', which postulates that all languages originated from [[hieroglyph]]s and [[cuneiform]] used by Sumerians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Turks Teach New Theories |date = 9 February 1936 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |place = Istanbul }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the paper of Austrian linguist Dr. Hermann F. Kvergić of [[Vienna]] titled "La psychologie de quelques elements des langues Turques" ("the psychology of some elements of the [[Turkic Languages]]").&lt;ref&gt;Laut (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the Sun Language Theory into Turkish political and educational circles in 1935, although he did later correct the more extremist practices.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey"/&gt;

A politician, [[Saffet Arıkan]], who was the head of the [[Turkish Language Association]], said "''Ulu Önderimiz Ata Türk Mustafa Kemal''" (''Our Great Leader Ata Türk Mustafa Kemal'') in the opening speech of the 2nd Language Day on 26 September 1934. Later, the surname "Atatürk" (father of the Turks) accepted as the surname of Mustafa Kemal Pasha after the adoption of the [[Surname Law|Family Surname Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120320030651/http://www.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/592222-gazi-onerilen-14-soyadini-kabul-etmis "Gazi, önerilen 14. soyadını kabul etmiş!"]. ''Habertürk''. Retrieved December 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the Surname Law, Turks did not have surnames but [[laqab]]s only, while Christian and Jewish minorities had used Turkish surnames since Ottoman times.

Beginning in 1932, several hundred "[[People's Houses]]" ({{lang-tr|Halk Evi}}) and "People's Rooms" (Halk Odası) across the country allowed greater access to a wide variety of artistic activities, sports, and other cultural events. Atatürk supported and encouraged the visual and the [[plastic arts]], which had been suppressed by the Ottoman leaders, who regarded depiction of the human form as [[idolatry]]. Many museums opened, architecture began to follow modern trends, and [[Classical period (music)|classical Western music]], opera, and ballet, as well as the theatre, also took greater hold. Book and magazine publications increased as well, and the film industry began to grow.

[[File:Elmalı 35 baskısı.jpg|thumb|The original 1935 print of the first [[List of translations of the Qur'an#Turkish|Quran in Turkish]] language, ordered by Atatürk]]

In 1932, a Qur'an in the Turkish language was read before a live audience and broadcast over the radio.&lt;ref name=cleveland178&gt;Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'', 181&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Mustafa Kemal wanted to "teach religion in Turkish to Turkish people who had been practising Islam without understanding it for centuries"&lt;ref name="Radu"&gt;Michael Radu, (2003), "Dangerous Neighborhood: Contemporary Issues in Turkey's Foreign Relations", page 125, {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0166-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Qur'ans in Turkey at the time were printed in Old Arabic. There was a rare [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] Qu'ran written in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Latin in the tetrapla style, prepared by savant Andrea Acolutho of Bernstadt and printed at Berlin in 1701.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. M. Zwemer]]: [http://www.muhammadanism.org/Quran/translations_koran.pdf Translations of the Koran], The Moslem World, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, three Turkish translations published in Istanbul created controversy. Several renderings of the [[List of translations of the Qur'an#Turkish|Qur'an in the Turkish language]] were read in front of the public.&lt;ref name=cleveland178/&gt; These Turkish Qur'ans were fiercely opposed by religious people. This incident impelled many leading Muslim modernists to call upon the Turkish Parliament to sponsor a Qur'an translation of suitable quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Wilson |first1 = M. Brett |title = The First Translations of the Qur'an in Modern Turkey (1924–1938) |url =  |journal = International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume = 41 |issue = 3 |pages = 419–435 |doi = 10.1017/s0020743809091132 |year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of Mustafa Kemal, the Parliament approved the project and the Directorate of Religious Affairs appointed Mehmet Akif (Ersoy) to compose a [[Qur'an translation]], and an Islamic scholar [[:tr:Elmalılı Hamdi Yazır|Elmalılı Hamdi Yazır]] to author a Turkish language Qur'anic commentary ([[tafsir]]) titled "[[:tr:Hak Dini Kur'an Dili|Hak Dini Kur'an Dili]]." It was only in 1935 that the version read in public found its way to print.&lt;ref&gt;Elmalılı Hamdi Yazır, (1935), "Hak dini Kur'an dili: Yeni mealli Türkçe tefsir" 9 volumes, printed in Istanbul&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal believed that the understanding of religion was too important to be left to a small group of people.&lt;ref name="Radu"/&gt; This included the central [[religious text]] of Islam. Mustafa Kemal's objective was to make the Qu'ran accessible to modern people, and therefore to translate it into modern languages.&lt;ref name="Radu"/&gt;

In 1934, Mustafa Kemal commissioned the first Turkish operatic work, ''Özsoy''. The opera, which was staged at the People's House in Ankara, was composed by [[Adnan Saygun]] and performed by soprano [[Semiha Berksoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Selda |last = Paydak |title = Interview with Semiha Berksoy |url = http://www.deltur.cec.eu.int/english/guncel/ghaber-jan00_18.html |publisher = Representation of the European Commission to Turkey |date = January 2000 |accessdate = 11 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030418082022/http://www.deltur.cec.eu.int/english/guncel/ghaber-jan00_18.html |archivedate = 18 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1934, Atatürk adopted his new signature designed by calligrapher [[Hagop Vahram Çerçiyan]]. It is used as his official signature on Turkish government buildings to this day.

[[File:First female MPs of the Turkish Parliament (1935).jpg|thumb|Eighteen female MPs joined the Turkish Parliament with the 1935 general elections.]]

On 5 December 1934, Turkey moved to grant full political rights to women, before [[Timeline of women's suffrage|several other European nations]]. The equal rights of women in marriage had already been established in the earlier Turkish civil code.&lt;ref&gt;Omur, ''[http://www.theturkishtimes.com/archive/02/12_01/c_women.html Modernity and Islam: Experiences of Turkish Women]''&lt;/ref&gt; Women's place in Mustafa Kemal's cultural reforms was best expressed in the civic book prepared under his supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Atatürk, ''Vatandaş İçin Medeni Bilgiler''&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal said:

{{bquote|There is no logical explanation for the political disenfranchisement of women. Any hesitation and negative mentality on this subject is nothing more than a fading social phenomenon of the past. ...Women must have the right to vote and to be elected; because democracy dictates that, because there are interests that women must defend, and because there are social duties that women must perform.&lt;ref&gt;İnan, ''Medeni bilgiler ve M. Kemal Atatürk'ün el yazıları''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Turkish general election, 1935|1935 elections]] yielded 18 female MPs out of a total of 395 representatives, compared to nine out of 615 members [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|of the British House of Commons]] and six out of 435 in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1934|US House of Representatives]] inaugurated that year.&lt;ref name="commonslibraryblog.com 2013"&gt;{{cite web |title = commonslibraryblog.com |website = commonslibraryblog.com |date = November 18, 2013 |url = http://commonslibraryblog.com/2013/11/18/the-history-and-geography-of-women-mps-since-1918-in-numbers |language = sl |access-date = April 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unification and nationalisation efforts====
When the modern [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] was founded in 1923, nationalism and secularism were two of the founding principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Findley |first = Carter Vaughn |title = Turkey, Islam, nationalism, and modernity : a history, 1789–2007 |year = 2010 |publisher = Yale University Press |location = New Haven, CT |isbn = 978-0-300-15260-9 }}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atatürk aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus devlet) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire.

====Issue of Mosul====
[[File:Abdullah I of Jordan and Kemal Atatürk on 1937.jpg|thumb|During the visit of [[Abdullah I of Jordan]]]]

The "Issue of Mosul", a dispute with the United Kingdom over control of [[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Mosul Province]], was one of the first foreign affairs-related controversies of the new Republic. During the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], [[Lieutenant General]] [[William Marshall (British Army officer)|William Marshall]] followed the British War Office's instruction that "every effort was to be made to score as heavily as possible on the Tigris before the whistle blew", capturing Mosul three days after the signature of the [[Armistice of Mudros]] (30 October 1918).&lt;ref name="britainsoil"&gt;Peter Sluglett, "The Primacy of Oil in Britain's Iraq Policy", in the book "Britain in Iraq: 1914–1932" London: Ithaca Press, 1976, pp. 103–116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the ''[[Misak-ı Milli]]'', which consolidated the "Turkish lands", declared that Mosul Province was a part of the historic Turkish heartland. The British were in a precarious situation with the Issue of Mosul, and were adopting almost equally desperate measures to protect their interests. The [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] was put down by the [[RAF Iraq Command]] during the summer of 1920. From the British perspective, if Mustafa Kemal Atatürk stabilized Turkey, he would then turn his attention to Mosul and penetrate Mesopotamia, where the native population would probably join him thus bringing an insurgent and hostile Muslim nation to the very gates of India.

In 1923, Mustafa Kemal tried to persuade the GNA that accepting the arbitration of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] over Mosul did not mean relinquishing Mosul, but rather waiting for a time when Turkey might be stronger. The artificially drawn border had an unsettling effect on the population on both sides. Later, it was claimed that Turkey began where oil ends, as the border was drawn by the British geophysicists based on the oil reserves. Atatürk did not want this separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.candundar.com.tr/index.php?Did=766 |title = Atatürk yaşasaydı |accessdate = 1 January 2008 |author = Can Dundar |language = Turkish |quote = ... Ata'nın öncelikli dış politika sorununun Musul olduğunu söylüyor.

On 23 January 1923, Lord Curzon argued that the existence of oil was no more than hypothetical.&lt;ref name="britainsoil" /&gt; However, according to Armstrong, "England wanted oil. Mosul and Kurds were the key."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Courtenay Armstrong Gray Wolf, Mustafa Kemal: An Intimate Study of a Dictator. page 225&lt;/ref&gt;

While three inspectors from the League of Nations Committee were sent to the region to oversee the situation in 1924, the [[Sheikh Said rebellion]], beginning in 1924 and escalating until 1927, set out to establish a new government positioned to cut Turkey's link to Mesopotamia. The relationship between the rebels and Britain was questioned. British assistance was sought after the rebels realised that the rebellion, or its expected outcome, could not stand by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Robert W. (1989) The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880–1925, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, the League of Nations formed a three-member committee to study the case while the Sheikh Said Rebellion was on the rise. Partly because of the continuing uncertainties along the northern frontier (present-day northern Iraq), the committee recommended that the region should be connected to Iraq with the condition that the UK would hold the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. By the end of March 1925, the necessary troop movements were completed, and the whole area of the Sheikh Said rebellion was encircled.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 401&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these manoeuvres, the revolt was put down. Britain, Iraq and Kemal made a treaty on 5 June 1926, which mostly followed the decisions of the League Council. In 1926, Kemal faced growing opposition to his reform policies, a continuing precarious economic situation, and a defeat in the Mosul issue. A large section of the Kurdish population and the [[Iraqi Turkmen]] were left on the other side of the border. The Sheikh Said Rebellion hastened both the imposition of the Republican Party and the speed of Atatürk's reforms. In 1925, the population was largely illiterate and disparate. Turkey was in ruins, reconstruction was difficult, poverty was everywhere and people were in pain, which fed separatist violence.&lt;ref&gt;ASD: Speeches and statements by Atatürk, volume I pages 361–363 published by Atatürk Culture, language and history Higher Institute, Ankara 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than to a section of the population, Mustafa Kemal attributed the rebellion to a group of notables, who  on 7 March 1925 were found guilty by the courts (kanunen mucrim olan bazi muteneffizan) and who used the mask of religion to conceal the interests of landlords, feudal tribal leaders and other "reactionaries".&lt;ref name=mangokurds20&gt;Andrew Mango, ''Atatürk and the Kurds'', Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.35, No.4, 1999, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relations with the Russian SFSR/Soviet Union====

[[File:Mustafa Kemal and Voroshilov on 29 October 1933.jpg|thumb|Exchanges on the concept of a Balkan Federation during the visit of [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], a vision of Kemal's which was never achieved]]

In his message to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the Bolshevik leader and head of the [[Russian SFSR]]'s government, dated 26 April 1920, Kemal promised to coordinate his military operations with the Bolsheviks' "fight against [[imperialist]] governments" and requested 5 million [[Turkish lira|lira]] in gold as well as armaments "as first aid" to his forces.&lt;ref name="LetterLenin"&gt;''Международная жизнь'' (the Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minisrty]]'s magazine). Moscow, 1963, № 11, pp. 147–148. The first publication of Kemal's letter to Lenin in excerpts, in Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 alone, the Lenin government supplied the Kemalists with 6,000 rifles, over 5 million rifle cartridges, 17,600 projectiles as well as 200.6&amp;nbsp;kg of gold bullion; in the subsequent 2 years the amount of aid increased.&lt;ref name="AidInfo"&gt;''Международная жизнь''. Moscow, 1963, № 11, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1921, the GNA representatives in Moscow signed the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|"Friendship and Brotherhood" Treaty]] with Soviet Russia, which was a major diplomatic breakthrough for the Kemalists. The Treaty of Moscow, followed by the identical [[Treaty of Kars]] in October the same year, gave Turkey a favourable settlement of its north-eastern frontier at the expense of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], then nominally an independent state.

Relations between the two countries were friendly, but were based on the fact that they were fighting against a common enemy: Britain and the West.&lt;ref name="Yılmaz"/&gt; In 1920, Kemal toyed with the idea of using a state-controlled [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Turkish Communist Party]] to forestall the perceived spread of communist ideas in the country and gain access to the [[Comintern]]'s financing.

"Friendship with Russia," said Mustafa Kemal, "is not to adopt their ideology of communism for Turkey."&lt;ref name="Yılmaz"&gt;Yılmaz Altuğ, Foreign Policy of Atatürk, Atatürk arastirma merkezi dergisi, Vol VI, No 16, November 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He declared: "Communism is a social issue. Social conditions, religion, and national traditions of our country confirm the opinion that Russian Communism is not applicable in Turkey."&lt;ref&gt;Yılmaz Altuğ, Türk Devrim Tarihi Dersim, 1919–1938, 1980 s. p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech on 1 November 1924 he said: "Our amicable relations with our old friend the Soviet Russian Republic are developing and progressing every day. As in past our Republican Government regards genuine and extensive good relations with Soviet Russia as the keystone of our foreign policy."&lt;ref name="Yılmaz"/&gt;

After the Turks, on 16 December 1925, withdrew their delegation from [[Geneva]], thus leaving the League of Nations Council to grant a mandate for the Mosul region to Britain without their consent, Kemal countered&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kinross. ''Atatürk: a biography of Mustafa Kemal, father of modern Turkey''. New York, 1965, p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; by concluding a [[non-aggression pact]] with the USSR on 17 December.&lt;ref&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia|БСЭ]], 1st edition, Moscow, Vol. 55, 1947, column 374.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, the pact was prolonged for another 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia|БСЭ]], 1st edition, Moscow, Vol. 55, 1947, column 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, the Soviet War minister [[Kliment Voroshilov]] visited Turkey and attended the tenth year celebrations of the Republic.&lt;ref name="BalkanFed"&gt;
{{cite news |title = Oh, What Happiness! |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746241-1,00.html |work = Time Magazine |pages = 37–39 |date = 6 November 1933 |accessdate = 7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemal explained his position regarding the realization of his plan for a Balkan Federation economically uniting Turkey, Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="BalkanFed"/&gt;

During the second half of the 1930s, Mustafa Kemal tried to establish a closer relationship with Britain and other major western powers, which caused displeasure on the part of the Soviets. The second edition of the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (Volume 20, 1953) was unequivocally critical of Kemal's policies in the last years of his rule, calling his domestic policies "anti-popular" and his foreign course as aimed at [[rapprochement]] with the "imperialist powers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia|БСЭ]], 2nd edition, Moscow, Vol. 20, 1953, p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkish-Greek alliance====
[[File:AtaturkAndVenizelos.jpg|thumb|President Mustafa Kemal (center) hosting the Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] (at the left) in [[Ankara]], October 1932]]

The post-war leader of Greece, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], was also determined to establish normal relations between the two states. The war had devastated [[Aegean Region|Western Anatolia]], and the financial burden of [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Ottoman Muslim refugees]] from Greece blocked rapprochement. Venizelos moved forward with the agreement despite accusations of conceding too much on the issues of the naval armaments, and the properties of the Ottoman Greeks from Turkey according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;Karamanlis, 1995, p. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt; Kemal resisted the pressures of historic enmities or atrocity-mongering between the societies. In spite of Turkish animosity against the Greeks, Kemal showed acute sensitivity to even the slightest allusion to these tensions; at one point, he ordered the removal of a painting showing a Turkish soldier plunging his bayonet to a Greek soldier by stating, "What a revolting scene!".&lt;ref&gt;Sosyal, Ismail, 1983, "Turkey's Diplomatic treaties", TTK, Ankara page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, many Greeks consider the reconciliation with Turkey among the greatest foreign policy achievements of Venizelos' final term as Prime Minister. Greece renounced all its claims over Turkish territory and the two sides concluded an agreement on 30 April 1930. On 25 October, Venizelos visited Turkey, and signed a treaty of friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Clogg |first = Richard |title = A Concise History of Greece |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-521-00479-4 }} p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Venizelos even forwarded Atatürk's name for the 1934 [[Nobel Peace Prize]],&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;Nobel Foundation. ''The Nomination Database for the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Prize in Peace]], 1901–1955''.[http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?action=show&amp;showid=2046]&lt;/ref&gt; Even after his fall from power, Greco-Turkish relations remained cordial. Indeed, Venizelos' successor [[Panagis Tsaldaris]] came to visit Atatürk in September 1933 and signed a more comprehensive agreement called the ''Entente Cordiale'' between Greece and Turkey, which was a stepping stone for the [[Balkan Pact]].

Greek Premier [[Ioannis Metaxas]] said of Atatürk and the Turkish-Greek alliance, that "...Greece, which has the highest estimation of the renowned leader, heroic soldier, and enlightened creator of Turkey. We will never forget that President Atatürk was the true founder of the Turkish-Greek alliance based on a framework of common ideals and peaceful cooperation. He developed ties of friendship between the two nations which it would be unthinkable to dissolve. Greece will guard its fervent memories of this great man, who determined an unalterable future path for the noble Turkish nation."

====Neighbours to the east====

From 1919, Afghanistan was in the midst of a [[reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war|reformation period]] under [[Amānullāh Khān|Amanullah Khan]]. Afghan Foreign Minister [[Mahmud Tarzi]] was a follower of Mustafa Kemal's domestic policy. He encouraged [[Amanullah Khan]] in social and political reform but urged that reforms should build upon the basis of a strong government. During the late 1920s, Anglo-Afghan relations soured over British fears of an Afghan-Soviet friendship. On 20 May 1928, Anglo-Afghan politics gained a positive perspective, when Amanullah Khan and the Queen were received by Mustafa Kemal in Constantinople. This meeting was followed by a Turkey-Afghanistan Friendship and Cooperation pact on 22 May 1928. Mustafa Kemal supported Afghanistan's integration into international organizations. In 1934, Afghanistan's relations with the international community gained a huge boost when it joined the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The American Journal of International Law |last = Jentleson |first = Bruce W. |author2 = Paterson, Thomas G. |year = 1997 |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 978-0-19-511055-5 |page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, King [[Zahir Shah]] became a signatory of the Treaty of Saadabad. Mahmud Tarzi received Mustafa Kemal's personal support until he died on 22 November 1933 in Istanbul.

Mustafa Kemal and [[Reza Shah]] had a common approach regarding [[British imperialism]] and its influence in their region, creating a slow but continuous rapprochement between Ankara and Tehran. Both governments sent diplomatic missions and messages of friendship to each other during the Turkish War of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;Narli, Nilüfer (1993): "Turco-Iranian Relations from the Islamic Revolution to Gulf War and Beyond: Co-operation or Competition in the Muslim World".

''Middle East Review of International Affairs'' Volume 7, No. 3 – September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The relations were strained after the abolishment of the Caliphate. Iran's [[Shi'a clergy]] did not accept Kemal's position. Iranian religious power centres perceived the real motive behind Atatürk's reforms was to undermine the power of the clergy.&lt;ref name="iran" /&gt; By the mid-1930s, Reza Shah's efforts had upset the clergy throughout Iran, thus widening the gap between religion and government.&lt;ref&gt;Rajaee, Farhang, ''[http://webstorage1.mcpa.virginia.edu/library/mc/forums/published/americanvalues13.pdf Islamic Values and World View: Farhang Khomeyni on Man, the State and International Politics, Volume XIII] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326213807/http://webstorage1.mcpa.virginia.edu/library/mc/forums/published/americanvalues13.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}'' (PDF), University Press of America. {{ISBN|0-8191-3578-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal feared the occupation and dismemberment of Iran as a multi-ethnic/multi-tribal society by Russia or Great Britain.&lt;ref name="iran" /&gt; Like Mustafa Kemal, Reza Shah wanted to secure Iran's borders. Reza Shah visited him in 1934. In 1935, the draft of what would become the [[Treaty of Saadabad]] was paragraphed in Geneva, but the signing of it was delayed because of the [[Iran-Iraq border|border dispute between Iran and Iraq]]. Iran challenged the validity of both the Treaty of Erzerum and the Constantinople Protocol in 1934.

[[File:Faisal I of Iraq and Mustafa Kemal Ankara Depot on 1931.jpg|thumb|Atatürk with King [[Faisal I of Iraq]] in Ankara, 1931]]

On 8 July 1937, Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan signed the [[Treaty of Saadabad|Saadabad Pact]] at [[Tehran]]. The signatories undertook to preserve their common frontiers, to consult together in all matters of common interest and to commit no aggression against one another's territory. The treaty united the Afghan king's call for greater Oriental-Middle Eastern cooperation, Reza Shah's goal in securing relations with Turkey that would help Iran free itself from Soviet and British influence, and Mustafa Kemal's foreign policy of securing stability in the region. The immediate outcome was to deter Mussolini from adventures in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 510&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkish Straits====
[[File:King Edward VIII and President Kemal Atatürk.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Atatürk with King [[Edward VIII]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in [[Istanbul]], 4 September 1936]]

On 24 July 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] included the Lausanne Straits Agreement. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the [[Dardanelles]] should remain open to all commercial vessels: seizure of foreign military vessels was subject to certain limitations during peacetime, and, even as a neutral state, Turkey could not limit any military passage during wartime. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the waterway was to be demilitarized, and its management left to the Straits Commission. The demilitarized zone heavily restricted Turkey's domination and sovereignty over the Straits. The defence of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] was impossible without having the sovereignty over the water that passed through it.

In March 1936, Hitler's reoccupation of the [[Rhineland]] gave Mustafa Kemal the opportunity to resume full control over the Straits. "The situation in Europe", he declared "is highly appropriate for such a move. We shall certainly achieve it".&lt;ref&gt;Sosyal, Ismail, 1983, "Turkey's Diplomatic treaties", TTK, Ankara page 493&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tevfik Rüştü Aras]], who was the foreign minister, initiated a move to revise the Straits' regime. Aras claimed that he was directed by the President, rather than his Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü. İnönü was worried about harming relations with Britain, France, and Balkan neighbors over the Straits. However, the signatories agreed to join the conference, since unlimited military passage had become unfavourable to Turkey with the changes in world politics. Mustafa Kemal demanded that the members of the Turkish Foreign Office devise a solution that would transfer full control over the waterway to Turkey.

On 20 July 1936, the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits|Montreux Convention]] was signed, with the participation of Bulgaria, Great Britain, Australia, France, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Greece. It became the primary instrument governing the passage of commercial and war vessels through the Dardanelles Strait. It was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|GNAT]] on 31 July 1936. It went into effect on 9 November 1936, and is still valid today.

====Balkan Pact====
[[File:Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Mustafa Kemal in 1933.jpg|thumb|During the visit of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in 1931]]

Until the early 1930s, Turkey followed a modern neutral foreign policy with the West by developing joint friendship and neutrality agreements. These bilateral agreements were aligned with Mustafa Kemal's worldview. By the end of 1925, Turkey had signed fifteen joint agreements with Western states.

In the early 1930s, changes and developments in world politics required Turkey to make multilateral agreements to improve its security. Mustafa Kemal strongly believed that a close cooperation between the Balkan states based on the principle of equality would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries, and had formed a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the mid-1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. [[Benito Mussolini]] had frequently proclaimed his intention to make the entire Mediterranean ''[[Mare Nostrum]]''. Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.

The [[Balkan Pact]] was negotiated by Mustafa Kemal with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This mutual-defence agreement intended to guarantee the signatories' territorial integrity and political independence against attack by another Balkan state such as Bulgaria or Albania. It countered the increasingly aggressive foreign policy of fascist Italy and the effect of a potential Bulgarian alignment with Nazi Germany. Mustafa Kemal thought of the Balkan Pact as a medium of balance in the relations with the European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Yilmaz Altuð, "Atatürk'ün Dis Politikasý," B.Ü. Uluslararasi Atatürk Konferansý Tebligleri, 10–11 November 1980, Vol. II, Istanbul 1981, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly anxious to establish a region of security and alliances in the west of Turkey and in Balkan Europe, which would extend as far as [[Dobruja]].&lt;ref&gt;Þevket Süreyya Aydemir, Tek Adam, Vol. 3, Ýstanbul 1988, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atatürk, Stojadinović, Metaxas, Comnen. Ankara, March 1938 (Koncern Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny).png|thumb|Atatürk with Greek Prime Minister [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (second from right) at the Balkan Pact summit in Ankara, March 1938]]

The Balkan Pact provided for regular military and diplomatic consultations. It was regarded as a significant step forward in consolidating the free world's position in southeast Europe, although it contained no specific military commitments. The importance of the agreement was best displayed in the message which Atatürk sent to the Greek Premier, [[Ioannis Metaxas]]:

{{bquote|The borders of the allies in the Balkan Pact are a single border. Those who covet this border will encounter the burning beams of the sun. I recommend avoiding this. The forces that defend our borders are a single and inseparable force.&lt;ref&gt;Atatürk'ün Milli Dýþ Politikasý, Vol. 2, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was signed by GNA on 28 February The Greek and Yugoslav Parliaments ratified the agreement a few days after. The unanimously ratified Balkan pact became a reality on 18 May 1935 and lasted until 1940.

The Balkan Pact turned out to be ineffective for reasons that were beyond Atatürk's control. What he wanted to prevent with the Balkan Pact was realized by Bulgaria's attempt to put the [[Dobruja]] issue into the agenda after a series of international events ending with the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] on 7 April 1939. These [[Causes of World War II|conflicts]] spread rapidly, triggering World War II. The goal of Atatürk, to protect southeast Europe, failed with the dissolution of the pact. The only state which arose intact after the war was Atatürk's Republic of Turkey.

====Issue of Hatay====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Kemal Ataturk congratulation of the Hatay's decision.png|thumb|Telegram sent by Atatürk after the local legislative assembly accepted his proposal for the [[Hatay State]]'s flag]]

Turkish Prime-Minister [[İsmet İnönü]] was very conscious of foreign policy issues. During the second half of the 1930s, Atatürk tried to form a closer relationship with Britain. The risks of this policy change put the two men at odds. The Hatay issue and the Lyon agreement were two important developments in foreign policy that played a significant role in the severing of relations between Atatürk and İnönü.

In 1936, Atatürk raised the "Issue of Hatay" at the League of Nations. [[Hatay State|Hatay]] was based on the old administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire called the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]]. On behalf of the League of Nations, the representatives of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey prepared a constitution for Hatay, which established it as an autonomous [[sanjak]] within Syria. Despite some inter-ethnic violence, in the midst of 1938 an election was conducted by the local legislative assembly. The cities of [[Antakya]] (Antioch) and [[İskenderun]] (Alexandretta) joined Turkey in 1939.

===Economic policies===
:''For conceptual analysis, see [[Atatürk's Reforms#Economic reforms|Economic reforms]]''
Mustafa Kemal instigated economic policies to develop small and large scale businesses, but also to create social strata (industrial bourgeoisie along with the [[peasantry]] of Anatolia) that were virtually non-existent during the Ottoman Empire. The primary problem faced by the politics of his period was the lag in the development of political institutions and social classes which would steer such social and economic changes.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, ''Political Order in Changing Societies'', 347–357&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal's vision regarding early Turkish economic policy was apparent during the [[İzmir Economic Congress]] of 1923 which was established before the signing of the [[Lausanne Treaty]]. The initial choices of Mustafa Kemal's economic policies reflected the realities of his period. After World War I, due to the lack of any real potential investors to open private sector factories and develop industrial production, Kemal established many state-owned factories for agriculture, machinery, and textile industries.

====State intervention, 1923–1929====

[[File:Atatürk Nazilli Basma Fabrikası'nın açılışında (1937).jpg|thumb|Atatürk and [[Celâl Bayar]] visiting the Sümerbank Nazilli Cotton Factory, which was established as a part of the cotton-related industry]]

Mustafa Kemal and [[İsmet İnönü]]'s pursuit of state-controlled economical policies was guided by a national vision; their goal was to knit the country together, eliminate the foreign control of the economy, and improve communications within Turkey. Resources were channeled away from Constantinople, a trading port with international foreign enterprises, in favor of other, less developed cities, in order to establish a more balanced development throughout the country.&lt;ref name=mango470&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 470&lt;/ref&gt;

For Mustafa Kemal, as for his supporters, tobacco remained wedded to his policy in the pursuit of economic independence. [[Turkish tobacco]] was an important industrial crop, while its cultivation and manufacture had been French monopolies under [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies: the "[[Regie Company]]" and "Narquileh Tobacco".&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire had given the tobacco monopoly to the [[Ottoman Bank]] as a limited company under the "[[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Council of the Public Debt]]". Regie, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over production, storing, and distribution (including export) with an unchallenged price control. Consequently, Turkish farmers were dependent on the company for their livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |title = Tütün, İçki ve Tekel |language = Turkish |date = 29 January 2003 |accessdate = 10 October 2007 |last = Aysu |first = Abdullah |publisher = BİA Haber Merkezi |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015212242/http://bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |archivedate = 15 October 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, this company was taken over by the state and named "[[Tekel]]". The control of tobacco was the biggest achievement of the Kemalist political machinery's "[[nationalization]]" of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. They accompanied this achievement with the development of the cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second biggest industrial crop in Turkey at the time.

In 1924, with the initiative of Mustafa Kemal, the first Turkish bank [[İş Bankası]] was established. He was the first member of İş Bankası. The bank's creation was a response to the growing need for a truly national establishment and the birth of a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated as a result of policies providing savings incentives, and, where necessary, extending resources which could trigger industrial impetus.

In 1927, [[Turkish State Railways]] was established. Because Mustafa Kemal considered the development of a national [[Rail transport|rail network]] as another important step in industrialization, it was given high priority. This institution developed an extensive railway network in a very short time. In 1927, Kemal also ordered the integration of road construction goals into development plans. Prior to this, the road network had consisted of 13,885&amp;nbsp;km of ruined surface roads, 4,450&amp;nbsp;km of stabilized roads, and 94 bridges. In 1935, a new entity was established under the government called "Şose ve Köprüler Reisliği" which would drive development of new roads after World War II. However, in 1937, the 22,000&amp;nbsp;km of roads in Turkey augmented the railways.

The national group{{Clarify|date=December 2008}}, which had Mustafa Kemal as the leader, developed many projects within the first decade of the republic. However, the Turkish economy was still largely agrarian, with primitive tools and methods; roads and transportation facilities were far from sufficient and management of the economy was inefficient. The [[Great Depression]] brought many changes to this picture.

====Great Depression, 1929–1931====
[[File:Mustafa Kemal surveying the model of the quarter of Ministries.jpg|thumb|Atatürk supported large-scale government subsidized industrial complexes, such as [[Sümerbank]], increasingly after the [[Great Depression]].]]
The young republic, like the rest of the world, found itself in a deep economic crisis during the [[Great Depression]]. Mustafa Kemal reacted to conditions of this period by moving toward integrated economic policies, and establishing a central bank to control exchange rates. However, Turkey could not finance essential imports; its currency was shunned and zealous revenue officials seized the meagre possessions of peasants who could not pay their taxes.&lt;ref name=mango470/&gt;

In 1929, Mustafa Kemal signed a treaty that resulted in the [[debt restructuring|restructuring of the nation's debt]] with the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]]. He did not fault the Ottoman debt. He had to deal with the turbulent economic issues of the Great Depression along with the payment of the high debt known as the [[Ottoman public debt]]. Until the early 1930s, Turkish private business could not acquire exchange credits. It was impossible to integrate the Turkish economy without a solution to this problem. This increased the credibility of the new Republic.

In 1931, Mustafa Kemal's intention to establish the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] was realized. The bank's primary purpose was to have control over the exchange rate, and [[Ottoman Bank]]'s role during its initial years as a central bank was phased out. Later specialized banks such as the [[Sümerbank]] (1932) and the [[Etibank]] (1935) were founded.

From the [[political economy]] perspective, Mustafa Kemal had to face the same problems which all countries faced: political upheaval. The establishment of a new party with a different economic perspective was needed; he asked Ali Fethi Okyar to fulfil. The [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] (August 1930) came out with a liberal program and proposed that state monopolies should be ended, foreign capital should be attracted, and that state investment should be curtailed. Mustafa Kemal supported İnönü's point of view: "it is impossible to attract foreign capital for essential development." In 1931, he proclaimed: "In the economic area ...the programme of the party is statism."&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim Kaya, Social Theory and Later Modernities, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effect of free republicans was felt strongly and state intervention became more moderate, more akin to a form of [[state capitalism]]. One of his radical left-wing supporters, [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu]] from the [[Kadro]] (The Cadre) movement, claimed that Mustafa Kemal found a third way between capitalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 478&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberalization and planned growth, 1931–1939====

The first (1929–1933) and second five-year economic plans were performed under the supervision of Mustafa Kemal. The first five-year economic plan promoted consumer substitution industries. However, these economic plans changed drastically with the death of Kemal and the rise of World War II. Subsequent governments took measures that harmed the economic productivity of Turkey in various ways.&lt;ref name=etatism&gt;Barlas, ''Etatism and Diplomacy in Turkey: Economic and Foreign Policy Strategies in an Uncertain World, 1929–1939''&lt;/ref&gt; The achievements of the 1930s were credited to early (1920s) implementation of the economic system based on the national policies of Mustafa Kemal and his team.&lt;ref&gt;Emrence, ''Turkey in economic crisis (1927–1930): a panoramic vision. Journal Middle Eastern Studies''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Mustafa Kemal watched the first national aircraft, MMV-1, develop. He realized the important role of aviation. In his words, "the future lies in the skies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate = 26 November 2007 |url = http://www.thy.com/en-INT/skylife/archive/en/2000_1/konu10.htm#1 |title = Skylife }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkish Aeronautical Association]] was founded on 16 February 1925 by his directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate = 26 November 2007 |url = http://www.thk.org.tr/yeni/tarihce/tarihceeng.htm |title = History of Turkish Aeronautical Association |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219112235/http://www.thk.org.tr/yeni/tarihce/tarihceeng.htm |archivedate = 19 December 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered the establishment of the Turkish Aircraft Association Lottery. Instead of the traditional raffle prizes, this new lottery paid money prizes. Most of the lottery income was used to establish a new factory and fund aviation projects. Mustafa Kemal did not live to see the flight of the first Turkish military aircraft built at that factory. Operational American [[Curtiss Hawk]] fighters were being produced soon after his death and before the onset of World War II.

In 1932, liberal economist [[Celal Bayar]] became the Minister of Economy at Mustafa Kemal's request and served until 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Dilek Barlas, Etatism and Diplomacy in Turkey: Economic and Foreign Policy Strategies p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the country moved toward a mixed economy with its first private initiatives. Textile, sugar, paper and steel factories (financed by a loan from Britain) were the private sectors of the period. Besides these government owned power plants, banks, and insurance companies were established.

In 1935, the first Turkish cotton print factory "Nazilli [[Calico (textile)|Calico]] print factory" opened. Cotton planting was promoted to furnish raw material for future factory settlements, part of the industrialization process.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Turkey of Atatürk: Social Process in the Turkish Reformation'', 260&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazilli]] became a major center beginning with the establishment of [[cotton mill]]s and was followed by a calico print factory by 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Doğan, ''Formation of factory settlements within Turkish industrialization and modernization in 1930s: Nazilli printing factory''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313679A66406202CCB09837F9A3538A2623 |title = Aydın – Historical Ruins |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070907003309/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313679A66406202CCB09837F9A3538A2623 |archivedate = 7 September 2007 |df = dmy-all |author = Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Culture and Tourism |publisher = T.C.

In 1936 [[Nuri Demirağ]] established the first Turkish aircraft factory in the [[Beşiktaş]] district of [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=Demirag&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nuridemirag.com/fotograf.asp |title = Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory |publisher = Nuridemirag.com |accessdate = 10 November 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120721214917/http://www.nuridemirag.com/fotograf.asp |archivedate = 21 July 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Turkish airplanes, [[Nuri Demirağ Nu D.36|Nu D.36]] and [[Nuri Demirağ Nu D.38|Nu D.38]], were produced in this factory.&lt;ref name=Demirag/&gt;

On 25 October 1937, Atatürk appointed [[Celal Bayar]] as the prime minister of the 9th government. Integrated economic policies reached their peak with the signing of the 1939 Treaty with Britain and France.&lt;ref name=etatism/&gt; This signaled a turning point in Turkish history.&lt;ref name=etatism/&gt; It was the first step towards an alliance with the "West".&lt;ref name=etatism/&gt; Celal Bayar served as prime minister until Atatürk's death. The differences of opinion between İsmet İnönü (state control) and Celal Bayar (liberal) came to the forefront after İnönü became president in 1938. On 25 January 1939, Prime Minister Bayar resigned.

Mustafa Kemal supported the establishment of the automobile industry. He wanted it to become a center in the region. The motto of the [[Turkish automobile association]] was: "The Turkish driver is a man of the most exquisite sensitivities."&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Norman "Talking Turkey". National Interest, Fall2000, Issue 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1935, Turkey was becoming an industrial society on the Western European model set out by Atatürk.&lt;ref name=5year&gt;Eastham, ''The Turkish Development Plan: The First Five Years'', 132–136&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, most regions of Turkey had viable micro-economic stability and some macro economic stability. These signs of sound economic policies were marked by the first-ever emergence of local banks. However, the gap between Mustafa Kemal's goals and the achievements of the socio-political structure of the country was not closed.&lt;ref name=5year/&gt;

[[File:Latife Hanım ve Mustafa Kemal.jpg|thumb|left|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his wife [[Latife Uşşaki|Latife Uşakizâde]] during a trip to [[Bursa]], 1923]]

Mustafa Kemal's name is associated with four women: [[Eleni Karinte]], Fikriye Hanım, Dimitrina Kovacheva&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSUDaIwQ0UQC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=Dimitrina+Kovaceva+Ataturk&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I-IAUZrUC8im4ATXrICYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Dimitrina%20Kovaceva%20Ataturk&amp;f=false Atatürk: Eine Biographie, Klaus Kreiser, C.H.Beck, 2011], {{ISBN|3406619789}}, p. 80, (Ger.)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Latife Uşaklıgil]]. Little is known of Mustafa Kemal's relationship with Eleni, who fell in love with him while he was a student in Bitola, Macedonia (Manastır in Turkish) but the relationship inspired a play by the Macedonian writer Dejan Dukovski, later filmed by Aleksandar Popovski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942808/ |title = Balkan Is Not Dead |date = 9 August 2012 |work = IMDb |accessdate = 12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fikriye was a nominal cousin of Mustafa Kemal, though not related by blood (his stepfather Ragıp Bey's sister's daughter). Fikriye grew passionately attached to Mustafa Kemal; the full extent of his feelings for her is unclear but it is certain that they became very close after Fikriye divorced her Egyptian husband and returned to Istanbul. During the War of Independence, she lived with him in Çankaya, Ankara as his personal assistant. However, after the Turkish army entered İzmir in 1922, Mustafa Kemal met Latife while staying at the house of her father, the shipping magnate Muammer Uşakizade (later Uşaklı). Latife fell in love with Mustafa Kemal; again the extent to which this was reciprocated is unknown, but he was certainly impressed by Latife's intellect: she was a graduate of the [[Sorbonne]] and was studying English in London when the war broke out. On 29 January 1923, they were married. Latife was jealous of Fikriye and demanded that she leave the house in Çankaya; Fikriye was devastated and immediately left in a carriage. According to official accounts, she shot herself with a pistol Mustafa Kemal had given her as a present; however, it was rumoured that she was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://atam.webnode.com/anasayfa/biografi/ataturk%E2%80%99un%20ozel%20hayat%C4%B1%20/ |title = Atatürk'ün Özel Hayatı |year = 2008 |work = Atatürk |accessdate = 12 November 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121231222800/http://atam.webnode.com/anasayfa/biografi/ataturk%E2%80%99un%20ozel%20hayat%C4%B1%20/ |archivedate = 31 December 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The triangle of Mustafa Kemal, Fikriye and Latife became the subject of a manuscript by his close friend, Salih Bozok which remained unpublished until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Latife ve Fikriye İki Aşk Arasında Atatürk |first = İsmet |last = Bozdağ |publisher = Truva Yayınları |location = Istanbul |year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Latife was briefly and literally the face of the new Turkish woman, appearing in public in Western clothing with her husband.&lt;ref name="latife1"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-in-the-21st-century-the-legacy-of-mrs-ataturk-6096702.html |title = Turkey in the 21st century: The Legacy Of Mrs Ataturk |accessdate = 29 September 2007 |date = 1 July 2006 |first = Pelin |last = Turgut |work = The Independent |location = UK |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060718072149/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article1152032.ece |archivedate = 2006-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their marriage was not happy; after frequent arguments they were divorced on 5 August 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Crescent and the Couch: Cross-Currents Between Islam and Psychoanalysis |last = Akhtar |first = Salman |year = 2008 |publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn = 978-0-7657-0574-7 |page = 68 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==

[[File:Atatürk'ün cenazesi.png|thumb|right|A view from the state funeral of Atatürk, November 1938]]
During 1937, indications that Atatürk's health was worsening started to appear. In early 1938, while he was on a trip to [[Yalova]], he suffered from a serious illness. He went to Istanbul for treatment, where he was diagnosed with [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. During his stay in Istanbul, he made an effort to keep up with his regular lifestyle for a while. He died on 10 November 1938, at the age of 57, in the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], where he spent his last days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turizm.gov.tr/TR/Genel/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF62979E318A6960C3 Atatürk'ün Hayatı] (Atatürk's Life). [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)]] {{tr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The clock in the bedroom where he died is still set to the time of his death, 9:05 in the morning.

Atatürk's funeral called forth both sorrow and pride in Turkey, and 17 countries sent special representatives, while nine contributed armed detachments to the [[cortège]].&lt;ref name=mango526&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 526&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal's remains were originally laid to rest in the [[Ethnography Museum of Ankara]], and transferred on 10 November 1953, 15 years after his death in a 42-ton [[sarcophagus]], to a mausoleum that overlooks Ankara,&lt;ref name=burial&gt;{{cite news |title = The Burial of Atatürk |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860125,00.html |work = Time Magazine |pages = 37–39 |date = 23 November 1953 |accessdate = 7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anıtkabir]].

In his [[will (law)|will]], Atatürk donated all of his possessions to the Republican People's Party, providing that the yearly interest of his funds would be used to look after his sister Makbule and his adopted children, and fund the higher education of the children of İsmet İnönü. The remainder of this yearly interest was willed to the [[Turkish Language Association]] and the [[Turkish Historical Society]].

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is commemorated by many memorials throughout Turkey, such as the [[Atatürk International Airport]] in Istanbul, the [[Atatürk Bridge]] over the [[Golden Horn]] (Haliç), the [[Atatürk Dam]], and [[Atatürk Olympic Stadium|Atatürk Stadium]]. Atatürk statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by Turkish Government, and most towns have their own memorial to him.

In the last week of October 2010, a German company, following a request from the Turkish Internet Board, exploited YouTube automatic copyright-enforcement mechanism to take down the videos. On 30 October, shortly after the removal, a court lifted the ban. But a few days later, Google concluded that the videos did not infringe copyright and restored them on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/02/google_reposts_ataturk_insulting_youtube_videos/ |title = Google defies Turkey, reinstates Atatürk insult videos |publisher = Theregister.co.uk |accessdate = 6 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page 172.&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal term from [[common law|common-law]] jurisdictions referring to the various published collections of reports of [[English law|English cases]] in various courts from the Middle Ages to the 1860s, when law reporting was officially taken over by the [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting]], for example [[Edmund F. Moore]]'s ''Reports of Cases Heard and Determined by the Judicial Committee and the Lords of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council on Appeal from the Supreme and Sudder Dewanny Courts in the East Indies'' published in London from 1837 to 1873, referred to as ''[[Moore's Indian Appeals]]'' and cited for example as: ''Moofti Mohummud Ubdoollah'' v. ''Baboo Mootechund'' 1 M.I.A. 383.

Most (but not all) are reprinted in the [[English Reports]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], Learning the Law, 11th Edition, 1982, Stevens, p.34; 13th Edition, 2006, Sweet and Maxwell, p.36 (less clear)&lt;/ref&gt;

They are described as "nominate" in order to distinguish them from the [[Year Books]], which are anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Adrian. In R G Logan (editor). [[Information Sources in Law]]. Butterworths. London. 1986. p 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Notes on Nursing: What it is and What it is Not''''' is a book first published by [[Florence Nightingale]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nightingale|first= Florence |author-link= Florence Nightingale |title=Notes on Nursing: What it is and What it is Not |place= London |publisher= Harrison|url=https://archive.org/details/NotesOnNursingByFlorenceNightingale |year=1859 |accessdate= 28 November 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nightingale|first= Florence |author-link= Florence Nightingale |title=Notes on Nursing: What it is and What it is Not |place= London |edition= 2nd |publisher= Harrison|url=https://archive.org/details/notesonnursingw01nighgoog/page/n6 |year=1860 |accessdate= 29 November 2018 |via= Internet Archive  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/women/article-9404148 Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Women's History]&lt;/ref&gt; A 76-page volume with 3 page appendix published by Harrison of Pall Mall, it was intended to give hints on [[nursing]] to those entrusted with the [[health]] of others. Florence Nightingale stressed that it was not meant to be a comprehensive guide from which to teach one's self to be a nurse but to help in the [[Nursing practice|practice]] of treating others.

In her introduction to the 1974 edition, Joan Quixley, then head of the [[Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery|Nightingale School of Nursing]], wrote that despite the passage of time since ''Notes on Nursing'' was published, "the book astonishes one with its relevance to modern attitudes and skills in nursing, whether this be practised at home by the 'ordinary woman', in hospital or in the community. The social, economic and professional differences of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in no way hinder the young student or pupil from developing, if he or she is motivated to do so, its unchanged fundamentals by way of intelligent thought and practice". "With its mid-nineteenth century background of poverty, neglect, ignorance and prejudice the book was a challenge to contemporary views of nursing, of nurses and of the patient". "The book was the first of its kind ever to be written. It appeared at a time when the simple rules of health were only beginning to be known, when its topics were of vital importance not only for the well-being and recovery of patients, when hospitals were riddled with infection, when nurses were still mainly regarded as ignorant, uneducated persons. The book has, inevitably, its place in the history of nursing, for it was written by the founder of modern nursing".&lt;ref name="FlorenceNightingale"&gt;{{cite book | title= Notes on Nursing: What it is and what it is not | last= Nightingale| first= Florence|authorlink=Florence Nightingale | chapter=Introduction by Joan Quixley| editor=…| year= 1974 |origyear= First published 1859 | publisher= Blackie &amp; Son Ltd.| location= Glasgow &amp; London|isbn=0-216-89974-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book included advice and practices for the following areas:
*ventilation and warming
*health in houses
*petty management (how things are done by others when you must be away)
*noise
*variety (environment)
*taking food and what kinds of food
*bed and bedding
*light
*cleanliness of rooms
*personal cleanliness
*chattering hopes and advices (the false assurances and recommendations of family and friends to the sick)
*observation of the sick

Later editions of ''Notes on Nursing'' are available to the public today.

[[File:Flag of the UNIA.svg|thumb|The [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]] or [[Black nationalism|Black Nationalist]] ([[Garveyism|Garveyist]]) flag.]]
The '''Pan-African colours''' are: [[green]], [[Gold (color)|gold]] (not yellow, despite its appearance), and [[red]] (inspired by the [[flag of Ethiopia]]).  

Red, [[black]], and green are the colours of [[Black nationalism|Black Nationalism]], which should not be taken for a symbol of [[Pan-Africanism]]. It is often confused as such, given the political tendency’s support of Black [[self-determination]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shelby|first=Tommie|date=2003-10|title=Two Conceptions of Black Nationalism|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0090591703252826|journal=Political Theory|language=en|volume=31|issue=5|pages=664–692|doi=10.1177/0090591703252826|issn=0090-5917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are used in [[flag]]s and other emblems of various countries and territories in [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]] to represent [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] ideology. The [[Rastafarianism|Rastafarian]] movement and many Pan-African organisations also often employ the colours for their activities.

==The Ethiopian colours==
{{Pan-African}}
[[Green]], [[Yellow (color)|gold]] and [[red]] are now found on the [[national flag]]s of many African nations.
The colour combination was borrowed from the [[flag of Ethiopia]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Ethiopian flag has influenced the flags of many Pan-African organizations and polities. Except for a brief period of occupation by [[Italy]] under the [[Fascism|Fascists]], Ethiopia remained outside European control during the colonial era by defeating the Italian army at the battle of Adwa, Ethiopia, in 1896. As a result, the country drew the admiration of many newly independent states in Africa. The adoption of the Ethiopian [[national colours]] by many Pan-African entities is a consequence of this. The first African state to adopt a red, gold and green flag upon independence was [[Ghana]] in 1957.

==The UNIA colours==
{{main|Pan-African flag}}
The [[UNIA]] founded by [[Marcus Garvey]] has a constitution which defines red, black, and green as the Pan-African colours: "red representing the noble blood that unites all people of African ancestry, the colour black for the people, green for the rich land of Africa."{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The [[Pan-African flag|UNIA flag]] was designated the official colours of Black Africans by the UNIA at its convention in [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] on August 13, 1920 in [[New York City]], [[United States]].

==Current country flags with the Pan-African symbolism==

The '''''petit appartement du roi''''' ({{IPA-fr|pɛˈtit‿apaʁtəˈmɑ̃dyʁwa|lang|}}) of the [[Palace of Versailles]] is a suite of rooms used by [[Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]], [[Louis&amp;nbsp;XV]], and [[Louis&amp;nbsp;XVI]].  Located on the first floor of the palace, the rooms are found in the oldest part of the palace dating from the reign of [[Louis XIII]].  Under [[Louis XIV]], these rooms housed the king’s collections of artworks and books, forming a museum of sorts. Under [[Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI]], the rooms were modified to accommodate private living quarters. At this time, the rooms were transformed and their decoration represent some of the finest extant examples of the ''[[Louis Quinze|style Louis XV]]'' and ''[[style Louis XVI]]'' at Versailles (Kimball, 1943).

==Louis XIV==

Beginning in 1678, [[Louis XIV]] began to modify these rooms for his particular private needs.  The configuration of the rooms dating from the time of [[Louis XIII]] was modified.  The most significant alteration for this era was the relocation of the ''degré du roi'' from the exterior ''cour de marbre'' to the interior ''cour du roi''.  This relocation of the staircase precipitated the rearrangement of rooms in this part of the château to become the ''petit appartement du roi''.  In 1684, as the influence of Louis’ mistress – [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan]] – waned due to her alleged involvement in the [[poison affair|Affair of the Poisons]], the king attached her rooms to his ''petit appartement'' after the marquise moved into the ''appartement des bains'' on the ground floor of the palace (Le Guillou, 1986; Verlet 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;227–228).

In [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] day, these rooms – ''[[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets de curiosités]]'' – formed a veritable museum for the king’s private collections.  In contrast to the ''[[Grand appartement du roi|grand appartement du roi]]'' and the ''[[appartement du roi]]'', which were open to members of the court and the general public, the ''petit appartement du roi'' was only accessible though the personal consent of the king (Bluche, 1991).

Located on the first floor on the northern side of the ''cour de marbre'', the ''petit appartement du roi'' comprised nine rooms:

*  ''Salle du billard'' (''cabinet des chiens'')
*  ''Salon du degré du roi''
*  ''Cabinet aux tableaux''
*  ''Cabinet des Coquilles'' (later ''cabinet des livres'')
*  ''Salon ovale''
*  ''Premier salon de la petite galerie''
*  ''Petite galerie''
*  ''Deuxième salon de la petite galerie''
*  ''Cabinet des Médailles''

The '''''salle du billiard''''' (1693 plan #1) contained a billiard table, a game at which [[Louis XIV]] was adept.  Additionally, the king kept several of his hunting dogs in this room so that he could care for them personally, which gave rise to the room’s other name: ''cabinet des chiens'' (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;227).

The '''''salon du degré du roi''''' (1693 plan #2) occupies the site of a staircase dating from the time of [[Louis XIII]].  By 1684 (Dangeau), a new staircase – the '''''degré du roi''''' (1693 plan #3) – had been constructed just north of the old staircase in the ''cour du roi''.  The ''salon du degré du roi'' served as entrance to the staircase that was reserved for the [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] personal use.  The decoration of this room was given over almost exclusively to paintings by [[Nicolas Poussin]] (Félibien, 66; Piganiole de la Force, 126)

The '''''cabinet aux tableaux''''' (1693 plan #4) with its southern exposure served as a Pinacotheca for part of [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] collection of paintings.  Among the masters displayed in the room were the works from the Italian schools by [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]], [[Raphael]], [[Giorgione]], [[Giulio Romano]] and [[Titian]].  Additionally, there were cabinets arranged in the room in which [[Louis XIV]] kept his collection of carved rock crystal (Brejon de Lavergnée, 1985; Félibien, 67; Piganiole de la Force, 129; Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;229).

In 1692, the '''''cabinet des coquilles''''' (1693 plan #5) and the '''''salon ovale''''' (1693 plan #6) were created.  These rooms, along with ''cabinet des médailles'' formed the main rooms of the [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] ''[[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets de curiosités]]''.  In addition to some of the most highly prized paintings of the royal collection, the ''salon ovale'' housed in four niches four bronze sculptural groups – “Jupiter” and “Juno” by [[Allesandro Algardi]]; the “Abduction of Orethyia” after the marble by [[Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy|Gaspard Marsy]], and the “Abduction of Persephone” by [[François Girardon]] – that were esteemed as some of the finest of this genre in the king’s collection.&lt;ref&gt;The later two sculptures were modeled after marble sculptures from the [[Grande Commande|grande commande]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The richness of the decoration – fully gilt paneling and mirrors – complemented the arrangement of some of the most valuable paintings in [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] collection (Félibien, 67; Piganiole de la Force, 129; Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;229).  The ''cabinet des coquilles'' originally housed some a portion of the king’s gem collection.  In 1708, the room was converted into a library – ''cabinet aux livres'' – in which [[Louis XIV]] kept his collection of rare books and manuscripts (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;230).

The following rooms – '''''premier salon de la petite galerie''''', '''''petite galerie''''', and '''''deuxième salon de la petite galerie''''' (1693 plan #7, 8, &amp; 9) – were formed from rooms that the [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|marquise de Montespan]] occupied before she moved to the ''appartement des bains'' in 1684 (Dangeau vol. 1 77-78; Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;232).  As with the previous rooms, the ''petite galerie'' and its two salons housed precious gems and paintings that the king had either inherited or collected.  In the years that preceded the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], [[Louis XIV]] engaged in an aggressive collecting campaign that necessitated his expanding space at Versailles to display newly acquired works of art (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;229).  [[Pierre Mignard]], [[Charles Le Brun|Charles Le Brun’s]] archrival was charged with the painting of the ceilings of the ''petite galerie'' and its two salons (Félibien, 68; Piganiole de la Force, 140; Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;233).

In the ''petite galerie'' and its two salons, [[Louis XIV]] displayed many of the most valued paintings in his collection.  The ''petite galerie'' was given almost entirely to works by Italian masters with the works by [[Francesco Albani]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]] and [[Parmigianino]] predominating (Piganiole de la Force, 141-149; Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;234).  The ''petite galerie'' also housed the collection of gifts [[Louis XIV]] received from foreign embassies; most notable among these diplomatic offerings were the gifts from the Chinese Jesuit, [[Michael Alphonsius Shen Fu-Tsung|Shen Fu-Tsung]] (1684), which included an enormous pearl, and the gifts from the Siamese Embassy of 1685-1686 (Josephson, 1926).  The ''premier salon de la petite galerie'' is of particular importance as it was in this room that [[Louis XIV]] kept the painting described by Piganiole de la Force as “Le Portrait de Vie, femme d’un Florentin nommé Giaconde,” better known in English as ''[[Mona Lisa|The Mona Lisa]]'' (Piganiole de la Force, 137).

[[Louis XIV]] lavished much attention to these rooms intending to have the walls clad with panels inlaid with tortoise shell and lapis-lazuli.  However, owing to the financial demands of the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], the plans were abandoned.  Nevertheless, the ''petite gallerie'' and its two salons were used by [[Louis XIV]] for entertaining foreign dignitaries, such as the Crown Prince of Denmark in 1693 and the Elector of Cologne in 1706 (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;233-234).

Of all the rooms that formed the ''petit apartment du roi'' during the reign of [[Louis XIV]], the '''''cabinet des médailles''''' (1693 plan #10) was one of the most remarkable of its sort ever assembled in France (Hulftegger, 1954).  Taking its name from the 12 cabinets in which [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] numismatic collections were kept, the ''cabinet des medailles'' also housed the king’s collections of miniatures by Flemish, Dutch, and German masters, objects of carved porphyry and carved jade, as well as those rare items made of silver or gold (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;230-232).  Forming part of [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] collection of items made of gold was the treasure of the Merovingian king, [[Childeric I]] found in Tournai in 1653 and presented to [[Louis XIV]] by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in 1665 (Cochet, 1859) and the gold and jewel encrusted [[nef (napkin holder)|nef]], which was used by [[Louis XIV]] when he dined ''au grand couvert''.&lt;ref&gt;Félibien describes the nef as ''de tout d’or du poids de cent cinquant marcs'' ''all gold weighing 150 marks'' (approximately 34 kilograms) (Félibien, 116-117; Saule, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louis XV – 1740==
After the return of the king and court to Versailles in 1722, life assumed a rhythm similar to that under [[Louis XIV]].  The young [[Louis XV]] occupied his great-grandfather’s bedroom, the ''[[Appartement du roi|chambre de Louis XIV]]'', where the ceremonies of the daily ''lever'' and ''coucher'' were executed with the same exacting precision as during the reign of the [[Louis XIV|Sun King]].  However, owing to the discomfort of the room in winter – its size and eastern exposure made it difficult, if not impossible, to heat – [[Louis XV]] was compelled to establish his bedroom elsewhere (Verlet 313-314).  In 1738, [[Louis XV]] ordered a new bedroom –  '''''chambre de Louis XV''''' (1740 plan #4) – constructed on the site of [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] ''salle du billard'', which was enlarged to the north into the ''cour du roi'' to accommodate an alcove for the bed (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;444-447).  In the same year, the ''degré du roi'' was demolished and a new staircase was built just north of the old location.  A new room was constructed on the site formerly occupied by the ''degré du roi'' of [[Louis XIV]], the '''''antichambre des chiens''''' (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;442).  As with his great-grandfather in his ''cabinet des chiens'', [[Louis XV]] kept some of his hunting dogs in this room.

Further modifications of the ''petit appartement du roi'' at this time included the creation of the ''salon des pendules'' and the ''cabinet intérieur''.  These rooms were created when the ''salon du degré du roi'' and the ''cabinet aux tableaux'' of [[Louis XIV]] were destroyed (Le Guillou, 1985).

The '''''salon des pendules''''' (1740 plan #3) (also called the ''salon ovale'' due to its elliptic shape) was given this name due to the dials arranged in the apsidal recess of the eastern wall that showed the times of the rising and setting of the sun and the moon (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;450).

The '''''cabinet intérieur''''' (1740 plan #4) served a number of purposes: it housed part of [[Louis XV]] numismatic collection and collection of miniature paintings; it served as a dining room; and, it served as a workroom.  Of all the rooms of the ''petit appartement du roi'' during the reign of [[Louis XV]], this was perhaps one of the most richly decorated and opulently appointed (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;452).&lt;ref&gt;This room was also known as the ''cabinet des tableaux''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''cabinet des livres'', ''salon ovale'' of [[Louis XIV]], the ''peite galerie'' with its two salons, and the ''cabinet des médailles'' were retained (1740 plan #6, 7, 8, &amp; 9).

By 1740, the ''petit appartement du roi'' had expanded to such an extent into the ''cour du roi'' that the eastern part of this courtyard became a separate courtyard.  This new courtyard was called the ''cour intérieur du roi'' (1740 plan II) and the ''cour du roi'' was renamed ''cour des cerfs''.  This new name was due to the two dozen sculpted deer heads that [[Louis XV]] ordered placed on the walls of the courtyard (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;457).

==Louis XV – 1760==

The modifications of the late 1750s of the ''petit appartement du roi'' were in response to a general reorganization of the apartments in the ''corps de logis'' of the château and the destruction of the [[escalier des ambassadeurs]] (1740 plan #10).&lt;ref&gt;The [[escalier des ambassadeurs]] – the ceremonial entry to the [[Grand appartement du roi|grand appartement du roi]] – was destroyed in 1752 on grounds that the maintenance of the skylight that lit the stairwell was too costly.&lt;/ref&gt;  To accommodate a new apartment for his daughter, [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]], [[Louis XV]] ordered the construction of rooms on the same floor as the ''petit appartement du roi''.  This new apartment occupied space that had been the ''petite galerie'' and the two salons as well as new space created by the suppression of the [[escalier des ambassadeurs]] (1760 plan #9).

The most significant modifications to the ''petit apartment du roi'' at this time were the relocation of the ''degré du roi'' (1760 plan #4), the construction of the '''''salle à manger des retours de chasses''''' (1750) (1760 plan #5), and the ''pièce des buffets'' (1754) (1760 plan #6) (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;473-474).  The ''salle à manger des retours de chasses'' was built upon the site of [[Louis XV|Louis XV’s]] bath (1740 plan g) when the king wanted a dining room on the first floor in which he could entertain a small group of friends, most frequently after hunting (Bluche, 2000; Marie, 1984).  The decoration of the ''salle à manger des retours de chasses'' incorporated paneling and decorative elements from the ''salon du billard'' of [[Louis XIV]] (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;442-443).

This era during which [[Louis XV]] decorated the ''petit appartement du roi'' was significant in the evolution of French decorative styles of the 18th century.  Many of these rooms represent some of the finest examples of the [[Louis Quinze|style Louis XV]].  Of the rooms of the ''appartement du roi'', the ''salon des pendules'' is one of the most significant.  With paneling by [[Jacques Verberckt]], the room was furnished with chairs and table and served for gaming parties hosted by [[Louis XV]] (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;449).  However, it would the delivery of 1754 that would set this room apart from others.

In January of that year, [[Louis XV]] had brought from the [[château de Choisy]] and placed in this room the famed mechanical clock.
{{main|Passemant Astronomical clock}}  The clock, which was designed by the engineer, [[Claude-Simon Passemant]], clockmaker [[Louis Dauthiau]], and set in an ormolu case by [[Philippe Caffieri (1714–1774)|Philippe Caffieri]], was a marvel of its day.  Taking 12 years to complete, the clock is surmounted by a crystal sphere in which a mechanical [[armillary sphere]] – after the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernic]] model – operated.  The time, days of the week, months of the year (even calculating for bissextile years), and year were accurately displayed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis XV]], on New Year’s Eve, would sit in front of the clock to witness the changes of the various calendars.  The clock is still functioning today.&lt;/ref&gt;  On account of this clock, the room received the definitive name, '''''salon de la pendule''''' (1760 plan #2) (Kuraszewski, 1976; Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;450).

By 1760, the ''cabinet intérieur'' (1760 plan #7) had become to be also known as the'' bureau du roi'' and this room came best to represent not only the personal taste of [[Louis XV]], but it also stands as one of the finest examples of the ''[[Louis Quinze|style Louis XV]]''.  In 1755, the cabinetmaker [[Gilles Joubert]] delivered two corner cabinets, complementing those by [[Antoine-Robert Gaudreau]], which had been delivered in 1739, to house numismatic record of [[Louis XV|Louis XV’s]] reign (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;452).  In 1769, the mechanical [[Bureau du Roi|roll-top desk]] by [[Jean-François Oeben]] was delivered (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;454).

With the evolution of the ''cabinet intérieur'', [[Louis XV]] also pursued the construction of his '''''arrière cabinet''''' (1760 plan #8).  In suppressing the ''cabinet des livres'' and the ''salon ovale'' of [[Louis XIV]], [[Louis XV]] created a private room (with a small ''cabinet de la chaise'') that communicated directly with the ''degré du roi'' in which he conducted much of the day-to-day governance of France.  The utilitarian décor – a simple table, chairs and rows of shelving – reflects this usage (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;459).

==Louis XVI==
With the exception of reclaiming part of the apartment of [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]], [[Louis XVI]] chose to retain the décor of the petit appartement du roi as his grandfather had left it.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''cabinet intérieur'' (1789 plan #7), [[Louis XVI]] covered the wall with portraits of his family, imparting curious contrast to the elaborately carved [[Jacques Verberckt]] paneling (Verlet 1985, p. 525)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''arrière cabinet'' of [[Louis XV]] was rechristened '''''cabinet des dépêches''''' (1789 plan #8); however, [[Louis XVI]] continued to use the room as day-to-day workroom as his grandfather had (Rogister, 1993).

The '''''pièce de la vaisselle d'or''''' (1789 plan #9) – originally the ''premier salon de la petite galerie'' – formed part of the ''appartement de [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In 1769, [[Louis XV]] reattached some of the rooms of the appartement de [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]] to his ''petit appartement''.  These rooms – with the exception of the ''pièce de la vaisselle d’or'' – were redecorated and reordered by [[Louis XVI]] (Verlet 1985, p. 474).  During the time that [[Louis XV|Louis XV’s]] daughter lived her, it served as a music room.  In this room in 1763, the young [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] played for [[Louis XV]] and members of his family (Marie, 1984; Nolhac, 1926).&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Louis XVI]], the ''pièce de la vaisselle d’or'' was where the king kept his collection of rare porcelains and curiosities, many received as diplomatic gifts (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;526)

The small room north and behind the ''pièce de la vaisselle d'or'' is the '''''cabinet de la cassette du roi''''' (1789 plan #10).  This room was converted into a bathroom for [[Louis XV]] around 1769.  [[Louis XVI]] used the room – allegedly – as a place where he could maintain his personal financial accounts (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;526).  The paneling dates from the remodeling for [[Louis XV]]; however, [[Louis XVI]] ordered a total regilding of the room in 1784 (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;526).  When [[Pierre de Nolhac]] assumed the directorship of the museum of Versailles, he discovered that this room was being used as a broom closet by the janitorial staff.  This discovery was the impetus that compelled Nolhac to begin exhaustive research on the subject of the history of Versailles (Nolhac, 1937).

The '''''bibliothèque de Louis XVI''''' (1789 plan #11) located directly east of the ''pièce de la vaisselle d'or'' occupies the space that was the ''chambre de [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]]'' (which [[Louis XV]] rechristened ''salon d’assemblée'' in 1769) and previously the ''petite galerie''.  In 1774, construction on the library began with the decoration being executed by the workshop of the [[Rousseau brothers]], who had previously worked on the paneling of the ''cabinet de la cassette du roi'' and on part of the sculptural decorations of the [[L'Opéra of the Palace of Versailles|Opéra]] (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;513).  This room represents not only the personal taste of [[Louis XVI]] it also stands as one of the finest examples of the ''[[style Louis XVI]]'' decorative style.

The room located just to the east of the ''bibliothèque de Louis XVI'' is the '''''salle à manger aux salles neuves''''' (1789 plan #12).  This room, once the ''deuxième salon de la petite galerie'' and once one of the rooms of [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]], was remodeled into a dining room for [[Louis XV]] in 1769.  The paneling by [[Jacques Verberckt]] dates from the 1769 redecoration of [[Louis XV]] and the present blue upholstery, draperies, and hunting scenes by [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] date from 1774 when [[Louis XVI]] redecorated the room (Baulez, 1976; Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;527).  The room was also known as the ''salle des porcelains'' on account of the annual display of the production of the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres]] factory that was arranged in this room during Christmas (Baulez, 1976).

The '''''pièce des buffets''''' or '''''salle du billiard''''' (1789 plan #13) occupies area that had once been the landing of the ''[[escalier des ambassadeurs]]''.  During dinners, the billiard table would be covered with a wooden plank on which a buffet would be dressed for the king’s guests (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;527).  The room originally had a window opening onto the ''cave du roi'' (1789 plan III), the courtyard that was created when the ''[[escalier des ambassadeurs]]'' was destroyed in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;During the restoration of the palace that was ordered by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], the ''cave du roi'' was converted into a staircase.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupying the site of the ''cabinet des médailles'' of [[Louis XIV]] is the '''''cabinet des jeux''''' (1789 plan #14) of [[Louis XVI]].  Upon the return of [[Louis XV]] and the court to Versailles, there had been a systematic rearrangement of the collections of [[Louis XIV]] that had been housed in the ''petite appartement du roi'', particularly the items kept in the [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] ''cabinet des médailles''.  The collection was either reorganized in other rooms of the ''petit appartement du roi'' or sent to the ''[[bibliothèque du roi]]'' in Paris.  With the destruction of the ''[[escalier des ambassadeurs]]'' in 1752 and the subsequent construction of the apartment for [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]], the ''cabinet des médailles'' of [[Louis XIV]] was completely transformed into an ''antichambre'' for [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]].  Dating from 1775, the room was redecorated in 1785 during the construction of a theater next to the ''[[salon d’Hercule]]'', [[Louis XVI]] decided to remodel this room as a game room (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;528).  The ''salle à manger aux salles neuves'', ''salle du billiard'' and the ''cabinet des jeux'' were used for the intimate dinner parties given by [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]] for their friends and selected members of the royal family.

'''Reference.com''' is an [[online encyclopedia]] that organizes content that uses a question-and-answer format. Articles are organized into hierarchical categories.

Before [[IAC (company)|IAC]] restructered the site following an acquisition in 2008, Reference.com comprised multiple reference works, and disclosed its sources.

==History==
[[File:Reference-com logo.png|thumb|left|The old version of the Reference.com logo]]

Reference.com was launched by InReference, Inc in February 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19088675.html|title=Reference.com Goes Live as the Most Comprehensive Internet Forums Service|date=3 February 1997|publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was later acquired by Lexico Publishing Group, LLC. In 2005, Lexico announced that Reference.com would begin offering searches of [[Wikipedia]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexico.com/about/pr20050915.html|title=Reference.com Expands Content by Adding Wikipedia Encyclopedia to Search Capabilities|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group|date=15 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2007, the site typically ranked in the mid-200s among the most popular websites on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Alexa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Freference.com|title= Reference.com Traffic Details|publisher=[[Alexa.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of [[Dictionary.com]] had been greatly boosted by [[Google]]'s practice of offering a link at the top of their search results that goes to the Dictionary.com definition. This exclusive relationship was terminated without explanation to the public when the Google links were redirected to definitions at [[Answers.com]]. (In December 2009, the Answers.com links were replaced with Google's own dictionary.) Google added a Dictionary.com definition link for certain search words in a non-exclusive relationship (along with links to definitions from a few other commercial reference websites). On 3 July 2008, [[IAC (company)|IAC]] acquired Lexico Publishing Group, LLC and its three properties: Thesaurus.com, Reference.com, and Dictionary.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN0337985120080703?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=internetNews|title=Ask.com closes acquisition of Dictionary.com|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=3 July 2008 | first=Eric | last=Auchard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8300-10784_3-7-0.html?keyword=Dictionary.com|title=Ask.com closes Dictionary.com deal|publisher=[[CNet]]|date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Reference.com reproduces content from external sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/help/about.html|title=404 Not Found &amp;#124; Reference.com|publisher=Reference.com|access-date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's sources include other online dictionaries, encyclopedias, and a search of terms found on other websites such as Wikipedia and the [[CIA World Factbook|CIA ''World Factbook'']]. The site can also search [[Usenet]] groups and other [[mailing list]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/4239/new_web_service_provides_search_tool_for_usenet_and_more.html|title=New Web Service Provides Search Tool for Usenet and More|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|date=12 February 1997|author=Tracy Swedlow|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605225254/http://www.pcworld.com/article/4239/new_web_service_provides_search_tool_for_usenet_and_more.html|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/04/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-on-line-goodbye-to-seinfeld-or-good-riddance.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=4 January 1998|author=Anthony Ramirez|title=Neighborhood Report: New York Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia had articles from such sources as the 2004 ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', the ''Crystal Reference Encyclopedia'', and (later) the [[English Wikipedia]]. Its [[online dictionary]] indexed the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', ''[[Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary]]'', the [[Jargon File]], the ''Kernerman English Multilingual Dictionary'', [[Acronym Finder]], ''[[Stedman's Medical Dictionary]]'', ''Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary'', the ''On-line Medical Dictionary'', and ''[[WordNet]]''. Its [[thesaurus]] was based on multiple versions of ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]''. The site's [[web directory]] was an interface to the [[Open Directory Project]], and its [[web search]] feature used [[Google Search]]. An interface to [[Google Translate]] was added in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.reference.com/ |title=Translator – An Ask.com Service|access-date=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User tracking==
Reference.com in 2010 topped the list compiled by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' ranking websites by how many third-party tracking cookies were added to the user's computer. Reference.com added 234 tracking cookies when encountering a first-time user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Tracking The Companies That Track You Online |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129298003 |quote=The one site that installed the most was Dictionary.com.

So on Dictionary.com, the vast majority of the trackers (200 out of 234) were installed by companies that the person visiting the site probably had never heard of." |work=[[Fresh Air]]  |date=August 19, 2010 |access-date=14 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3497">The '''Rules for Archival Description''' (RAD) is the Canadian archival descriptive standard. It is overseen by the Canadian Committee on Archival Description of the Canadian Council of Archives.&lt;ref name=CHIN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/GetForumRecord.do?lang=en&amp;type=sd&amp;id=FORUM_23118&amp;ens=cnRsTGFuZz1lbiZydGxUeXBlPXNk |title="Rules for Archival Description (RAD)" |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 15, 2013 |website=www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/ |publisher=[[Canadian Heritage Information Network]] |access-date=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar in structure to [[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules|AACR2]], it was last revised in 2008.&lt;ref name="SAA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules for Archival Description (RAD)|url=http://www2.archivists.org/groups/standards-committee/rules-for-archival-description-rad|publisher=Society of American Archivists (SAA)|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

RAD provides [[archivists]] with a framework for generating archival descriptions and [[finding aids]]. It is a multi-level descriptive standard structured to reflect the context of a group of records based on manner in which they were created, used and managed.&lt;ref name=OBrien&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scaa.sk.ca/rad/section2.htm |title=

'''Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements no. 16 (SSAE 16)''' is an auditing standard for service organizations, superseding [[Statement on Auditing Standards no. 70]] (SAS 70). The "service auditor’s examination" of SAS&amp;nbsp;70 is replaced by a '''System and Organization Controls''' ('''SOC''') report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= System and Organization Controls (SOC): SOC Suite of Services |url=https://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/FRC/AssuranceAdvisoryServices/Pages/SORHome.aspx|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 was issued in April 2010, and became effective in June 2011. Many organizations that followed SAS&amp;nbsp;70 have now shifted to SSAE&amp;nbsp;16. Some service organizations are becoming savvy to the ability to use the SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 report status to show they are more capable, also encouraging their prospective end-users to make having an SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 standard part of new vendor selection criteria. It is widely known that public companies in the United States fall under the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act]], also known as Sarbanes–Oxley or SOX. However, there are also a number of provisions of the Act (e.g. the willful destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation) that apply to privately held companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.swipeclock.com/ssae-16-payroll-provider-competitive-advantage-workforce-software//&lt;/ref&gt;

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 is largely an American standard, but it mirrors the [[ISAE 3402|International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 overview|url=http://ssae16.com/SSAE16_overview.html|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 has two different kinds of reports. A SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 1 report is an independent snapshot of the organization's control landscape on a given day. A SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 2 report adds a historical element, showing how controls were managed over time. The SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 standard requires a [http://www.a-lign.com/ssae-16-what-is-the-minimum-period-for-a-type-2-report/ minimum of six months of operation] of the controls for a SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 2 report.

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 reporting can help service organizations comply with [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes–Oxley]]'s requirement (section 404) to show effective internal controls covering financial reporting. It can also be applied to data centers or any other service that might be used in the delivery of financial reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Data Centers Need SSAE&amp;nbsp;16|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/09/27/why-data-centers-need-ssae-16/|website=Data Center Knowledge|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For reports that are not specifically focused on internal controls over financial reporting, the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) has issued an Interpretation under AT Section 101 permitting service auditors to issue reports. These reports will now be considered SOC&amp;nbsp;2 audits and focus on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOC 2 Audit Overview|url=https://www.ssae16professionals.com/services/soc-2/|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 provides guidance on an auditing method, rather than mandating a specific control set. In this respect, it is similar to [[ISO 27001:2013]]. 

Effective May 1, 2017, SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 has been superseded by SSAE&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssae-16.com/ssae-18-an-update-to-ssae-16-coming-2017/|title=SSAE-18 - An Update to SSAE&amp;nbsp;16|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ssae-16.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13050">[[File:New England Courant - third Silence Dogood essay (detail).jpg|thumb|right|Silence Dogood Essay in New England Courant]]
'''Mrs. Silence Dogood''' was a [[pen name]] used by [[Benjamin Franklin]] to get his work published in the ''[[New-England Courant]]'', a newspaper founded and published by his brother [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]]. This was after Benjamin Franklin was denied several times when he tried to publish letters under his own name in the ''Courant''.  The 14 Mrs. Silence Dogood letters were first printed in 1722.

==History==
As a teenager, Franklin worked as an [[apprentice]] in his older brother's printing shop in [[Boston]], where ''The New-England Courant'' was published and printed.

Franklin never got anything he wrote published, so, at age 16, Franklin created the persona of a middle-aged [[widow]] named Silence Dogood.&lt;ref name="MoH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Silence_Dogood/|title=Silence Dogood at the Museum of Hoaxes|last=Boese|first=Alex|year=2008|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once every two weeks, he would leave a letter under the door of his brother's printing shop.  A total of 14 letters were sent.  The first letter began:

{{quote|
Sir,

It may not be possible in the first Place to inform your Readers, that I intend once a Fortnight to present them, by the Help of this Paper, with a short [[Epistle]], which I presume will add somewhat to their Entertainment.

And since it is observed, that the Generality of People, nowadays, are unwilling either to commend or dispraise what they read, until they are in some measure informed who or what the Author of it is, whether he be poor or rich, old or young, a Schollar or a Leather Apron Man, &amp;c. and give their Opinion of the Performance, according to the Knowledge which they have of the Author's Circumstances, it may not be amiss to begin with a short Account of my past Life and present Condition, that the Reader may not be at a Loss to judge whether or no my Lucubrations are worth his reading.&lt;ref name="HistoryCarper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf1/sd1.htm|title=HistoryCarper.com|accessdate=2008-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907231417/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf1/sd1.htm|archivedate=2008-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The letters poked fun at various aspects of life in [[colonial America]], such as this quote about [[hoop petticoat]]s:

{{quote|These monstrous topsy-turvy Mortar-Pieces, are neither fit for the Church, the Hall, or the Kitchen; and if a Number of them were well mounted on Noddles-Island, they would look more like Engines of War for bombarding the Town, than Ornaments of the Fair Sex. An honest Neighbour of mine, happening to be in Town some time since on a publick Day, inform'd me, that he saw four Gentlewomen with their Hoops half mounted in a Balcony, as they withdrew to the Wall, to the great Terror of the Militia, who (he thinks) might attribute their irregular Volleys to the formidable Appearance of the Ladies Petticoats.&lt;ref name="MoH" /&gt;}}

The letters were published in ''The New-England Courant'' fortnightly, and amused readers.  Some men wrote in offering to marry Ms. Dogood, upon learning she was widowed.&lt;ref name="MoH" /&gt;

Eventually, James found out that all fourteen of the letters had been written by his younger brother, which angered him. Benjamin left his apprenticeship without permission and escaped to [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="vandoren"&gt;Van Doren, Carl. ''Benjamin Franklin''. (1938). Penguin reprint 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Letters 1 &amp; 2 – Dogood's background ==
Franklin created a whole background for his character, and explained this in depth in the majority of his first letter:

{{quote|At the time of my Birth, my Parents were on Ship-board in their Way from London to N. England. My Entrance into this troublesome World was attended with the Death of my Father, a Misfortune, which tho' I was not then capable of knowing, I shall never be able to forget; for as he, poor Man, stood upon the Deck rejoycing at my Birth, a merciless Wave entered the Ship, and in one Moment carry'd him beyond Reprieve. Thus was the first Day which I saw, the last that was seen by my Father; and thus was my disconsolate Mother at once made both a Parent and a Widow.

When we arrived at Boston (which was not long after) I was put to Nurse in a Country Place, at a small Distance from the Town, where I went to School, and past my Infancy and Childhood in Vanity and Idleness, until I was bound out Apprentice, that I might no longer be a Charge to my Indigent Mother, who was put to hard Shifts for a Living.

My Master was a Country Minister, a pious good-natur'd young Man, &amp; a Batchelor: He labour'd with all his Might to instil vertuous and godly Principles into my tender Soul, well knowing that it was the most suitable Time to make deep and lasting Impressions on the Mind, while it was yet untainted with Vice, free and unbiass'd. He endeavour'd that I might be instructed in all that Knowledge and Learning which is necessary for our Sex, and deny'd me no Accomplishment that could possibly be attained in a Country Place; such as all Sorts of Needle-Work, Writing, Arithmetick, &amp;c. and observing that I took a more than ordinary Delight in reading ingenious Books, he gave me the free Use of his Library, which tho' it was but small, yet it was well chose, to inform the Understanding rightly, and enable the Mind to frame great and noble Ideas.

Before I had liv'd quite two Years with this Reverend Gentleman, my indulgent Mother departed this Life, leaving me as it were by my self, having no Relation on Earth within my Knowledge.

I will not abuse your Patience with a tedious Recital of all the frivolous Accidents of my Life, that happened from this Time until I arrived to Years of Discretion, only inform you that I liv'd a chearful Country Life, spending my leisure Time either in some innocent Diversion with the neighbouring Females, or in some shady Retirement, with the best of Company, Books. Thus I past away the Time with a Mixture of Profit and Pleasure, having no Affliction but what was imaginary, and created in my own Fancy; as nothing is more common with us Women, than to be grieving for nothing, when we have nothing else to grieve for.&lt;ref name="HistoryCarper" /&gt;}}

The whole second letter was an account of Dogood's life:

{{quote|Histories of Lives are seldom entertaining, unless they contain something either admirable or exemplar: And since there is little or nothing of this Nature in my own Adventures, I will not tire your Readers with tedious Particulars of no Consequence, but will briefly, and in as few Words as possible, relate the most material Occurrences of my Life, and according to my Promise, confine all to this Letter.

My Reverend Master who had hitherto remained a Batchelor, (after much Meditation on the Eighteenth verse of the Second Chapter of Genesis,) took up a Resolution to marry; and having made several unsuccessful fruitless Attempts on the more topping Sort of our Sex, and being tir'd with making troublesome Journeys and Visits to no Purpose, he began unexpectedly to cast a loving Eye upon Me, whom he had brought up cleverly to his Hand.

There is certainly scarce any Part of a Man's Life in which he appears more silly and ridiculous, than when he makes his first Onset in Courtship. The aukward Manner in which my Master first discover'd his Intentions, made me, in spite of my Reverence to his Person, burst out into an unmannerly Laughter: However, having ask'd his Pardon, and with much ado compos'd my Countenance, I promis'd him I would take his Proposal into serious Consideration, and speedily give him an Answer.

As he had been a great Benefactor (and in a Manner a Father to me) I could not well deny his Request, when I once perceived he was in earnest. Whether it was Love, or Gratitude, or Pride, or all Three that made me consent, I know not; but it is certain, he found it no hard Matter, by the Help of his Rhetorick, to conquer my Heart, and perswade me to marry him.

This unexpected Match was very astonishing to all the Country round about, and served to furnish them with Discourse for a long Time after; some approving it, others disliking it, as they were led by their various Fancies and Inclinations.

We lived happily together in the Heighth of conjugal Love and mutual Endearments, for near Seven Years, in which Time we added Two likely Girls and a Boy to the Family of the Dogoods: But alas! When my Sun was in its meridian Altitude, inexorable unrelenting Death, as if he had envy'd my Happiness and Tranquility, and resolv'd to make me entirely miserable by the Loss of so good an Husband, hastened his Flight to the Heavenly World, by a sudden unexpected Departure from this.

I have now remained in a State of Widowhood for several Years, but it is a State I never much admir'd, and I am apt to fancy that I could be easily perswaded to marry again, provided I was sure of a good-humour'd, sober, agreeable Companion: But one, even with these few good Qualities, being hard to find, I have lately relinquish'd all Thoughts of that Nature. At present I pass away my leisure Hours in Conversation, either with my honest Neighbour Rusticus and his Family, or with the ingenious Minister of our Town, who now lodges at my House, and by whose Assistance I intend now and then to beautify my Writings with a Sentence or two in the learned Languages, which will not only be fashionable, and pleasing to those who do not understand it, but will likewise be very ornamental.

I shall conclude this with my own Character, which (one would think) I should be best able to give. Know then, That I am an Enemy to Vice, and a Friend to Vertue. I am one of an extensive Charity, and a great Forgiver of private Injuries: A hearty Lover of the Clergy and all good Men, and a mortal Enemy to arbitrary Government &amp; unlimited Power. I am naturally very jealous for the Rights and Liberties of my Country; &amp; the least appearance of an Incroachment on those invaluable {{sic|Priviledges}}, is apt to make my Blood boil exceedingly. I have likewise a natural Inclination to observe and reprove the Faults of others, at which I have an excellent Faculty. I speak this by Way of Warning to all such whose Offences shall come under my Cognizance, for I never intend to wrap my Talent in a Napkin. To be brief; I am courteous and affable, good-humour'd (unless I am first provok'd,) and handsome, and sometimes witty...&lt;ref name="HistoryCarper" /&gt;}}

== In popular culture ==

The Silence Dogood letters feature in the 2004 movie ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]''. After stealing the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], cryptologist Benjamin Franklin Gates ([[Nicolas Cage]]) and Dr. Abigail Chase ([[Diane Kruger]]) find an [[Book cipher|Ottendorf cipher]] hidden in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration. Following the discovery of a [[Knights Templar]] riddle which said ''"The key in Silence undetected"'', a link between the Silence Dogood letters and the cipher is established. The cipher is used to find the hidden message in the letters which proves to be another clue.

The '''Third Position''' ({{lang-it|Terza Posizione}}) was a [[far-right]] group founded in [[Rome]] in 1978 (but already present with the name of [[Lotta Studentesca]] from 1976). The TP rejected both [[capitalism]] and [[communism]], looking instead to found a political and economic [[Third Position]], with its main influence being [[Julius Evola]]. The group became a front for the [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] (NAR) in 1980. It insisted on [[tradition]], [[nationalism]], [[anti-parliamentarism]] and [[militarism]].

==Overview==
The group was founded by ex-members of previous [[Neo-Fascism|neo-fascist]] groups such as [[Ordine Nuovo]], [[Avanguardia Nazionale]], [[Lotta di Popolo]], [[Fronte Studentesco]], disbanded for apology of [[fascism]]. [[Peppe Di Mitri]] was the leader of the group, with [[Roberto Fiore]] and [[Gabriele Adinolfi]] amongst its most important ideologues. [[Massimo Morsello]] was also a member. Parallel to the official organization, an operative clandestine nucleus was formed, led by Peppe Di Mitri. The movement did not last long as Di Mitri was arrested soon after its founding. When he was arrested in the summer of 1980, the structure merged with [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]].

The group motto was ''Nè fronte rosso nè reazione, Terza Posizione'' (Ital. "Neither red front nor reaction, Third Position"). The group [[logo]] was a variation of the [[Wolfsangel]] symbol, with the central bar substituted by a fist holding a hammer.

Terza Posizione was one of the various Italian neofascist groups of the '70s (along with [[Lotta di Popolo]], for example) that attempted to break the wall between radical left and radical right ideologies. Terza Posizione platform supported a social, corporativist state and looked with interest at both the [[Juan Perón|Perón]] [[Argentina]] and the [[Vietcong]]s.

== Terza Posizione and the NAR ==
On December 1979, in one of the premises of the organization, three members were arrested, having been caught while moving a box of hand grenades. After the incident, the police found several [[Carabinieri]] uniforms, false papers, arms and explosives. As a result, in September 1980, Fiore, Adinolfi and forty members of Terza Posizione received a warrant of arrest. Fiore and Adinolfi escaped abroad, leaving the leadership of the group to [[Giorgio Vale]] (a member of [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]]). The NAR's [[Giusva Fioravanti]] would later accuse Fiore and Adinolfi of absconding with the movement's money. Without Di Mitri's lead, the NAR quickly took control and used TP as a front movement.

==Investigations into activities==
In June 1983, judge Mario Amato, who was investigating the links between the Terza Posizione and neo-fascist terrorism, was assassinated by a commando formed by [[Gilberto Cavallini]] and [[Luigi Ciavardini]]. The instigators of the killing were NAR members [[Francesca Mambro]] and [[Valerio Fioravanti]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. (Both were convicted of other terrorist killings and the 1980 [[Bologna massacre]]). The judge had been investigating in isolation from his superiors, like the chief prosecutor Giovanni De Matteo, a member of [[Propaganda Due]], and under heavy attacks from his colleague Antonio Alibrandi, a right-wing sympathizer and father of Alessandro Alibrandi, member of Terza Posizione and NAR.

==Legacy of Terza Posizione==
Despite its brief life and ambiguous relationships with terrorist groups, Terza Posizione remains one of the most influential groups of the Italian and European far right. Many of its former members continued to play prominent roles in the far right politics after the disbanding of the original association.

Peppe Dimitri later joined [[Alleanza Nazionale]] and became the advisor of [[Gianni Alemanno]]. Fiore and Morsello, meanwhile, repaired to [[Great Britain]] founding the [[International Third Position]] along with [[Nick Griffin]] and other British nationalists. They then returned some of their ideals to Italian politics with [[Forza Nuova]], albeit with less social-oriented and more strictly anti-immigration overtones. Forza Nuova web sites and manifests are still sometimes titled ''Forza Nuova per la Terza Posizione'' ("New Force for the Third Position"). [[Gabriele Adinolfi]] is not formally involved in politics but he is still active in the Italian [[far right]] scene as an ideologue and thinker.

'''''Trevett v. Weeden''''' (1786) was a [[Rhode Island Supreme Court]] decision finding state legislation regarding [[paper currency]] was violative of the state constitution.  The decision set precedent for ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' regarding [[judicial review]].

==History==
On September 25-26, 1786, the Superior Court of Judicature of Rhode Island ([[Rhode Island Supreme Court]])
heard the case in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] with a decision by [[David Howell (jurist)|David Howell]]. In May 1786, the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] passed legislation allowing [[paper money]] as [[legal tender]], and in June 1786 the Court created penalties for anyone refusing to accept such currency. In August 1786, the Assembly passed further legislation providing that trial of
offenders should take place "without any jury," by a majority of the judges and no appeal was allowed.  Both [[common law]] and the [[Constitution of Rhode Island]] guaranteed a [[jury trial]] in contrast to the legislation. &lt;ref&gt;''Power of Federal Judiciary Over Legislation''
 by John Hampden Dougherty (Putnam, 1912) pg. 28-32[https://books.google.com/books?id=hX9JAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=trevett+v.+weeden&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hCetwzdlrI&amp;sig=un5ikXaEeV65W2w-bSzIo6EkpGA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA30,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[James M. Varnum]], a U.S. Congressman representing the defendant argued that although the [[American Revolution]] occurred, the original colonial Constitution was still valid and the assembly derived its powers from this document. Accordingly, the Court retained the power to judge the constitutionality of any legislation under the Constitution.  The Court found that the paper currency law was unconstitutional ("not cognizable") because it limited the right to a jury trial for violators.&lt;ref&gt;''Power of Federal Judiciary Over Legislation''
 by John Hampden Dougherty (Putnam, 1912) pg. 28-32[https://books.google.com/books?id=hX9JAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=trevett+v.+weeden&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hCetwzdlrI&amp;sig=un5ikXaEeV65W2w-bSzIo6EkpGA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA30,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the decision, the justices were brought before the General Assembly, reprimanded, and all but one were not reappointed for the following term. The Assembly then appointed paper currency advocates such as [[William West (Rhode Island politician)|William West]] to the Court. The case was later cited as precedent for judicial review in ''Marbury v. Madison''.&lt;ref&gt;''Power of Federal Judiciary Over Legislation''
