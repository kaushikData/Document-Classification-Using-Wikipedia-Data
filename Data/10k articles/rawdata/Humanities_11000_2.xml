      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7466">Rabbi Dr. '''Adolf Rosenzweig''' (October 20, 1850 – August 16, 1918&lt;ref&gt;''Jahrbuch für jüdische Geschichte und Literatur'', Vol. 20, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=cJY3TZGfE4O38gPDmfGDCQ&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=iw&amp;id=JEcLAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22adolf+rosenzweig%22+1850&amp;q=%22adolf+rosenzweig%22+#search_anchor p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[German Jews|German]] moderate liberal [[rabbi]] and [[Tanakh|Biblical]] and [[Talmud]]ic scholar. In his publications he dealt with historical and [[archaeology|archaeological]] matters.

==Biography==
Adolf Aharon Rosenzweig was born in [[Turdossin]], Hungary. He studied at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], later at the [[Yeshiva]] of [[Pressburg]]. After graduation he went to [[Berlin]], where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[Oriental languages]] and [[literatures]] at the [[University of Berlin]], and [[theology]] at the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]]. Finally he earned his [[PhD]].

On October 20, 1874, he entered upon the rabbinate of [[Pasewalk]], [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]], whence he was called to [[Międzychód|Birnbaum]], [[Posen (region)|Posen]]. In 1879 he went to [[Teplitz]], [[Bohemia]], and in 1887 he accepted a rabbinate at the [[New Synagogue (Berlin)|New Synagogue]] (Neue Synagoge) in [[Oranienburger Straße]], Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1918. There he came to be known as an outstanding [[preacher]]. He was also a prolific author, writing on history and archaeology as well as religious subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12881-rosenzweig-adolf Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenzweig died in 1918, at 68, and was buried in Berlin. On his [[gravestone]] was written: "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips" ([[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Malachi#Chapter 2|2:6]]).

==Family==
Rosenzweig's son, Rabbi Dr. [[Arthur Rosenzweig]] (March 27, 1883, Teplitz – 1935, [[Prague]]), was a spiritual leader.

His daughter, Hedwig, married Rabbi [[Juda Bergmann]]&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish life in Germany: memoirs from three centuries'' / edited by [[Monika Richarz]]; translated by Stella P. Rosenfeld and Sidney Rosenfeld, Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1991, p. 168 (footnote: p. 173).&lt;/ref&gt; (1874–1956) – [[Jews in Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galician]]-born, studied in the Rabbinical Seminary in [[Vienna]]; rabbi in Berlin from 1908; emigrated to [[Mandate Palestine]] in 1933. They had 8 children. Their elder son, [[Ernst David Bergmann]] (October 18, 1903, Karlsruhe – 1975), was a [[professor]] of [[Organic Chemistry]] in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (1954–1975), and often considered the father of the [[Israeli nuclear program]]. His brother, [[Felix Bergmann|Felix Eliezer Bergmann]] (August 17, 1908, Frankfurt – 2002, Israel), raised in Berlin, PhD in chemistry and MD from the [[University of Berlin]] in 1933; chair of [[Pharmacology]] in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (1950–2002). Arthur Bergmann (born 1908) was a lawyer who defended Palestinian prisoners and initiated several humanitarian projects for blind Palestinian children. Theodor Bergmann (born March 7, 1916, in Berlin) is a professor of Agricultural Economy in the [[University of Hohenheim]] in [[Stuttgart]] since 1981.
[[Alfred Bergmann]] [[:de:Alfred Bergmann (KPD-O)]](born 1910) was a member of the German communist opposition (KPD-O) like his younger brothers Theodor and Josef. Alfred was forced to emigrate to Switzerland from where he was handed over to the German Gestapo in 1942 and murdered in prison. [[Josef Bergmann]] [[:de:Josef Bergmann (Gewerkschafter)]](born 1913), also a member of the German communist opposition, emigrated with his brother Theodor to Sweden and returned to Germany after WW II.

{{Anti-nuclear movement sidebar}}

The '''anti-nuclear movement in the United States''' consists of more than 80 [[anti-nuclear]] groups that oppose [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapons]], and/or [[uranium mining]]. These have included the [[Abalone Alliance]], [[Clamshell Alliance]], [[Committee for Nuclear Responsibility]], [[Nevada Desert Experience]], [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]], [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]], [[Plowshares Movement]], [[Women Strike for Peace]], and [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. The anti-nuclear movement has delayed construction or halted commitments to build some new nuclear plants,&lt;ref name=protest/&gt; and has pressured the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Brown and [[Rinaldo Brutoco]] (1997). ''Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-nuclear protests]] reached a peak in the 1970s and 1980s and grew out of the [[environmental movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Kitschelt. [http://www.marcuse.org/harold/hmimages/seabrook/861KitscheltAntiNuclear4Democracies.pdf Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies] ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigns that captured national public attention involved the [[Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant]], [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]] (by the [[Clamshell Alliance]]), [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]], [[Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant]], and [[Three Mile Island]].&lt;ref name=protest&gt;Giugni, Marco (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kn6YhNtyVigC&amp;pg=PA44 Social Protest and Policy Change: Ecology, Antinuclear, and Peace Movements]'' p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, many anti-nuclear power activists began shifting their interest, by joining the rapidly growing [[Nuclear Freeze campaign]], and the primary concern about nuclear hazards in the US changed from the problems of nuclear power plants to the prospects of [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref name=ll2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/974944/1/BeRadiatedFINAL.pdf |title='We don't wanna be radiated:' Documentary Film and the Evolving Rhetoric of Nuclear Energy Activism |author=Lisa Lynch |year=2012 |work=American Literature Ecocriticism Issue }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 1981, the [[White House Peace Vigil]] began and has continued day and night ever since, thanks to [[William Thomas (activist)]] and a small band of stalwart antinuclear activists who launched the "Proposition One Campaign for a Nuclear-Free Future"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prop1.org]&lt;/ref&gt; voter initiative in 1993 which led to a bill that has been introduced into the House of Representatives every session by Eleanor Holmes Norton.  On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against nuclear weapons and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history.&lt;ref name="The Spirit of June 12"&gt;Jonathan Schell. [http://www.thenation.com/article/spirit-june-12 The Spirit of June 12] ''The Nation'', July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icanw.org"&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/1982 1982 – a million people march in New York City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616175116/http://www.icanw.org/1982 |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on June 20, 1983, at 50 sites across the United States.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nl.newsbank.com"/&gt;
There were many [[Nevada Desert Experience]] protests and peace camps at the [[Nevada Test Site]] during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times 1992"/&gt;

More recent campaigning by anti-nuclear groups has related to several nuclear power plants including the [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant]],&lt;ref name="monroenews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monroenews.com/article/20090310/NEWS01/703109970/-1/NEWS|title=Article 404 - Monroe News - Monroe, Michigan - Monroe, MI|author=|date=|website=Monroe News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="michiganmessenger.com"&gt;[http://michiganmessenger.com/14545/fermi-3-opposition-takes-legal-action-to-block-new-nuclear-reactor Fermi 3 opposition takes legal action to block new nuclear reactor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330185512/http://michiganmessenger.com/14545/fermi-3-opposition-takes-legal-action-to-block-new-nuclear-reactor |date=March 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian Point Energy Center]],&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.Y7MW1H7PTM|title=404.

[[File:US nuclear sites map.svg|thumb|Map of major U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure sites during the Cold War and into the present. Places with grayed-out names are no longer functioning and are in various stages of environmental remediation.]]
[[File:Women Strike for Peace NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Women Strike for Peace]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962.]] On November 1, 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]]. It was the largest national women's [[peace march|peace protest]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="dagmar2011" /&gt;
[[File:NNSA-NSO-787.jpg|thumb|This view of downtown [[Las Vegas]] shows a [[mushroom cloud]] in the background. Scenes such as this were typical during the 1950s. From 1951 to 1962 the government conducted 100 atmospheric tests at the nearby [[Nevada Test Site]].]]

The nuclear debate initially was about nuclear weapons policy, and began within the scientific community. Scientific concern about the adverse health effects arising from atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]] first emerged in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Professional associations such as the [[Federation of Atomic Scientists]] and the [[Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]] were involved.&lt;ref name=jerry/&gt;  The National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy was formed in November 1957, and surveys showed rising public uneasiness about the nuclear arms race—especially atmospheric nuclear weapons tests that sent [[radioactive fallout]] around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence S. Wittner]]. [http://www.hnn.us/articles/122716.html Preserving the Golden Rule as a Piece of Anti-Nuclear History] ''History News Network'', 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Linus Pauling won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to stop the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, and the "Ban the Bomb" movement spread throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=jerry&gt;Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997). ''Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear Movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age'', Twayne Publishers, pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1945 and 1992, the United States maintained a program of vigorous nuclear weapons testing. A total of 1,054 nuclear tests and two nuclear attacks were conducted, with over 900 of them at the [[Nevada]] [[Nevada Test Site|Test Site]], and ten on miscellaneous sites in the United States ([[Alaska]], [[Colorado]], [[Mississippi]], and [[New Mexico]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carey Sublette, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/ Gallery of U.S. Nuclear Tests]&lt;/ref&gt; Until November 1962, the vast majority of the U.S. tests were above-ground; after the acceptance of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of [[nuclear fallout]].

The U.S. program of atmospheric nuclear testing exposed some people to the hazards of fallout. Since the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, more than $1.38 billion in compensation has been approved. The money is going to people who took part in the tests, notably at the Nevada Test Site, and to others exposed to the radiation.&lt;ref name=compo&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7159303 What governments offer to victims of nuclear tests] ''The Associated Press'', March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/civil/omp/omi/Tre_SysClaimsToDateSum.pdf|title=Radiation Exposure Compensation System: Claims to Date|author=|date=|website=usdoj.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unexpectedly high costs in the nuclear weapons program, along with competition with the Soviet Union and a desire to spread democracy through the world, created "... pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures."&lt;ref name=jbs1996&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] encouraged private corporations to build nuclear reactors and a significant learning phase followed with many early partial [[core meltdown]]s and accidents at experimental reactors and research facilities.&lt;ref name=bks/&gt; This led to the introduction of the Price-Anderson Act in 1957, which was, "... an implicit admission that nuclear power provided risks that producers were unwilling to assume without federal backing."&lt;ref name=bks&gt;[[Benjamin K.

The first U.S. reactor to face public opposition was Fermi 1 in 1957. It was built approximately 30 miles from Detroit and there was opposition from the [[United Auto Workers Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Mehta (2005).

[[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]] planned to build the first commercially viable [[nuclear power plant]] in the US at [[Bodega Bay]],  north of [[San Francisco]]. The proposal was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958.&lt;ref name=well&gt;Paula Garb.

The [[Sierra Club]] became actively involved in the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Raymond Wellock (1998).

A small military test reactor exploded at the [[SL-1|Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One]] in Idaho Falls in January 1961, causing 3 fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Idaho Falls: The Untold Story of America's First Nuclear Accident|first=William|last=McKeown|year=2003|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-562-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was caused by a combination of dangerous reactor design plus either sabotage, operator error by experienced operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hathaway|first=William|title=Idaho Falls|year=2006|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738548707}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further partial meltdown at the [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station]] in Michigan in 1966.&lt;ref name=bks/&gt;

In his 1963 book ''Change, Hope and the Bomb'', [[David E. Lilienthal]] criticized nuclear developments, particularly the nuclear industry's failure to address the [[High-level radioactive waste management|nuclear waste]] question. He argued that it would be "... particularly irresponsible to go ahead with the construction of full scale nuclear power plants without a safe method of nuclear waste disposal having been demonstrated." However, Lilienthal stopped short of a blanket rejection of nuclear power. His view was that a more cautious approach was necessary.&lt;ref name=rudig&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Walker, in his book ''[[Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective]]'', explains that the growth of the nuclear industry in the U.S. occurred as the [[environmental movement]] was being formed.  Environmentalists saw the advantages of nuclear power in reducing air pollution, but became critical of nuclear technology on other grounds.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;  The view that nuclear power was better for the environment than conventional fuels was partially undermined in the late 1960s when major controversy erupted over the effects of waste heat from nuclear plants on water quality.  The nuclear industry "... gradually and reluctantly took action to reduce thermal pollution by building cooling towers or ponds for plants on inland waterways."&lt;ref name=ten&gt;Walker, J. Samuel (2004). ''[[Three Mile Island (book)|Three Mile Island]]: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective'' (Berkeley: University of California Press), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Several scientists, including [[John Gofman]] and Arthur Tamplin, challenged the prevailing view that the small amounts of radioactivity released by nuclear power plants during normal operation were not a problem. They argued "... that the routine releases were a severe threat to public health and could cause tens of thousands of deaths from cancer each year."&lt;ref name=ten/&gt; Exchange of views about radiation risks caused uneasiness about nuclear power, especially among those unable to evaluate the conflicting claims.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;

The large size of nuclear plants ordered during the late 1960s raised new safety questions and created fears of a severe reactor accident that would send large quantities of radioactivity into the environment.  In the early 1970s, a highly contentious debate over the performance of emergency core cooling systems in nuclear plants, designed to prevent a core meltdown that could lead to the "[[China Syndrome (nuclear meltdown)|China syndrome]]", received coverage in the popular media and technical journals.&lt;ref name=eleven&gt;Walker, J. Samuel (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tf0AfoynG-EC&amp;dq=Three+Mile+Island:+A+Nuclear+Crisis+in+Historical+Perspective&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OouUwdMQpH&amp;sig=GkKocK36A1bZhmqt_Nm4O6zWQKw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lFtKS7TIDY3U7AOKq_jXCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective]'' (Berkeley: University of California Press), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wrudig&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergency core cooling systems controversy opened up whether the AECs first priority was promotion of the nuclear industry or protection of public health and safety.&lt;ref name=jb144&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1970s, anti-nuclear activity had increased dramatically in conjunction with concerns about nuclear safety and criticisms of a policy-making process that allowed little voice for these concerns. Initially scattered and organized at the local level, opposition to nuclear power became a national movement by the mid-1970s when such groups as the [[Sierra Club]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], and [[Critical Mass (Anti-nuclear group)|Critical Mass]] became involved.&lt;ref name=sh96&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of environmentalism in the 1970s, the anti-nuclear movement grew substantially:&lt;ref name=jb144/&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1975–76, ballot initiatives to control or halt the growth of nuclear power were introduced in eight western states. Although they enjoyed little success at the polls, the controls they sought to impose were sometimes adopted in part by state legislature, most notably in California. Interventions in plant licensing proceedings increased, often focusing on technical issues related to safety. This widespread popular ferment kept the issue before the public and contributed to growing public skepticism about nuclear power.&lt;ref name=jb144/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another major area of ongoing concern was [[High-level radioactive waste management|nuclear waste management]]. The absence of a working waste management facility became an important issue by the mid-1970s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1976, the [[California Energy Commission]] announced that it would not approve any more nuclear plants unless the utilities could specify fuel and waste disposal costs, an impossible task without decision on reprocessing, spent fuel storage and waste disposal. By the late 1970s, over thirty states had passed legislation regulating various activities associated with nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can be used to make [[nuclear weapons]] if a country chooses to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/daed.2009.138.4.7|title=Nuclear power without nuclear proliferation? |volume=138 |issue=4 |pages=7 |author=Steven E.

In 1976, [[Nuclear whistleblowers|four nuclear engineers]] -[[GE Three|three from GE]] and one from the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]- resigned, stating that nuclear power was not as safe as their superiors were claiming.&lt;ref name=mar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; These men were engineers who had spent most of their working life building reactors, and their defection galvanized anti-nuclear groups across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,918045,00.html The San Jose Three] ''TIME'', Feb. 16, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879643,00.html|title=The Struggle over Nuclear Power|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1976-03-08|access-date=2016-11-04|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They testified to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;the cumulative effect of all design defects and deficiencies in the design, construction and operations of nuclear power plants makes a nuclear power plant accident, in our opinion, a certain event.  The only question is when, and where.&lt;ref name=mar&gt;Mark Hertsgaard (1983). ''Nuclear Inc. The Men and Money Behind Nuclear Energy'', Pantheon Books, New York, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These issues, together with a series of other environmental, technical, and public health questions, made nuclear power the source of acute controversy.  Public support, which was strong in the early 1960s, had been shaken. ''Forbes'', in the September 1975 issue, reported that "the anti-nuclear coalition has been remarkably successful ... [and] has certainly slowed the expansion of nuclear power."&lt;ref name=eleven/&gt;  By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism, fueled by dissenting experts, had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence.  Although it lacked a single coordinating organization, and did not have uniform goals, it emerged as a movement sharply focused on opposing nuclear power, and the movement's efforts gained a great deal of national attention.&lt;ref name=eleven/&gt;

On March 28, 1979, equipment failures and operator error contributed to loss of coolant and a partial core meltdown at the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant]] in Pennsylvania.  The [[World Nuclear Association]] has stated that cleanup of the damaged nuclear reactor system at TMI-2 took nearly 12 years and cost approximately US $973 million.&lt;ref name=world&gt;World Nuclear Association. [http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf36.html Three Mile Island Accident] January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], in his 2007 preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, estimated that the TMI accident caused a total of $2.4 billion in property damages.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. The costs of failure: A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' 36 (2008), p. 1807.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Three Mile Island accident health effects|health effects of the Three Mile Island accident]] are widely, but not universally, agreed to be very low level.&lt;ref name=world/&gt;&lt;ref name=mangano2004&gt;Mangano, Joseph (2004).

''Nuclear Inc. The Men and Money Behind Nuclear Energy'', Pantheon Books, New York, p. 95 &amp; 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 Three Mile Island accident inspired Perrow's book ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', where a [[nuclear accident]] occurs, resulting from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. TMI was an example of a normal accident because it was "... unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable."&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1982), 'The President's Commission and the Normal Accident', in Sils, D., Wolf, C. and Shelanski, V. (Eds), ''Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions'', Westview, Boulder, pp.173–184.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.&lt;ref name=nature477&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pidgeon | first1 = N. | title = In retrospect: Normal Accidents | doi = 10.1038/477404a | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7365 | pages = 404 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc =  |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7365/abs/477404a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their place are emerging "distributed resources"—smaller, decentralized electricity supply sources (including efficiency) that are cheaper, cleaner, less risky, more flexible, and quicker to deploy. Such technologies are often called "[[soft energy technologies]]" and Lovins viewed their impacts as more gentle, pleasant, and manageable than hard energy technologies such as nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;Amory B. Lovins (1977). ''Soft Energy Paths: Toward a Durable Peace'', Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear energy systems have a long stay time. The completion of the sequence of activities related to one commercial nuclear power station, from the start of construction through the safe disposal of its last radioactive waste, may take 100–150 years.&lt;ref name=stor/&gt;

===Emergence of the anti-uranium movement===

Uranium mining is the process of extraction of [[uranium]] ore from the ground. A prominent use of uranium from mining is as fuel for [[nuclear power plant]]s. After mining uranium ores, they are normally processed by grinding the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium, "[[yellowcake]]", which is sold on the uranium market as U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, and uranium mining can use large amounts of water.

The [[Church Rock uranium mill spill]] occurred in [[New Mexico]] on July 16, 1979, when United Nuclear Corporation's [[Church Rock, New Mexico|Church Rock]] [[Uranium mining#Heap leaching|uranium mill]] [[tailings]] disposal pond breached its dam.&lt;ref name=Pasternak&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasternak |first=Judy |year=2010 |title=Yellow Dirt: A Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed|publisher=Free Press |isbn= 1416594825 |ref=pasternak|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=courier&gt;{{citation|title=Navajos mark 20th anniversary of Church Rock spill|newspaper=The Daily Courier|date=July 18, 1999|location=[[Prescott, Arizona]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,000 tons of solid [[radioactive waste|radioactive mill waste]] and 93 million gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution flowed into the [[Puerco River]], and contaminants traveled {{convert|80|mi|km}} downstream to [[Navajo County, Arizona]] and onto the [[Navajo Nation]].&lt;ref name=Pasternak /&gt; The accident released more radioactivity than the [[Three Mile Island accident]] that occurred four months earlier and was the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=Pasternak/&gt;&lt;ref name=congress&gt;US Congress, House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment.

It was the largest national women's [[peace march|peace protest]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=dagmar2011&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dagmar-wilson-20110130,0,5499397.story |title=Dagmar Wilson dies at 94; organizer of women's disarmament protesters |author=Woo, Elaine |date=January 30, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/us/24wilson.html |title=Dagmar Wilson, Anti-Nuclear Leader, Dies at 94 |author=Hevesi, Dennis |date=January 23, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many anti-nuclear protests in the United States which captured national public attention during the 1970s and 1980s. These included the well-known [[Clamshell Alliance]] protests at [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Abalone Alliance]] protests at [[Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant]], where thousands of protesters were arrested. Other large protests followed the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref name="protest"/&gt;

A large [[anti-nuclear]] demonstration was held in May 1979 in Washington D.C., when 65,000 people including the Governor of California, attended a march and rally against [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Giugni, Marco (2004).

On June 6, 1982, a crowd of 85,000 gathers at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA for "Peace Sunday: We Have a Dream" a rally and concert in support of the United Nations Special Session on Nuclear Disarmament.  Performers include Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.

On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against [[nuclear weapons]] and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history.&lt;ref name="The Spirit of June 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icanw.org"/&gt; International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on June 20, 1983, at 50 sites across the United States.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;Harvey Klehr.

In the 1980s, when fewer nuclear power plants remained in the construction and licensing pipeline, and interest in energy policy as a national issue declined, many anti-nuclear activists switched their focus to nuclear weapons and the arms race.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M.

==People with anti-nuclear views==

===Al Gore===
Former vice president [[Al Gore]] says he is not anti-nuclear, but has stated that the "... cost of the present generation of reactors is nearly prohibitive."&lt;ref name="fai"/&gt; In his 2009 book, ''Our Choice'', Gore argues that nuclear power was once "expected to provide virtually unlimited supplies of low-cost electricity", but the reality is that it has been "... an energy source in crisis for the last 30 years."&lt;ref name=gor/&gt; Worldwide growth in nuclear power has slowed in recent years, with no new reactors and an "actual decline in global capacity and output in 2008." In the United States, "... no nuclear power plants ordered after 1972 have been built to completion."&lt;ref name=gor&gt;Al Gore (2009). ''Our Choice'', Bloomsbury, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the 253 nuclear power reactors originally ordered in the United States from 1953 to 2008, 48 percent were canceled, 11 percent were prematurely shut down, 14 percent experienced at least a one-year-or-more outage, and 27 percent are operating without having a year-plus outage. Thus, only about one fourth of those ordered, or about half of those completed, are still operating and have proved relatively reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Al Gore (2009). ''[[Our Choice]]'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Amory Lovins===
In his 2005 book ''Winning the Oil Endgame'', [[Amory Lovins]] praises nuclear power engineers, but is critical of the nuclear industry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No vendor has made money selling power reactors. This is the greatest failure of any enterprise in the industrial history of the world. We don't mean that as a criticism of nuclear power's practitioners, on whose skill and devotion we all continue to depend; the impressive operational improvements in U.S. power reactors in recent years deserve great credit. It is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions and immense effort. In nuclear power's heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came end-use efficiency, combined-cycle plants, distributed generation (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match.&lt;ref&gt;Lovins, Amory (2005). [http://www.rmi.org/rmi/Library/2004-08_WTOEExecSummary Winning the Oil Endgame] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615202216/http://rmi.org/rmi/Library/2004-08_WTOEExecSummary |date=2010-06-15 }} p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1988, Lovins argued that improving energy efficiency can simultaneously ameliorate [[greenhouse warming]], reduce [[acid rain]] and [[air pollution]], save money, and avoid the problems of nuclear power. Given the urgency of abating global warming, Lovins stated that we cannot afford to invest in nuclear power when those same dollars put into efficiency would displace far more [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Rocky Mountain Institute (1988). [http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid258.php E88-31, Global Warming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705050108/http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid258.php |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Nuclear Power: Climate Fix or Folly," published in 2010, Lovins argued that expanded nuclear power "... does not represent a cost-effective solution to global warming and that investors would shun it were it not for generous government subsidies lubricated by intensive lobbying efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/renewing-support-for-renewables/ |title=Renewing Support for Renewables |author=Nancy Folbre |date=March 28, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph Romm===
[[Joseph Romm]] contends that nuclear power generates about 20 percent of all U.S. electricity, and is a low-carbon source of around-the-clock power, which has received renewed interest in recent years.&lt;ref name=rom&gt;Romm, Joe (2008). [http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/pdf/nuclear_report.pdf The Self-Limiting Future of Nuclear Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204102407/http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/pdf/nuclear_report.pdf |date=2008-12-04 }} p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Romm says, nuclear power's "own myriad limitations will constrain its growth, especially in the near term", and the limitations include:&lt;ref name=rom/&gt;

*"Prohibitively high, and escalating, capital costs
*Production bottlenecks in key components needed to build plants
*Very long construction times
*Concerns about uranium supplies and importation issues
*Unresolved problems with availability and security of radioactive waste storage, which has a 100,000 year shelf life
*Large-scale water use and contamination amid shortages
*High electricity prices from new plants".&lt;ref name=rom/&gt;

===Randall Forsberg===
[[Randall Forsberg]] (née Watson, 1943–2007) became interested in [[arms control]] issues while working at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974, she returned to the United States, and became a graduate student in international studies at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1979, Forsberg wrote ''Call to Halt the Arms Race'', which later was the manifesto of the [[Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign]]. The document advocated a bilateral halt to the testing, production, deployment and delivery of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name=forsb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop_physicians_to_a_dying_planet_author_preprint.pdf |title=Physicians to a Dying Planet: Helen Caldicott, Randall Forsberg, and the Anti-Nuclear Weapons Movement of the Early 1980s |author=Benjamin Redekop |year=2010 |work=Leadership Quarterly 21. |access-date=2013-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407055649/http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop_physicians_to_a_dying_planet_author_preprint.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forsberg was awarded a doctorate in 1980 and she started the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies, which became an important resource for the [[peace movement]] and [[anti-nuclear]] weapons movement. In 1983 Forsberg was awarded a [[MacArthur Foundation]] ''[[genius grant]]''. In 2005 she became Spitzer Professorship in Political Science at the [[City College of New York]], and died of cancer in 2007 when she was 64 years old.&lt;ref name=forsb/&gt;

===Christopher Flavin===
Many advocates of nuclear power argue that, given the urgency of doing something about climate change quickly, it must be pursued. [[Christopher Flavin]], however, contends that speedy implementation is not one of nuclear power's strong points:&lt;ref name=flavin&gt;Worldwatch Institute (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/SOW08_chapter_6.pdf Building a Low-Carbon Economy] in ''State of the World 2008'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Planning, licensing, and constructing even a single nuclear plant typically takes a decade or more, and plants frequently fail to meet completion deadlines. Due to the dearth of orders in recent decades, the world currently has very limited capacity to manufacture many of the critical components of nuclear plants. Rebuilding that capacity will take a decade or more.&lt;ref name=flavin/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given the urgency of the climate problem, Flavin emphasizes the [[Renewable energy commercialization|rapid commercialization of renewable energy]] and [[efficient energy use]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Improved energy productivity and renewable energy are both available in abundance—and new policies and technologies are rapidly making them more economically competitive with fossil fuels. In combination, these energy options represent the most robust alternative to the current energy system, capable of providing the diverse array of energy services that a modern economy requires. Given the urgency of the climate problem, that is indeed convenient.&lt;ref&gt;Worldwatch Institute (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/SOW08_chapter_6.pdf Building a Low-Carbon Economy] in ''State of the World 2008'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2009, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that nuclear power is emerging as "... perhaps the world's most unlikely weapon against [[climate change]], with the backing of even some green activists who once campaigned against it."&lt;ref name=fai/&gt;  The article said that rather than deride the potential for nuclear power, some environmentalists are embracing it, and that presently there is only "muted opposition"—nothing like the protests and plant invasions that helped define the anti-nuclear movement in the United States during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=fai&gt;Anthony Faiola.

Patrick Moore, one of the initial founders of [[Greenpeace]], said in a 2008 interview that, "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realized that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/From-eco-warrior-to-nuclear-champion/2008-13840_3-6228461.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809204523/http://news.cnet.com/From-eco-warrior-to-nuclear-champion/2008-13840_3-6228461.html |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Pittsburgh, calculates that nuclear power is many times safer than any other form of power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/BOOK.html|title=The Nuclear Energy Option|first=Bernard L|last=Cohen|date=|website=www.phyast.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the movement point to independent studies showing the capital costs of renewable energy sources are higher than those from nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ElecCostSUM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

Critics argue that the amount of waste generated by nuclear power is very small, as all the high-level nuclear waste from 50+ years of operation of the world's nuclear reactors would fit into a single football field to the depth of five feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evworld.com/currents.cfm?jid=84|title=Mondragón: The Model For A Vibrant New Economy - EVWORLD.COM|author=|date=|website=evworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Furthermore, U.S. coal power plants presently create nearly a million tons of low-level radioactive waste per day and therefore release more total radioactivity than the nation's nuclear plants,&lt;ref&gt;Hvistendahl, Mara.

Nuclear proponents also point out that cost and the quantity of waste figures for the operation of nuclear power plants are commonly derived from nuclear reactors built using second generation designs, dating from the 1960s. Advanced reactor designs are estimated to be even cheaper to operate and generate less than 1% the amount of waste of current designs, like [[Integral Fast Reactor]]s or [[Pebble Bed Reactor]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

It is because of these facts that proponents argue that nuclear fission power is the safest means currently available to entirely replace the use of fossil fuels, and pro-nuclear environmentalists argue that a combination of both nuclear energy and renewable energy would be the fastest, safest, and cheapest way forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/may/27/why-choose-nuclear-renewable-energy | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=George | last=Monbiot | title=Nuclear power (Environment),Renewable energy (Environment),Energy (Environment),Environment | date=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 [[Gwyneth Cravens]] outlined the message of her newest book, ''Power to Save the World: The Truth About Nuclear Energy''. It argues for [[nuclear power]] as a safe [[energy]] source and an essential preventive of [[global warming]]. ''[[Pandora's Promise]]'' is a 2013 [[documentary film]], directed by [[Robert Stone (director)|Robert Stone]]. It presents an argument that nuclear energy, typically feared by environmentalists, is in fact the only feasible way of meeting humanity's growing need for energy while also addressing the serious problem of [[climate change]]. The movie features several notable individuals (some of whom were once vehemently opposed to nuclear power, but who now speak in support of it), including: [[Stewart Brand]], [[Gwyneth Cravens]], [[Mark Lynas]], [[Richard Rhodes]] and [[Michael Shellenberger]].&lt;ref name=Vulcan&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paul-allen-lends-support-pro-559512 |title=Paul Allen Lends Support to Pro-Nuclear Doc 'Pandora's Promise' |last1=Kilday |first1=Gregg |date=29 May 2013 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-nuclear]] advocate [[Helen Caldicott]] appears briefly.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-13/news/39945376_1_nuclear-power-film-fukushima |title='Pandora's Promise' movie review |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Michael |date=13 June 2013 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=25 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928123154/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-13/news/39945376_1_nuclear-power-film-fukushima |archive-date=28 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, the U.S. nuclear industry has begun a new lobbying effort, hiring three former senators—[[Evan Bayh]], a Democrat; [[Judd Gregg]], a Republican; and [[Spencer Abraham]], a Republican—as well as [[William M. Daley]], a former staffer to President Obama. The initiative is called Nuclear Matters, and it has begun a newspaper advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/business/energy-environment/nuclear-industry-gains-carbon-focused-allies-in-push-to-save-reactors.html?_r=0 |title=Nuclear Industry Gains Carbon-Focused Allies in Push to Save Reactors |author=Matthew Wald |date=April 27, 2014 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2010, anti-nuclear groups such as Physicians for Social Responsibility, NukeFree.org, and NIRS were actively fighting federal loan guarantees for new nuclear plant construction. In February 2010, several groups coordinated a national call-in day to Congress to attempt to stop $54 billion in federal loan guarantees for new nuclear plants. However, the first such loan guarantee of $8.3 billion was offered to Southern Company that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/business/southern-co-negotiating-on-385423.html|title=Southern Co. negotiating on nuke loan guarantees|author=|date=|website=ajc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, about 175 anti-nuclear activists participated in a 126-mile walk in an effort to block the re-licensing of [[Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/BT/20100114/NEWS01/1140347/0/BENNETT Anti-nuclear protesters reach capitol]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Rutland Herald'', January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, numerous anti-nuclear activists and private citizens gathered in Montpelier, to be at hand as the [[Vermont Senate]] voted 26 to 4 against the "Public Good" certificate needed for continued operation of Vermont Yankee past 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Wald, Matthew |title = Vermont Senate Votes to Close Nuclear Plant | work = The New York Times | date = February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 a dozen environmental groups (including [[Friends of the Earth]], South Carolina's [[Sierra Club]], [[List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Nuclear Watch South|Nuclear Watch South]], the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Georgia Women's Action for New Directions) stated that the proposed [[AP1000]] reactor containment design is "... inherently less safe than current reactors."&lt;ref name=pavey/&gt; [[Arnold Gundersen]], a nuclear engineer, authored a 32-page report arguing that the new AP1000 reactors will be vulnerable to leaks caused by corrosion holes. There are plans to construct the Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at seven sites across the southeast, including Plant Vogtle in Burke County, Georgia.&lt;ref name=pavey&gt;Rob Pavey.

In October 2010, Michael Mariotte, executive director of the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]] anti-nuclear group, predicted that the U.S. nuclear industry will not experience a [[nuclear renaissance]], for the most simple of reasons: "nuclear reactors make no economic sense". The economic slump has driven down electricity demand and the price of competing energy sources, and Congress has failed to pass climate change legislation, making nuclear economics very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald.

===Post-Fukushima===
[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumb|Following the 2011 Japanese [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], authorities shut down the nation's 54 nuclear power plants. As of 2013, the Fukushima site remains [[Radiation effects from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|highly radioactive]], with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing, and some land will be unfarmable for centuries. The [[Fukushima disaster cleanup|difficult cleanup job]] will take 40 or more years, and cost tens of billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/12/fukushima-nuclear-accident-lessons-for-us |title=Two years on, America hasn't learned lessons of Fukushima nuclear disaster |author=Richard Schiffman |date=12 March 2013  |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world |title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger |author=Martin Fackler |date=June 1, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], activists who were involved in the movement's emergence (such as [[Graham Nash]] and [[Paul Gunter]]), suggest that Japan's nuclear crisis may rekindle an anti-nuclear protest movement in the United States. The aim, they say, is "... not just to block the Obama administration's push for new nuclear construction, but to convince Americans that existing plants pose dangers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/science/earth/19antinuke.html?_r=1 |title=Japan Crisis Could Rekindle U.S. Antinuclear Movement |author=Leslie Kaufman |date=March 18, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, 600 people gathered for a weekend protest outside the Vermont Yankee plant. The demonstration was held to show support for the thousands of Japanese people who are endangered by possible radiation from the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=14288307 |title=Vermont Yankee: Countdown to closure |date=March 21, 2011 |work=WCAX |access-date=March 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309154836/http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=14288307 |archive-date=March 9, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Rochelle Becker, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility said that the United States should review its nuclear accident liability limits, in the light of the economic impacts of the Fukushima disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/04/18/EDAV1J2TQ7.DTL |title=Who would pay if nuclear disaster happened here? |author=Rochelle Becker  |date=April 18, 2011   |work=San Francisco Chronicle  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New England region has a long history of anti-nuclear activism and 75 people held a State House rally on April 6, 2011, to "protest the region's aging nuclear plants and the increasing stockpile of radioactive spent fuel rods at them."&lt;ref name=regainsvoice/&gt; The protest was held shortly before a State House hearing where legislators were scheduled to hear representatives of the region's three nuclear plants – Pilgrim in Plymouth, Vermont Yankee in Vernon, and Seabrook in New Hampshire—talk about the safety of their reactors in the light of the Japanese nuclear crisis. Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim have reactor designs similar to the crippled Japanese nuclear plants.&lt;ref name=regainsvoice&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2011/04/anti-nuclear_se.html |title=Anti-nuclear sentiment regains its voice at State House rally|author=Martin Finucane  |date=April 6, 2011  |work=Boston.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2011, a total of 45 groups and individuals from across the nation are formally asking the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to immediately suspend all licensing and other activities at 21 proposed nuclear reactor projects in 15 states until the NRC completes a thorough post-[[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima reactor crisis]] examination. The petitioners also are asking the NRC to supplement its own investigation by establishing an independent commission comparable to that set up in the wake of the serious, though less severe, 1979 Three Mile Island accident.

Thirty two years after the No Nukes concert in New York, on August 7, 2011, a [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] benefit concert was held Mountain View, California, to raise money for MUSE and for Japanese tsunami/nuclear disaster relief. The show was powered off-grid and 
artists included Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, John Hall, Graham Nash, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Kitaro, Jason Mraz, Sweet Honey and the Rock, the Doobie Brothers, Tom Morello, and Jonathan Wilson. 
In February 2012, the United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] approved the construction of two additional reactors at the [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant]], the first reactors to be approved in over 30 years since the Three Mile Island accident,&lt;ref name=yah12&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/first-next-gen-us-reactor-designed-avoid-fukushima-005203660.html | title=First Next-Gen US Reactor Designed to Avoid Fukushima Repeat | publisher=Live Science (hosted on Yahoo!) | date=February 9, 2012 | accessdate=February 9, 2012 | author=Hsu, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but NRC Chairman [[Gregory Jaczko]] cast a dissenting vote citing safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], and saying "I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-usa-nuclear-nrc-idUSTRE8182J720120209  |title=U.S. approves first new nuclear plant in a generation  |author=Ayesha Rascoe | date=Feb 9, 2012  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; One week after Southern received the license to begin major construction on the two new reactors, a dozen environmental and [[anti-nuclear]] groups are suing to stop the Plant Vogtle expansion project, saying "public safety and environmental problems since Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor accident have not been taken into account".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/business/groups-sue-to-stop-1351830.html |title=Groups sue to stop Vogtle expansion project |author=Kristi E.

The nuclear reactors to be built at Vogtle are new [[AP1000]] third generation reactors, which are said to have safety improvements over older power reactors.&lt;ref name=yah12/&gt; However, John Ma, a senior structural engineer at the NRC, is concerned that some parts of the AP1000 steel skin are so brittle that the "impact energy" from a plane strike or storm driven projectile could shatter the wall.&lt;ref name=bs11/&gt; Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the AP1000.&lt;ref name=bs11&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nuclear energy: Planning for the Black Swan |author=Adam Piore |date=June 2011 |work=Scientific American }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold Gundersen, a nuclear engineer commissioned by several anti-nuclear groups, released a report which explored a hazard associated with the possible rusting through of the steel liner of the containment structure.&lt;ref name=mlw&gt;Matthew L.

In March 2012, activists protested at [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station]] to mark the one-year anniversary of the nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, Japan. Around 200 people rallied in San Onofre State Beach to listen to several speakers, including two Japanese residents who lived through the Fukushima meltdowns. ''Residents Organizing for Safe Environment'' and several other anti-nuclear energy organizations, organized the event and about 100 activists came in from San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytitan.com/2012/03/anti-nuclear-groups-protest-san-onofre/ |title=Anti nuclear groups protest San Onofre |author=Jameson Steed |date=March 12, 2012  |work=Daily Titan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2012, 23 aging nuclear power plants continue to operate, including some similar in design to those that melted down in Fukushima, such as Vermont Yankee, and Indian Point 2 just 24 miles north of New York City. Vermont Yankee has reached the end of its projected lifetime operation but, despite strong local opposition, the NRC favored extending its license; however, on August 27, 2013, Entergy (VT Yankee's owner) announced it was decommissioning the plant and that "The station is expected to cease power production after its current fuel cycle and move to safe shutdown in the fourth quarter of 2014." &lt;ref name="d.o.2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entergy.com/news_room/newsrelease.aspx?NR_ID=2769|title=Entergy to Close, Decommission Vermont Yankee|author=Media Relations |date=August 27, 2013O}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, 2012, "more than 1,000 people marched to the plant in protest, and about 130 engaging in civil disobedience were arrested".&lt;ref name=nancy2012&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/the-nurture-of-nuclear-power/ |title=The Nurture of Nuclear Power |author=[[Nancy Folbre]] |date=March 26, 2012 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 [[Pew Research Center]] poll, 44 percent of Americans favor and 49 percent oppose the promotion of increased use of nuclear power, while 69 percent favor increasing federal funding for research on wind power, solar power, and hydrogen energy technology.&lt;ref name=nancy2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=pewpoll2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/3-19-12%20Energy%20release.pdf |title=As Gas Prices Pinch, Support for Oil and Gas Production Grows |author=The Pew Research Center For The People and The Press |date=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Before Columbus Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization founded in 1976 by [[Ishmael Reed]], "dedicated to the promotion and dissemination of contemporary American multicultural literature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beforecolumbusfoundation.com/about/ "About"], Before Columbus Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation makes annual awards for books published in the US during the previous year that make contributions to American multicultural literature.&lt;ref name=awards&gt;[http://www.pw.org/writing_contests/american_book_awards "Before Columbus Foundation, American Book Awards"], Poets &amp; Writers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Adhering to its founding grant's requirement that he have a partner, Reed chose poet [[Victor Hernández Cruz]], now a chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. Next to become directors were [[Shawn Wong]], novelist and former chair of the English Department at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], and Presidential medal recipient [[Rudolfo Anaya]]. The foundation, named after [[Ivan van Sertima]]'s book ''They Came before Columbus'' (1976), began as a multi-cultural distribution project, but evolved into a service organization devoted to the recognition of Hispanic, African-American, and Native American authors whose literature of quality might be neglected by the literary mainstream, which, according to the directors, continues to be segregated and fifty years behind the south in terms of diversity - a mainstream that limits its inclusion of minorities to tokenism. Through classrooms, poetry readings, symposia, and publications the foundation has met this goal.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

==[[American Book Awards]]==
In 1980, Ishmael Reed suggested that there be an [[American Book Awards]] to challenge the lack of diversity in the [[Pulitzer Prizes]] and the [[National Book Awards]]. The first awards ceremony was held at The West Side Community Center. In the following year, Public Theater director [[Joseph Papp]] hosted the American Book Awards in New York. The master of ceremonies was [[Quincy Troupe]]. Among the presenters were Nobel Laureate [[Toni Morrison]] and writer [[Donald Barthelme]]. The American Book Awards have been held in [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[New Orleans]], [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[Miami]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], where they were held at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]], and arranged by the late [[Daniel Shore]]. Awards are given annually for books published in the US during the previous year that make contributions to American multicultural literature.&lt;ref name=awards /&gt;

In 1992, the Beyond Columbus Foundation published two anthologies of award-winning selections (one poetry and one fiction). Though severely underfunded, it has survived through what Executive Director Gundars Strads called "blind persistence". Its directors are drawn from the Black, Hispanic, Italian, Irish and Jewish communities. One of the current directors is [[Juan Felipe Herrera]], Poet Laureate of California since 2012 and US Poet Laureate since 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17960">"'''Bernie Bro'''" (sometimes spelled "'''Berniebro'''"; collective '''Bernie Bros''')&lt;ref name="Meyer 2015"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Robinson|last1=Meyer|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/here-comes-the-berniebro-bernie-sanders/411070/|title=Here Comes the Berniebro|work=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|date=October 17, 2015|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a pejorative label applied to some supporters of the 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential primary candidate [[Bernie Sanders]].

==Origin==
Robinson Meyer, a writer for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', coined the term "Bernie bro" in an October 17, 2015 article&lt;ref name="HereComestheBerniebro" /&gt; to describe a phenomenon in which some young, white, progressive men were "hectoring their friends" on [[Facebook]] to support Sanders.&lt;ref name="HessAboutBernieBros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hess|first1=Amanda|title=Everyone Is Wrong About the Bernie Bros; How a necessary critique of leftist sexism deteriorated into a dumb flame war. |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2016/02/bernie_bros_are_bad_the_conversation_around_them_is_worse.html |accessdate=May 15, 2016 |publisher=Slate| date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MeyerCoined"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|title=It's Not Just Berniebros I coined the term—now I've come back to fix what I started.|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/berniebro-revisited/460212/|accessdate=May 15, 2016|publisher=The Atlantic|date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AndrewsSandersBros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Natalie|title=Bernie Sanders on Sexist Commenters: I Don't Want That Support|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/08/bernie-sanders-on-sexist-commenters-i-dont-want-that-support/|accessdate=May 15, 2016|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article, Meyer characterized the Bernie Bro as "male... white; well-educated; middle-class (or, delicately, 'upper middle-class'); and aware of NPR podcasts and jangly bearded bands." Furthermore, according to Meyer, "[t]he Berniebro asserts that this country needs highly principled, pie-in-the-sky progressive policies, regardless of how likely they are to become legislation. The Berniebro supports free college for all and a $15 minimum wage.... The Berniebro voted for Barack Obama in 2012. And 2008, if the Berniebro was old enough to vote."&lt;ref name="HereComestheBerniebro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|title=Here Comes the Berniebro  Look, there is a systemic crisis occurring. On Facebook.|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/here-comes-the-berniebro-bernie-sanders/411070/|accessdate=May 15, 2016|publisher=The Atlantic|date=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer's story was shared 28,000 times on Facebook, bringing the term to public attention.&lt;ref name="MeyerCoined"/&gt;

===Definition===
{{see also | Bro (subculture)}}

''[[USA Today]]'' describes Bernie Bros as "the unsanctioned shock troops of Bernie Sanders' vaunted online army, digital rogues who've plagued Hillary Clinton's presidential bid and embarrassed Sanders' campaign."&lt;ref name="HampsonBernieBros"/&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described the Bros as generally "white, male" Sanders supporters who [[Internet troll|troll]] Clinton supporters, "leaving vitriolic comments on social media accounts and created memes showing Mrs. Clinton as trying too hard to be cool."&lt;ref name="AndrewsSandersBros"/&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' calls them "online trolls...  who attack journalists, politicians and fellow voters they perceive to be pro-Clinton with misogynistic, often vulgar attacks."&lt;ref name="HalperLashingOut"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halper|first1=Evan|title=Sanders' supporters are lashing out, but here's how they might be hurting his campaign|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-bernie-sanders-supporters-20160415-story.html|accessdate=May 19, 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTV correspondent [[Jamil Smith (writer)|Jamil Smith]] described these people as engaging in "trolling, misogyny, and '[[hipster racism]].'"&lt;ref name="SmithBros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Jamil|title=The Sanders campaign knows the 'Bernie Bros' are a problem|url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/128747/sanders-campaign-knows-bernie-bros-problem|accessdate=May 15, 2016|publisher=The New Republic|date=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter Janell Ross described some pro-Sanders online activists as "angry people who sometimes engage in or embrace bigotry," and believed they demonstrated an attitude she called "offensively dismissive, superior, let-us-tell-you-black-voters-what-you-need-and-how-you-should-vote commentary from some subset of Sanders supporters."&lt;ref name="RossBigotry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Janell|title=Bernie Sanders's most vitriolic supporters really test the meaning of the word 'progressive'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/10/bernie-sanderss-most-vitriolic-supporters-really-test-the-meaning-of-the-word-progressive/|accessdate=May 15, 2016|publisher=Washington Post|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
===Sanders campaign response===
In a February 2016 interview with [[CNN]]'s ''[[State of the Union (TV series)|State of the Union]]'', Sanders criticized "Bernie Bros" for their sexist attacks against rival Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]]. "It's disgusting. [...] Anybody who is supporting me and who is doing sexist things, we don't want them. I don't want them. That is not what this campaign is about."&lt;ref name="Bereznak 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastry 2016" /&gt;

===Clinton campaign response===
In February, [[Brian Fallon (press secretary)|Brian Fallon]], Clinton's press secretary, characterized the Bernie Bros as "nasty and vitriolic."&lt;ref name="HampsonBernieBros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hampson|first1=Brian|title=Hillary Clinton, no fan of 'Bernie Bros,' could use their energy vs. Trump|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/05/12/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-social-media-supporters/84284322/|accessdate=May 15, 2016|publisher=USA Today|date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Clinton]] accused the Bernie Bros as carrying out "vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane ... not to mention sexist."&lt;ref name="KarnieBlastsBros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karnie|first1=Annie|title=Bill Clinton batters and blasts Bernie Sanders|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bill-clinton-bernie-sanders-hillary-218916#ixzz48kbIztdE|accessdate=May 15, 2016|publisher=Politico|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online reaction===
Online reaction to the perceived Bernie Bro phenomenon from Clinton supporters ranged from organizational action to the production of [[meme]]s to counter media narratives surrounding the campaign. Bros4Hillary, an advocacy group touting inclusiveness and progressive ideals as their central tenets, was created with the goal of providing a direct response to the perceived misogynistic and white nationalist overtures espoused by Hillary Clinton's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-year-with-hillary_us_58708e62e4b0eb9e49bfbba9|title=In Politics, 2016 Was The Year of the Bro|last=Mohajer|first=Alex|date=January 7, 2017|website=Huffington Post|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2016 presidential election, the group was renamed [[Bros4America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bros4hillary.com|title=Bros4Hillary|website=Bros4Hillary|language=en-US|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their mission statement condemns the "misogyny and white male privilege exemplified by the 'BernieBros' movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bros4america.com/bros4americamission/|title=Bros4America Mission Statement|first=Alex|last=Mohajer|date=December 31, 2016|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
In May 2016, historian [[Joshua M. Zeitz]] suggested that "Bernie's Bros" might follow a pattern seen in the 1968 and 1980 elections in which [[Eugene McCarthy]] and [[Ted Kennedy]] won large numbers of votes from angry Democratic voters who, when their candidate failed to win the Party's nomination, switched and voted for the Republican in November.&lt;ref name="ZeitzBernieBros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeitz|first1=Joshua|title=Why Bernie's Bros Might Go for Trump|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/why-bernies-bros-might-go-for-trump-213915|accessdate=May 26, 2016|publisher=Politico|date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leah McElrath wrote in 2017 that the sexist responses on Twitter purportedly from male Sanders supporters may have been actually Russian bots intended to disrupt the election,&lt;ref name="McElrath"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shareblue.com/watching-the-hearings-i-learned-my-bernie-bro-harassers-may-have-been-russian-bots/ |title=Watching the hearings, I learned my “Bernie bro” harassers may have been Russian bots|author=McElrath, Leah|date=April 2, 2017|publisher=''[[Shareblue]]|access-date=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a suggestion supported in part by testimony at the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] hearings on Russian election interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-russian-interference-2016-us-elections|title=U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Hearings|date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indictments stemming from the [[Mueller investigation]] in February 2018 said that the Russians "engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Collins |first1=Michael |title=Indictment: Russians also tried to help Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein presidential campaigns |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/17/indictment-russians-also-tried-help-bernie-sanders-jill-stein-presidential-campaigns/348051002/ |work=USA TODAY |date=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In an interview with [[Thom Hartmann]], state Senator [[Nina Turner]] (a former surrogate for Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]) affirmed that she was uncomfortable with the term; "I just think it is really hyped by the Clinton campaign. I mean, both candidates have people who really, really support them and sometimes in ways that are not nice. But it's the same thing, if people want to research this, it's the same thing that the Clinton campaign did to President, then Senator, [[Obama]]. I think they were called 'Obama Boys.' So it's really the same stuff recycled that there are a group of men out there that are rabid and they're sexist and they're really against Secretary Clinton."&lt;ref name="TurnerBernieBros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Nina|title=Great Minds p2: Nina Turner - Are Bernie Bros Real?|url=http://conversationswithgreatminds.com/video/great-minds-p2-nina-turner-are-bernie-bros-real|accessdate=July 28, 2016|publisher=Conversations With Great Minds|date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, ''[[The Intercept]]'' journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] called the Bernie Bro narrative a "cheap campaign tactic" and a "journalistic disgrace." He pointed to the millions of women who supported Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton with "one has to be willing to belittle the views and erase the existence of a huge number of American women to wield this 'Bernie Bro' smear." He also pointed to the lack of evidence for the phenomenon outside of the typical vitriol associated with online forums. He summarized the narrative's purpose as follows: "The goal is to inherently delegitimize all critics of Hillary Clinton by accusing them of, or at least associating them with, sexism, thus distracting attention away from Clinton's policy views, funding, and political history and directing it toward the online behavior of anonymous, random, isolated people on the internet claiming to be Sanders supporters."&lt;ref name="Intercept"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenwald|first1=Glenn|title=The “Bernie Bros” Narrative: a Cheap Campaign Tactic Masquerading as Journalism and Social Activism Glenn Greenwald Jan. 31 2016, 8:42 a.m.|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/01/31/the-bernie-bros-narrative-a-cheap-false-campaign-tactic-masquerading-as-journalism-and-social-activism/|website=[[The Intercept]]|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathan Wellman wrote in [[US Uncut|U.S. Uncut]] that users of the term "are essentially erasing the contributions of women and people of color to the Bernie Sanders campaign to propagate their own narrative, rendering them as invisible people. This is one of the oldest forms of violence perpetuated by white people of privilege."&lt;ref name="WellmenBernieBros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wellmen|first1=Nathan|title=The 'Bernie Bro' is a Media Myth.

'''''Bruh Rabbit and the Tar Baby Girl''''' is a 2003 picture book by [[Virginia Hamilton]] and illustrated by James Ransome. It is a retelling by Hamilton, in the [[Gullah language|Gullah dialect]], of the [[Tar-Baby|classic story]] of [[Br'er Rabbit|Bruh Rabbit]] outwitting [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Bruh Wolf]].

==Reception==
''[[BookList]]'', in a review of ''Bruh Rabbit and the Tar Baby Girl'', wrote "In this version of the beloved Tar Baby trickster story, she drew on Gullah folklore from the Sea Islands of South Carolina. Her rhythmic, immediate version is well matched by Ransome's paintings, both cozy and exciting, which extend the fun with beautiful farmland scenes at dayclean (dawn) and daylean (evening) picturing the wily rabbit thief in human clothes repeatedly outwitting the wolf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/1243848/Reviews |title=Bruh Rabbit and the tar baby girl |website=buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' described it as "meticulously paced, lyrical, hilarious, and a joy to read aloud." with "lush watercolors [that] suit the story perfectly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/item/show/271595082_bruh_rabbit_and_the_tar_baby_girl |title=Bruh Rabbit and the Tar Baby Girl |website=kcls.bibliocommons |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto''''' written by [[Benedetto Cotrugli]] around 1400 was the first [[bookkeeping]] [[manuscript]] and trade manual.&lt;ref name="item 1441"&gt;[[#Anzovin|Anzovin, 2000]], p. 36, item 1441&lt;/ref&gt; The title has been translated in English by the alternate names of ''Of commerce and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="item 1441"/&gt; ''On merchantry and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et22a1.html History of Croatian Science, 15th-19th centuries]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''On trade and the perfect dealer.''&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"&gt;[http://www.oxbridgewriters.com/essays/accounting/financial-accounting-accountants.php Essay title - Financial Accounting And Accountants]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several historians show that, since the manuscript was written in 1458, it is the oldest known manuscript on the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]], and, as such, predates [[Luca Pacioli]]'s book by at least 36 years.&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AccountingHistory"&gt;[http://www.promonegocios.net/contabilidad/historia-contabilidad.html Accounting History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/siesc2.html SIESC 2007 in CROATIA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"&gt;''In Chapter XIII of the 1st book is called "order to keep " the records marketable '. There are only very vague rules, and the author observes: "..... narrating everything here wanting to '1 minute 'treatment would be too verbose et almost impossible to express it, "that without the living voice, writing can hardly be impa" rare. " However, one can easily argue that Benedict Cotrugli want to talk about the double entry. He says that the scriptures remind you credit, debt, cost of goods, profits and losses and any other cenda ago, adds that the merchant must hold the memorial, the newspaper, and the notebook with its own alphabet, which devesi entered in the log, what to do, the Whole capital and bring everything to your file. 'S work of the merchant Ragusin was not amended in the audience, Luca Pacioli is no longer the first exhibitor of record keeping.'' [[#Alfieri|Alfieri, 1891]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason why Luca Pacioli (1445–1517) received credit as the father of accounting is because Cotrugli's work was not officially published until 1573.&lt;ref&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/evolucion-historica-de-la-contabilidad.html Historical evolution of accounting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paciolicode.com/ 3.

An early copy of ''Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto'' from the end of the fifteenth century is at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=28931&amp;lang=en | journal = [[Dubrovnik Annals]] | issn = 1331-3878 | publisher = [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] | location = Dubrovnik, Croatia | number = 6 |date=July 2002 | title = Book Review: Marin Rafaeli of Ragusa on Double-Entry Bookkeeping in 1475: a Recent Discovery by Anne J. van der Helm and Johanna Postma | author = Vladimir Stipetić | page = 123 | accessdate = 2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.kpn.nl/annejvanderhelm/paper.html LA RIEGOLA DE LIBRO Bookkeeping instructions from the mid-fifteenth century]&lt;/ref&gt; Another early copy is at [[Biblioteca Marciana]] in Venice.&lt;ref name="AccountingHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edit16.iccu.sbn.it/scripts/iccu_ext.dll?fn=10&amp;i=13663 Prospectus Title]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first English translation of the Libro de l'arte de la mercatura (The Book of the Art of Trade) edited by Carlo Carraro and Giovanni Favero, with a foreword by Niall Ferguson, Professor of History at Harvard University, has been published by Palgrave Mcmillan in 2017, based on the critical edition of the original manuscripts made by Vera Ribaudo, University of Venice, published on May 2016 by Edizioni Cà Foscari, Venice. 

== Manuscript content ==
The manuscript contains four books. The first is of the origin, form, and essence of being a [[merchant]]. The second talks of a merchant's religious commitment. The third is of moral virtues and policies. The fourth is administration of his home and family, and his economic matters.&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hangers|Hangers, 1803]], p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the manuscript merchandising was regarded as an art. The "Perfect Merchant" or "Perfect Dealer" was a man of culture motivated  
to good moral conduct and honest transactions to everyone he encountered. He had to be very sensitive to local interests in places where he conducted business. He had to know how to assess the political situation and the customary laws in order to successfully conduct his business. Kotruljević wrote in his bookkeeping and merchandising trade manual that not only must a merchant be a [[bookkeeper]]-[[accountant]], but that he must also be a good writer, a [[rhetorician]] and a [[Intellectual#Men of letters|man of letters]] being diplomatic all the while.&lt;ref name="conduct"&gt;[http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/30/id/123/ Markets of the Mediterranean]&lt;/ref&gt;

He contrasted the "Perfect Merchant" to sailors and soldiers by saying that they were many times naive of these points. He said they were of such dull mind that when they would drink in a tavern and buy bread at a market they often had [[grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]] and were not very diplomatic.&lt;ref name="conduct"/&gt;

A '''drawl''' is a perceived feature of some varieties of spoken [[English language|English]], and generally indicates longer [[vowel]] sounds and [[diphthong]]s. Varieties of English which are said to feature pronounced drawls include [[Southern American English]], Broad Australian English, and Broad New Zealand English.

The ''Southern Drawl'', or the [[diphthongization]] or [[triphthong]]ization, of the traditional short front vowels as in the words ''pat'', ''pet'', and ''pit'': these develop a glide up from their original starting position to {{IPA|[j]}} and, in some cases, back down to [[schwa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14399">[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|Jean-Jacques Rousseau, populariser of the idea of the general will]]

In [[political philosophy]], the '''general will''' ({{lang-fr|volonté générale}}) is the [[will (philosophy)|will]] of the people as a whole. The term was made famous by 18th-century French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

==Basic ideas==

The phrase "general will," as Rousseau used it, occurs in Article Six of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' (French: ''Déclaration des droits de l'Homme et du citoyen''), composed in 1789 during the [[French Revolution]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to contribute personally, or through their representatives, to its formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, positions, and employments, according to their capacities, and without any other distinction than that of their virtues and their talents.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in James Swenson, ''On Jean-Jacques Rousseau'' (Stanford University Press 2001), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Swenson writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;To my knowledge, the only time Rousseau actually uses the formulation "expression of the general will" is in a passage of the ''Discours sur l'économie politique'', whose content renders it little susceptible of celebrity. [...] But it is indeed a faithful summary of his doctrine, faithful enough that commentators frequently adopt it without any hesitation. Among Rousseau's definitions of law, the textually closest variant can be found in a passage of the ''Lettres écrites de la montagne'' summarizing the argument of ''Du contrat social'', in which law is defined as "a public and solemn declaration of the general will on an object of common interest."&lt;ref&gt;''Lettres de la montagne'', quoted in Swenson (2000), p. 164. See also: Patrick Riley, ''The General Will before Rousseau'' (Princeton University Press, 1988) and Mark Hulliung "Rousseau, Voltaire and the Revenge of Pascal" in the ''Cambridge Companion to Rousseau'', edited by Patrick Riley (Cambridge University Press: 2000), pp. 57-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As used by Rousseau, the "general will" is considered by some identical to the [[rule of law]],&lt;ref&gt;See Maurice Cranston's introduction to the ''Social Contract'', Penguin Classics, 1968, pp. 9-42.&lt;/ref&gt; and to Spinoza's ''mens una''.&lt;ref&gt;for Spinoza's ''mens una'', see Jonathan Israel, ''Radical Enlightenment'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The notion of the general will is wholly central to Rousseau's theory of [[political legitimacy]]. [...] It is, however, an unfortunately obscure and controversial notion. Some commentators see it as no more than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] or the tyranny of the urban poor (such as may perhaps be seen in the French Revolution). Such was not Rousseau's meaning. This is clear from the ''Discourse on Political Economy'', where Rousseau emphasizes that the general will exists to protect individuals against the mass, not to require them to be sacrificed to it. He is, of course, sharply aware that men have selfish and sectional interests which will lead them to try to oppress others. It is for this reason that loyalty to the good of all alike must be a supreme (although not exclusive) commitment by everyone, not only if a truly general will is to be heeded but also if it is to be formulated successfully in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;Entry, "Rousseau" in the ''Routelege Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edward Craig, editor, Volume Eight, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==
Early critics of Rousseau included [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].  Hegel argued that, because it lacked any grounding in an objective ideal of reason, Rousseau's account of the general will ineluctably lead to the [[Reign of Terror]].  Constant also blamed Rousseau for the excesses of the French Revolution, and he rejected the total subordination of the citizen-subjects to the determinations of the general will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Theory |contribution=General Will |author=Joseph Reisert |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Bevir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gryvMfjg-zEC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=551–553 |year=2010 |isbn=1412958652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 [[Jacob Talmon]] characterized Rousseau's "general will" as leading to a [[totalitarian democracy]] because, Talmon argued, the state subjected its citizens to the supposedly infallible will of the [[tyranny of the majority|majority]]. Another writer of the period, liberal theorist [[Karl Popper]], also interpreted Rousseau in this way, while [[Bertrand Russell]] warned that "the doctrine of general will ... made possible the mystic identification of a leader with its people, which has no need of confirmation by so mundane an apparatus as the ballot box."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_tGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rousseau's Social Contract: An Introduction |author= David Lay Williams |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0521124447 |pages=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent critics include [[Isaiah Berlin]] who argued that Rousseau's association of freedom with obedience to the General Will allowed totalitarian leaders to defend oppression in the name of freedom, and made Rousseau "one of the most sinister and formidable enemies of liberty in the whole history of human thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dj-bMlq0V5QC&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Isaiah Berlin: Liberty, Pluralism and Liberalism |author= George Crowder |page=61 |publisher=Polity |year= 2004 |isbn=978-0745624778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense of Rousseau==
Some Rousseau scholars, however, such as his biographer and editor Maurice Cranston, and Ralph Leigh, editor of Rousseau's correspondence, do not consider Talmon's 1950s "totalitarian thesis" as sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;For a rejoinder to Talmon see R. A. Leigh, "Liberté et autorité dans le Contrat Social" in ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et son oeuvre'', (Paris, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of Rousseau argued that Rousseau was not alone among republican political theorists in thinking that small, homogeneous states were best suited to maintaining the freedom of their citizens. [[Montesquieu]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] were also of this opinion. Furthermore, Rousseau envisioned his ''[[Social Contract]]'' as part of a projected larger work on political philosophy, which would have dealt with issues in larger states. Some of his later writings, such as his ''Discourse on Political Economy'', his proposals for a Constitution of Poland, and his essay on maintaining perpetual peace, in which he recommends a federated [[European Union]], gave an idea of the future direction of his thought.

His defenders also argued Rousseau is one of the great prose stylists and because of his penchant for the paradoxical effect obtained by stating something strongly and then going on to qualify or negate it, it is easy to misrepresent his ideas by taking them out of context.

Rousseau was also a great synthesizer who was deeply engaged in a dialog with his contemporaries and with the writers of the past, such as the theorists of [[Natural Law]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]]. Like "the body politic", "the general will" was a term of art and was not invented by Rousseau, though admittedly Rousseau did not always go out of his way to explicitly  acknowledge his debt to the jurists and theologians who influenced him. Prior to Rousseau, the phrase "general will" referred explicitly to the general (as opposed to the particular) will or ''volition'' (as it is sometimes translated) of the Deity. It occurs in the theological writings of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/malebranche/ See the "Nicolas Malebranche" entry in the ''Stanford History of Philosophy'' (revised 2009).]&lt;/ref&gt; who had picked it up from [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], and in the writings of Malebranche's pupil, [[Montesquieu]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Riley, "The General Will Before Rousseau", ''Political Theory'' 6: 4: Special Issue: ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau'' (Nov., 1978): 485-516&lt;/ref&gt; who contrasted ''volonté particulière'' and ''volonté générale'' in a secular sense in his most celebrated chapter (Chapter XI) of [[The Spirit of the Laws|''De L'Esprit des Lois'']] (1748).&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau at one point, states that the most profound metaphysics are to be found in "Plato, Locke, or Malebranche" P [IV: III], quoted in Charles William Hendel, ''Rousseau Moralist'' [Oxford University Press, 1934], p. 169.

Lennon and Paul J. Olscamp, editors (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 742.]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Discourse on Political Economy'', Rousseau explicitly credits [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' article "''Droit Naturel''" as the source of "the luminous concept" of the general will, of which he maintains his own thoughts are simply a development. Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau's innovation was to use the term in a secular rather than theological sense.

==Quotations==
'''Diderot on the General Will''' [emphasis added]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
EVERYTHING you conceive, everything you contemplate, will be good, great, elevated, sublime, if it accords with ''the general and common interest''. There is no quality essential to your species apart from that which you demand from all your fellow men to ensure your happiness and theirs . . . . [D]o not ever lose sight of it, or else you will find that your comprehension of the notions of goodness, justice, humanity and virtue grow dim. Say to yourself often, “I am a man, and I have no other truly inalienable natural rights except those of humanity.”  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
But, you will ask, in what does this '''general will''' reside? Where can I consult it? [...] [The answer is:] In the principles of prescribed law of all civilized nations, in the social practices of savage and barbarous peoples; in the tacit agreements obtaining amongst the enemies of mankind; and even in those two emotions — indignation and resentment — which nature has extended as far as animals to compensate for social laws and public retributions. --Denis Diderot, “''Droit Naturel''” article in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Diderot: Political writings: Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought,'' edited by John Hope Mason and Robert Walker (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 20. Compare Rousseau: “Cast your eyes on all the nations of the world, go through all the histories. Among so many inhuman and bizarre cults, among this prodigious diversity of morals and character, you will find everywhere the same ideas of justice and decency, everywhere the same notions of good and bad” (''Emile'', 288, [IV 597-98]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Rousseau on the General Will''' [emphasis added]:&lt;blockquote&gt;AS long as several men assembled together consider themselves as a single body, they have only ''one will'' which is directed towards their common preservation and general well-being. Then, all the animating forces of the state are vigorous and simple, and its principles are clear and luminous; it has no incompatible or conflicting interests; the ''common good'' makes itself so manifestly evident that only common sense is needed to discern it. Peace, unity and equality are the enemies of political sophistication. Upright and simple men are difficult to deceive precisely because of their simplicity; stratagems and clever arguments do not prevail upon them, they are not indeed subtle enough to be dupes. When we see among the happiest people in the world bands of peasants regulating the affairs of state under an oak tree, and always acting wisely, can we help feeling a certain contempt for the refinements of other nations, which employ so much skill and effort to make themselves at once illustrious and wretched?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A state thus governed needs very few laws [...]&lt;ref&gt;''Of the Social Contract'', Book IV, Chapter 1, Paragraphs 1 &amp; 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;However, when the social tie begins to slacken and the state to weaken, when particular interests begin to make themselves felt and sectional societies begin to exert an influence over the greater society, the ''common interest'' then becomes corrupted and meets opposition, voting is no longer unanimous; the '''general will''' is no longer the will of all; contradictions and disputes arise, and even the best opinion is not allowed to prevail unchallenged."&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Contract'', Book IV, paragraph 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For this reason the sensible rule for regulating public assemblies is one intended not so much to uphold the '''general will''' there, as to ensure that it is always questioned and always responds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Contract'', Book IV, Chapter 1, Paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:BKK-0972 (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|The Giant Swing in Bangkok]]
The '''Giant Swing''' ({{lang-th|เสาชิงช้า}}, {{RTGS|Sao Chingcha}}, {{IPA-th|sǎw t͡ɕʰīŋ.t͡ɕʰáː|pron}}) is a religious structure in [[Phra Nakhon District|Phra Nakhon]], [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. Located in front of [[Wat Suthat]], it was formerly used in an old [[Brahmin]] ceremony, and is one of Bangkok's tourist attractions.
&lt;!--N 13° 45.097' E 100° 30.072' according to http://www.kutu.com/thai/gps/Bangkok.htm - but MapQuest shows that coordinate as being at Sanam Luang --&gt;

==History==
The Giant Swing was constructed in 1784 in front of the [[Devasathan]] shrine by King [[Rama I]]. During the reign of [[Buddha Loetla Nabhalai|Rama II]] the swing ceremony was discontinued as the swing had become structurally damaged by lightning. In 1920 it was renovated and moved to its current location in order to make space for a gas plant. The ceremony was again performed until 1935, when it was discontinued after several fatal accidents.

The last renovations were done in 1959, and after 45 years of exposure to the elements the wooden pillars were showing signs of serious damage. A major reconstruction began in April 2005. Six teak tree trunks were used. The two used for the main structure of the swing are over 3.5 m in circumference and over 30m in height. The remaining four are used for support and are 2.30 m in circumference and 20 m in height.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manager.co.th/Daily/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000067781 Daily News - Manager Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The swing was taken down in late October 2006 and the work finished in December of the same year. The rebuilt swing was dedicated in royal ceremonies presided over by King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] in September 2007. The timbers of the original swing are preserved in the [[Bangkok National Museum]].

In 2005, the Giant Swing, together with Wat Suthat, was proposed as a future UNESCO [[World Heritage]] site.

==Surroundings==
'''Wat Suthat Thep Wararam'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Wat Suthat]] Thep Wararam, commonly shortened to "Wat Suthat", is an important temple in Thailand. Inside the grand hall is a Phra Sri Sagaya Munee, its principal Buddha image which was acquired from Wat Mahathat in [[Sukhothai (city)|Sukhothai]]. Wat Suthat was built by King Rama I in the center of his capital, but it was completed in the reign of Rama III.&lt;ref&gt;ThammaThai "WatSuthat" Retrieved 19 October 2013, [http://www.dhammathai.org/watthai/bangkok/watsutat.php], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many people often make pilgrimages to worship the Buddha especially on holy days such as Visakha Bucha Day and Magha Bucha Day.

'''SarnChoa Po Seu or Tiger God Shrine'''
In the quarter there is also a well known and high regarded Chinese shrine, Sarn Choa Po Seu ('tiger shrine'). Originally it was a building on Bamrungmueng Road where the big Chinese communities were. Later, King Rama V expanded the road and had the shrine relocated to the current location on Ta Nao Road near WatMahanaparam.&lt;ref&gt;Travel "PaiWaiSarnJaoPorSeu" Retrieved 19 October 2013, [http://travel.kapook.com/view8796.html], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The site is a place of worship for Thai and Chinese people seeking success in career, money, love, and infant fertility.

It was built in King Rama III reign which is 1834 and now.. Tiger God Shrine is one of the most ancient and famous shrines in Thailand.  Moreover, this shrine has beautiful interior design and has some antiquities. Most people come to pay respect to "Tua Lao Aie", a Chinese God to have good fortune, especially on Chinese New Year's Day.&lt;ref&gt;ศาลเจ้าพ่อเสือ Retrieved 17 April 2017, [http://chaoporseua.blogspot.com/] , 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LanKonMueng'''&lt;br/&gt;
At the heart of the quarter is LanKonMueng in front of city hall. Every evening, this is the recreational area of the locals where they can exercise such as dance aerobics, jogging, stroll around, gather or just relax, bring children or pets out for a walk and enjoy the breeze.&lt;ref&gt;Travel "Sao ching cha" Retrieved 18 October 2013, [http://www.manager.co.th/travel/viewnews.aspx?NewsID=9560000034732], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devasathan'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Devasathan]] Shrine is the most important religious and ancient place for Brahmin-Hindu in Thailand. It was built in 1784. which is in King Rama I's reign. According to ancient tradition, it was built for holding officiating religious ceremony in the past. Devasathan Shrine has three important sanctuaries which are Shiva sanctuary, Ganesha sanctuary, and Narayana sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;เทวสถาน Retrieved 17 April 2017, [http://www.devasthan.org/newweb/%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2], 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swing ceremony==
{{main|Triyampawai ceremony}}
An annual swinging ceremony known as ''Triyampavai-Tripavai'' was held at Giant Swings of major cities until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=M. E. Manickavasagom Pillai |title=Dravidian Influence in Thai Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soFCAAAAYAAJ |year=1986 |publisher=Tamil University |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two [[Tamil language]] Hindu chants: ''[[Thiruvempavai]]'' (a [[Shaivite]] hymn by [[Manikkavacakar]]) and ''[[Thiruppavai]]'' (a [[Vaishnavite]] hymn by Andal). Among Thai people, the ceremony was popularly known as ''Lo Jin Ja'' or ''Lo-Chin-Cha'' ("pulling the swing"). It is known that Tamil verses from ''Thiruvempavai'' — ''poet pratu sivalai'' ("opening the portals of Shiva's home") — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the coronation ceremony of the [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thai king]].&lt;ref name="Upendra_1986"&gt;{{cite book |author=Upendra Thakur |title=Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m42TldA_OvAC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1986 |publisher=Abhinav |isbn=978-81-7017-207-9 |pages=27–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Consider Our Vow: Translation of Tiruppāvai and Tiruvempāvai Into English |author=Norman Cutler |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fMOAAAAMAAJ |year=1979 |publisher=Muttu Patippakam |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an ancient [[Hindu]] epic, after [[Brahma]] created the world he sent [[Shiva]] to look after it. When Shiva descended to the earth, [[Nāga|Naga]] serpents wrapped around the mountains in order to keep the earth in place. After Shiva found the earth solid, the Nagas moved to the seas in celebration. The Swing Ceremony was a re-enactment of this. The pillars of the Giant Swing represented the mountains, while the circular base of the swing represented the earth and the seas. In the ceremony Brahmins would swing, trying to grab a bag of coins placed on one of the pillars.

==Bus==
You can go to Giant Swing by bus number 12, 35, 42, and 508. &lt;ref&gt;เสาชิงช้า Retrieved 17 April 2017, [[:th:เสาชิงช้า|เสาชิงช้า]] ,2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilgal I''' ({{lang-he| גלגל}}) is an archaeological site in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], [[West Bank]], dated to the [[Neolithic]] period. The site is located eight miles north of ancient [[Jericho]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146520118.html Farming began with fig trees, say experts]&lt;/ref&gt; The features and artifacts unearthed at Gilgal I shed important light on agriculture in the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/publications/Gilgal.html Gilgal: Early Neolithic Occupations in the Lower Jordan Valley (The Excavations of Tamar Noy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to the [[Bible]], [[Gilgal]] is the camp where Joshua and the children of Israel first settled upon entering the [[Promised Land]] (Joshua 5:9).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingchristiannews.com/articles/display_art.html?ID=10348 Ancient Gilgal Camp Discovered in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilgal I was first excavated by Tamar Noy in 1979. Further excavations were conducted by Ofer Bar-Yosef of Harvard University and Mordechai E. Kislev and Anat Hartmann of [[Bar-Ilan University]]. They found caches of selectively propagated [[ficus|fig]] seeds, stored together with wild [[barley]], wild [[oat]], and [[acorn]]s in quantities too large to be accounted for even by [[intensive gathering]], at strata datable c. 11,000 years ago. The dig also unearthed the remains of thirteen round buildings made of mud and rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3344688,00.html Where's the historical Gilgal?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal I, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kislev | first1 = Mordechai E. | last2 = Hartmann | first2 = Anat | last3 = Bar-Yosef | first3 = Ofer | year = 2006 | title = Early Domesticated Fig in the Jordan Valley | url = | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5778| pages = 1372–1374 | doi = 10.1126/science.1125910 | pmid=16741119}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Gilgal, archaeologists found ancient carbonized figs stored in an 11,400-year-old house which appear to be a mutant [[Parthenocarpy|"parthenocarpic"]] variety, bred for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146520118.html Farming began with fig trees, say experts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The figs discovered at Gilgal lack embryonic seeds, a mutation that does not survive in nature more than a single generation. This suggests that the fig trees at Gilgal were artificially maintained by planting live branches in the ground, a horticultural technique known as vegetative propagation. Some fig remains recovered from other sites in the Middle East appear to be of the Gilgal variety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060601-agriculture_2.html Ancient Fig Find May Push Back Birth of Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) baked clay objects were discovered at Gilgal I, most of them figurines and symbolic artifacts. As some of the earliest ceramic findings in the Levant, they are of interest to archaeologists for their artistic, stylistic, symbolic and technological characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/389809/Technology_of_the_Fired_Clay_Objects_from_Gilgal_I Technology of the fired clay objects from Gilgal I]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moreshet Foundation Israel (MHF Israel) is developing the Gilgal Education Center in the Jordan Valley, a center open to the public that will highlight the importance of this archaeological site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilgalvisitorcenter.org/wp/ Gilgal Visitors Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordon Square''' is part of the [[Bedford Estate]] in [[Bloomsbury]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] (postal district [[WC postcode area|WC1]]). 

==History and buildings==
The square was developed by master builder [[Thomas Cubitt]] in the 1820s, as one of a pair with [[Tavistock Square]], which is a block away and has the same dimensions. As with most London squares the central garden was originally for the private use of the residents of the surrounding houses, but it now belongs to the [[University of London]] and is open to the public. The square is named after the second wife of the [[6th Duke of Bedford]], Lady Georgiana Gordon,  daughter of [[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon]]. The university owns many of the buildings in the square and in early 2005 it submitted an application for a refurbishment of the square, including the reinstatement of railings similar to the originals. The work was completed in 2007. The west side of the square is dominated by the listed church of ''[[Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury|Christ the King]]'' and next to it the home of [[Dr Williams's Library]].

The [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]], a department of [[University College London]], is on the north side of the square. The [[Campaign for Science and Engineering]] and [[UCL Urban Laboratory]] resides in Gordon House, at the square's north-west corner. Gordon Street leads from the north-west corner with the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] close by. The [[Warburg Institute]] (part of the [[School of Advanced Study]]) is located on the south-west corner of the square, across Tavistock Place.

Nos. 16–26, on the western side of the Square, were not completed until 1855, and they represent some of the last buildings created by [[Thomas Cubitt]]. They now mostly house UCL academic departments. For example, No. 22 houses the [[Department of Science and Technology Studies]].

==Notable residents==
The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946) lived at 46 Gordon Square,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asms.k12.ar.us/classes/humanities/britlit/97-98/bell/46GORDON.HTM 46 Gordon Square] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155726/http://asms.k12.ar.us/classes/humanities/britlit/97-98/bell/46GORDON.HTM |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; marked by a [[blue plaque]]. Before Keynes moved in, the same house was occupied by a young [[Virginia Woolf]] (1882-1941) and her siblings (including the noted painter and interior designer [[Vanessa Bell]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uah.edu/woolf/bloomsbury.html|title=Information and Quotations: "Old Bloomsbury"|website=Uah.edu|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequented by other members of the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewordtravels.com/bloomsburygroup.html|title=Bloomsbury Group Locations|website=Thewordtravels.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer and biographer [[Lytton Strachey]] lived at No. 51. Houses 43 to 46 are now occupied by the School of Arts, [[Birkbeck, University of London]].

[[File:St Patrick's saltire.svg|thumb|right|The Greenshirts, like their Blueshirt predecessors, used the Saint Patrick's saltire flag as the symbol of their movement.]]

The '''Greenshirts''' were members of the [[fascist]] [[National Corporate Party]] (NCP) in [[Ireland]] in the 1930s. The NCP was founded by [[Eoin O'Duffy]] after he broke from the [[Fine Gael]] party in 1935. The Greenshirts were different from the better known [[Blueshirts]], O'Duffy's followers before he left Fine Gael. Only eighty of the Blueshirts later became Greenshirts. It was an influence to a later fascist party, [[Ailtirí na hAiséirghe]].

In 1936 O'Duffy [[Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War)|led a volunteer Irish Brigade]] to fight for the Nationalists in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and retired on his return in 1937. Without him, both the Greenshirts and NCP faded away.

The '''Head of a Warrior''' is a recurring [[Theme (arts)|theme]] in art.  The heads vary a great deal across time and artistic style, but all present an intriguing look into both the soldier and the artist of the day.

[[File:Cristobal Rojas 37a.JPG|thumb|380px|''La Miseria'' by [[Cristóbal Rojas (artist)|Cristóbal Rojas]] (1886). Rojas was suffering from tuberculosis, when he painted this. Here he depicts the social aspect of the disease, and its relation with living conditions at the close of the 19th century.]]

'''Consumption''', '''phthisis''' and the '''White Plague''' are all terms used to refer to '''[[tuberculosis]] throughout history'''. It is generally accepted that ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' originated from other, more primitive organisms of the same genus ''[[Mycobacterium]]''. In 2014, results of a new DNA study of a tuberculosis genome reconstructed from remains in southern Peru suggest that human tuberculosis is less than 6,000 years old. Even if researchers theorize that humans first acquired it in Africa about 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; there is evidence that the first tuberculosis infection happened about 9,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Hershkovitz e3426"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Detection and Molecular Characterization of 9000-Year-Old Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a Neolithic Settlement in the Eastern Mediterranean|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003426|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2008-10-15|pmc = 2565837|pmid = 18923677|pages = e3426|volume = 3|issue = 10|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003426|first = Israel|last = Hershkovitz|first2 = Helen D.|last2 = Donoghue|first3 = David E.|last3 = Minnikin|first4 = Gurdyal S.|last4 = Besra|first5 = Oona Y-C.|last5 = Lee|first6 = Angela M.|last6 = Gernaey|first7 = Ehud|last7 = Galili|first8 = Vered|last8 = Eshed|first9 = Charles L.|last9 = Greenblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread to other humans along trade routes. It also spread to domesticated animals in Africa, such as goats and cows. Seals and sea lions that bred on African beaches are believed to have acquired the disease and carried it across the Atlantic to South America. Hunters would have been the first humans to contract the disease there.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Origins==
Scientific work investigating the evolutionary origins of the ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' complex has concluded that the most recent common ancestor of the complex was a human-specific [[pathogen]], which underwent a [[population bottleneck]]. Analysis of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units has allowed dating of the bottleneck to approximately 40,000 years ago, which corresponds to the period subsequent to the expansion of ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' out of Africa. This analysis of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units also dated the ''Mycobacterium bovis'' lineage as dispersing approximately 6,000 years ago, which may be linked to animal domestication and early farming.&lt;ref name="wirth"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wirth T. |author2=Hildebrand F. | year = 2008 | title = Origin, spread and demography of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = e1000160 | doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000160 | pmid=18802459 | pmc=2528947|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human bones from the Neolithic show a presence of the bacteria. There have also been a claim of evidence of lesions characteristic of tuberculosis in a 500,000 years old Homo erectus fossile, although this finding is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Letter to the editor: Was tuberculosis present in Homo erectus in Turkey?|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21056/abstract|journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date = 2009-07-01|issn = 1096-8644|pages = 442–444|volume = 139|issue = 3|doi = 10.1002/ajpa.21056|language = en|first = Charlotte A.|last = Roberts|first2 = Luz-Andrea|last2 = Pfister|first3 = Simon|last3 = Mays|pmid=19358292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of a genome study reported in 2014 suggest that tuberculosis is newer than previously thought. Scientists were able to recreate the genome of the bacteria from remains of 1,000-year-old skeletons in southern Peru. In dating the DNA, they found it was less than 6,000 years old. They also found it related most closely to a tuberculosis strain in seals, and have theorized that these animals were the mode of transmission from Africa to South America.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The team from University of Tubingen believe that humans acquired the disease in Africa about 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Their domesticated animals, such as goats and cows, contracted it from them. Seals acquired it when coming up on African beaches for breeding, and carried it across the Atlantic. In addition, TB spread via humans on the trade routes of the Old World. Other researchers have argued there is other evidence that suggests the tuberculosis bacteria is older than 6,000 years.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; This TB strain found in Peru is different from that prevalent today in the Americas, which is more closely related to a later Eurasian strain likely brought by European colonists.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;"Sea Lions And Seals Likely Spread Tuberculosis To Ancient Peruvians", National Public Radio, Aug 21, 2014 [https://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/08/21/341930621/sea-lions-and-seals-swam-tuberculosis-to-ancient-peruvians]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this result is criticised by other experts from the field,&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; for instance because there is evidence of the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 9000 year old skeletal remains.&lt;ref name="Hershkovitz e3426"/&gt;

Although relatively little is known about its frequency before the 19th century, its incidence is thought to have peaked between the end of the 18th century and the end of the 19th century. Over time, the various cultures of the world gave the illness different names: ''phthisis'' (Greek), ''consumptione'' (Latin), ''yaksma'' (India), and ''chaky oncay'' (Incan), each of which make reference to the "drying" or "consuming" affect of the illness, [[cachexia]].

In the 19th century, TB's high mortality rate among young and middle-aged adults and the surge of [[Romanticism]], which stressed feeling over reason, caused many to refer to the disease as the "romantic disease".

In 2008, evidence for tuberculosis infection was discovered in human remains from the Neolithic era dating from 9,000 years ago, in [[Atlit Yam]], a settlement in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hershkovitz I. |author2=Donoghue H.

Evidence of the infection in humans was also found in a cemetery near Heidelberg, in the [[Neolithic]] bone remains that show evidence of the type of angulation often seen with spinal tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Madkour 2004:3&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors call tuberculosis the first disease known to mankind.

Signs of the disease have also been found in Egyptian mummies dated between 3000 and 2400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Zink 2003:359-67&lt;/ref&gt; The most convincing case was found in the mummy of priest Nesperehen, discovered by Grebart in 1881, which featured evidence of spinal tuberculosis with the characteristic [[psoas major muscle|psoas]] abscesses.&lt;ref&gt;Madkour 2004:6&lt;/ref&gt; Similar features were discovered on other mummies like that of the priest [[Philoc]] and throughout the cemeteries of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. It appears likely that [[Akhenaten]] and his wife [[Nefertiti]] both died from tuberculosis, and evidence indicates that hospitals for tuberculosis existed in Egypt as early as 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Madkour 2004:11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ebers papyrus]], an important Egyptian medical treatise from around 1550 BC, describes a pulmonary consumption associated with the cervical lymph nodes. It recommended that it be treated with the surgical lancing of the cyst and the application of a ground mixture of acacia seyal, peas, fruits, animal blood, insect blood, honey and salt.

The [[Old Testament]] mentions a consumptive illness that would affect the Jewish people if they stray from God. It is listed in the section of curses given before they enter the land of Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|28:22|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The East==

===Ancient India===
The first references to tuberculosis in non-European civilization is found in the [[Veda]]s. The oldest of them ([[Rigveda]], 1500 BC) calls the disease ''yaksma''.&lt;ref&gt;Zysk 1998:12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atharvaveda]] calls it ''balasa''. It is in the Atharvaveda that the first description of [[scrofula]] is given.&lt;ref&gt;Zysk 1998:32&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', written around 600 BC, recommends that the disease be treated with breast milk, various meats, alcohol and rest.&lt;ref name="ghose214"&gt;Ghose 2003:214&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yajurveda]] advises sufferers to move to higher altitudes.&lt;ref name="ghose214"/&gt;

===Ancient China===
The [[Classical Chinese]] word ''ao'' [[wikt:癆|癆]] "consumption; tuberculosis" was the common name in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and ''fèijiéhé'' [[wikt:肺結核|肺結核]] (lit. "lung knot kernel")  "pulmonary tuberculosis" is the modern medical term. ''Lao'' is compounded in names like ''xulao'' [[wikt:虛|虛]]癆 with "empty; void",  ''láobìng'' 癆[[wikt:病|病]] with "sickness", ''láozhài'' 癆[[wikt:瘵|瘵]] with "[archaic] sickness", and ''feilao'' [[wikt:肺|肺]]癆 with "lungs". Zhang and Unschuld explain that the medical term ''xulao'' 虛癆 "depletion exhaustion" includes infectious and consumptive pathologies, such as ''laozhai'' 癆瘵 "exhaustion with consumption" or ''laozhaichong'' 癆瘵蟲 "exhaustion consumption bugs/worms".&lt;ref&gt;2014: 586, 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt; They retrospectively identify ''feilao'' 肺癆 "lung exhaustion" and infectious ''feilao chuanshi'' 肺癆傳尸 "lung exhaustion by corpse [evil] transmission as "consumption/tuberculosis".&lt;ref&gt;2014: 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing foreign loanwords in early medical terminology, Zhang and Unschuld note the phonetic similarity between Chinese ''feixiao'' 肺消 (from [[Old Chinese]] ''**pʰot-ssew'') "lung consumption" and ancient Greek ''[[wikt:phthisis|phthisis]]'' "pulmonary tuberculosis".&lt;ref&gt;2014: 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The (c. 400 BCE – 260 CE) ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' classic Chinese medical text, traditionally attributed to the mythical [[Yellow Emperor]], describes a disease  believed to be tuberculosis, called ''xulao bing'' (虛癆病 "weak consumptive disease"), characterized by persistent cough, abnormal appearance, fever, a weak and fast pulse, chest obstructions, and shortness of breath.&lt;ref&gt;Elvin et al. 1998:521-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2015}}

The ''Huangdi Neijing'' describes an incurable disease called ''huaifu'' 壞府 "bad palace", which commentators interpret as tuberculous. "As for a string which is cut, its sound is hoarse. As for wood which has become old, its leaves are shed. As for a disease which is in the depth [of the body], the sound it [generates] is hiccup. When a man has these three [states], this is called 'destroyed palace'. Toxic drugs do not bring a cure; short needles cannot seize [the disease].&lt;ref&gt;25-158, tr. Unschuld and Tessenow 2001: 420–421.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Bing's commentary explains that ''fu'' 府 "palace" stands for ''xiong'' 胸 "chest", and ''huai'' "destroy" implies "injure the palace and seize the disease". The ''Huangdi Neijing'' compiler Yang Shangshan notes, "The [disease] proposed here very much resembles tuberculosis ... Hence [the text] states: poisonous drugs bring no cure; it cannot be seized with short needles."&lt;ref&gt;tr. 2001: 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

The (c. 200–250 CE) ''[[Shennong Bencaojing]]'' pharmacopeia, attributed to the legendary inventor of agriculture [[Shennong]] "Divine Farmer", also refers to tuberculosis&lt;ref&gt;Yang 1998:xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Zhouhou beiji fang'' 肘后备急方 "Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies", attributed to the Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]] (263–420), uses the name of ''shizhu'' 尸疰 "corpse disease; tuberculosis" and describes the symptoms and contagion: "This disease has many changing symptoms varying from thirty-six to ninety-nine different kinds. Generally it gives rise to a high fever, sweating, asthenia, unlocalised pains, making all positions difficult. Gradually, after months and years of suffering, this lingering disease brings about death to the sufferer. Afterwards it is transferred to others until the whole family is wiped out."&lt;ref&gt;1/17a-b, tr. Liu 1971: 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Song dynasty]] (920–1279) Daoist priest-doctors first recorded that tuberculosis, called ''shīzhài'' 尸瘵 (lit. "corpse disease") "disease which changes a living being into a corpse",&lt;ref&gt;tr. Liu 1971: 287.&lt;/ref&gt; was caused by a specific parasite or pathogen, centuries earlier than their contemporaries in other countries. The ''Duanchu shizhai pin'' 斷除尸瘵品 "On the Extermination of the Corpse Disease" is the 23rd chapter in Daoist collection ''Wushang xuanyuan santian Yutang dafa'' 無上玄元三天玉堂大法 "Great Rites of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Mysterious Origins" (''[[Daozang]]'' number 103). The text has a preface dated 1126, written by the Song dynasty [[Zhengyi Dao]] master Lu Shizhong 路時中, who founded the Yutang dafa 玉堂大法 tradition, but internal evidence reveals that the text could not have been written before 1158.&lt;ref&gt;Liu 1971: 287–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The disaster of the contagious disease, which changes a living being into a corpse, is caused by the infectious [nature] of the nine [kinds of] parasites (''ch'ung'' 蟲). It is also caused by overworking one's mind and exhausting one's energy, injuring one's ''ch'i'' and loosening one's sperm—all of which happen to common folk. When the original vitality is being [gradually] exhausted, the evil aura begins to be transmitted through the affected vital ''ch'i'' [of the sick body]. ... The aspects of the illness vary, and the causes of contamination are different. Rooms and food are capable of gradual contamination, and the clothes worn by the indisposed are twined easily with the infectious ''ch'i'' and these two become inseparable. ... The symptoms of the disease: When it begins, the sufferer coughs and pants; he spits blood [pulmonary hemorrhage]; he is emaciated and skinny; cold and fever affect him intermittently, and his dreams are morbid. This is the evidence that this person is suffering from the disease which is also known as ''wu-ch'uan'' 屋傳 [contagious disease contracted from a sick-room]. ... The disease may be contracted by a healthy person who happens to have slept in the same bed with the patient, or worn his clothes. After the death of the sufferer, the clothes, curtains, bed or couch, vessels and utensils used by him are known to have been contaminated by and saturated with the polluted ''ch'i'' in which the noxious ''ku'' 蠱 [parasites or germs] take their abode. Stingy people wish to keep them for further use, and the poorer families cannot afford to get rid of them and buy everything anew. Isn't this lamentable, since it creates the cause of the great misfortune yet to come!&lt;ref&gt;23/1a-b, tr. Liu 1971: 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This passage refers to the cause of TB in ancient medical terminology of ''jiuchong'' 九蟲 "Nine Worms" and ''[[Gu (poison)|gu]]'' 蠱 "supernatural agents causing disease", and ''[[qi]]''.  The Nine Worms generically meant "bodily parasites; intestinal worms" and were associated with the ''sanshi'' 三尸 "[[Three Corpses]]" or ''sanchong'' 三蟲 "Three Worms", which were believed to be biospiritual parasites that live in the human body and seek to hasten their host's death. 
Daoist medical texts give different lists and descriptions of the Nine Worms. The ''Boji fang'' 博濟方 "Prescriptions for Universal Dispensation", collected by Wang Gun王袞 (fl. 1041), calls the supposed TB pathogen ''laochong'' 癆蟲 "tuberculosis worms".&lt;ref&gt;Liu 1971: 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''Duanchu shizhai pin'' chapter (23/7b-8b) explains that the present Nine Worms does not refer to the intestinal ''weichong'' 胃蟲 "stomach worms", ''huichong'' 蛔蟲 "coiling worm; [[roundworm]]", or ''cun baichong'' 寸白蟲 "inch-long white worm; [[nematode]]", and says the supposed six TB worms are "six kinds" of parasites, but the next chapter (24/20a-21b) says they are "six stages/generations" of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Liu 1971: 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Daoist priests allegedly cured tuberculosis through drugs, acupuncture, and burning ''[[fulu]]'' "supernatural talismans/charms". Burning magic talismans would cause the TB patient to cough, which was considered an effective treatment.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;To cure the disease, it is necessary to produce a spout of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether he likes it or not. By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, it will be good if his spittle is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ''ch'i'', he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured. When the wicked element is rooted out, it does not need to be fumigated any more [with charms].&lt;ref&gt;tr. Liu 1971: 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, Daoist healers would burn talismans in order to fumigate the clothes and belongings of the deceased, and would warn the family of the tuberculosis victim's family to throw away everything into a ''changliu shui'' 長流水 "everflowing stream". According to Liu Ts'un-yan,&lt;ref&gt;1971: 289.&lt;/ref&gt; "This proves that the priests of the time actually wanted to destroy all the belongings of the deceased, using charms as a camouflage."

==Classical antiquity==
[[File:Hippocrates Light.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Hippocrates.]]
The first classical text to mention the disease is [[Herodotus]]' Histories in which he relates how a Persian general, Pharnouches, abandoned Xerxes' campaign against the Spartans due to consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]] | author = [[Herodotus]] | chapter = Chapter 88, Book VII |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.88.1 | isbn = 0315544996 | year = 1990 | publisher = National Library of Canada | location = Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippocrates]], in Book 1 of his ''Of the Epidemics,'' describes the characteristics of the disease: fever, colorless urine, cough resulting in a thick sputa, and loss of thirst and appetite. He notes that most of the sufferers became delirious before they succumbed to the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates, ''Of the Epidemics'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/epidemics.1.i.html 1.i.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates and many other at the time believed phthisis to be hereditary in nature.&lt;ref name="herz5"&gt;Herzog 1998:5&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle disagreed, believing the disease was contagious.

[[Pliny the Younger]] wrote a letter to Priscus in which he details the symptoms of phthisis as he saw them in Fannia:

{{quote|The attacks of fever stick to her, her cough grows upon her, she is in the highest degree emaciated and enfeebled.|Pliny the Younger|Letters VII, 19}}

[[Galen]] proposed a series of therapeutic treatments for the disease, including: [[opium]] as a sleeping agent and painkiller; [[blood letting]]; a diet of barley water, fish, and fruit. He also described the phyma (tumor) of the lungs, which is thought to correspond to the tubercles that form on the lung as a result of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;McClelland 1909:403–404&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vitruvius]] noted that "cold in the windpipe, cough, plurisy, phthisis, [and] spitting blood", were common diseases in regions where the wind blew from north to northwest, and advised that walls be so built as to shelter individuals from the winds.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, ''On Architecture'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#6.3 1.6.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aretaeus]] was the first person to rigorously describe the symptoms of the disease in his text ''De causis et signis diuturnorum morborum'':&lt;ref&gt;Aretaeus, ''De causis et signis diuturnorum morborum'' [http://www.chlt.org/sandbox/dh/aretaeusEnglish/page.63.a.php?size=240x320 On Phthisis]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Voice hoarse; neck slightly bent, tender, not flexible, somewhat extended; fingers slender, but joints thick; of the bones alone the figure remains, for the fleshy parts are wasted; the nails of the fingers crooked, their pulps are shrivelled and flat...Nose sharp, slender; cheeks prominent and red; eyes hollow, brilliant and glittering; swollen, pale or livid in countenance; the slender parts of the jaws rest on the teeth as, as if smiling; otherwise of cadaverous aspect...|''De causis et signis diuturnorum morborum''|Aretaeus, translated by Francis Adams}}

In his other book ''De curatione diuturnorum morborum'', he recommends that sufferers travel to high altitudes, travel by sea, eat a good diet and drink plenty of milk.&lt;ref name="Stive128"&gt;Stivelman 1931:128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Columbian America==
In South America, reports of a study in August 2014 revealed that TB had likely been spread via seals that contracted it on beaches of Africa, from humans via domesticated animals, and carried it across the Atlantic. A team at the [[University of Tubingen]] analyzed tuberculosis DNA in 1,000-year-old skeletons of the Chiribaya culture in southern Peru; so much genetic material was recovered that they could reconstruct the genome. They learned that this TB strain was related most closely to a form found only in seals.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/science/tuberculosis-is-newer-than-what-was-thought-study-says.html?_r=0 Carl Zimmer, "Tuberculosis Is Newer Than Thought, Study Says"], ''New York Times,'' 21 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In South America, it was likely contracted first by hunters who handled contaminated meat. This TB is a different strain from that prevalent today in the Americas, which is more closely related to a later Eurasian strain.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BosNature2014&gt;{{cite journal|

Prior to this study, the first evidence of the disease in South America was found in remains of the [[Arawak]] culture around 1050 BC.&lt;ref name="prat153"&gt;Prat 2003:153&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant finding belongs to the mummy of an 8 to 10-year-old Nascan child from Hacienda Agua Sala, dated to 700 AD. Scientists were able to isolate evidence of the bacillus.&lt;ref name="prat153"/&gt;

==Europe: Middle Ages and Renaissance==
During the Middle Ages, no significant advances were made regarding tuberculosis. [[Avicenna]] and [[Rhazes]] continued to consider to believe the disease was both contagious and difficult to treat. [[Arnaldus de Villa Nova]] described etiopathogenic theory directly related to that of Hippocrates, in which a cold humor dripped from the head into the lungs.

In [[Medieval]] [[Hungary]], the Inquisition recorded the trials of pagans. A document from the 12th century recorded an explanation of the cause of illness. The pagans said that tuberculosis was produced when a dog-shaped demon occupied the person's body and started to eat his lungs. When the possessed person coughed, then the demon was barking, and getting close to his objective, which was to kill the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Radloff: "Bussgebete" stb. 874. 1 jegyzet.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal touch===
[[File:Henri IV touche les escrouelles.jpg|thumb|Henry IV of France touching numerous sickly individuals during the ceremony of the "royal touch". The original caption reads: ''Des mirabili strumas sanandi vi solis Galliae regibus christianissimis divinitus concessa liber unus''.]]
{{main|Royal touch}}
With the spread of Christianity, monarchs were seen as religious figures with magical or curative powers. It was believed that [[royal touch]], the touch of the [[sovereign]] of England or France, could cure diseases due to the [[divine right of kings|divine right of sovereigns]].&lt;ref name="Mau87"&gt;Maulitz and Maulitz 1973:87&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry IV of France]] usually performed the rite once a week, after taking communion.&lt;ref name="Dang231"&gt;Dang 2001:231&lt;/ref&gt; So common was this practice of royal healing in France, that [[scrofula]] became known as the "''mal du roi''" or the "King's Evil".

Initially, the touching ceremony was an informal process. Sickly individuals could petition the court for a royal touch and the touch would be performed at the King's earliest convenience. At times, the [[King of France]] would touch afflicted subjects during his royal walkabout. The rapid spread of tuberculosis across France and England, however, necessitated a more formal and efficient touching process. By the time of [[Louis XIV of France]], placards indicating the days and times the King would be available for royal touches were posted regularly; sums of money were doled out as charitable support.&lt;ref name="Dang231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auf129"&gt;Aufderheide 1998:129&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the process was extremely formal and efficient. As late as 1633, the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Anglican Church]] contained a Royal Touch ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchinson | first = John |author2=Molly Oldfield | title = QI: Quite Interesting facts about Kings | work = Telegraph.co.uk | date = 9 January 2009 | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/4176490/QI-Quite-interesting-facts-about-Kings.html | accessdate = 23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[monarch]] (king or queen), sitting upon a canopied throne, touched the afflicted individual, and presented that individual with a [[coin]] – usually an [[Angel (coin)|Angel]], a gold coin the value of which varied from about 6 [[shillings]] to about 10 shillings – by pressing it against the afflicted's neck.&lt;ref name="Dang231"/&gt;

Although the ceremony was of no medical value, members of the royal courts often propagandized that those receiving the royal touch were miraculously healed. [[André du Laurens]], the senior physician of Henry IV, publicized findings that at least half of those that received the royal touch were cured within a few days.&lt;ref&gt;Gosman 2004:140&lt;/ref&gt; The royal touch remained popular into the 18th century. Parish registers from [[Oxfordshire]], England include not only records of baptisms, marriages, and deaths, but also records of those eligible for the royal touch.&lt;ref name="Mau87"/&gt;

===Contagion===
[[Girolamo Fracastoro]] became the first person to propose, in his work ''De contagione'', that phthisis was transmitted by an invisible ''virus''. Among his assertions were that the ''virus'' could survive between ''two or three years'' on the clothes of those suffering from the disease and that it was usually transmitted through direct contact or the discharged fluids of the infected, what he called ''fomes''. He noted that phthisis could be contracted without either direct contact or fomes, but was unsure of the process by which the disease propagated across distances.&lt;ref&gt;Brock ''Milestones'' 1999:72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paracelsus's tartaric process===
[[Paracelsus]] advanced the belief that tuberculosis was caused by a failure of an internal organ to accomplish its alchemical duties. When this occurred in the lungs, stony precipitates would develop causing tuberculosis in what he called the ''tartaric'' process.&lt;ref&gt;Debus 2001:13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries==
[[Franciscus Sylvius]] began differentiating between the various forms of tuberculosis (pulmonary, ganglion). He was the first person to recognize that the skin ulcers caused by scrofula resembled tubercles seen in phthisis,&lt;ref name="anc549"&gt;Ancell 1852:549&lt;/ref&gt; noting that "phthisis is the scrofula of the lung" in his book ''Opera Medica'', published posthumously in 1679. Around the same time, [[Thomas Willis]] concluded that all diseases of the chest must ultimately lead to consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Waksman 1964:34&lt;/ref&gt; Willis did not know the exact cause of the disease but he blamed it on sugar&lt;ref&gt;Macinnis 2002:165&lt;/ref&gt; or an acidity of the blood.&lt;ref name="anc549"/&gt; [[Richard Morton (physician)|Richard Morton]] published ''Phthisiologia, seu exercitationes de Phthisi tribus libris comprehensae'' in 1689, in which he emphasized the tubercle as the true cause of the disease. So common was the disease at the time that Morton is quoted as saying "I cannot sufficiently admire that anyone, at least after he comes to the flower of his youth, can [sic] dye without a touch of consumption."&lt;ref&gt;Otis 1920:28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1720, [[Benjamin Marten]] proposed in ''A New Theory of Consumptions more Especially of Phthisis or Consumption of the Lungs'' that the cause of tuberculosis was some type of ''animalcula''—microscopic living beings that are able to survive in a new body (similar to the ones described by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1695).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 2000:8&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was roundly rejected and it took another 162 years before Robert Koch demonstrated it to be true.

In 1768, [[Robert Whytt]] gave the first clinical description of tuberculosis meningitis&lt;ref&gt;Whytt 1768:46&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1779, [[Percivall Pott]], an English surgeon, described the vertebral lesions that carry his name.&lt;ref name="Auf129"/&gt; In 1761, [[Leopold Auenbrugger]], an Austrian physician, developed the percussion method of diagnosing tuberculosis,&lt;ref name="Dan45"&gt;Daniel 2000:45&lt;/ref&gt; a method rediscovered some years later in 1797 by [[Jean-Nicolas Corvisart]] of France. After finding it useful, Corvisart made it readily available to the academic community by translating it into French.&lt;ref&gt;Dubos 1987:79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Stark (physician)|William Stark]] proposed that ordinary lung tubercles could eventually evolve into ulcers and cavities, believing that the different forms of tuberculosis were simply different manifestations of the same disease. Unfortunately, Stark died at the age of thirty (while studying [[scurvy]]) and his observations were discounted.&lt;ref&gt;Dubos 1987:83&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Systematik de speziellen Pathologie und Therapie'', [[Johann Lukas Schönlein|J. L. Schönlein]], Professor of Medicine in Zurich, proposed that the word "tuberculosis" be used to describe the affliction of tubercles.&lt;ref&gt;Dubos 1987:84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog 1998:7&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of tuberculosis grew progressively during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, displacing [[leprosy]], peaking between the 18th and 19th century as field workers moved to the cities looking for work.&lt;ref name="Auf129"/&gt; When he released his study in 1808, [[William Woolcombe]] was astonished at the prevalence of tuberculosis in 18th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;Chalke 1959:92&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1,571 deaths in the English city of [[Bristol]] between 1790 and 1796, 683 were due to tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Chalke 1959:92-3&lt;/ref&gt; Remote towns, initially isolated from the disease, slowly succumbed. The consumption deaths in the village of Holycross in [[Shropshire]] between 1750 and 1759 were one in six (1:6); ten years later, 1:3. In the metropolis of London, 1:7 died from consumption at the dawn of the 18th century, by 1750 that proportion grew to 1:5.25 and surged to 1:4.2 by around the start of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chalke 1959:93&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] coupled with poverty and squalor created the optimal environment for the propagation of the disease.

[[File:Anton Pavlovich Chekhov.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The [[Russians|Russian]] writer [[Anton Chekhov]], who died of tuberculosis  in 1904]]

It was during this century that tuberculosis was dubbed the White Plague,&lt;ref name="Madkour 2004:20"&gt;Madkour 2004:20&lt;/ref&gt; ''mal de vivre'', and ''mal du siècle''. It was seen as a "romantic disease". Suffering from tuberculosis was thought to bestow upon the sufferer heightened sensitivity. The slow progress of the disease allowed for a "good death" as sufferers could arrange their affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdelais 2006:15&lt;/ref&gt; The disease began to represent spiritual purity and temporal wealth, leading many young, upper-class women to purposefully pale their skin to achieve the consumptive appearance. British poet [[Lord Byron]] wrote, "I should like to die from consumption", helping to popularize the disease as the disease of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Yancey 2007:18&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Sand]] doted on her phthisic lover, [[Frédéric Chopin]], calling him her "poor melancholy angel".&lt;ref name="Dan1864"&gt;Daniel 2006:1864&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, at least five novels were published expressing the ideals of tuberculosis: Dumas's ''[[La Dame aux camélias]]'', Murger's ''[[Scènes de la vie de Bohème]]'', Hugo's ''[[Les Misérables]]'', the [[Goncourt brothers]]' ''Madame Gervaisais'' and ''Germinie Lacerteux'', and Rostand's ''[[L'Aiglon]]''. The portrayals by Dumas and Murger in turn inspired operatic depictions of consumption in Verdi's ''[[La traviata]]'' and Puccini's ''[[La bohème]]''.  Even after medical knowledge of the disease had accumulated, the redemptive-spiritual perspective of the disease has remained popular&lt;ref&gt;Barnes 1995:51&lt;/ref&gt; (as seen in the 2001 film [[Moulin Rouge!|''Moulin Rouge'']] based in part on ''La traviata'' and the [[Les Misérables (musical)|musical adaptations]] of ''Les Misérables'').

In large cities the poor had high rates of tuberculosis.  Public-health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease.  People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;Diego Armus, ''The Ailing City: Health, Tuberculosis, and Culture in Buenos Aires, 1870–1950'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific advances===
Though removed from the cultural movement, the scientific understanding advanced considerably. By the end of the 19th century, several major breakthroughs gave hope that a cause and cure might be found.

One of the most important physicians dedicated to the study of phthisiology was [[René Laennec]], who died from the disease at the age of 45, after contracting tuberculosis while studying contagious patients and infected bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 2000:60&lt;/ref&gt; Laennec invented the [[stethoscope]]&lt;ref name="Dan45"/&gt; which he used to corroborate his auscultatory findings and prove the correspondence between the pulmonary lesions found on the lungs of autopsied tuberculosis patients and the respiratory symptoms seen in living patients. His most important work was ''Traité de l’Auscultación Mediate'' which detailed his discoveries on the utility of pulmonary auscultation in diagnosing tuberculosis. This book was promptly translated into English by [[John Forbes (physician)|John Forbes]] in 1821; it represents the beginning of the modern scientific understanding of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="Dan1864"/&gt; Laennec was named professional chair of [[Hôpital Necker]] in September 1816 and today he is considered the greatest French clinician.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 2000:44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ackerknecht 1982:151&lt;/ref&gt;

Laennec's work put him in contact with the vanguard of the French medical establishment, including [[Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis]]. Louis would go on to use statistical methods to evaluate the different aspects of the disease's progression, the efficacy of various therapies and individuals' susceptibility, publishing an article in the ''Annales d'hygiène publique'' entitled "Note on the Relative Frequency of Phthisis in the Two Sexes".&lt;ref&gt;Barnes 1995:39&lt;/ref&gt; Another good friend and co-worker of Laennec, [[Gaspard Laurent Bayle]], published an article in 1810 entitled ''Recherches sur la Pthisie Pulmonaire'', in which he divided pthisis into six types: tubercular phthisis, glandular phthisis, ulcerous phthisis, phthisis with melanosis, calculous phthisis, and cancerous phthisis. He based his findings on more than 900 autopsies.&lt;ref name="Madkour 2004:20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter 2006:154&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] demonstrated that the disease was indeed contagious, conducting an experiment in which tuberculous matter from human cadavers was injected into laboratory rabbits, which then became infected.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes 1995:41&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 1882, Robert Koch revealed the disease was caused by an infectious agent.&lt;ref name="Dan1864"/&gt; In 1895, [[Wilhelm Roentgen]] discovered the X-ray, which allowed physicians to diagnose and track the progression of the disease,&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1991:88&lt;/ref&gt; and although an effective medical treatment would not come for another fifty years, the incidence and mortality of tuberculosis began to decline.&lt;ref&gt;Aufderheide 1998:130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Koch===
[[File:RobertKoch cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Robert Koch]], a [[Prussian]] physician, discovered the cause of tuberculosis.]]
Villemin's experiments had confirmed the contagious nature of the disease and had forced the medical community to accept that tuberculosis was indeed an infectious disease, transmitted by some etiological agent of unknown origin. In 1882, Prussian physician [[Robert Koch]] utilized a new staining method and applied it to the sputum of tuberculosis patients, revealing for the first time the causal agent of the disease: ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', or Koch's bacillus.&lt;ref&gt;Brock ''Robert Koch'' 1999:120&lt;/ref&gt;

When he began his investigation, Koch knew of the work of Villemin and others who had continued his experiments like Julius Conheim and Carl Salmosen. He also had access to the "pthisis ward" at the Berlin Charité Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Brock ''Robert Koch'' 1999:118&lt;/ref&gt; Before he confronted the problem of tuberculosis, he worked with the disease caused by anthrax and had discovered the causal agent to be ''Bacillus anthracis''. During this investigation he became friends with Ferdinand Cohn, the director of the Institute of Vegetable Physiology. Together they worked to develop methods of culturing tissue samples. 18 August 1881, while staining tuberculous material with [[methylene blue]], he noticed oblong structures, though he was not able to ascertain whether it was just a result of the coloring. To improve the contrast, he decide to add [[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck Brown]], after which the oblong structures were rendered bright and transparent. He improved the technique by varying the concentration of alkali in the staining solution until the ideal viewing conditions for the bacilli was achieved.

After numerous attempts he was able to incubate the bacteria in [[coagulated blood serum]] at 37 degrees Celsius. He then inoculated laboratory rabbits with the bacteria and observed that they died while exhibiting symptoms of tuberculosis, proving that the bacillus, which he named ''tuberculosis bacillus'', was in fact the cause of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="Ati"&gt;Koch 1882&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his result public at the [[Physiological Society of Berlin]] on 24 March 1882, in a famous lecture entitled ''Über Tuberculose'', which was published three weeks later. Since 1882, 24 March has been known as [[World Tuberculosis Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Yancey 2007:1982&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1882, Koch presented an article entitled ''Die Ätiologie der Tuberculose'' in which he demonstrated that ''Mycobacterium'' was the single cause of tuberculosis in all of its forms.&lt;ref name="Ati"/&gt;

In 1890 Koch developed tuberculin, a purified protein derivative of the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Magner 2002:273&lt;/ref&gt; It proved to be an ineffective means of immunization but in 1908, [[Charles Mantoux]] found it was an effective intradermic test for diagnosing tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Madkour 2004:49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If the importance of a disease for mankind is measured from the number of fatalities which are due to it, then tuberculosis must be considered much more important than those most feared infectious diseases, plague, cholera, and the like. Statistics have shown that 1/7 of all humans die of tuberculosis.|''Die Ätiologie der Tuberculose''|Robert Koch (1882)}}

===Sanatorium movement===
The advancement of scientific understanding of tuberculosis, and its contagious nature created the need for institutions to house sufferers.

The first proposal for a tuberculosis facility was made in paper by [[George Bodington]] entitled ''An essay on the treatment and cure of pulmonary consumption, on principles natural, rational and successful'' in 1840. In this paper, he proposed a dietary, rest, and medical care program for a hospital he planned to found in [[Maney]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodington 1840&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks from numerous medical experts, especially articles in ''The Lancet'', disheartened Bodington and he turned to plans for housing the insane.&lt;ref&gt;Dubos 1987:177&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time in the United States, in late October and early November 1842, Dr. [[John Croghan]], the owner of [[Mammoth Cave]], brought 15 tuberculosis sufferers into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/26/mammoth.cave.ap/index.html Kentucky: Mammoth Cave long on history.] ''[[CNN]]''. 27 February 2004. Accessed 8 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Patients were lodged in stone huts, and each was supplied with a slave to bring meals.&lt;ref&gt;Billings, Hillman, and Regen 1957:12&lt;/ref&gt; One patient, A. H. P. Anderson, wrote glowing reviews of the cave experience:&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Billings, Hillman, and Regen 1957:13&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[S]ome of the invalids eat at their pavillions while others in better health attend regularly the table d'hote which is very good indeed, having a considerable variety and being almost daily (I've noted but 2–3 omissions) graced with a saddle of venison or other game.|A. H. P. Anderson}}

By late January, early February 1843, two patients were dead and the rest had left. Departing patients died anywhere from three days to three weeks after resurfacing; John Croghan died of tuberculosis at his [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] residence in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Billings, Hillman, and Regen 1957:14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann Brehmer]], a German physician, was convinced that tuberculosis arose from the difficulty of the heart to correctly irrigate the lungs. He therefore proposed that regions well above sea level, where the atmospheric pressure was less, would help the heart function more effectively. With the encouragement of explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and his teacher [[Johann Lukas Schönlein|J. L. Schönlein]], the first anti-tuberculosis sanatorium was established in 1854, 650 meters above sea level, at Görbersdorf.&lt;ref&gt;Dubos 1987:175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later he published his findings in a paper ''Die chronische Lungenschwindsucht und Tuberkulose der Lunge: Ihre Ursache und ihre Heilung''.

Brehmer and one of his patients, [[Peter Dettweiler]], became proponents for the sanatorium movement, and by 1877, sanatoriums began to spread beyond Germany and throughout Europe. Dr. [[Edward Livingston Trudeau]] subsequently founded the [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitorium]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York]] in 1884. One of Trudeau's early patients was author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]; his fame helped establish Saranac Lake as a center for the treatment of tuberculosis. In 1894, after a fire destroyed Trudeau's small home laboratory, he organized the Saranac Laboratory for the Study of Tuberculosis; renamed the [[Trudeau Institute]], the laboratory continues to study infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Alfred L., ''A History of the Adirondacks'', Century Co., New York 1921 (reprinted by Purple Mountain Press, Fleischmanns, NY, 1992), pp. 243–265&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Dettweiler went on to found his own sanatorium at [[Falkenstein, Königstein im Taunus|Falkenstein]] in 1877 and in 1886 published findings claiming that 132 of his 1022 patients had been completely cured after staying at his institution.&lt;ref&gt;Graham 1893:266&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, sanatoriums began to appear near large cities and at low altitudes, like the [[Sharon Sanatorium]] in 1890 near Boston.&lt;ref name="Shr47"&gt;Shryock 1977:47&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanatoriums were not the only treatment facilities. Specialized tuberculosis clinics began to develop in major metropolitan areas. Sir Robert Philip established the [[Royal Victoria Dispensary for Consumption]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1887. [[dispensary|Dispensaries]] acted as special sanatoriums for early tuberculosis cases and were opened to lower income individuals. The use of dispensaries to treat middle and lower-class individuals in major metropolitan areas and the coordination between various levels of health services programs like hospitals, sanatoriums, and tuberculosis colonies became known as the "Edinburgh Anti-tuberculosis Scheme".&lt;ref&gt;"The Edinburgh Scheme" 1914:117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==

===Containment===
[[File:Map of the City of Washington Showing Location of Fatal Cases of Consumption.jpg|thumb|A map of deaths from tuberculosis in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1900–1901.]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, tuberculosis was one of the UK's most urgent health problems. A royal commission was set up in 1901, The Royal Commission Appointed to Inquire into the Relations of Human and Animal Tuberculosis. Its remit was to find out whether tuberculosis in animals and humans was the same disease, and whether animals and humans could infect each other. By 1919, the Commission had evolved into the UK's Medical Research Council.

In 1902, the [[International Conference on Tuberculosis]] convened in Berlin. Among various other acts, the conference proposed the [[Cross of Lorraine]] be the international symbol of the fight against tuberculosis. National campaigns spread across Europe and the United States to tamp down on the continued prevalence of tuberculosis.

After the establishment in the 1880s that the disease was contagious, TB was made a [[notifiable disease]] in Britain; there were campaigns to stop spitting in public places, and the infected poor were pressured to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons; the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention.&lt;ref name =sanatoria&gt;McCarthy 2001:413-7&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the purported benefits of the fresh air and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered were dead within five years (1916).&lt;ref name=sanatoria/&gt;

The promotion of [[Christmas Seals]] began in Denmark during 1904 as a way to raise money for tuberculosis programs. It expanded to the United States and Canada in 1907–1908 to help the [[National Tuberculosis Association]] (later called the [[American Lung Association]]).

In the United States, concern about the spread of tuberculosis played a role in the movement to prohibit public spitting except into [[spittoon]]s.

===Vaccines===
The first genuine success in immunizing against tuberculosis was developed from attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis by [[Albert Calmette]] and [[Camille Guérin]] in 1906. It was called "BCG" (''[[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|Bacille Calmette-Guérin]]''). The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France,&lt;ref&gt;Bonah 2005:696–721&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until after World War II that BCG received widespread acceptance in Great Britain, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Comstock 1994:528-40&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of the British [[National Health Service]] X-ray examination for TB increased dramatically but rates of vaccination were initially very low. In 1953 it was agreed that secondary school pupils should be vaccinated, but by the end of 1954 only 250,000 people had been vaccinated. By 1956 this had risen to 600,000, about half being school children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The Health Services Since the War|date=1988|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0116309423|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatments===
[[File:Tuberculosis in the USA 1861-2014.png|alt= Tuberculosis mortality in the USA from 1861 to 2014.|thumb|Tuberculosis mortality in the USA from 1861 to 2014.]]

As the century progressed, some surgical interventions, including the [[pneumothorax]] or [[plombage]] technique—collapsing an infected lung to "rest" it and allow the lesions to heal—were used to treat tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfart 1990:506–11&lt;/ref&gt; Pneumothorax was not a new technique by any means. In 1696, [[Giorgio Baglivi]] reported a general improvement in tuberculosis sufferers after they received sword wounds to the chest. [[F.H. Ramadge]] induced the first successful therapeutic pneumothorax in 1834, and reported subsequently the patient was cured. It was in the 20th century, however, that scientists sought to rigorously investigate the effectiveness of such procedures. In 1939, the ''[[British Journal of Tuberculosis]]'' published a study by [[Oli Hjaltested]] and [[Kjeld Törning]] on 191 patients undergoing the procedure between 1925 and 1931; in 1951, Roger Mitchell published several articles on the therapeutic outcomes of 557 patients treated between 1930 and 1939 at [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium|Trudeau Sanatorium]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 2006:1866&lt;/ref&gt; The search for a medicinal cure, however, continued in earnest.

During the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenführer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis – little knowing or caring that a cure was nearly at hand.

In 1944 [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]], [[Elizabeth Bugie]], and [[Selman Waksman]] isolated [[streptomycin]] produced by a bacterial strain ''[[Streptomyces griseus]].'' Streptomycin was the first effective antibiotic against ''M. tuberculosis''.&lt;ref name="Daniel1868"&gt;Daniel 2006:1868&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery is generally considered the beginning of the modern era of tuberculosis, although the true revolution began some years later, in 1952, with the development of [[isoniazid]], the first oral mycobactericidal drug.&lt;ref name="Daniel1868"/&gt; The advent of [[rifampin]] in the 1970s hastened recovery times, and significantly reduced the number of tuberculosis cases until the 1980s.

The British epidemiologist [[Thomas McKeown (physician)|Thomas McKeown]] had shown that ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'treatment by streptomycin reduced the number of deaths since it was introduced (1948–71) by 51 per cent...'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/publications/role-medicine-dream-mirage-or-nemesis|title=The Role of Medicine: Dream, Mirage or Nemesis?

McKeown explained the decline in mortality from infectious diseases by an improved standard of living, particularly by better nutrition, and by better hygiene, and less by medical intervention.  McKeown, who is considered as the father of social medicine,&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Escape.

===Tuberculosis resurgence===
Hopes that the disease could be completely eliminated were dashed in the 1980s with the rise of [[Antibiotic resistance|drug-resistant]] strains. Tuberculosis cases in Britain, numbering around 117,000 in 1913, had fallen to around 5,000 in 1987, but cases rose again, reaching 6,300 in 2000 and 7,600 cases in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_AZ/tb/epidemiology/table1.htm | title = Tuberculosis&amp;nbsp;— Respiratory and Non-respiratory Notifications, England and Wales, 1913–2005 | publisher = Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections | date = 21 March 2007 | accessdate = 1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the elimination of public health facilities in New York and the emergence of HIV, there was a resurgence of TB in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo and Nosanchuk 2004:287–93&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of patients failing to complete their course of drugs was high. New York had to cope with more than 20,000 TB patients with [[Multidrug resistance|multidrug-resistant]] strains (resistant to, at least, both rifampin and isoniazid).

In response to the resurgence of tuberculosis, the World Health Organization issued a declaration of a global health emergency in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization]] (WHO). [http://www.who.int/tb/hiv/faq/en/index.html Frequently asked questions about TB and HIV.] Retrieved 6 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Every year, nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB].

The first outbreaks of disease that were probably yellow fever occurred in the Windward Islands of the Caribbean on Barbados in 1647 and Guadalupe in 1648.&lt;ref name=mcneill&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNeill|first=J. R.|title=Yellow Jack and Geopolitics: Environment, Epidemics, and the Struggles for Empire in the American Tropics, 1650–1825|journal=OAH Magazine of History|date=1 April 2004|volume=18|issue=3|pages=9–13|doi=10.1093/maghis/18.3.9|url=http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/9.extract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbados had undergone an ecological transformation with the introduction of sugar cultivation by the Dutch. Plentiful forests present in the 1640s were completely gone by the 1660s. By the early 18th century, the same transformation related to sugar cultivation had occurred on the larger islands of Jamaica, Hispaniola and Cuba. Spanish colonists recorded an outbreak in 1648 on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]] that may have been yellow fever. The illness was called ''xekik'' (black vomit) by the [[Maya peoples|Maya]].

At least 25 major outbreaks followed in North America, such as in [[Philadelphia]] 1793, where several thousand people died, more than nine percent of the total population. The American government, including [[George Washington]], had to flee the city, which was the capital of the United States at the time. In 1878, about 20,000 people died in an epidemic in towns of the Mississippi River Valley and its tributaries. The last major outbreak in the US occurred in 1905 in [[New Orleans]]. Major outbreaks also occurred in Europe in the nineteenth century in Atlantic ports following the arrival of sailing vessels from the Caribbean, most often from Havana.&lt;ref name="pmid16913829"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrett AD, Higgs S |title=Yellow fever: a disease that has yet to be conquered |journal=Annu.

The first mention of the disease by the name "yellow fever" occurred in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest mention of "yellow fever" appears in a manuscript of 1744 by [[John Mitchell (geographer)|Dr. John Mitchell]] of Virginia; copies of the manuscript were sent to Mr. [[Cadwallader Colden]], a physician in New York, and to Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]] of Philadelphia; the manuscript was eventually printed (in large part) in 1805 and reprinted in 1814.  See:
*  (John Mitchell) (1805) [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJ21Uy4-lb0C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (Mitchell's account of the Yellow Fever in Virginia in 1741–2)], ''The Philadelphia Medical Museum,'' 1 (1) :  1–20.
*  (John Mitchell) (1814) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_EZJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Account of the Yellow fever which prevailed in Virginia in the years 1737, 1741, and 1742, in a letter to the late Cadwallader Colden, Esq. of New York, from the late John Mitchell, M.D.F.R.S. of Virginia,"] ''American Medical and Philosophical Register'' … , '''4''' : 181–215.  The term "yellow fever" appears on p. 186.  On p. 188, Mitchell mentions "… the distemper was what is generally called the yellow fever in America."  However, on pages 191–192, he states "… I shall consider the cause of the yellowness which is so remarkable in this distemper, as to have given it the name of the Yellow Fever."
It should be noted, however, that Dr. Mitchell misdiagnosed the disease that he observed and treated, and that the disease was probably Weil's disease or hepatitis.

==Philadelphia: 1793==
{{main|Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793}}
The Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 struck during the summer in [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, where the highest fatalities in the United States were recorded. The disease probably was brought by refugees and mosquitoes on ships from [[Saint-Domingue]]. It rapidly spread in the port city, in the crowded blocks along the Delaware River. About 5000 people died, ten percent of the population of 50,000. The city was then the national capital, and the national government left the city, including President [[George Washington]]. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York suffered repeated epidemics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as did other cities along the East and Gulf coasts.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard C. Campbell, ed. ''American Disasters: 201 Calamities That Shook the Nation'' (2008) pp 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haiti: 1790–1802==
The majority of the British soldiers sent to Haiti in the 1790s died of disease, chiefly yellow fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geggus | first1 = David | year = 1982 | title = The British Army and the Slave Revolt | url = | journal = History Today | volume = 32 | issue = 7| pages = 35–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John S. Marr, and John T. Cathey. "The 1802 Saint-Domingue yellow fever epidemic and the Louisiana Purchase." ''Journal of Public Health Management and Practice'' 19#.1 (2013): 77-82.

Girard|title=The Slaves Who Defeated Napoleon: Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian War of Independence, 1801-1804|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03XSP22p3kgC&amp;pg=PA179|year=2011|publisher=University of Alabama Press|pages=179–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802–1803, an army of forty thousand sent by First Consul [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] of France to [[Saint Domingue]] to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution]] mounted by slaves, was decimated by an epidemic of yellow fever (among the casualties was the expedition's commander and Bonaparte's brother-in-law, [[Charles Leclerc]]). Some historians believe Napoleon intended to use the island as a staging point for an invasion of the United States through [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana]] (then newly regained by the French from the Spanish.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Almost History: Close Calls, Plan B's, and Twists of Fate in American History |last=Bruns |first=Roger |year=2000 |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=0-7868-8579-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marr | first1 = J.

Only one-third of the French troops survived to return to France, and in 1804 the new republic of [[Haiti]] declared its independence.

==Savannah, Georgia: 1820==
Nearly 700 people in [[Savannah, Georgia]] died from yellow fever in 1820, including two local physicians who lost their lives caring for the stricken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waring|first1=William R.|title=Report to the City Council of Savannah on the epidemic disease of 1820|date=1821|publisher=Henry P.

==New Orleans, Louisiana: 1853==
The 1853 outbreak claimed 7,849 residents of New Orleans.  The press and the medical profession did not alert citizens of the outbreak until the middle of July, after more than one thousand people had already died.  The New Orleans business community feared that word of an epidemic would cause a [[quarantine]] to be placed on the city, and their trade would suffer. In such epidemics, steamboats frequently carried passengers and the disease upriver from New Orleans to other cities along the Mississippi River.

The epidemic was dramatized and featured in the plot of the 1938 film ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'', starring [[Bette Davis]].

Yellow fever was a threat in New Orleans and south Louisiana virtually every year, during the warmest months. Among the more prominent victims were: [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial]] Governor [[Manuel Gayoso de Lemos]] (1799); the first and second wives (d. 1804, 1809) of [[Territory of Orleans|territorial]] Governor [[William C. C. Claiborne]] and his young daughter (1804); one of New Orleans' most important early city planners [[Barthelemy Lafon]] (1820), architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] and one of his sons (1820, 1817, respectively), who were in New Orleans building the city's first waterworks; [[Jesse Burton Harrison]] (1841), a young lawyer and author;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyBnpnlNCigC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=jesse+burton+harrison&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hcv_9VxOo8&amp;sig=QMC9Oix-enCG7K6zcfVEuGeCWE0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_TXDU_rUDpCsyATp5oC4Dg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=jesse%20burton%20harrison&amp;f=false| title=All Clever Men, Who Make Their Way: Critical Discourse in the Old South }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Brig. Gen. [[Young Marshall Moody]] (1866); architect [[James Gallier, Jr.]] (1868); and Confederate Lt. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]] and his wife and daughter (1879).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=vcsr&amp;GSvcid=519434 |title=Died in New Orleans or La. of yellow fever |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norfolk, Virginia: 1855==
A ship carrying persons infected with the virus arrived in [[Hampton Roads]] in southeastern [[Virginia]] in June 1855.&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/fever-browse?id=N2659002 |title=Mosquito control ends fatal plague of yellow fever |accessdate=2007-06-11 |author=Mauer HB |publisher=etext.lib.virginia.edu }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (undated newspaper clipping).&lt;/ref&gt; The disease spread quickly through the community, eventually killing over 3,000 people, mostly residents of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. The [[Howard Association]], a benevolent organization, was formed to help coordinate assistance in the form of funds, supplies, and medical professionals and volunteers, who poured in from many other areas, particularly the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] areas of the United States.

==Texas and Louisiana: 1867==
The 1867 yellow fever epidemic claimed many casualties in the southern counties of [[Texas]], as well as in New Orleans. The deaths in Texas included [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Maj. Gen. [[Charles Griffin]], [[Margaret Lea Houston]] (Mrs. Sam Houston), and at least two young physicians and their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=vcsr&amp;GSvcid=511403 |title=Died in Texas yellow fever epidemics |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878==
The entire Mississippi River Valley from [[St. Louis]] south was affected, and tens of thousands fled the stricken cities of New Orleans, [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. An estimated 120,000 cases of yellow fever resulted in some 20,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled J. Bloom, ''The Mississippi Valley's Great Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878,'' Louisiana State U. Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] suffered several epidemics during the 1870s, culminating in the 1878 epidemic (called the Saffron Scourge of 1878), with more than 5,000 fatalities in the city. Some contemporary accounts said that commercial interests had prevented the rapid reporting of the outbreak of the epidemic, increasing the total number of deaths. People still did not understand how the disease developed or was transmitted, and did not know how to prevent it.&lt;ref name="crosby"&gt;M.C. Crosby, ''The American Plague: The Untold Story of Yellow Fever, the Epidemic That Shaped Our History'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1878 epidemic was the worst that occurred in the state of Mississippi. Sometimes known as 'Yellow Jack,' and 'Bronze John,' devastated Mississippi socially and economically. Entire families were killed, while others fled their homes for the presumed safety of other parts of the state. Quarantine regulations, passed to prevent the spread of the disease, brought trade to a stop. Some local economies never recovered. Beechland, near Vicksburg, became a ghost town because of the epidemic. By the end of the year, 3,227 people had died from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stephens Nuwer | first1 = Deanne | year = 1999 | title = The 1878 Yellow Fever Epidemic along the Mississippi Gulf Coast | url = | journal = Gulf South Historical Review | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 51–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The French Panama Canal Effort: 1882–1889==
The French effort to build a [[Panama Canal]] was damaged by the prevalence of endemic tropical diseases in the Isthmus.  Although [[malaria]] was also a serious problem for the French canal builders, the numerous yellow fever fatalities and the fear they engendered made it difficult for the French company to retain sufficient technical staff to sustain the effort.  Since the mode of transmission of the disease was unknown, the French response to the disease was limited to care of the sick. The French hospitals contained many pools of stagnant water, such as basins underneath potted plants, in which mosquitoes could breed. The eventual failure, as a result of the numerous deaths, of the French company licensed to build the canal resulted in a massive financial crisis in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[David McCullough]], ''[[The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870–1914]],'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1978 (a comprehensive history of the building of the canal).&lt;/ref&gt;

Saidu-II), [[Moenjodaro]] and [[Tulamba]]. As a [[curator]] he was in charge of museums at [[Harappa]], [[Umerkot]], Moenjodaro, [[Lahore Fort]] and [[Taxila Museum|Taxila]]. He managed the regional offices of the department at [[Peshawar]] and [[Quetta]] before being posted as officer ncharge of the Publications Branch, which he reactivated after it had remained dormant for 13 years. He launched the [[Pakistan Institute of Archaeological Training and Research]] (PIATR) at [[Lahore]] and co-ordinated it following its launch. He was the director of the Northern Circle of Archaeology with headquarters at Lahore, and then Southern Circle of Archaeology at Hyderabad (Sindh)/Karachi. These assignment entailed archaeological research and maintenance and administration of antiquities in the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and North West Frontier – in the former case – and Sindh and Balochistan in the latter case. He retired from active government service in 2000 and is now an author on the cultural heritage of Pakistan.

He has also served as Professor in the [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]] where he structured courses on "Conservation of Architectural Heritage" as a subject for Master's degree in Architecture. He has published about twenty five Research Papers in different journals of international repute; over 250 articles on cultural heritage of Pakistan appearing in various dailies and periodicals and an Excavation Report in two volumes, from Rome. In addition, he edited ''Pakistan Archaeology'' volume 10–22, and prepared and published professional and technical reports.

He also writes English poetry. His poems have appeared in different publications, and as collections entitled ''Illusory Trance''(now out of print) and ''Golden Rays''. His book on ''Moenjodaro, Heritage of Mankind'' was first published in 1994, and the edition sold out within months. Its second edition, revised and enlarged, was published in 1995 and a third edition three years later. He has so far published 27 books from the House of Sang-e-Meel Publications and 3 books from Alfaisal Publishers, both at Lahore, on the cultural heritage of Pakistan. In addition his book - Subjects and Themes in the Holy Qur'an, in two volumes - has also been published by Alfaisal Publishers, Lahore.
Since 2010 he is working as Director in Dyal Singh Research &amp; Cultural Forum - an institute devoted to the study and research in the culture, language and history of Punjab (on both side of the divide between Pakistan and India)

'''''In Search of the Cradle of Civilization: New Light on Ancient India''''' is a 1995 book by [[Georg Feuerstein]], [[Subhash Kak]], and [[David Frawley]] in which the authors argue against the theories that Indo-European peoples arrived in India in the middle of the second millennium BC ([[Indo-Aryan migration]]) and support the concept of "[[Indigenous Aryans]]" and the [[Out of India theory]].

The book was published by Quest Books, a branch of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society in America]].

==Content==
Contradicting earlier views of colonial historians, the authors argue that [[Vedic civilization]] grew out of the "Indus-Sarasvati civilization", or "[[Indus Valley civilization]]". The authors enumerate fifteen arguments for their revisionist views. Several of these arguments emphasize [[linguistics|linguistic]], [[architecture|architectural]], cultural, [[agriculture|agricultural]], and [[technology|technological]] continuity between Harappan culture, the [[Vedas]], and post-Vedic [[Hinduism]]. They also argue that it is improbable that the Vedas were the product of a [[nomads|nomadic]] or semi-nomadic group. Early opinion considered the [[Rigveda]] as containing memories of an earlier nomadic period, whilst the later [[Vedas]] were the product of a society native to India. The authors argue that this early viewpoint of the Rigveda is based on mistaken and speculative interpretations, and that in actuality the Rigveda also describes society native to India.

The authors leave open the view that India is the ''[[Urheimat]]'' (original homeland) of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-Europeans]] (the "[[out of India model]]"), saying that "the [[Aryan]]s could just as well have been native to India for several millennia, deriving their [[Sanskrit]]ic language from earlier Indo-European dialects."

The authors find continuity in Indian spiritual and religious artifacts from [[Mehrgarh]], one of the first cities in the world, to the present. [[Historical linguistics]] does not rule out elements of cultural continuity in spite of language change, so that such claims, likewise, are not in conflict with mainstream opinion.  In the view of the authors, however, this alleged continuity rules out the later influx of another ethnic group.

==Reception==

A review by M. K. Dhavalikar called it a "beautifully printed" contribution to the literature equating Vedic Aryans with the Harappans.&lt;ref name=dhavalikar96/&gt; Dhavalikar wrote that the authors state that there is no archaeological evidence of a massive invasion or migration, and stated that they make a strong case but that the book fails on crucial points, such as not explaining why chariots are absent from Harappan culture while prominent in the Vedas.&lt;ref name=dhavalikar96/&gt; Ultimately, the attempt to rewrite history is not convincing.&lt;ref name=dhavalikar96&gt;{{cite journal

The '''International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation''' ('''IHEYO''') is the [[youth wing]] of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), founded in 2002{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}. It aims to network young humanists around the world together, support training and promote humanist values for the age category of 18–35. It is an umbrella organisation representing around 40,000 young people&lt;ref name=Singapore&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://humanist.org.sg/ahc/about-iheyo-and-iheu/ |title=About IHEYO and IHEU |work=Humanist Society Singapore website |accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the world.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iheu.org/ihey/iheyo-about/ |title=About IHEYO |work=IHEYO website |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
[[File:IHEYO East European conference 2.png|left|thumb|IHEYO East European Conference in Bucharest, Romania in 2015.]]
The International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation (IHEYO) is the international umbrella organisation for Humanist youth organisations. IHEYO's main identity is to bring into active association youth groups and young humanist individuals throughout the world interested in promoting humanism, as is described in the IHEU [[Amsterdam Declaration]] 2002. IHEYO brings together people who describe themselves as humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, skeptics and similar views.

The vision of IHEYO is to give a voice to young humanists within the mission of IHEU. The mission of IHEU is to build and represent the global humanist movement that defends human rights and promotes humanist values worldwide. IHEYO does this by organising international networking events, offering training, connecting youth through social media and by its work in regional working groups. These activities empower IHEYO’s members to achieve their individual, local and regional goals.&lt;ref name=Singapore/&gt;

IHEYO members form the young humanist communities and campaign for political and cultural change in a diverse range of areas such as [[religious freedom]], [[women's rights]], [[education rights]], [[abortion rights]], [[LGBTIQ rights]], [[equal opportunity|equality]], [[human rights]], [[freedom of speech]]/[[Freedom of thought|thought/belief]], [[science communication|public communication of science]].&lt;ref name=Singapore/&gt;

== History ==
IHEYO was formally established in 2003, but it was not completely a 21st-century construct. The first version of IHEYO was launched in 1966, and lasted around ten years. In the ‘80s, it was again revived for a similar period of time. But it was not until 2001, when the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) started an internship programme, that the idea of re-establishing IHEYO as an international humanist youth network was revived in a lasting way.

== Structure ==
[[File:Washington May 2015.jpg|thumb|Americas WG launch event in Washington, DC 2015.]]
[[File:IHEYO Asian Working Group training.png|thumb|Asian WG training in Singapore, 2015.]]
IHEYO's Working Groups are the forum through which Humanist organisations can get in touch and work together with others in the same region. There are four Working Groups: the Asian Humanist Alliance, African Working Group, European Working Group and Americans Working Group.

=== African Working Group ===
The African Working Group (in short: AfWG)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/groups/468425919945991/ African Working Group on Facebook]&lt;br&gt;{{Twitter|https://twitter.com/IheyoAfWG|African Working Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; of IHEYO was established around 2005. It organises regional meetings in East and West Africa. The African Working Group is mainly organised in East Africa (Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, etc.) and West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Cameroon, etc.). The Fourth Annual IHEYO East African Regional Working Group Meeting was held in Kigali on 26–28 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rice |first=Lily |date=October 2015 |title=Learning humanism in Uganda |url=http://www.haleauganda.org/magazine/HALEA%20Magazine%20October.pdf |journal=Open Talk Magazine |publisher=Humanist Association for Leadership, Equity and Accountability |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=14 |accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Americas Working Group ===
The American Working group is the newest and launched in Washington DC in May 2015 at the Future of Ethical Societies Annual conference.&lt;ref name="Future of Ethical Societies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeu.org/our-community/future-of-ethical-societies/ |title=Future of Ethical Societies |website=American Ethical Union|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This working group covered Canada, the United States of America, Central America and South America.

=== Asian Humanist Alliance (Asian Working Group) ===
The Asian Working Group is a joint humanist effort in this continent to foster humanist values and ideas.  Since its inception in 2007, it has published information −bulletins, has had regular meetings and organised events. The Working Group has members in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines.

=== European Working Group ===
The European Working group (EWG) combines all IHEYO member organisations in Europe. The EWG has annual face-to-face meetings to coordinate the international exchanges taking place at events organised in Europe, including the European Humanist Youth Days (EHYD).&lt;ref name="EHYD"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehyd.eu/ |title=European Humanist Youth Days |work=EHYD website |publisher=IHEYO |accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3683">A '''jeremiad''' is a long literary work, usually in [[prose]], but sometimes in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], in which the author bitterly laments the state of society and its morals in a serious tone of sustained invective, and always contains a [[prophecy]] of society's imminent downfall.

==Origins and usage==
The word is an [[eponym]], named after the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[prophet]] [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], and comes from Biblical works attributed to him, the ''[[Book of Jeremiah]]'' and the ''[[Book of Lamentations]]''.  The Book of Jeremiah prophesies the coming downfall of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], and asserts that this is because its rulers have broken the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God|the Lord]].

The ''Lamentations'', similarly, lament the fall of the kingdom of Judah after the conquest prophesied by Jeremiah has occurred:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!&lt;br&gt;She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.&lt;br&gt;  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.&lt;br&gt;The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.&lt;ref&gt;Lamentations 1:1–4 ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Generally, the term ''jeremiad'' is applied to moralistic texts that denounce a society for its wickedness, and prophesy its downfall. The jeremiad was a favorite literary device of the Puritans especially in sermons like "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]" by [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Bruce C. Puritans at Play. New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-7212-5}} {{Page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors from [[Gildas]] to [[Robert Bork]] have had this label hung on their works. Extending that tradition in a reflective vein is the [[A Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass|autobiographical work]] of freed American slave [[Frederick Douglass]], who lamented the moral corruption that slavery wrought on America – from both a [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Christian]] tradition. In contemporary usage, it is frequently [[pejorative]], meant to suggest that the tone of the text is excessively [[pessimism|pessimistic]] and overwrought.

'''John Womack Jr.''' (born 1937) is an historian of [[Latin America]], particularly of [[Mexico]], the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1921) and [[Emiliano Zapata]].  In June 2009 he retired from his post as the Robert Woods Bliss Professor of Latin American History and Economics at [[Harvard University]].

Womack was born in [[Norman, Oklahoma]], in 1937 to John Womack Sr., also a historian. He graduated ''summa cum laude'' at Harvard University in 1959 (see '''Publications''') and became a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at Oxford University.  In the 1960s he returned to his ''alma mater'' to earn a Ph.D. in History with exceptional research that gave him international prestige and his most famous book: ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution'' (1969). His dissertation earned him a place at Harvard as an assistant professor of Latin American History. The published monograph was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970 and he was named to the Robert Woods Bliss Chair in Latin American History, first held by [[Clarence Haring]].&lt;ref&gt;John D. French and Daniel James, "The Travails of Doing Labor History: The Restless Wanderings of John Womack, Jr." ''Labor: Studies in Working Class History of the Americas'' vol. 4(2) 2007, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has focused on modern Mexican history, with interests in Cuban and Colombian history, leading research in agrarian, industrial, and labor history.  After his monograph on Zapata, which inspired many other scholars to pursue projects on grassroots rural history,&lt;ref&gt;John D. French, "The Latin American Labor Studies Boom." ''International Review of Social History'' vol. 45(2)2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Womack shifted his interest to urban working class history.&lt;ref&gt;French and James, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, he published an article in ''Marxist Perspectives'' on the Mexican economy during the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;John Womack, Jr. "The Mexican Economy during the Revolution, 1910-1920: Historiography and Analysis," ''Marxist Perspectives'' I, no. 4 (1978) 80-123.&lt;/ref&gt; His article in the ''Cambridge History of Latin America'' was anthologized in ''Mexico Since Independence''.&lt;ref&gt;John Womack, Jr. "The Mexican Revolution, 1910-1920," ''Mexico Since Independence'', Leslie Bethell, ed. Cambridge University Press 1991, pp. 125-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he published an article on the Moctezuma beer brewery.&lt;ref&gt;John Womack, Jr. "Work in the Moctezuma Brewery", in ''Reconstructing History: The Emergence of a New Historical Society'', Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn, eds. New Your: Routledge 1999, 347-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he published a lengthy article assessing the state of labor history.&lt;ref&gt;John Womack, Jr. "Doing Labor History: Feeling, Work, Material Power," ''Journal of the Historical Society'' vol. 5(3)2005, pp. 255-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1999 anthology of documents, ''Rebellion in Chiapas: An Historical Reader'' was a timely collection that places the Chiapas struggle in a historical perspective back to the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;John Womack, Jr. ''Rebellion in Chiapas: An Historical Reader'', New Press 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 2009, he received the 1808 Medal, given by the Mexico City government. He gave it up to the Mexican Union of Electricians, saying: "My infinite respect for the ability of Mexicans to transform in benefit of the majority their moments of crisis. Such conviction moves me to give honor and deliver this medal to the most important, most courageous organization that took form in this city during the revolutionary wars at the beginning of the last century, the Mexican Union of Electricians (...)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/11/21/index.php?section=politica&amp;article=007n1pol|title=México exige una reorganización política profunda y responsable: John Womack|accessdate=24 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed by Adela Pineda Franco and Jaime Marroquín Arrendondo on his views of the Mexican Revolution, the movie ''Viva Zapata'', and the relevance of Zapata in modern Mexico. "In Mexico, for complicated, still largely unexamined historical reasons, the exploited classes cannot count on politicians or intellectuals for guidance to overthrow the systems of exploitation, centered in New York, proliferated into centers in Mexico, concentrated, of course in Mexico City. Like the people in Morelos, 1900-1911, the exploited have to figure out for themselves, not trusting the politicians they know whatever they howl, whatever they promise."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview with John Womack" by Adela Pineda Franco and Jaime Marroquín Arredondo in ''Open Borders to a Revolution: Culture, Politics, and Migration'', edited by Jaime Marroquín Arredondo, Adela Pineda Franco, and Magdalena Mieri. Washington, D.C. Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press 2013, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Womack also serves on the board of directors for FFIPP-USA (Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace-USA) which is a network of Palestinian, Israeli, and International faculty, and students, working for an end of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and just peace.

"[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of the judicial reform often include; codification of law instead of [[common law]], moving from an [[inquisitorial system]] to an [[adversarial system]], establishing stronger judicial independence with [[judicial council]]s or changes to appointment procedure, establishing mandatory retirement age for judges or  enhancing independence of [[prosecution]].

The '''Kedukan Bukit Inscription''' was discovered by the Dutchman M. Batenburg on 29 November 1920 at Kedukan Bukit, [[South Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], on the banks of the River Tatang, a tributary of the River [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi]]. It is the oldest surviving specimen of the [[Malay language]], in a form known as [[Old Malay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lost Kingdoms: Hindu-Buddhist Sculpture of Early Southeast Asia | last = Guy | first = John | publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art | date = 7 April 2014 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vO_-AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=id#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn= 9781588395245 | page= 21 | accessdate = 7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small stone of 45 by 80&amp;nbsp;cm. This inscription is dated the year 11, 02, 605 Saka (1, 05, 683 AD).

These inscriptions were written in a sister system of [[Vatteluttu alphabet|Vatteluttu]] and [[Grantha alphabet|Grantha]] called the [[Pallava alphabet]], developed by ancient Tamils to write [[Tamil language|Tamil ]] and contain numerous [[Sanskrit]] words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Colette Caillat|author2=J.

[[George Coedes]] states the inscription tells us, "that on April 23, 682, a king began an expedition (''siddhayatra'') by boat, that on May 19 he left an estuary with an army moving simultaneously by land and sea, and that, a month later, he brought victory, power, and wealth to Srivijaya.

===English Translation===
:"''Om swasti astu!'' All hail and prosperity. In the year 605 of the [Indian] &lt;!--editorial edition, hence square brackets, BD--&gt;[[Saka era|Saka]] calendar, on the eleventh day at half-moon of ''Waisaka'', Sri Baginda took dugouts in order to obtain  ''siddhayatra''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Coedès, ''siddhayatra'' refers to some "magic potion". An alternative translation, however, is possible: [[Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder|Zoetmulder]]'s ''Dictionary of Old Javanese'' (1995) renders it as "a prosperous journey". If so, the sentence may be taken to read: "Sri Baginda took dugouts in order to spread Buddhism, the successful way."&lt;/ref&gt;  On Day 7, on the 15th day at half-moon of ''Jyestha'', Sri Baginda extricated himself from ''minānga tāmvan''.&lt;ref&gt;Meaning not clear.&lt;/ref&gt; He took 20,000 troops with him … as many as 200 in dugouts, with 1,312 foot soldiers.  They arrived at … Truly merry on the fifteenth day of the half-moon…, agile, happy, and they made a trip to the country … Great [[Sriwijaya]]! Prosperity and riches …"

'''Language event''' (German: ''Sprachereignis'') is an act or instance of written or spoken [[communication]]. In the 1920s earliest use of the word was found in [[The Journal of Philosophy|''Journal of Philosophy'']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/language_event English Oxford Living Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theology|theology]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; this word was used by [[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernest Fuchs]], relating to [[New Hermeneutic]]. Fuchs' doctrine of language helped to inspire a "new quest" for the historical [[Jesus]] because it could now be said that Jesus' words and deeds constituted that "language event" in which faith first entered into language, thereby becoming available as an existential possibility within language, the "house of being" ([[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]). Conversely, the reality of God's love is verbalized in Jesus' words and deeds recorded in the Gospels and is thus preserved as language gain(Sprachgewinn). In the freedom of proclamation God's presence in the gospel as the "Yes of love" happens again-that is, comes to be as language, opening up the future to authentic existence (faith, hope, and love)
&lt;ref&gt;(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, A-J, R.N. Soulen, "Ernst Fuchs", by John Hayes, (Abingdon), 422-423&lt;/ref&gt;


==Paul==

According to the Epistles of Paul, the proclaimed Word of God effects and creates faith. Faith is thus the creature of the word ("creatura verbi"). So it says in Paul's letter to the Romans (Rom 10,17 EU):
"Faith thus comes from preaching, but preaching by the word of Christ."
Thus, for Paul, faith arises from hearing the apostolic message of faith. Yet this "fides ex auditu" is a gift from God.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stuhlmacher, ''Biblische Theologie des Neuen Testaments Bd. 1: Grundlegung. von Jesus zu Paulus'', Göttingen 1992, S.&amp;nbsp;343&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martin Luther==
Martin Luther defines the believing people as "homo audiens".&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Beutel, ''Im Anfang war das Wort'', 1991, S.&amp;nbsp;126ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to him, listening to the Word requires faith in man.&lt;ref&gt;z.&amp;nbsp;B. [[Weimarer Ausgabe|WA]] 23,267,20-22: „Der Glaube ynn Gotts wort ist uns von nöten, weil es darumb geredt wird, das wirs gleuben sollen, und Gott foddert und wil den glauben haben, wo sein wort ist.“&lt;/ref&gt;  This "verbality" of faith is central to his theology. Again and again this emphasizes the vocabulary of faith and that the word should be praised as a means of grace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Weimarer Ausgabe|WA]] 5, 175, 23; 176, 12, 177, 11; 215, 38; 376, 2; 380, 15. &lt;/ref&gt; Faith embraces the word that is offered to it.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Ernst Bizer, ''Fides ex auditu'', 1961, S. 171&lt;/ref&gt; So it is z. Eg in his second Psalm lecture (1519/20) on Ps 18.45 VUL:

"Actum igitur credendi (ut vocant) nescio quibus verbis possis aptius eloqui quam ista periphrasi divina:" auditu auris audivit mihi ", hoc est, stultus sibi fuit populus gentium, ut mihi crederet in his, quae non videret nec caperet."

- Martin Luther: WA 5, 537, 3
"Therefore, I do not know with which words you could pronounce the event of faith (as they call it) more fittingly than by this divine description:" It [the people] hears me with obedient ears ", that is to say, simple is for themselves the people of People so that it believed me in things that neither saw nor grasped. "

By referring to the passage as a "transcription", Luther means the "inner" and "spiritual" hearing  through which the act of believing (actum credendi) is characterized.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Flachmann, ''Martin Luther und das Buch'' (1996), S.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with such a Lutheran understanding of the word, Fuchs will later develop his theory of the language event.

==Ernst Fuchs==
[[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernest Fuchs]] insisted that speeches from the language event is in the Pauline-Lutheran tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Jüngel, ''Unterwegs zur Sache'' (2000), S.24&lt;/ref&gt; For Fuchs, word and faith essentially belong together: faith has its essence from its relationship to the word. Faith is the listening to the word that meets it, by which he means the [[Gospel]] concretely.{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}} For this reason, Fuchs sees the speech event as the unfolding of faith: it causes the listener to change the situation{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}} from "not-being" to being in the existence of God. This understanding of speech thus represents a fundamental category of his [[hermeneutics]]. Fuchs is keen to emphasize the passivity of man. For this he uses the term of silence.{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}} Man does not move in her{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}}, but is moved by the speech event.{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}} Language live on the silence.{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fuchs, ''Marburger Hermeneutik'' (1968), S.242&lt;/ref&gt;
In the language event, the language itself leads to that silence of which it lives. In addition, Fuchs sees his statements of eloquent and significant language parallel to the distinction between being and being{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}} (see also Heidegger).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fuchs, ''Gesammelte Aufsätze II'' (1960), S.425&lt;/ref&gt; While merely indicative language offers only an expression of beings, a speech event justifies being and allows it to be present. Fuchs applies his doctrine of the linguistic event to various theological disciplines, namely, the preaching of Jesus, the theology of Paul and the Easter event.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fuchs, ''Gesammelte Aufsätze I'' (1959), S, 281&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gerhard Ebeling==
[[Gerhard Ebeling]] continues to use the concept of the language event as a demarcation to dogmatic doctrine. Ebeling understands the sacrament as "language event".

==Eberhard Jüngel==
[[Eberhard Jüngel]], theologically influenced by [[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernest Fuchs]], proved to be a proponent of the language event. He took it over in his book "Paul and Jesus" as a demarcation to [[Rudolf Bultmann]].

The '''Lapis Satricanus''' ("Stone of Satricum"), is a yellow stone found in the ruins of the ancient town of [[Satricum]], near Borgo Montello ({{coord|41|31|N|12|47|E|}}), a village of southern [[Lazio]], dated late 6th to early 5th centuries BC.&lt;ref name="Stibbe1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

Stibbe.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Conrad M. Stibbe|see the Dutch lemma on C.M. Stibbe]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stibbe1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. M. Stibbe|title=Lapis Satricanus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvseAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Ministerie van Cultuur, Recreatie en Maatschappelijk Werk|isbn=978-90-12-02951-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:

: ''(?)IEI STETERAI POPLIOSIO VALESIOSIO''
: ''SVODALES MAMARTEI''&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' I2 2832a [http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/inschrift/HD001651]&lt;/ref&gt;

("The (?) dedicated this, as companions of Publius Valerius, to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]")

This inscription has attracted attention for several reasons. Its language has been identified as [[Old Latin]] or a closely related dialect.&lt;ref name="Baldi2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Baldi|title=The Foundations of Latin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afsDrP9K3pQC&amp;pg=PA204|date=January 2002|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-017208-9|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for comparative Indo-European grammar, as it is the only Latin inscription to show the ending ''-osio'' for the genitive singular of the thematic noun declension. Latin later has ''-ī'' as the ending for this case, but by comparison with [[Sanskrit]], [[Mycenaean Greek|Mycenaean]] and [[Homeric Greek]] and other languages, it becomes clear that ''-osio'' is a far earlier form.&lt;ref name="Beekes2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Stephen Paul Beekes|title=Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_JwBsKzgeAC|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-1185-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lapis Satricanus 02.JPG|thumb|detail of the Lapis Satricanus]]
Another point of interest is the presence of the word ''suodales'' ([[Classical Latin]] ''[[sodales]]''). In historic times, this word referred to a member of a ''sodalites'', a religious fraternity or brotherhood who met for ritual meals or as a burial organization. "Since the ''suod-'' element in ''suodales'' is cognate with the English word 'swear'", writes Gary Forsythe, "the term suggests that some kind of oath was taken, binding the members of the group together in a common purpose." Forsythe uses this and that this was a dedication to Mars to suggest this indicates the existence of an armed group of sworn followers, similar to "the war bands led by Homeric heroes, the warlike aristocratic companions of the Macedonian kings during the classical period, and the war bands surrounding the Celtic and Germanic chieftains described by Caesar and Tacitus".&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'' (Berkeley: University of California, 2005), p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Forsythe notes this puts a new light on the account of the [[Battle of the Cremera]], an event where the entire [[Fabia (gens)|gens Fabii]] fought as a group the armed men of the rival town of [[Veii]] only to be tragically defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History'', p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

A third point of interest to historians and archaeologists of early [[Latium]] is the name preserved on the inscription.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Armstrong|title=War and Society in Early Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRa8CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|date=8 April 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-09357-7|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaic name of Poplios Valesios is rendered in Classical Latin as "Publius Valerius". That has inevitably led to speculation that the inscription refers to none other than the famous [[Publius Valerius Publicola]], the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] ally of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] who dominates the list of early [[consuls]] recorded by the ''[[Fasti Capitolini]]'' and is credited, in traditional accounts, as one of the primary founders of the [[Roman Republic]]. Positive identification is at least somewhat problematic because the town of Satricum was not part of Roman territory when Publius Valerius was consul. However, the "lapis" itself may not have been dedicated in Satricum in the first place since it was found as part of a collection of recycled material used in the construction of a temple in the town, and it could well have been imported from elsewhere.

| This is one of the most outstanding volcanic regions in the world, with a high density of active volcanoes, a variety of types, and a wide range of related features. The six sites included in the serial designation group together the majority of volcanic features of the Kamchatka peninsula. The interplay of active volcanoes and glaciers forms a dynamic landscape of great beauty. The sites contain great species diversity, including the world's largest known variety of salmonoid fish and exceptional concentrations of sea otter, brown bear and [[Steller's sea eagle]].

| The Altai mountains in southern Siberia form the major mountain range in the western Siberia biogeographic region and provide the source of its greatest rivers – the Ob and the Irtysh. Three separate areas are inscribed: Altaisky Zapovednik and a buffer zone around Lake Teletskoye; Katunsky Zapovednik and a buffer zone around Mount Belukha; and the Ukok Quiet Zone on the Ukok plateau. The total area covers 1,611,457 ha. The region represents the most complete sequence of altitudinal vegetation zones in central Siberia, from steppe, forest-steppe, mixed forest, subalpine vegetation to alpine vegetation. The site is also an important habitat for endangered animal species such as the snow leopard.

| –
| The Western Caucasus, extending over 275,000 ha of the extreme western end of the Caucasus mountains and located 50&amp;nbsp;km north-east of the Black Sea, is one of the few large mountain areas of Europe that has not experienced significant human impact. Its subalpine and alpine pastures have only been grazed by wild animals, and its extensive tracts of undisturbed mountain forests, extending from the lowlands to the [[subalpine zone]], are unique in Europe. The site has a great diversity of ecosystems, with important endemic plants and wildlife, and is the place of origin and reintroduction of the mountain subspecies of the European bison.

| –
| The Sikhote-Alin mountain range contains one the richest and most unusual temperate forests of the world. In this mixed zone between taiga and subtropics, southern species such as the tiger and Himalayan bear cohabit with northern species such as the brown bear and lynx. The site stretches from the peaks of Sikhote-Alin to the Sea of Japan and is important for the survival of many endangered species such as the Amur tiger.

The Bikin River Valley is a serial extension of the existing Central Sikhote-Alin site, inscribed in 2001 on the World Heritage List. It is located about 100 km to the north of the existing property. The extension covers an area of 1,160,469 hectares, three times larger than the existing site. It encompasses the South-Okhotsk dark coniferous forests and the East-Asian coniferous broadleaf forests. The fauna includes species of the taiga alongside southern Manchurian species. It includes notable mammals such as the Amur Tiger, Siberian Musk Deer, Wolverine and Sable.

| The Uvs Nuur Basin (1,068,853 ha), is the northernmost of the enclosed basins of Central Asia. It takes its name from Uvs Nuur Lake, a large, shallow and very saline lake, important for migrating birds, waterfowl and seabirds. The site is made up of twelve protected areas representing the major biomes of eastern Eurasia. The steppe ecosystem supports a rich diversity of birds and the desert is home to a number of rare gerbil, jerboas and the marbled polecat. The mountains are an important refuge for the globally endangered snow leopard, mountain sheep (argali) and the Asiatic ibex.

| –
| Located well above the Arctic Circle, the site includes the mountainous Wrangel Island (7,608 km2), [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]] (11 km2) and surrounding waters. Wrangel was not glaciated during the Quaternary Ice Age, resulting in exceptionally high levels of biodiversity for this region. The island boasts the world’s largest population of Pacific walrus and the highest density of ancestral polar bear dens. It is a major feeding ground for the grey whale migrating from Mexico and the northernmost nesting ground for 100 migratory bird species, many endangered. Currently, 417 species and subspecies of vascular plants have been identified on the island, double that of any other Arctic tundra territory of comparable size and more than any other Arctic island. Some species are derivative of widespread continental forms, others are the result of recent hybridization, and 23 are endemic.

| –
| This site coincides with the area of the Putoransky State Nature Reserve, and is located in the central part of the Putorana Plateau in northern Central Siberia. It is situated about 100&amp;nbsp;km north of the Arctic Circle. The part of the plateau inscribed on the World Heritage List harbours a complete set of subarctic and arctic ecosystems in an isolated mountain range, including pristine taiga, forest tundra, tundra and arctic desert systems, as well as untouched cold-water lake and river systems. A major reindeer migration route crosses the property, which represents an exceptional, large-scale and increasingly rare natural phenomenon.

| –
| Lena Pillars Nature Park is marked by spectacular rock pillars that reach a height of approximately 100 m along the banks of the Lena River in the central part of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). They were produced by the region's extreme continental climate with an annual temperature range of almost 100 degrees Celsius (from –60&amp;nbsp;°C in winter to +40&amp;nbsp;°C in summer). The pillars form rocky buttresses isolated from each other by deep and steep gullies developed by frost shattering directed along intervening joints. Penetration of water from the surface has facilitated cryogenic processes (freeze-thaw action), which have widened gullies between pillars leading to their isolation. Fluvial processes are also critical to the pillars. The site also contains a wealth of Cambrian fossil remains of numerous species, some of them unique.

| 16th century on
|Shared with [[Mongolia]], this site is an outstanding example of the [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] Steppe eco-region, which extends from eastern Mongolia into Russian Siberia and northeastern [[China]]. Cyclical climate changes, with distinct dry and wet periods lead to a wide diversity of species and ecosystems of global significance. The different types of steppe ecosystems represented, such as grassland and forest, as well as lakes and wetlands serve as habitats for rare species of fauna, such as the [[White-naped crane]], [[Great Bustard]], [[Relict Gull]] and [[Swan goose]]. It is also a critical site on the transboundary migration path for the [[Mongolian gazelle]].

| The ''pogost'' of Kizhi (i.e. the Kizhi enclosure) is located on one of the many islands in Lake Onega, in Karelia. Two 18th-century wooden churches, and an octagonal clock tower, also in wood and built in 1862, can be seen there. These unusual constructions, in which carpenters created a bold visionary architecture, perpetuate an ancient model of parish space and are in harmony with the surrounding landscape.

| The Church of the Ascension was built in 1532 on the imperial estate of Kolomenskoye, near Moscow, to celebrate the birth of the prince who was to become Tsar Ivan IV ('the Terrible'). One of the earliest examples of a traditional wooden tent-roofed church on a stone and brick substructure, it had a great influence on the development of Russian ecclesiastical architecture.

| Built on an ancient site, the Kazan Kremlin dates from the Muslim period of the Golden Horde and the Kazan Khanate. It was conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1552 and became the Christian See of the Volga Land. The only surviving Tatar fortress in Russia and an important place of pilgrimage, the Kazan Kremlin consists of an outstanding group of historic buildings dating from the 16th to 19th centuries, integrating remains of earlier structures of the 10th to 16th centuries.

| The Ferapontov Monastery, in the Vologda region in northern Russia, is an exceptionally well-preserved and complete example of a Russian Orthodox monastic complex of the 15th-17th centuries, a period of great significance in the development of the unified Russian state and its culture. The architecture of the monastery is outstanding in its inventiveness and purity. The interior is graced by the magnificent wall paintings of Dionisy, the greatest Russian artist of the end of the 15th century.

| Human habitation of this elongated sand dune peninsula, 98&amp;nbsp;km long and 0.4–4&amp;nbsp;km wide, dates back to prehistoric times. Throughout this period it has been threatened by the natural forces of wind and waves. Its survival to the present day has been made possible only as a result of ceaseless human efforts to combat the erosion of the Spit, dramatically illustrated by continuing stabilisation and reforestation projects.

| The Citadel, Ancient City and Fortress Buildings of Derbent were part of the northern lines of the Sasanian Persian Empire, which extended east and west of the Caspian Sea. The fortification was built in stone. It consisted of two parallel walls that formed a barrier from the seashore up to the mountain. The town of Derbent was built between these two walls, and has retained part of its medieval fabric. The site continued to be of great strategic importance until the 19th century.

| The Novodevichy Convent, in south-western Moscow, built in the 16th and 17th centuries in the so-called Moscow Baroque style, was part of a chain of monastic ensembles that were integrated into the defence system of the city. The convent was directly associated with the political, cultural and religious history of Russia, and closely linked to the Moscow Kremlin. It was used by women of the Tsar’s family and the aristocracy. Members of the Tsar’s family and entourage were also buried in its cemetery. The convent provides an example of the highest accomplishments of Russian architecture with rich interiors and an important collection of paintings and artefacts.

| Situated at the confluence of the Volga and Kotorosl Rivers some 250&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Moscow, the historic city of Yaroslavl developed into a major commercial centre from the 11th century. It is renowned for its numerous 17th-century churches and is an outstanding example of the urban planning reform Empress Catherine the Great ordered for the whole of Russia in 1763. While keeping some of its significant historic structures, the town was renovated in the neoclassical style on a radial urban master plan. It has also kept elements from the 16th century in the Spassky Monastery, one of the oldest in the [[Upper Volga region]], built on the site of a pagan temple in the late 12th century but reconstructed over time.

| 19th century
| The Struve Arc is a chain of survey triangulations stretching from Hammerfest in Norway to the Black Sea, through 10 countries and over 2,820&amp;nbsp;km. These are points of a survey, carried out between 1816 and 1855 by the astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve, which represented the first accurate measuring of a long segment of a meridian. This helped to establish the exact size and shape of the planet and marked an important step in the development of earth sciences and topographic mapping. It is an extraordinary example of scientific collaboration among scientists from different countries, and of collaboration between monarchs for a scientific cause. The original arc consisted of 258 main triangles with 265 main station points. The listed site includes 34 of the original station points, with different markings, i.e. a drilled hole in rock, iron cross, cairns, or built obelisks.

| This property lies on the shores of the Volga River, south of its confluence with the River Kama, and south of the capital of Tatarstan, Kazan. It contains evidence of the medieval city of Bolgar, an early settlement of the civilization of Volga-Bolgars, which existed between the 7th and the 15th centuries, and was the first capital of the Golden Horde in the 13th century. Bolgar represents the historical cultural exchanges and transformations of Eurasia over several centuries that played a pivotal role in the formation of civilizations, customs and cultural traditions. The property provides remarkable evidence of historic continuity and cultural diversity. It is a symbolic reminder of the acceptance of Islam by the Volga-Bolgars in 922 AD and remains a  sacred,  pilgrimage destination to the Tatar Muslims.

|The Assumption Cathedral is located in the town-island of Sviyazhsk and is part of the monastery of the same name. Situated at the confluence of the [[Volga]], the [[Sviyaga River|Sviyaga]] and the Shchuka rivers, at the crossroads of the [[Silk road|Silk]] and [[Volga trade route|Volga]] routes, Sviyazhsk was founded by [[Ivan the Terrible]] in 1551. It was from this outpost that he initiated the conquest of the [[Kazan Khanate]]. The cathedral’s frescoes are among the rarest examples of Eastern Orthodox mural paintings.

The use of SBASs, such as MSAS, enables an individual GPS receiver to correct its own position, offering a much greater accuracy.

{{Expand Italian|Magistrato alla Sanità|date=August 2018}}

The '''Magistrate for Health''' ({{lang-it|Magistrato alla Sanità}}) was a magistracy of the [[Republic of Venice]] instituted in 1485 to manage public health in the city of Venice and its territories, with specific attention to preventing the spread of epidemics within the maritime republic. The magistracy was expanded several times, notably in 1556 with the introduction of a supervisory role and in 1563 with a regulatory body. It was among the first health authorities in Europe to institute public inoculation projects to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The office of the Magistrate for Health was retained until the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice]], during which tumultuous time it was briefly replaced by a health committee and eventually superseded by other magistracies entirely.

[[File:Avviso di inoculazione antivaiolosa 1770.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of a 1770 smallpox variolation notice from the Archive of the Superintendents for Health of the Republic of Venice.]]

==Organisation==

The Magistrate for Health initially comprised three superintendents appointed by the [[Venetian Senate]], but fell under the jurisdiction of the [[Great Council of Venice]] in 1537. In 1556, it was expanded with two supervisors tasked with directing and controlling the work of the superintendents in the name of the Republic. In 1563, a regulatory body for the activities of the Magistrate for Health was introduced in the form of a college of ten “wise men” ({{lang-it|Savi}}) who were elected individually by the Venetian Senate.

The authority of the Magistrate for Health extended not only to the entirety of the [[Venetian Lagoon]] but also to the other cities of the Venetian Republic by means of establishing health offices in each. Extensive infrastructure was introduced in the [[Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands|Ionian Islands]], which were viewed particularly throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as likely sources of disease outbreaks due to its proximity to [[Asia Minor]] and by extension the [[Ottoman Empire]]. &lt;ref name="Ionian"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Katerina Konstantinidou, Elpis Mantadakis, Matthew E. Falagas, Thalia Sardi &amp; George Samonis | title = Venetian rule and control of plague epidemics on the Ionian Islands during 17th and 18th centuries | journal = [[Emerging infectious diseases]] | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–43
 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.3201/eid1501.071545 | pmid = 19116047 | pmc = 2660681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice]], as [[Napoleon]]’s troops were occupying the Republic’s territory with numerous reforms to government and infrastructure, the office of the Magistrate for Health was folded into the Health Committee ({{lang-it|Comitato di Sanità}}) for a short period of time before eventually being disbanded, with its duties assigned to other magistracies.

==Function==

Upon its institution as a permanent body, the Magistrate for Health was tasked with safeguarding the public health of the state, with particular attention to preventing the spread of foreign diseases within the republic’s territory, a regular threat for a city with such extensive reliance on trade routes bearing risk of contact with foreign outbreaks (notably in the 1347 outbreak of the [[Black Death]], in which Venice’s interactions with seagoing vessels had made it one of the first cities in Europe to be devastated by the plague). In order to do so, the superintendents (and upon their introduction, the supervisors) were empowered with numerous legal authorities, including the right to pronounce capital punishment, ostensibly for purposes of [[quarantine]]. 

The officials of the Magistrate for Health exercised their authority in supervising a wide range of professions and services: in addition to the colleges of barbers and physicians, it regularly supervised the food industry, [[Leper colony|lazar houses]], waste disposal, sewage and water management and mortuary services. It was also known to interact with prostitutes, vagrants, beggars and guesthouses, further aiding the surveillance of possible transmission of foreign maladies within their jurisdiction. However, in many cases, their authority was often not direct; for example, the lazar houses, or ''lazaretti'', were able to bypass local health authorities and report directly to the regional government in times of low disease activity, only falling under the health office’s direct jurisdiction in times of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Konstantinidou |first=Katerina |date=2007 |title= The disaster creeps crawling… The plague epidemics of the Ionian Islands|language=Greek|publisher=Hellenic Institute of Byzantine and Post Byzantine Studies|publication-place = Venice (Italy)|pages=55–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venetian Magistrate for Health was the second health provider in Italy to introduce [[variolation]], which had only recently been introduced to Europe from eastern schools of medicine, as a means of [[inoculation]] against smallpox, preceded only by the Hospital of Santa Maria degli Innocenti in Florence, and the first to offer it freely to the public for purposes of [[herd immunity]].

Despite their precautions, epidemics continued to occur regularly in Venice. The [[Black Death#Recurrence|outbreak of plague]] of 1576–1577 killed around 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population;&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fQxAkrbksTEC&amp;pg=PA41 Medicine and society in early modern Europe]''". Mary Lindemann (1999). [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 41. {{ISBN|0-521-42354-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a similar proportion of the population was killed in 1630 in the [[Italian plague of 1629-31]], when around 46,000 of the city’s 140,000 citizens were killed.&lt;ref name= "Hays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hays|first1=J. N.|title=Epidemics and pandemics their impacts on human history|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-1851096589|page=103}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to enable control and quarantine of disease outbreaks, officials of the Magistrate for Health were able to impose periods of isolation of at least 14 days, upper length dependent on the situation in the port of question, and to cordon off areas of the cities. Independent branches of the Venetian health services immediately discontinued trade and travel to and from Venice, functioning independently with the immediate isolation order of the Venetian Senate until the outbreak abated. Other methods of disease control included an intricate network of information and messaging, allowing for efficient reporting of and response to outbreaks, and the capacity to mobilise local coastal garrisons to carry out inspections, allowing isolation of plague-infested areas using pre-existing infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Ionian" /&gt;
==Archive==

The Archive of the Superintendents for Health contains nearly four centuries of documentation on not only the conditions of public health and sanitation within the Venetian Republic, but also of other contemporary states, on account of the extensive information gathered by the officials from their foreign counterparts as part of their regular surveillance of potential foreign-borne epidemics. The inventory for the archive, along with an index of names and locations, was published by Salvatore Carbone in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Carbone, Salvatore.

'''Off-color humor''' (also known as '''vulgar humor''', '''crude humor''', or '''shock humor''') is [[Humour|humor]] that deals with topics that may be considered to be in [[poor taste]] or overly [[vulgarity|vulgar]]. Many [[comedic genres]] (including [[jokes]], [[prose]], [[poem]]s, [[black comedy]], [[Ribaldry#Blue_comedy|blue comedy]], [[insult comedy]], [[cringe comedy]] and [[Sketch comedy|skits]]) can incorporate vulgar elements. 

Most commonly labeled as "off-color" are acts concerned with [[sexual intercourse|sex]], a particular [[Racism|ethnic group]], or [[Sexism|gender]].  Other off-color topics include [[violence]], particularly [[Spousal abuse|domestic abuse]]; excessive swearing or [[profanity]]; "[[toilet humor]]" / [[scatological humor]]; [[Nationalism|national superiority]] or [[Xenophobia|inferiority]], [[pedophilia|pedophilic]] content, and any topics generally considered [[Taboo|impolite]] or [[morality|indecent]].  Generally, the point of off-color humor is to induce laughter by evoking a feeling of [[shock value|shock]] and surprise in the comedian's audience.  In this way, off-color humor is related to other forms of [[postmodern]] [[humor]], such as the [[anti-joke]].

==History==
Off-color humor was used in [[Ancient Greek comedy]], primarily by its most famous contributor and representative, [[Aristophanes]]. His work parodied some of the great tragedians of his time, especially [[Euripides]], using sexual and excremental jokes that received great popularity among his contemporaries. 

[[William Shakespeare]], the 16th-century playwright and poet, is well known for his ribald humor. Almost every one of his plays contains suggestive jokes and [[innuendo]].

[[Jonathan Swift]], an Irish satirist in the 17th century, used scatological humor in some of his pieces, including his famous essay [[A Modest Proposal]] and his rather crude poem "[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]", in which the speaker comments on the goings-on in a 17th-century woman's room, including her business in her chamber pot.

Dirty jokes were once considered [[subversive]] and underground, and rarely heard in public.  Comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] was tried, convicted, and jailed for [[obscenity]] after a stand up performance that included off-color humor in [[New York City]] in 1964.  Comedian and actor [[Redd Foxx]] was well known in nightclubs in the 1960s and 1970s for his raunchy [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up act]], but toned it down for the television shows ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' and ''[[The Redd Foxx Comedy Hour]]'', stating in the first monologue of the latter show that the only similarity between the show and his nightclub act was that "I'm smoking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://207.36.165.13/foxx.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217151814/http://207.36.165.13/foxx.html |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  American society has become increasingly tolerant of off-color humor since that time. Such forms of humor have become widely distributed and more socially acceptable, in part due to the mainstream success in the 1970s and 1980s of comedians like [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]]'s [[alter-ego]]s [[Derek and Clive]], [[Rudy Ray Moore|Dolemite]],  and [[Andrew Dice Clay]]. [[George Carlin]] and [[Richard Pryor]] have used it as an effective tool for social commentary.

In the 1990s and modern era, comedians such as [[Bill Hicks]], [[Doug Stanhope]], and [[Dave Chappelle]] have used shocking content to draw attention to their criticism of social issues, especially [[censorship]] and the socioeconomic divide. [[Dave Attell]] and [[Louis C.K.]] are recognised{{By whom|date=June 2017}} as the modern masters of off-color humor that focuses on absurd topics.The cartoon ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' was especially off-color in its early episodes, which included numerous depictions of animal cruelty. The highly praised television show ''[[South Park]]'' also popularized the use of offensive humor, for which the show has become infamous. [[The Aristocrats (joke)|The Aristocrats]] is perhaps the most famous dirty joke in the US and is certainly one of the best-known and most oft-repeated among comedians themselves. [[Tom Green]] has used shock humor in ''[[The Tom Green Show]]'' and the film ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'', using outrageous stunts and jokes to draw an audience in.

In [[British humour|British humor]], the genre of "[[sick comedy|sick jokes]]" is often used to shock by poking fun at [[taboo]] or as a reaction against [[political correctness]]. Examples include the website [[B3ta]] and its accompanying book ''The Bumper B3ta Book of Sick Jokes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manuel|first=compiled by Rob|title=The bumper b3ta book of sick jokes|year=2006|publisher=Friday|location=London|isbn=978-1-905548-28-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the humor wiki [[Sickipedia]] and the adult comic ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]''.

==Veg and non-veg jokes==
In some parts of the world, including India, sexual humor in particular is known as "non-veg" humor, contrasted with the "veg" jokes that are more acceptable in polite company. The use of the term "non-veg" is probably a reference to the carnal nature of sexual humor, and can be viewed in the context of the prevalence of both [[vegetarian]] and non-vegetarian dietary preferences in India.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[animation|animated]] [[science fiction]] show ''[[Futurama]]'' presents a satirical look at [[politics]] and current affairs in a number of its episodes. Series creator [[Matt Groening]] intended from the outset that ''Futurama'' would lampoon not only the conventions of science fiction, but elements of present-day life, serving as a form of political and social satire.&lt;ref name="motherjones"&gt;{{cite news| last=Doherty |first=Brian |title=Interview with Matt Groening |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/1999/03/matt-groening |date=March–April 1999 |accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X |date=2002 |title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Space Pilot 3000]]"| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inverse"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutchinson |first=Sean |title=How 'Futurama' Predicted Donald Trump's Presidential Bid |work=Inverse |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18892-futurama-donald-trump-head-of-richard-nixon-politics-presidential-election |date=2016-08-29|accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Brenden |title=The 25 Best Things About the Future According To "Futurama" |work=[[Complex Magazine]] |url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/07/futurama-best-future-predictions/ |date=2013-08-07|accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earth government==
[[Image:Futurama flag of Earth.svg|thumb|right|The Earth flag, "Old Freebie".]]
The most significant change in global politics presented in ''Futurama'''s view of the 31st century is that the whole of [[Earth]] is governed by a single united government. This united government has many similarities to the present-day [[United States]]' political system; its capital is [[Washington, D.C.]], it is a [[two-party system]] of the "Fingerlican" and "Tastycrat" parties with a number of inconsequential [[third party (politics)|third parties]], the government is headed by a [[president]], and there are references to a [[constitution]] and an expanded [[bill of rights]]. In the episodes "[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]" and a "[[A Head in the Polls]]" third parties mentioned include the "Rainbow Whigs", "Antisocialists", the "Voter Apathy Party", "Reform Party", the "Green Party", "Brain Slug Party", "Dudes for the Legalation of of Hemp" [sic], "Bull Space Moose Party", "National Ray-Gun Association", "People for the Ethical Treatment of Humans", and "One Cell, One Vote".

Citizens of Earth are referred to as "Earthicans". In the episodes "[[When Aliens Attack]]" and "[[Anthology of Interest II]]" there is evidence that the Countries of Earth are still bound to the [[U.N.]] (the UN New York Offices appear in "When Aliens Attack"), headed by the Earth President. Each member appears to remain individual, sending their own representative to the UN and maintaining many of their own cultures and languages, but also show evidence of [[multiculturalism]] (France now speaks [[English language|English]] and French is apparently a [[Extinct language|dead language]], for example). It is not clear how much power the countries actually have in the Earthican government, though it appears that remnants of many U.S. states, for example, have survived into the 31st century, including "New New York", "New New Jersey", "[[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Nukevada]]", [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|"Penn Republic" and "Sylvania"]].

"Old Freebie", the name of Earth's flag, contains the thirteen stripes of the [[Flag of the United States]] and the [[Grand Union Flag]] but instead of the 50 stars or the [[Union Flag]] in the [[Flag terminology|canton]] it has a picture of the globe, with North and South America prominently centered. In the episode "[[A Taste of Freedom]]", [[Doctor Zoidberg]] eats the flag, causing an interplanetary incident. This reflects several controversies surrounding the desecration of the American flag.

The former [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has become the Earth's Supreme Court. According to Richard Nixon's head, the Earth's Supreme Court is the "one place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat". The current Chief Justice is [[Snoop Dogg]] while the other members of the Supreme Court are several preserved, jar heads of the members of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1990s, like Scalia, Thomas or Ginsberg, while the other members are singers or actresses such as [[Björk]] or [[Katey Sagal]] (who voices [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]]). Myrtle Fu, a female judge who resembles [[Judge Judy]], was the last non-head in jar Justice at the Supreme Court.  [[Abe Vigoda]] was also a member of the Court. In "[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]", Leela and her environmentalist cohorts are convicted of various crimes because, while all five female justices vote to acquit, each female justice has only half a vote.

===Presidency===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Futurama nixons head.png|thumb|left|''[[Futurama]]'''s fictional president of Earth, the preserved head of [[Richard Nixon]] in a jar.]] --&gt;
The President of Earth is introduced in the episode "[[When Aliens Attack]]", in the person of President McNeal. In a case of mistaken identity, McNeal is vaporized by invading Omicronians. In a later episode, "[[A Head in the Polls]]", a presidential election is held. Initially two [[cloning|clone]]s, John Jackson and Jack Johnson, run for the presidency, representing the "Fingerlican" and "Tastycrat" parties respectively. Later in the episode, [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon]] enters the running, his living head preserved in a glass jar and mounted on [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]'s previously [[pawnbroker|pawned]] body.&lt;ref name="Drawn to TV"&gt;{{cite book| last=Booker| first=M. Keith |title=Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first Nixon's head is presented in a positive light, an effort by the writers to point out laudable elements of the real [[Richard Nixon]]'s political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=[[Futurama]] season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Head in the Polls]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=[on Leela's line about Nixon opening up relations with China] A positive comment about Richard Nixon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Cohen, David X |date=2002 |title=[[Futurama]] season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Head in the Polls]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=We went through everything about Nixon that we all remembered from about eighth grade history.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is soon revealed that Nixon's head has evil intentions, planning to "sell children's organs to zoos for meat" and "go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!" His campaign is almost undone after [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and Bender record his confession and use it to blackmail him into giving back Bender's body, but he wins by a single vote after overwhelming support from Earth's robotic voters in response to his [[Super Robot|colossal new robot body]].&lt;ref name="inverse" /&gt;

Nixon's head reappears as President of Earth in numerous subsequent episodes. Nixon runs for office a third time in "[[Decision 3012]]" against a candidate from the future, [[Chris Travers]], sent back to prevent Nixon from destroying the world with his political decisions (Nixon demands the candidate's "earth certificate", parodying the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|controversy over Barack Obama's birth certificate]]).&lt;ref name="decision3012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama: "Decision 3012" (7.3) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/06/futurama-decision-3012-73.html |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon loses, but this causes a time paradox causing his challenger to disappear, and he wins by default. Series creator [[Matt Groening]] has expressed pleasure at being able to continue poking fun at Nixon thirty or forty years after he was in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Space Pilot 3000]]"| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=If I could have known back then that in 1999 I would still get to make fun of [Nixon]...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's head's subsequent appearances in ''Futurama'' are often used for satirical humor. An example is the episode "[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]", where Nixon gives a $300 [[tax rebate]] to every Earthican, spoofing the rebate that was part of the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Cohen, David X |date=2003 |title=[[Futurama]] season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=At the time Eric Kaplan and I first met to discuss this episode, there was a very big story in the news that President George W. Bush had decided to refund $300 in tax money like this to all the taxpayers in America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other themes include voting and participating in the political process. In "[[A Head In The Polls]]", Fry debates  if he should vote, saying "like one vote ever made a difference” after which Leela tells him about a robot candidate who won an election by one vote.&lt;ref name="inverse" /&gt; Later in the episode, neither Fry, Bender, or Leela end up voting after Fry and Leela forgot Bender meanwhile cannot vote as he is a registered felon, and Nixon, with a "gigantic missile-firing bionic body" wins the presidency by one robot vote.

==Democratic Order of Planets (D.O.O.P.)==
The ''Futurama'' universe has a cooperative interplanetary organization known as the '''Democratic Order of Planets''' or '''D.O.O.P.'''.&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt; First mentioned in the episode "[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]", it is explored in more detail in "[[Brannigan Begin Again]]", in which it is compared to the present-day [[United Nations]] and the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] from ''[[Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref name="Drawn to TV" /&gt; The D.O.O.P. flag is styled on the [[flag of the United Nations]] with two olive branches representing peace, replacing the globe image with an atom diagram with the word [[Ambigram|"doop"]] in lowercase in the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/fic%5Efutr.html |title=Flags of the World: Futurama (television series)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.O.O.P. maintains a military capability, most often led by Zapp Brannigan. The typography of D.O.O.P. is identical to that used by the [[Doop (band)|one-hit wonder of the same name]]. Combating this group are a "rampaging alien race" that wants to take over Earth for commercial purposes named the Omicronians.&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt;

==Environmentalism==
Episodes with environmental themes include "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]", "[[The Problem with Popplers]]", "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]", "[[Crimes of the Hot]]", "[[Fun on a Bun]]", "[[Attack of the Killer App]]" (partially), and "[[Fry Am the Egg Man]]."

Former [[Vice President of the United States]] and prominent [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] [[Al Gore]] is a recurring guest star, due in part to his daughter [[Kristin Gore]]'s involvement in the show as a staff writer and story editor. He has appeared as himself in story segments set in the early 21st century ("[[Anthology of Interest I]]" and ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'') and as his own head in a jar in the 31st century ("[[Crimes of the Hot]]" and ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''). His portrait also adorns the $500 bill (written prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2000|controversial election in 2000]]), and he is described as the "inventor of the environment, and first "[[Emperor]] of the [[Moon]]."

===Global warming===
The episode "[[Crimes of the Hot]]" centers around the issue of [[global warming]]. The temporary solution of cooling the Earth with giant ice cubes dropped periodically into the ocean is no longer possible because [[Halley's Comet]], the source of the ice, has been mined completely hollow. At a scientific conference, led by Al Gore, Professor Farnsworth reveals that beer-powered robots, including Bender, are the source of current global warming, and President Nixon and Professor Wernstrom attempt to destroy all robots on Earth by tricking them to convene on the Galapagos Islands for a party, and then bathe the islands in electromagnetic waves from a satellite in space. Fry, Leela, and Farnsworth arrive in time, and Farnsworth tells every robot to aim their exhaust ports upward and expel their gasses, creating a makeshift engine that pushes Earth away from the sun, thus cooling Earth and causing the electromagnetic beams to miss.  
The episode was nominated for the [[Environmental Media Award]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="ema-online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema-online.org/awards_13th_annual.php |title=Thirteenth Annual Media Awards |publisher=Environmental Media Association |year=2003 |accessdate=2007-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213211900/http://www.ema-online.org/awards_13th_annual.php |archivedate=2009-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Gore's appearance in the episode was also listed as one of the 20 best animated politicians by ''The Phoenix''.&lt;ref name="Phoenix" /&gt;

[[Al Gore]]'s involvement with the show continued after it was cancelled in 2003. In promoting the documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', the producers of ''Futurama'' were approached to make a short animated trailer, starring Al Gore and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]. This trailer was released online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXP8Qwp5JRk |title=A Terrifying Message from Al Gore |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is included as an extra on the DVD of ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'', with a commentary track by Al Gore, David X. Cohen and Series creator [[Matt Groening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=19939 |title=Toon Zone: "Futurama: Bender's Big Score" Still a Winner for Casual Fans |last=Liu |first=Ed |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2007-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126005529/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=19939 |archivedate=2007-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''An Inconvenient Truth'' used a clip from the episode "Crimes of the Hot" to humorously explain how global warming works.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/0915/1158001563481.html |title=YOU GO, GORE |publisher=The Irish Times |date=September 15, 2006 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Xmas Story]]" Leela explains that snow still exists in the future because, even though global warming occurred, "[[nuclear winter]] canceled it out."

===Conservationism===
The episode "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]" tackles the issues of [[pollution]] and its effect on wildlife. In a parody of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|Exxon ''Valdez'' oil spill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Cohen, David X |date=2003 |title=[[Futurama]] season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=I like the idea that it was like the Exxon Valdez, except Bender crashed it because he ''wasn't'' drinking.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tanker spaceship  (piloted by a sober Bender) spills its cargo of "[[dark matter]] oil" on a [[penguin]] colony on [[Pluto]]. The dark matter actually functioned as an [[aphrodisiac]], or as the environmentalist puts it "a Penguin [[Spanish fly]]", so rather than killing the penguin population, the pollution vastly increases the speed and rate of their breeding, as even the males were producing eggs. This leads the conservationists, who originally set out to save the wildlife and clean up the oil spill, to resort to [[hunting]] the penguins to prevent them starving from [[Overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]]. The episode's stance on the issue of hunting was influenced by some of the writers on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which has also presented multiple viewpoints on controversial issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2003 |title=[[Futurama]] season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=One thing which I heard from some of the senior writers of ''The Simpsons'' when I used to work there was that if you discuss a real topic like this on the show, it works much better if you give both sides a somewhat reasonable argument at the base of it...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode "[[The Problem with Popplers]]" addresses conservationism in a similar fashion: it focuses primarily on the [[animal rights movement]], parodying [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment (M.E.A.T.) a vegan activist group that, among other things, attempt to teach carnivorous animals to eat tofu. This episode won an [[Environmental Media Award]] in 2000.

The ''Futurama'' movie ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder|Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'' showcases the fight between conservationism and the interests of big business; the construction of the universe's largest giant [[mini golf]] course (headed by Amy's father, Leo Wong) threatens to destroy 12% (an entire branch) of the [[Milky Way]]. An environmental survey headed by [[Professor Farnsworth]] and the ''Futurama'' crew discovers an asteroid full of primitive life, orbiting a violet dwarf star. However, Farnsworth has been bribed by Leo, and declares the destruction 'environmentally friendly', leading to plans for the dwarf star to be imploded, creating a black hole. This leads to two groups trying to sabotage this plan – a group of [[Eco-feminism|eco-feminists]], who are joined by [[Amy (Futurama)|Amy]], [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and [[LaBarbara Conrad]], who start destroying equipment, machines and sections of the golf course, and even accidentally kill Nixon's beloved vice-president, Agnew. The second group is the Legion of Madfellows, a secret organization of mind readers, of which [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]] joins. They prophesize a new green age, headed by a resurgence in the life force Chi, which they believe will be started by the asteroid and the dwarf star. A resurgence in the Chi would halt the extinction rate, and increase the diversity of life by preserving endangered species DNA and reintroducing extinct life forms through the Encyclopod. Fry is given the responsibility to preserve and protect it at all costs.

==Social and other issues==
The episode "[[Proposition Infinity]]" depicts an attempt to legalize "robosexual marriage," or marriage between robots and humans, after Bender and Amy fall in love. It closely parodies the events surrounding, as well as arguments for and against, [[Proposition 8]] of [[California]] from the 2008 election. Ultimately, "robosexual marriage" is legalized with this "future civil rights movement."&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite news |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |title=In 'Futurama,' robots follow 'Bender's Law,' not Asimov's |work=[[CNet]] |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/in-futurama-robots-follow-benders-law-not-asimovs/ |date=2013-09-12 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Futurama episodes there is a theme of, as Series creator [[Matt Groening]] put it in 1999, a "corporate, commercial, confusing world where the military is just as stupid as it is currently" with a "corrupt megacorporation" named MomCorp which is run by a "scrawny elderly woman" who is very rich "from manufacturing Mom's Old-Fashioned Robot Oil." &lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Wired |title=One-Eyed Aliens! Suicide Booths! Mom’s Old-Fashioned Robot Oil! |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/1999/02/futurama/ |date=1999-02-01|accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is expanded by characters being "thoroughly inundated by advertising, especially subliminal advertising that comes out of your pillow into your dreams" and having "ridiculous-but-cool tech gadgets" that don't work as they were expected to, not improving the economy.&lt;ref name="washpo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Basulto |first=Dominic |title=The Jetsons vs. Futurama: Which one will be our innovation future? |work=[[Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2013/08/16/the-jetsons-vs-futurama-which-one-will-be-our-innovation-future/ |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, people are tested to find out what they would be "best at in life," as shown in "[[Space Pilot 3000]]" and other episodes, a choice that Bender, Fry, and other characters reject, wanting to "go against their programming, whether or not they will be successful."&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;

The show also criticized [[jingoism]] in "[[A Taste Of Freedom]]", lampooned groups like [[Parents Television Council]] and Parents Against Media Violence with groups like "Fathers Against Rude Television" and criticized the [[Star system (filmmaking)|star system]] in "[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV]]" and "[[Calculon 2.0]]" while addressing the controversy around [[genetically-modified]] food in "[[Leela and the Genestalk]]".&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite news |last=Handlen |first=Zack |title=Futurama: "A Taste Of Freedom"/"Bender Should Not Be Allowed On Television" |work=[[The A.V.

Elsewhere in the show, the place of robots in human society and [[sentient]] robots are also addressed as issues which fit with the [[science fiction]] genre.&lt;ref name="cnet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paste3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama: "31st Century Fox"/"Naturama" (6.12/6.13) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/08/futurama-31st-century-foxnaturama-612613.html |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paste4"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama: "Free Will Hunting" (Episode 7.9) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/08/futuram-free-will-hunting-79.html |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paste5"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama: "The Bots and the Bees"/"A Farewell to Arms" (7.1 &amp; 7.2) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/06/futurama-the-bots-and-the-beesa-farewell-to-arms-7.html |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paste6"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama Review: "Overclockwise" (6.25) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/09/futurama-review-overclockwise-625.html |date=2011-09-11 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than this, numerous episodes address the themes of time travel, including "[[Mobius Dick]]", "[[All the Presidents' Heads]]", "[[Roswell That Ends Well]]" and "[[Space Pilot 3000]]", plagiarism and exploitation in "[[Yo Leela Leela]]", and 3-D printing in "[[Forty Percent Leadbelly]]". Additionally, in "[[The Mutants Are Revolting]]", the "mutants" engage in a revolution to demand their rights to live on the surface, an event which may reference the [[Stonewall riots]].

'''''Prison Legal News'' (PLN)''' is a monthly [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] and on-line periodical published since May 1990. ''Prison Legal News'' (PLN) primarily reports on criminal justice issues and prison and jail-related civil litigation, mainly in the United States. It is a project of the [[Human Rights Defense Center]] (HRDC), a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1. https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/FAQ.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

''Prison Legal News'' is the longest running newspaper produced by and for current and former prisoners in U.S history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2006/jun/15/the-decline-and-fall-of-the-prison-press/&lt;/ref&gt;

PLN covers all aspects of the criminal justice system, including court access, prison conditions, privatization, disciplinary hearings, excessive force, mail censorship, jails, wrongful convictions, crime labs, visitation, prison phone services, immigration detention, religious freedom, free speech, prison rape, abuse of women prisoners, retaliation, the [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA), medical treatment, [[Infectious diseases within American prisons|HIV and hepatitis C]], [[prison slave labor]], [[Felony disenfranchisement|disenfranchisement]], the death penalty and control units/[[supermax]] facilities. However, the mainstay of PLN's coverage from the beginning has been the issue of conditions of confinement.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2. PLN May 2010, Vol. 21, No. 5 page 3 https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/22305_displayArticle.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

==Origins and function==

''Prison Legal News'' was inspired by the need for prisoners and their families to have a voice in criminal justice policy and to provide timely, accurate news about justice-related issues and progressive reform efforts. PLN has been admired and disliked for its strong advocacy of prisoner rights, including its extensive litigation involving jails and prison systems.

As of February 2017, PLN had an average circulation of over 9,000 hardcopy issues per month. About 70% of PLN's subscribers are state and federal prisoners, and PLN has incarcerated subscribers in all fifty states&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/annualreports/HRDC%202014%20annual%20report%20FINAL_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on PLN's media pack, each subscriber's magazine is read by an average of almost 10 people, so PLN's monthly readership is around 90,000&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/annualreports/HRDC%202014%20annual%20report%20FINAL_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As of February 2017, subscriptions were $30/year for prisoners, $35/year for non-incarcerated individuals and $90/year for attorneys, government agencies and corporations.

The PLN website has over 18,000 news and law articles in its database.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/annualreports/HRDC%202014%20annual%20report%20FINAL_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The publication section has more than 5,600 reports, audits and other documents related to criminal justice topics, and the brief bank contains over 7,500 assorted legal pleadings - including complaints, motions, appeal briefs, verdicts, judgments and settlements in prison and jail cases.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/annualreports/HRDC%202014%20annual%20report%20FINAL_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The site receives over 150,000 visitors each month and also functions as a resource for media and community outreach as well as a platform for public education on criminal justice issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/annualreports/HRDC%202014%20annual%20report%20FINAL_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A website subscription is $149.95/year and gives full access to all of PLN's online content.

''Prison Legal News'' also publishes and distributes legal reference and self-help educational books&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ranging from their own in-house-published ''The Habeas Citebook: Ineffective Assistance of Counsel'' by Brandon Sample&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the ''Prison Education Guide''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Federal-Prison-Handbook-Definitive-Surviving/dp/0692799737|title=Federal Prison Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Surviving the Federal Bureau of Prisons|last=Zoukis|first=Christopher|date=2017-01-22|publisher=Middle Street Publishing|isbn=9780692799734|edition= 1st|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''by'' Christopher Zoukis,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to the Nolo legal how-to series, the ''Prisoners' Self-Help Litigation Manual''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the ''Federal Prison Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Federal-Prison-Handbook-Definitive-Surviving/dp/0692799737|title=Federal Prison Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Surviving the Federal Bureau of Prisons|last=Zoukis|first=Christopher|date=March 14, 2018|website=Amazon|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLN also distributes (free upon request) the ''Prisoner Diabetes Handbook'', and is the exclusive distributor of ''Protecting Your Health &amp; Safety: A Litigation Guide for Inmates'', a book published by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the monthly magazine and website, PLN has published three anthologies related to mass incarceration: ''The Celling of America: An Inside Look at the U.S Prison Industry'' (Common Courage Press, 1997); ''Prison Nation: The Warehousing of America's Poor (Routledge)'' (2003); and ''Prison Profiteers: Who makes Money from Mass Imprisonment'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/faq/#faq-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==

''PLN'' has been involved in litigation concerning First Amendment and censorship issues in the prison and jail context since 1994. Co-editor Ed Mead was prevented from assisting in publishing'' Prison Legal News'' due to a condition of his parole prohibiting association with other felons – a policy specifically enacted to prevent Mead from further involvement with PLN.&lt;ref&gt;''Mead v. ISRB'', USDC (W.D. Wash.), Case No. 3:94-cv-00529.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, PLN, represented by the ACLU of Washington, joined with other publishers and prisoner plaintiffs in a suit challenging the state of Washington DOC's wide-ranging censorship of incoming mail, publications and mail classifications, among other issues. The lawsuit was settled in 2000, with the state agreeing to change its censorship policies and pay the plaintiffs' attorney fees and costs.&lt;ref&gt;''Humanists of Washington v. Lehman'', USDC (W.D. Wash.), Case No. 3:97-cv-05499-FDB-JKA.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prison Legal News'' obtained a [[preliminary injunction]] against the Nevada DOC's statewide ban on PLN, followed by a consent decree in which the DOC agreed to pay damages and change its policies concerning mail and publications. The matter was settled in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;''PLN v. Crawford'', USDC (D. Nev.), Case No. 3:00-cv-00373-HDM-RAM.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supermax ADX prison]], run by the federal Bureau of Prisons, enacted a policy banning all books related to prisons and prisoners. PLN filed suit in 2003 and withdrew the lawsuit in 2005 after the ADX mooted the claim by changing its unconstitutional policy.&lt;ref&gt;''PLN v. Hood'', USDC (D. Col.), Case No. 1:03-cv-02516.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''PLN'' and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) settled the magazine's claims that CDCR mail policies violated a number of federal and state rights, under precedents established by ''PLN.'' As a result of the settlement, CDCR ordered five-year subscriptions to ''PLN'' for all of its facilities and is being monitored by ''PLN'' for compliance.&lt;ref&gt;''PLN v. Schwarzenegger'', 561 F.Supp.2d 1095 (N.D. Cal. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, PLN settled with the State of New York, reversing a statewide ban on the magazine in New York prisons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Words-land-behind-bars-3745178.php]&lt;/ref&gt; That year, it also settled with [[Berkeley County, South Carolina]], reaching the largest ever jail-related censorship settlement in the United States, totaling almost $600,000 in damages and attorney fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlg-npap.org/news/prison-legal-news-settles-censorship-suit-against-berkeley-county-detention-center]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] joined PLN in its lawsuit against the unconstitutional mail policies enacted by Berkeley County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/prisonlegalnews_briefinsupportPI_05-23-11.pdf], Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, PLN settled a case with the U.S Department of Homeland Security after PLN filed a FOIA request for records related to telephone services and other documents concerning the ability of immigration prisoners to communicate with people outside the Northwest Detention Center in [[Tacoma, Washington]]; this is operated by the [[GEO Corporation]], a private for-profit company.&lt;ref&gt;''PLN v. U.S Dept. of Homeland Sec.'' Case No. C14-479 MJP.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to battling unconstitutional censorship through litigation (see the May 2010 issue of PLN for a full listing of cases),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/22305_displayArticle.asp] x&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prison Legal News'' has also filed numerous lawsuits related to public records and [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests in order to pursue its investigative reporting on detention facility issues.

These cases have led to landmark rulings. including ''PLN v. Washington Department of Corrections'', 115 P.3d 316 (Wash. 2005). At the time it was the largest penalty and attorney fee payout in a Washington state public records case in history and disclosed serious misconduct among Washington prison doctors.

*''PLN v. Lappin'' held that PLN was entitled to fee waivers in Freedom of Information Act requests where the information sought would educate the public about government operations. ''PLN v. Lappin'', 436 F. Supp.2d 17 (D DC 2006). Additional cases include: ''PLN v. The [[GEO Group]], Inc.'', Circuit Court of the 15th Judicial Circuit of Florida, Case No. 50 2005 CA 011195 AA; ''Friedmann v. CCA'', Chancery Court for Davidson County (TN), Case No. 01-1105-I; and ''PLN v. EOUSA'', USDC (D. Col.), Case No. 1:08-cv-01055-MSK.

== Developments and advocacy==

Founded as Prisoners Legal News, in 2009 PLN's parent organization was renamed as the Human Rights Defense Center. It is a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the human rights of people held in U.S. detention facilities. HRDC also supports ''Prison Legal News'' in national campaigns in coordination with other advocacy groups 1) to lower prison phone rates;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afro.com/sections/news/afro_briefs/story.htm?storyid=76718]&lt;/ref&gt; 2) to demand transparency and accountability of private prison contractors,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/05/ex-con-alex-friedmann-cca-private-prison-rape], ''Mother Jones'', May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and with numerous other activities related to the human rights of prisoners.

PLN's editor and managing editor are former prisoners. The magazine features contributions from nationally recognized scholars and activists involved in criminal justice reform or advocacy efforts. Contributors include [[Mumia Abu-Jamal|Mumia Abu Jamal]],&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Jamal, Mumia, "Prison Legal News at 15", ''Prison Legal News,'' July 2005, Vol. 16, No.7, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam, "Drug Policy as Social Control," ''Prison Legal News,'' May 1997, Vol. 8, No.5, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Marie Gottschalk,&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, Marie, "Days Without End: Life Sentences and Penal Reform," ''Prison Legal News,'' Jan. 2012, Vol.23, No. 1, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Prison Policy Initiative Director Peter Wagner,&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Peter, "Ending Prison-Based Gerrymandering", ''Prison Legal News,'' Dec. 2012, Vol.23, No.12, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Prison Law Office Director Donald Specter&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Donald, "Everything Revolves Around Overcrowding: The State of California's Prisons," ''Prison Legal News,'' Aug. 2010, Vol. 21, No.8, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and ACLU National Prison Project Director David Fathi,&lt;ref&gt;Fathi, David, "The New Asylum: Supermax as Warehouse for the Mentally Ill," ''Prison Legal News'', July 2007, Vol.18, No.7, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and Christopher Zoukis, founder of PrisonEducation.com and PrisonerResource.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prisonerresource.com|title=Zoukis Prisoner Resources|last=Zoukis|first=Christopher|date=March 14, 2018|website=PrisonerResource.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of PLN's content is written by current and former prisoners.

'''Shadow marks'''  are a form of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] feature visible from the air. Unlike [[cropmarks]], [[frost marks]] and [[soil mark]]s they require upstanding features to work and are therefore more commonly seen in the context of extant sites rather than previously undiscovered buried ones.

They are caused by the differences in height on the ground produced by archaeological remains. In the case of ancient, eroded [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] these differences are often small and they are most apparent when viewed from the air, when the sun is low in the sky. This causes long shadows to be cast by the higher features, which are illuminated from one side by the sun, with dark shadows marking hollows and depressions.

Shadow marks are best viewed obliquely rather than from directly above in order to emphasise the effect of the shadows.

Artificial shadow marks can be created easily by constructing a virtual [[3D model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite04.htm|title=3D Kite aerial photography and other techniques.|accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a site by merging aerial images (pole, kite etc.) and then vectoring in a virtual light source. Such an applied lighting can be animated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/stninianani.mp4|title=Animated virtual 3D model of St. Ninian's Chapel, Bute.  |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Underwater Historical Research''' (SUHR) was an amateur [[maritime archaeology]] organisation operating in [[South Australia]] (SA). It was formed in 1974 by [[Recreational diving|recreational scuba divers]] and other persons to pursue an interest in [[maritime archaeology]] and [[maritime history]]. The SUHR was renamed as the [[South Australian Archaeology Society]] in March 2012 as part of a plan to expand its activities beyond maritime archaeology to include other archaeological disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Steve; (2012) 'Club News' in ''SDF News Sheet – June 2012” (Scuba Divers Federation of South Australia), at http://www.sdfsa.net/newsletters/2012/2012-06-News-Sheet.pdf, retrieved 11/06/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The SUHR was founded in September 1974 by recreational scuba divers principally from the Underwater Explorers Club of South Australia (UEC) and [[Professional diving|occupational scuba divers]] from government agencies such as the [[South Australian Museum]] and the [[South Australia Police|South Australian Police]], as well as a number of individuals interested in [[maritime history]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock, A.E., 1977, ‘The Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia’, In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, ''Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology'', Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Jeffery  | first =B.  | author-link =   | title =South Australian Maritime Heritage Program 1970s – 2002 Projects, Activities and Bibliography

The origin of the SUHR is due in part to the positive public response to the aftermath of a successful expedition in 1973 to locate and recover 2 [[anchor]]s discarded during 1803 by the [[HMS Investigator (1798)|HMS ''Investigator'']] whilst under the command of [[Matthew Flinders]] off the coast of what is now Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, A.E., 1977, ‘The Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia’, In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, ''Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology'', Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recovery of the anchors and their connection to the voyage of the HMS ''Investigator'' is commemorated in the inclusion of the best bower anchor and the outline of the Australian continent on the SUHR emblem.&lt;ref&gt;‘Second Annual Report, September 1976’, pp.2, in Cowan, David (editor), (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
After its formation in 1974, the SUHR was initially managed by a committee consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and the following specialist officers – Research Officer, Registrar of Relics (added in 1976), an officer to liaise with the responsible part of the South Australian Government which was initially the South Australian Museum, and an officer to liaise with the South Australian Police Force (removed in 1978). By the late 1970s, it had evolved into a project-based organisation whose work consisted of activities such as planning, research, exploration, logistics, photography, survey and the publication of reports. Activities such as recovery and conservation, while historically significant, ceased to be carried out in the late 1980s except where permitted by archaeological practice.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, David; (2007), 'About the SUHR', in Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'' , Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA. pages 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1982, a group within the membership who were unhappy with the increasing level of professionalization, resigned and founded a competing organisation known as the [[Nautical Archaeology Association of South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Letter to Society for Underwater Historical Research Committee’ in the SUHR Newsletter for April 1982, Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Minutes of the General Meeting held … on Tuesday 27 April 1982’ in SUHR Newsletter for May 1982, Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'' , Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, after nearly a decade of stagnation, new life was breathed in the organisation via new funding opportunities and interest in membership from undergraduate and postgraduate archaeology students.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, N. &amp; Lewczak, C., (2002), ''Back to the Bay: An overview of the Holdfast Bay Project 1974-2000 and the reinvigoration of avocational maritime archaeology in South Australia'', Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology Vol. 26, pp. 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superfest is held over a weekend and is considered more of a cultural event than a film festival.&lt;ref name="Festreview"/&gt;

==  History ==
The Superfest International Disability Film Festival began in [[Los Angeles]] in 1970 as a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting films representing the diverse disability community. At that time, Superfest was a small film showcase and not yet considered a film festival.&lt;ref name="Marvelous"/&gt; In 1982, Culture! Disability! Talent! (CDT) took over operations of Superfest. In 1995, CDT decided to move Superfest from Los Angeles to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Berkeley is significant to the [[disability rights movement]] and [[independent living movement|independent living]].&lt;ref name="Marvelous"/&gt;

In 1998, Superfest expanded to encompass the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Festreview"/&gt; Annual film festivals were held in Berkeley from 1998 to 2011. In 2009, Superfest held a commemorative two-day program featuring 13 disability films the committee considered classics of disability in film called Superfest Classics.&lt;ref name="Classics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Descriptions of Superfest Classics|url=http://culturedisabilitytalent.org/superfest/sf2009.html|website=Internet Archive: Culture! Disability! Talent!|accessdate=30 January 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325114140/http://culturedisabilitytalent.org/superfest/sf2009.html|archivedate=March 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Superfest expanded to a two-day festival and recognized the 25th anniversary of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] being signed into legislation.&lt;ref name="Kazakstan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Jonathan|title=Op-Ed: Films as far away as Kazakstan will premiere at Superfest|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/arts/op-ed-films-as-far-away-as-kazakstan-will-premiere-at-superfest/article/447913|website=Digital Journal|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the beginnings as a grass-roots organization, Superfest has not been able to have a film festival each year since its founding. The 2016 festival was their 30th film festival.&lt;ref name="Celebrates"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gar|title=Movies in the Margin: The Disability Film Festival, the UN Film Festival, and Films on Fracking|url=http://berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2016-10-21/article/45035|website=The Berkeley Daily Planet|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dissies==
In 2013, Superfest presented a special event. This event was to highlight films where disability had been mocked or portrayed in an insensitive manner.&lt;ref name="Dissies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=James|title=Film event highlights 'disses' of disabled|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=69162|website=The Bay Area Reporter|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of films where disability is mocked are referred to as disability snub films.&lt;ref name="Dark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cipriani|first1=Belo|title=Seeing in the Dark: Film festival celebrates disability|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=72012|website=The Bay Area Reporter|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dissies" mirror the [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzies]], where the award given is not an honor at all. Each year, a new "Dissie" is awarded from films nominated by the community. Mock "Dissie" awards are given each year to disability snub films.&lt;ref name="Comedic"/&gt;

'''''The Hired Hand: An African-American Folktale''''' is a 1997 book by [[Robert D. San Souci]] and illustrator [[Jerry Pinkney]] based on an African American folktale about an itinerant worker who is able to rejuvenate and resurrect people.

==Reception==
A review of ''The Hired Hand'' by ''[[BookList]]'' wrote "He [Pinkney] successfully blends historically realistic details with timeless folkloric magic, and he enhances San Souci's smooth retelling in the process. An obvious choice for primary story hours, this will also make a welcome addition to African American folklore and history units.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/925574/Reviews#tabnav |title=The hired hand : an African-American folktale |website=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Manipulated Man''''' ({{lang-de|Der Dressierte Mann}}) is a 1971 book by author [[Esther Vilar]]. The main idea behind the book is that women are not oppressed by men but rather control men to their advantage. A third edition of the book was released in January 2009.

==Synopsis==

The book argues that, contrary to common [[feminist]] and [[women's rights]] rhetoric, women in industrialized cultures are not oppressed, but rather exploit a well-established system of manipulating men.

Vilar writes, "Men have been trained and conditioned by women, not unlike the way Pavlov conditioned his dogs, into becoming their slaves. As compensation for their labours men are given periodic use of a woman's vagina." The book contends that young boys are encouraged to associate their masculinity with their ability to be sexually intimate with a woman, and that a woman can control a man by socially empowering herself to be the gate-keeper to his sense of masculinity. Vilar states that this has been going on for some time.

The author says that [[Gender role|social definitions and norms]], such as the idea that women are weak, are constructed by women with their needs in mind.  Vilar explains how it works: if women are viewed as weak, less is expected of them; and therefore they are given more leeway in society than men.  Vilar states that women are generally "gold diggers" who attempt to extract money and other material resources from men. One means by which women control men to effect this transfer of resources is praise. Women dole out praise to men only when their needs are met in some way.

Another means of manipulation is the calculated use of emotional displays. Vilar claims that women can control their emotional reactions whereas men cannot, and that women create overly-dramatized emotional reactions to get their way: they "blackmail" men emotionally. Women also use sex as a tool of manipulation and control but also traditional concepts of love and romance, which are seen more positively than sex, to control men's sexual lives. Vilar writes that men gain nothing from marriage and that women coerce them into it under the pretense that it fulfills their romantic desires.

The book closes with Vilar stating that it would be difficult to change the situation by appealing to women, as women are unsympathetic to the plight of men, and unwilling to give up their comfortable position in society.  It is up to men to see past the deception and emotional blackmail and 
subject it to open criticism before any meaningful changes can occur.

==Critical reception==
''The Manipulated Man'' was quite popular at the time of its release, in part due to the considerable press coverage it received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ardmediathek.de/ard/servlet/content/3517136?documentId=4840682 E. Vilar, "Der dressierte Mann", radio-interview (in german)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503171900/http://www.ardmediathek.de/ard/servlet/content/3517136?documentId=4840682 |date=2012-05-03 }} [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], November 7, 1971. Retrieved in December 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vilar appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on February 21, 1973, to discuss her book. In 1975 she was invited to a televised debate&lt;ref&gt;Excerpts from the debate can be seen in the documentary about [[Alice Schwarzer]], available in the "Deutschland - Lenker und Gestalter" series of 12 DVDs released in Germany, and in a recent Schwarzer interview aired in September 27, 2011, and available in the [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] website. The full-42 minute debate can be obtained directly from [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] in DVD [http://www.wdrmg.de/mitschnitt/ here].&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] with [[Alice Schwarzer]], who was considered as the leading representative of the women's movement in Germany at that time. The debate provoked controversy, in particular for its high degree of aggression. At one point, for example, Schwarzer claimed Vilar was&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41559127.html Im Clinch (in german)] [[Der Spiegel]], February 10, 1975. Retrieved December 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; "not only sexist, but fascist", and compared her book with the Nazi newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2005/25/Schwarzer_25 Frau gegen Frau (in german)] [[Die Zeit]], June 16, 2005. Retrieved December 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vilar stated that she received death threats over the book: "So I hadn't imagined broadly enough the isolation I would find myself in after writing this book. Nor had I envisaged the consequences which it would have for subsequent writing and even for my private life—violent threats have not ceased to this date.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Vilar, ''The Manipulated Man'', revised edition, August 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sales==
According to research from the Spanish Book Institute, the Spanish translated version (under the title ''El Varón Domado'') was the third-most popular book sold in Spain in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[[Folha de S.Paulo]], [http://acervo.folha.com.br/fsp/1976/01/28/21/4278148 Ilustrada, p.5, January 28, 1976 (in Portuguese)] - Retrieved December 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transcreation''' is a term used chiefly by [[advertising]] and [[marketing]] professionals to refer to the process of adapting a message from one language to another, while maintaining its intent, style, tone, and context. A successfully transcreated message evokes the same [[Emotion|emotions]] and carries the same implications in the target language as it does in the source language. Increasingly, transcreation is used in [[global marketing]] and advertising campaigns as advertisers seek to transcend the boundaries of [[culture]] and [[language]]. It also takes account of images which are used within a creative message, ensuring that they are suitable for the target local market.

Terms with meanings similar to transcreation include ‘creative [[translation]]’, ‘cross-market [[copywriting]]’, ‘international copy adaptation’, ‘free-style translation‘, ‘marketing translation’, ‘internationalization’, ‘localization’, and ‘cultural adaptation’. For each of these words and phrases, the aim is similar: taking the essence of a message and re-creating it in another language and/or dialect.

==Background==

Transcreation is a relatively new term and its precise meaning is still being defined. In 2000 the term was registered as UK Trademark No. 2222617 by United Publicity Services Plc; this registration as a trademark expired in February 2010.

When first used in the 1960s and 1970s transcreation was a term coined to describe the translation of creative ad copy. UPS Translations (now part of Intonation Translations&lt;ref&gt;https://www.intonation.co.uk/en/news/intonation-acquires-ups-translations%21&lt;/ref&gt;) subsequently developed the term into a specific process for tackling the translation of highly creative language, rather than merely a general term to describe creative translations.

An alternative explanation of the etymology of transcreation is it is thought by some to have originated in the computer and video game industry in the 1980s. According to this view, early manufacturers found that merely translating the words (written and spoken) used in the games was not sufficient to satisfy the majority of users in targeted markets. To make the games more enjoyable and relevant to users in different cultures, the makers began to tailor images and modify story lines to match the culture and expectations of those users.&lt;ref name="Common Sense Advisory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/Portals/_default/Knowledgebase/ArticleImages/100331_R_Transcreation_Preview.pdf
 |title=Reaching New Markets Through Transcreation |publisher=Common Sense Advisory |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, marketers and advertising agencies with international accounts began using the term transcreation to distinguish their work in this field from translation. The implication is that, when bringing an existing advertising campaign to a market outside the source language, much more is needed than a translation.

Transcreation is now a mainstream term in the Anglophone advertising and translation community. The American market research company, Common Sense Advisory, one of the major publishers of industry references for language service providers (LSPs), has recently published a large selection of articles featuring transcreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/Home.aspx |title=Common Sense Advisory |publisher= Common Sense Advisory |year=2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also recognized in Asian countries, including China. In 2010, the Chinese design and advertising publication, Modern Advertising Magazine, discussed the term in an article for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Modern Advertising |title= Textappeal: The Advantage of Talents |date=August 2010 |pages=20–21}} [http://textappeal.com/cultureshocks/textappeal-the-advantage-of-talents/ Translated article]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the concept of transcreation has taken hold, advertising agencies and marketers, realizing its importance, have added departments dedicated to this service. Also, companies have sprung up that specialize in transcreative projects. These companies produce no original copy themselves, but are rather hired by international marketers and their advertising agencies to perform the process.

An example of how the concept has permeated other spheres is the collaboration between Marvel Comics and Gotham Entertainment Group in 2004, to produce a comic book for the Indian market featuring an Indian-born Spider-Man whose “real” name is Pavitr Prabhakar. Thus, rather than battling the Green Goblin in the canyons of New York City, Prabhakar, clad in a dhoti, fights the demon Rahshasa against backdrops such as the Taj Mahal. "Unlike traditional translations of American comics, Spider-Man India will become the first-ever 'transcreation', where we reinvent the origin of a Western property," said Sharad Devarajan, the chief executive of the Gotham Entertainment Group.  The goal in this case closely matched that of cross-cultural marketers: to make Spider-Man more relevant to the Indian audience, establish a deeper emotional connection with readers, and thus sell more comic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Van Gelder |first=Lawrence |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/05/arts/arts-briefing.html?scp=2&amp;sq=transcreation&amp;st=cse |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 5 July 2004 |accessdate= 6 December 2011 |title=Arts Briefing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

Transcreation refers to the process of taking a message that was created in one language and conveying it in another language, without the loss of salience. While, in theory, any message is a candidate for transcreation, the bulk of transcreative work performed to date has been in the advertising industry in media such as brochures, TV and radio ads aimed at end clients, and posters and flyers distributed to resellers. Websites are also the subject of much transcreation.

As markets continue to broaden, advertisers face special challenges. To be effective, advertising must reach hearts as well as minds. Thus, the ability to transcend language and cultural boundaries is paramount to achieving an effective global marketing strategy.  Not only must copy be translated correctly, but other factors must also be considered, such as culture, mores, dialects, idiom, humor, and context. Any perceived lack of respect for heritage, local values, beliefs and cultures may have a negative impact on consumers.&lt;ref name=Pollak&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polak |first1=Elliot |last2=Cuttita |first2=Frank |title=Global Marketing Disasters and Recoveries |journal= Admap |issue= 470 |date=March 2006 |pages= 36–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To meet these challenges, companies that market internationally are increasingly using transcreation, whether via their advertising company or with a company specializing in transcreation.

The goal of transcreation is to transfer the intent, style, vocal tone, and emotional salience of the message from the source language to that of the targeted audience.&lt;ref name=Pb&gt;{{cite web |last=Balemans |first=Percy |url=http://pbtranslations.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/transcreation-translating-and-recreating/ |title= Transcreation: Translating and Recreating |work= Translating Is an Art |date= 14 July 2010 |accessdate= 16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process thus requires expertise in marketing, as well as linguistic skills and a firm grasp of targeted cultures.

Most transcreation is performed by in-market copywriters specializing in the practice. As is the case with translation, the work is performed by a person whose native language is that of the targeted audience.  To produce effective transcreation, local language copywriters need to have an extensive knowledge of their market, excellent language skills, and the ability to creatively adapt messages for their target market, all the while possessing skills in advertising copywriting.

Transcreation is used to market to different countries as well as different cultures within a country. Thus, the increasing Hispanic population in the U.S. provides many opportunities for same-country transcreation.

==Transcreation and translation==

Translation and transcreation are related processes, but they are not identical. Translation in the Western world has a centuries-long history and has been marked in practice by two “ideal” approaches – metaphrase (word-for-word translation) – and paraphrase (i.e. “say in other words”). Due to idiom and the wide variety of local usages, word-for-word translation has long been considered inadequate and the best translations take into account the vocabulary, grammar, syntax, idiom and local usage of the target audience while remaining faithful to the text, and context, of the original document.

Transcreation expands upon translation by focusing not so much on the literal text, but on discerning the emotional response by viewers in the source language and working to elicit the same response from viewers in the target market. It is about “taking a concept in one language, and completely recreating it in another.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articulatemarketing.com/translation-vs-transcreation |title=Translation vs. Transcreation |publisher=Bad Language |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absolute fidelity to the text is secondary to eliciting the desired emotional response by the target audience. Because differences between cultures are so numerous, eliciting the same emotional reaction may also necessitate changes in the context of the message.

Companies seeking to market a product across different languages and cultures have a spectrum of viable services from which to choose, ranging from mechanical translation on one end to the full resources of a multinational advertising agency on the other. Transcreation agencies, which add marketing and copywriting expertise to the translation process, lie at the center of this spectrum.  The right choice depends on the nature of the message, how it will be used to reach the target language, the marketing objective of the advertiser and the financial resources of the company requiring the service.

==Examples==

To market a contraceptive product for females to two separate populations – U.S. English-speakers and U.S. Latinas, a pharmaceutical company created an advertising campaign that looked and “felt” the same, but appealed in different ways to their targeted audiences. The main thrust for the English version was about convenience and that for the Spanish version was about freedom of choice. These choices reflected the transcreators’ research on what drives women in each demographic to choose contraceptive products.&lt;ref name="Common Sense Advisory"/&gt;

The computer chip-maker Intel wanted to bring its successful “Intel: Sponsors of Tomorrow” campaign to Brazilian markets, but research showed that “Sponsors of Tomorrow”, rendered in Portuguese, implies that Intel would not deliver on its promises immediately. The line was modified to read, in Portuguese, “Intel: In love with the future”, thus appealing to the presumed passionate nature of the target audience.

In the 1990s, the Swedish automobile manufacturer SAAB launched a new convertible model and, in the ensuing advertising campaign, wanted to establish the idea that the car allowed passengers to experience wide-open spaces. In the U.S., the ad’s headline read "Saab vs. Oxygen bars", because oxygen bars were popular in the U.S. at the time. In Sweden, where there were no oxygen bars, the same ad ran with the headline "SAAB vs. klaustrofobi". By substituting ‘oxygen bar’ with the Swedish word for claustrophobia, the transcreators changed the literal meaning of the message but appealed to the same emotions as did the U.S. ad.

==Avoiding the pitfalls of cross-cultural marketing==

Transcreation was developed to avoid many of the pitfalls inherent in cross-cultural marketing. Those include:

* Cultural differences. Cultural boundaries can be formidable barriers to communication. Mistakes here may damage the brand in ways that can be difficult to repair. In 2011, the German sportswear retailer Puma introduced a limited line of trainers clad in the colors of the United Arab Emirates’ flag, in honor of the UAE’s 40th National Day. Many Emiratis were highly distressed by this product, believing it trivialized their nation’s flag. Furthermore, in Arab culture, the shoe is considered dirty as it touches both the ground and the foot. As a result, Puma promptly withdrew the shoes from the market.
* Word usage. Mistakes as simple as using words that have different meanings in different languages can also lead to trouble. In a famous example, automobile manufacturer Honda introduced its model named “Fitta” into the Scandinavian countries and discovered, belatedly, that the word “fitta” is a vulgarity in many Nordic languages. The company renamed the model “Honda Jazz” and continued to market it there.
* Puns, idioms and slogans. As any translator knows only too well, wordplay and idiomatic speech are exceedingly difficult to bring from one language to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/transcreation-101 |title=Trancscreation101 |publisher=ititranslates.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for slogans, which, so familiar to a population’s ears, lose their literal meaning over time. In these instances, the transcreator must change the literal text, while attempting to create a similar effect on target audiences.

Not all cross-cultural marketing “disasters” are caused purely by poor research into the targeted market. To create “buzz”, some advertisers consciously “push the envelope” of what may be acceptable.  In 2011, the Italian clothing maker Benetton launched an ad campaign supporting the Unhate foundation, which featured images of world leaders kissing. Many of the unlikely pairings raised ire, but the strongest reaction was from the Vatican, which objected to a version of the ad featuring Pope Benedict XVI kissing Mohamed Ahmed al-Tayeb, the Grand Sheik of the al-Azhar mosque in Cairo. Though in this instance, Benetton pulled the ad immediately, the company has garnered praise, condemnation, and perhaps most importantly, widespread attention for [[shockvertising]].

==Maximizing cultural relevance==

Among the chief proponents of transcreation are local marketing managers, because dedication to this process frees them from having to accede to the dictates of copywriters who may be thousands of miles away and working in a completely different culture and language. (*)Transcreation allows local marketers to take the essence of a global advertising message and tailor it to their market. Thus, a global advertising campaign subjected to transcreation becomes more supple, while still adhering to an overall global strategy.

The tasks of a transcreator include establishing an emotional connection between the audience and the message, and maximizing cultural relevance.&lt;ref name="Kates&amp;Goh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kates |first1=Steven M. |last2=Goh |first2=Charlene |title=Brand Morphing: Implications for Advertising Theory and Practice |journal= Journal of Advertising |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=59–68 |issn=0091-3367 |jstor=4622150 |doi=10.1080/00913367.2003.10639049}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many factors may differ across cultural and linguistic boundaries and must be considered, as these differences can significantly  limit the effectiveness and impact of a cross-market campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffith |first1=David A. |last2=Chandra |first2=Aruna |last3=Ryans Jr. |first3=John K. |journal=Journal of International Marketing |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=30–47 |url=http://www.journals.marketingpower.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jimk.11.3.30.20160 |year=2003 |title=Examining the Intricacies of Promotion Standardization: Factors Influencing Advertising Message and Packaging |accessdate=16 September 2011 |doi=10.1509/jimk.11.3.30.20160}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors include cultural heritage, shared values, practices, and prevalent social cueing and reception thereof, including expression of emotions, gestures, body language, and facial expressions. These factors in turn influence consumers’ behavior and their reactions to advertising elements such as text, tone of voice, humor, settings, casting, and tonality.

There are also differences in how local consumers perceive a product. A product or service that is regarded as an everyday item in one country can be perceived as luxury in another, in which case, the advertising strategy needs to be adjusted accordingly. Products may also have varied development paces. For example, the development of mobile telecommunications markets has been quicker in Asia than in Western Europe.

Some or all of these factors may be multiplied by the number of sub-cultures within the targeted country. The difficulty of honing the message may be exacerbated by the degree of variance among these subcultures. Transcreators must also take into account local advertising regulations, media environments, and commercial codes. The key figure in bringing attention to bear on all of these concerns is the local marketing manager, who is familiar with the global brand, and has intimate knowledge of the target audience.

==Market growth==

In 1960, international billings accounted for 6% of the gross revenues of the top ten U.S. advertising agencies. By 1991, that share had climbed to 60%, and it has been rising ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Ducoffe, Robert, and Andreas Grein. 1998. “Strategic Responses to market globalization among advertising agencies”. International Journal of Advertising 17 (3). 301–319.&lt;/ref&gt;, in line with the “think global; act local” principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Greg |journal=Journal of International Marketing |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=13–30 |title=International Advertising Standardization: What Do the Multinationals Actually Standardize? |year= 1994 |issn=1069-031X |jstor=25048564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vrontis |first1=Dmetris |last2=Thrassou |first2=Alkis |journal=Journal of Innovative Marketing |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=7–21 |url=https://unic.academia.edu/DemetrisVrontis/Papers/359731/Adaptation_Vs._Standardization_In_International_Marketing-The_Country-of-Origin_Effect |title= Adaptation vs. Standardisation in International Marketing- The Country-of-origin Effect |issn=1814-2427 |accessdate= 16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mousai Helikon Staatliche Antikensammlungen Schoen80 full.jpg|thumb|150px|Lyre-playing Muse seated on a rock labeled ''ΗΛΙΚΟΝ'', Helicon ([[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic]] [[White ground technique|white-ground]] [[lekythos]], 440–430 BC )]]

The '''Valley of the Muses''' was the site of an ancient Greek sanctuary to the Muses and the ''Mouseia'' festivals held in their honor. It is an open-air historical site open permanently to the public. It is located at [[Thespiae|Thespies]] on the eastern slopes of [[Mount Helicon]] in [[Boeotia]], Greece.

==History==
The recorded history of the valley began in the 6th century BC. Its greatest period started in the 3rd century BC with the establishment of the ''Mouseia'' festivals (Grk ''Μουσεῖα''), organised every fifth year by the [[Thespiae|Thespians]]. Poets and musicians from all over [[Greece]] participated in various games. In the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, games in honor of the Roman emperor were added. From that time the emperors sponsored the festivals, which were then called "Great Kaisareia" (Grk ''Μεγάλα Καισάρεια'') because the emperor was honored over the [[Muses]]. Winners of the games dedicated their tripods to a sanctuary.  Many statues depicting the Muses, famous poets, and musicians stood in the open-air space of the Valley. With the rise of [[monotheism]], the festivals and the valley were abandoned.

==Archaeology==
In 1882, Stamatakis made the first test trench in the little church of Ayia Triada and noted the rectangular foundation of a small [[temple]] of the Muses. He also indicated the remains of the theatre on the mountain slope. The French Archaeological School under Jamot excavated systematically in 1888, 1889 and 1890, and discovered all the antiquities (G. Roux, Le Val des Muses et les Musees chez les auteurs anciens, in Bulletin de Correspondance Hellenique, 1954, 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;22–48).

==The sanctuary==
The Sanctuary consisted of:

*The theater, dated to the end of the 3rd century BC or the beginning of the 2nd century BC; built for the musical and theatrical games held in the valley during the ''Mouseia'' festival. Spectators sat on seats cut in the mountain slope. Only the first row - the prohedria - was [[marble]].
*The temple or [[altar]] of the Muses, dated in the 3rd century BC; a small rectangular building. After its abandonment the church of Ayia Triada was built upon the ancient foundations, which were revealed after the demolition of the church.
*A long Ionic stoa (length 96,70 m.) on the west of the temple, dated in the 3rd century BC; this housed the votive offerings to the Muses. Originally it had an internal wall and rooms; these were replaced later by a colonnade in the [[Corinthian order]]. 	
*Statues of the nine Muses; works of the poet and sculptor [[Onestos]]. These original stood in a single group; their bases were discovered during the excavations. On the five most well-preserved bases were found inscribed names of Muses and epigrams.
*The square tower of Askra, dated to the 4th century BC; the tower crowned the hill Pyrgaki and dominated the valley from the north. It had three storerooms on the ground floor. An earlier circuit wall, now ruined, enclosed the tower. It was probably built by the Thespians a little before 371 BC, the time of the battle of Leuktra, to control the movements of the Thebans.

[[Friar|Fray]] '''Ángel María Garibay Kintana''' (18 June 1892– 19 October 1967) was a [[Demographics of Mexico|Mexican]] [[Roman Catholic]] priest, [[philologist]], [[Linguistics|linguist]], historian, and scholar of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, specifically of the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] peoples of the central Mexican highlands. He is particularly noted for his studies and translations of [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquest-era]] primary source documents written in [[Classical Nahuatl]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] central Mexico and the then-dominant [[Aztec]] empire. Alongside his former student [[Miguel León-Portilla]], Garibay ranks as one of the pre-eminent Mexican authorities on the [[Nahuatl language]] and its [[Mesoamerican literature|literary heritage]], and as one who has made a significant contribution towards the promotion and preservation of the [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous cultures]] and [[indigenous languages of Mexico|languages]] of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;León-Portilla, Miguel. "Ángel Ma. Garibay K.(1892–1992), en el centenario de su nacimiento." Estudios de Cultura Náhuatl 22 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Garibay and León-Portilla published texts and scholarly analysis for the study of classical Nahuatl literature, founded the journal 
''[[:es:Estudios de cultura náhuatl|Estudios de Cultura Náhuatl]]'', and created the ''Seminario de Cultura Náhuatl''. In the seminar, they taught fundamentals of literature and linguistics to Nahuas, who have gone on to created a modern Nahuatl literature.&lt;ref&gt;León-Portilla, Miguel. "Lengua y cultura nahuas." ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'' 20.2 (2004): 223-25&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, the relationship between the development of Nahuatl literature as a field and the ideology of ''[[Indigenismo in Mexico|indigenismo]]'' and ''[[mestizaje]]'' has been critically examined.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jongsoo, "Emergence and Progress of Contemporary Nahua Literature: Fray Ángel María Garibay Kintana, Miguel León-Portilla, and the Pre-Hispanic Past".
