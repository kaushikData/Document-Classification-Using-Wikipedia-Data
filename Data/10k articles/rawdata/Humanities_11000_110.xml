'''Albanian iso-polyphony''' is a traditional part of [[music of Albania|Albanian folk music]] and, as such, is included in UNESCO's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00155 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention : |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All four regions of Albania—Lalëria ([[Myzeqe]]), Toskëria, [[Chameria|Çamëria]], and [[Labëria]]—have polyphonic song as part of their culture. A related form of polyphonic singing is found in northern [[Albania]], in the area of [[Peshkopi]]; [[Kaçanik]] in [[Kosovo]]; [[Polog]], [[Tetovo]], [[Kičevo]] and [[Gostivar]] in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]; and [[Malësia]] in northern Albania and southern [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref name="ardian"&gt;Ardian Ahmedaja, Gerlinde Haid (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Iga91qAoeDYC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=kenge+polifonike&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0H_WS-m8BsT6lwe9t-GVBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDoQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kenge%20polifonike&amp;f=false European voices: Multipart singing in the Balkans and the Mediterranean]'', Volume 1, p. 210, 243-44. {{ISBN|9783205780908}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labëria is particular well-known for multipart singing; songs can have two, three, or four parts. Two-part songs are sung only by women. Three-part songs can be sung by men and women. Four part songs are a Labërian specialty. Research has shown that four-part songs developed after three-part ones, and that they are the most complex form of polyphonic singing.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmedaja, Haid (2008), p.214-215. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Iga91qAoeDYC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=kenge+polifonike&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0H_WS-m8BsT6lwe9t-GVBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDoQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kenge%20polifonike&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gjirokastër National Folklore Festival]], [[Albania]], ({{lang-sq|Festivali Folklorik Kombëtar}}), has been held every five years in the month of October since 1968, and it typically includes many polyphonic songs.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmedaja, Haid (2008), p.241. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Iga91qAoeDYC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=festivali+i+folklorit+gjirokaster+5+years&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pleqërishte==
'''Pleqërishte''' is a genre of Albanian folk iso-polyphony sung by men in [[Labëria]] and is principally identified with the city of [[Gjirokastër]] and its environs. The genre is characterized by a slow tempo, low pitch and small range.

''Pleqërishte'' means both "of old men" and "of the old time" in reference to the mode of singing and the lyrical themes of part of their songs respectively. In relation to these subjects ''pleqërishte'' songs are also called ''lashtërishte'' ("of the ancient time"), a term used exclusively in Gjirokastër.&lt;ref name="AhmedajaHaid2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmedaja|first1=Ardian|last2=Haid|first2=Gerlinde|title=European Voices: Multipart singing in the Balkans and the Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iga91qAoeDYC&amp;pg=PA339|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=2008|publisher=Böhlau Verlag Wien|isbn=9783205780908|pages=218–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific topics have largely fallen into public disuse over the years but remain thematically notable.

Songs of the genre adhere to a slow tempo and low pitch with little vocal variation as opposed to genres such as ''djemurishte'' ("of young men") in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stockmann|first=Doris|author2=Erich Stockmann |year=1963|title=Die vokale Mehrstimmigkeit in Süd-Albanien|journal=Les Colloques de Wegimont|publisher=Cercle Internationale d'Études Ethno-musicologiques|volume=171|page=104|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MUMTAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As all fourth-part genres they feature a third soloist (''hedhës''). While in other four-part genres the ''hedhës'' mainly assumes the role of secondary drone a [[minor third]] above the [[keynote]], in ''pleqërishte'' the ''hedhës'' relieves the first soloist (''marrës'') and allows him to take a breathing break.&lt;ref name="AhmedajaHaid2008"/&gt; Each rendition begins with the singing of the first lines by the ''marrës'' and the introduction of the second soloist (''kthyes'') and finally the ''hedhës''. After the ''hedhës'', the ''marrës'''s lyrics are repeated by the drone group in various forms and manners.

''Pleqërishte'' songs are exemplified in the repertory of the folk group ''Pleqtë e Gjirokastrës'' sometimes regarded as the "last representative" of the genre.&lt;ref name="AhmedajaHaid2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tole"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isopolifonia.com/Other%20docs/Inventory%20of%20Performers,%20on%20iso-polyphony.pdf|title=Inventory of performers on iso-polyphony|last=Tole|first=Vasil|publisher=UNESCO|page=121|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best-known songs of the genre and most notable renditions of the group is ''Doli shkurti, hyri marsi'', which details a battle between [[Çerçiz Topulli]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops in 1908 in the village of Mashkullorë near Gjirokastër.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2601">'''Karl Albert August Ludwig Eichhorn''' (1 October 1856, [[Garlstorf]] – 3 August 1926, [[Braunschweig]]) was a German [[Protestant theologian]]. He was the author of ''Das Abendmahl im Neuen Testament'' and one of the founders of the [[history of religions school]], an approach that sought to understand all religions, including [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], as socio-cultural phenomena that developed in comparable ways. His pioneering work on the role of the contemporary needs, beliefs, and culture that shaped the [[New Testament]] reports of the [[Last Supper]] argued that this early Christian sacramental meal reflected the influence of Near Eastern [[gnostic]] ideas.

'''Amri''' is an ancient settlement in [[Dadu District|Dadu district]] [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]] that goes back to 3600 BC. The site is located south of [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] on [[Hyderabad, Pakistan|Hyderabad]]-[[Dadu, Pakistan|Dadu]] Road more than 100 kilometres north of [[Hyderabad, Pakistan]].

==Archaeology==
This site had multi-level structures, although it was never a big city.&lt;ref name="Higham2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Higham|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=H1c1UIEVH9gC|page=9}}|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0996-1|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amri culture]] is named after the site.

===Pre-Harappan stage===
Situated near the foothills of [[Kirthar Mountains]], this was an important earlier urban center in Lower Sindh. Amri is close to [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] where development of earlier farming communities from 6000 BC to 4000 BC ultimately led to urbanization.

The ancient mounds of 8 hectares on the west bank of [[Indus River]] have been extensively excavated. The earliest phase was a fortified town that flourished from [[3600 BC|3600]] to [[3300 BC]], and belonged to the [[Pre-Harappan]] stage of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Amri is dated after [[Rehman Dheri]].

The pottery discovered here had its own characteristics and is known as ''Amri Ware''. [[Sohr Damb]] (Nal) is a related site in Balochistan to the west of Amri. Their pottery is sometimes collectively described as 'Amri-Nal ware'.

Like other Pre Harappa towns, no writings were found at this site. Evidence indicates widespread fire at the town around 2500BC.

===Later phases===
In period II (ca. 2750-2450 BC), more and more elements of Indus Valley culture appear.

Period III (ca. 2450-1900 BC) belongs almost entirely to Indus Valley culture.

Period IV (ca. 1900-1300 BC) is marked by the mingling of cultural traditions. Elements of the [[Jhukar phase|Jhukar culture]] appear, and co-exist with the last phase of the Indus Valley culture.&lt;ref name="LaetDani1994"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Sigfried J. |last1=de Laet|first2=Ahmad Hasan |last2=Dani|title=History of Humanity: From the third millennium to the seventh century B.C.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=BnY0KYbJC6wC|page=674}}|year=1994|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-102811-3|pages=674–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the elements of [[Jhangar culture]] appear.

Period V is Muslim and dated much later.

Based on the evidence from this site, Indus culture was probably not developed directly from Amri culture. Also, at least at this location, rather than suddenly being replaced by the Amri culture, there was a co-existence of both cultures.

{{Cleanup|reason=the subject titles that reiterate "Arguments"...the page is already about the arguments|date=May 2012}}

Arguments about the '''[[prohibition (drugs)|prohibition of drugs]]''', and over [[drug policy]] reform, are subjects of considerable controversy. The following is a presentation of major drugs policy arguments, including those for drug law enforcement on one side of the debate, and arguments for drug law reform on the other. Arguments for and against drug prohibition discuss which system is more effective to protects human rights, prevent drug abuse and violence, and which system is more ethical.

==Efficiency==

===Drug laws are effective===
Supporters of prohibition claim that drug laws have a successful track record suppressing illicit drug use since they were introduced 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"&gt;Drug Free Australia {{cite web |url=http://www.drugfree.org.au/fileadmin/Media/Global/Taskforce_Arguments_for_Prohibition.pdf |title=Arguments for Prohibition |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706124952/http://www.drugfree.org.au/fileadmin/Media/Global/Taskforce_Arguments_for_Prohibition.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/the-1912-hague-international-opium-convention.html |title=The 1912 Hague International Opium Convention |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902141513/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/the-1912-hague-international-opium-convention.html |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The licit drug alcohol has current (last 12 months) user rates as high as 80–90% in populations over 14 years of age,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey: first Results.

In March, 2007, Antonio Maria Costa, former executive director of the [[UNODC|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], drew attention to the [[drug policy of Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;The Swedish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Feb 2008). [http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/09/87/50/0dcba6c7.pdf The Swedish action plan on narcotic drugs 2006–2010]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNODC (Feb 2007).

{{"|Sweden is an excellent example. Drug use is just a third of the European average while spending on drug control is three times the EU average. For three decades,&lt;ref group=nb name=Bogdan1977&gt;There were changes of course to the [[drug policy of Sweden]] prior to the period to which, on both sides of the argument, Antonio Maria Costa and Henrik Tham refer. For example, the Narcotics Penal Act of 1968 increased the maximum penalty for a grave drug offence from one to four years. It was increased again in 1969 to maximum six years (both in the Narcotics Penal Act and in the Smuggling Penal Act). The aim was to permit notable penalties for profiteers taking advantage of the inexperience, curiosity or drug dependence of others. In 1972, maximum punishment for gross offences was increased from 6 to 10 years in order to achieve parity with Finnish, Norwegian and West German law. This increase was intended to affect only the most dangerous criminals. – Source: Bogdan, Michael (1977).

There is a strong emphasis on prevention, drug laws have been progressively tightened, and extensive treatment and rehabilitation opportunities are available to users. The police take drug crime seriously. Governments and societies must keep their nerve and avoid being swayed by misguided notions of tolerance. They must not lose sight of the fact that illicit drugs are dangerous – that is why the world agreed to restrict them.|Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of [[UNODC]] (March 2007).

Criticizing governments that have relaxed their drug laws, Antonio Maria Costa, speaking in Washington before the launch of the World Drug Report in June 2006, said:

{{"|After so many years of drug control experience, we now know that a coherent, long-term strategy can reduce drug supply, demand and trafficking. If this does not happen, it will be because some nations fail to take the drug issue sufficiently seriously and pursue inadequate policies. Many countries have the drug problem they deserve.|}}

== Inefficiency ==

===Drug laws are ineffective===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AugustVollmer.jpg|right|thumb|250px|August Vollmer, former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and critic of drug prohibition]] --&gt;
One of the prominent early critics of prohibition in the United States was [[August Vollmer]], founder of the School of Criminology at [[University of California, Irvine]] and former president of the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]. In his 1936 book ''The Police and Modern Society'', he stated his opinion that:

{{"|Stringent laws, spectacular police drives, vigorous prosecution, and imprisonment of addicts and peddlers have proved not only useless and enormously expensive as means of correcting this evil, but they are also unjustifiably and unbelievably cruel in their application to the unfortunate drug victims. Repression has driven this vice underground and produced the narcotic smugglers and supply agents, who have grown wealthy out of this evil practice and who, by devious methods, have stimulated traffic in drugs. Finally, and not the least of the evils associated with repression, the helpless addict has been forced to resort to crime in order to get money for the drug which is absolutely indispensable for his comfortable existence.

The first step in any plan to alleviate this dreadful affliction should be the establishment of Federal control and dispensation – at cost – of habit-forming drugs. With the profit motive gone, no effort would be made to encourage its use by private dispensers of narcotics, and the drug peddler would disappear. New addicts would be speedily discovered and through early treatment, some of these unfortunate victims might be saved from becoming hopelessly incurable.

Drug addiction, like prostitution, and like liquor, is not a police problem; it never has been, and never can be solved by policemen. It is first and last a medical problem, and if there is a solution it will be discovered not by policemen, but by scientific and competently trained medical experts whose sole objective will be the reduction and possible eradication of this devastating appetite. There should be intelligent treatment of the incurables in outpatient clinics, hospitalization of those not too far gone to respond to therapeutic measures, and application of the prophylactic principles which medicine applies to all scourges of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;''The Police and Modern Society'', [[August Vollmer]], Berkeley, University of California Press, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stephen Rolles, writing in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', argues:

{{"|Consensus is growing within the drugs field and beyond that the prohibition on production, supply, and use of certain drugs has not only failed to deliver its intended goals but has been counterproductive. Evidence is mounting that this policy has not only exacerbated many public health problems, such as adulterated drugs and the spread of HIV and hepatitis B and C infection among injecting drug users, but has created a much larger set of secondary harms associated with the criminal market. These now include vast networks of organised crime, endemic violence related to the drug market, corruption of law enforcement and governments.}}

These conclusions have been reached by a succession of committees and reports including, in the United Kingdom alone, the [[Police Foundation]], the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]], the [[Prime Minister's Strategy Unit]], the [[Royal Society of Arts]], and the [[UK Drug Policy Consortium]]. The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many "unintended negative consequences" of drug enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Rolles, Stephen (2010). [http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3360.full An alternative to the war on drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902235541/http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3360.full |date=2010-09-02 }} BMJ. 341:c3360. {{doi|10.1136/bmj.c3360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor of the ''British Medical Journal'', Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir [[Ian Gilmore]], former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs "as a health issue rather than criminalising people" and "this could drastically reduce crime and improve health".

Danny Kushlik, head of external affairs at Transform, said the intervention of senior medical professionals was significant. He said: "Sir Ian's statement is yet another nail in prohibition's coffin. The Hippocratic oath says: 'First, do no harm'. Physicians are duty bound to speak out if the outcomes show that prohibition causes more harm than it reduces."

Nicholas Green, chairman of the [[Bar Council]], made comments in a report in the profession's magazine, in which he said that [[drug-related crime]] costs the UK economy about £13bn a year and that there was growing evidence that decriminalisation could free up police resources, reduce crime and recidivism and improve public health.&lt;ref&gt;Boseley, Sarah (2010). [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/16/drugs-decriminalisation-doctor-ian-gilmore Leading doctor urges decriminalisation of drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307145031/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/16/drugs-decriminalisation-doctor-ian-gilmore |date=2016-03-07 }}. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report sponsored by the [[New York County Lawyers' Association]], one of the largest local bar associations in the United States, argues on the subject of US drug policy:

{{"|Notwithstanding the vast public resources expended on the enforcement of penal statutes against users and distributors of controlled substances, contemporary drug policy appears to have failed, even on its own terms, in a number of notable respects. These include: minimal reduction in the consumption of controlled substances; failure to reduce violent crime; failure to markedly reduce drug importation, distribution and street-level drug sales; failure to reduce the widespread availability of drugs to potential users; failure to deter individuals from becoming involved in the drug trade; failure to impact upon the huge profits and financial opportunity available to individual "entrepreneurs" and organized underworld organizations through engaging in the illicit drug trade; the expenditure of great amounts of increasingly limited public resources in pursuit of a cost-intensive "penal" or "law-enforcement" based policy; failure to provide meaningful treatment and other assistance to substance abusers and their families; and failure to provide meaningful alternative economic opportunities to those attracted to the drug trade for lack of other available avenues for financial advancement.&lt;ref&gt;via New York County Lawyers' Association (Oct 2006). [http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/nycla/nycla.htm#footnotes Report and Recommendations of the Drug Policy Task Force (Note 2)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622205805/http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/nycla/nycla.htm#footnotes |date=June 22, 2008 }}. NYCLA &amp; Drug Reform Coordination Network. – see National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (1993), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which reports that 12% of the total U.S. population, or 24 million persons within the U.S., had used illicit drugs within the past year. 77 million persons had used illicit drugs sometime during their life. In a similar survey, conducted in 1994, it was found that 10.8% of the total population, or 22.6 million persons had used illicit drugs some time during the previous year. Further, a U.S. General Accounting Office report, released in 1989, noted the following findings: that drug abuse in the United States persisted at very high levels throughout the 1980s; that the amount of cocaine consumed in the U.S. doubled, while the price declined about 30%; that the price of heroin declined 20%, while the average purity of heroin sold had doubled; and that marijuana, while its use declined, continued to be readily available in most areas of the country. Thus, notwithstanding huge expenditures in waging the "war on drugs" drug use remains widespread throughout the nation, its costs have actually decreased and potency increased.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, a growing body of evidence and opinion suggests that contemporary drug policy, as pursued in recent decades, may be counterproductive and even harmful to the society whose public safety it seeks to protect. This conclusion becomes more readily apparent when one distinguishes the harms suffered by society and its members directly attributable to the pharmacological effects of drug use upon human behavior, from those harms resulting from policies attempting to eradicate drug use.&lt;ref&gt;New York County Lawyers' Association (Oct 2006). [http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/nycla/nycla.htm#footnotes Report and Recommendations of the Drug Policy Task Force (Note 3)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622205805/http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/nycla/nycla.htm#footnotes |date=June 22, 2008 }}. NYCLA &amp; Drug Reform Coordination Network. "In aid of more meaningful and objective analysis of what has commonly been referred to as 'the drug problem', care must be taken and appropriate distinctions made in using terms such as: 'drug use', 'substance abuse', 'drug-related crime', and 'drug-induced crime'. Definitions of these terms having been blurred in the drug policy debate thus far, has led to a failure to properly analyze and distinguish harms caused by drug use, substance abuse, the drug-trade, and drug control policies themselves."&lt;/ref&gt;

With aid of these distinctions, we see that present drug policy appears to contribute to the increase of violence in our communities. It does so by permitting and indeed, causing the drug trade to remain a lucrative source of economic opportunity for street dealers, drug kingpins and all those willing to engage in the often violent, illicit, black market trade.

Meanwhile, the effect of present policy serves to stigmatize and marginalize drug users, thereby inhibiting and undermining the efforts of many such individuals to remain or become productive, gainfully employed members of society. Furthermore, current policy has not only failed to provide adequate access to treatment for substance abuse, it has, in many ways, rendered the obtaining of such treatment, and of other medical services, more difficult and even dangerous to pursue.&lt;ref&gt;

In response to claims that prohibition can work, as argued by [[Antonio Maria Costa]], executive director of the [[UNODC|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], who drew attention to the [[drug policy of Sweden]], Henrik Tham has written that sometimes it's domestically important to stress drug policy as successful; in the case of Sweden, where this notion is important, such claims serve "''the function of strengthening a threatened national identity in a situation where the traditional 'Swedish model' has come under increasingly hard attack from both inside and outside the country.''" Tham questions the success of the Swedish model – "''The shift in Swedish drug policy since around 1980''" ...(more difficult to receive ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' for minor drug crimes)&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Tham: Narkotikapolitiken och missbrukets utveckling, page 4, Kriminologiska institutionen, Stockholms universitet, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb name=Bogdan1977/&gt; ..."''towards a more strict model has according to the official point of view been successful by comparison with the earlier, more lenient drug policy. However, available systematic indicators show that the prevalence of drug use has increased since around 1980, that the decrease in drug incidence was particularly marked during the 1970s and that some indicators point towards an increase during the 1990s.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Leif Lenke and Börje Olsson from Stockholm University have conducted research that showed how drug use have followed the youth unemployment in close correlation. They noted that unlike most of Europe, Sweden did not have widespread and lingering youth unemployment until the [[Swedish banking rescue|early 1990s financial crisis]], suggesting that unattractive future prospects may contribute to the increase in drug use among the young.&lt;ref&gt;Lenke, L. &amp; Olsson, B.

The professor emeritus in criminology at the University of Oslo, [[Nils Christie]], pointed out Sweden as the hawk of international drug policy in a 2004 book. He said that Sweden are serving the role of being welfare alibi for, and lending legitimacy to the US [[War on Drugs|drug war]]. Adding that USA and Sweden have had an extraordinary influence on UNODC as the biggest donor countries.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, Nils (Mar 2004). ''A Suitable Amount of Crime''. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-33611-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden was the second biggest donor financing 8% of the UNODC budget behind the [[European Commission]] in 2006, followed by the US.

An editorial in [[The Economist]] argued: {{"|fear [of legalisation] is based in large part on the presumption that more people would take drugs under a legal regime. That presumption may be wrong. There is no correlation between the harshness of drug laws and the incidence of drug-taking: citizens living under tough regimes (notably America but also Britain) take more drugs, not fewer. Embarrassed drug warriors blame this on alleged cultural differences, but even in fairly similar countries tough rules make little difference to the number of addicts: harsh Sweden and more liberal Norway have precisely the same addiction rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Deterrence==

===Arguments that prohibition discourages drug use===
A 2001 Australian study, of 18- to 29-year-olds by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research suggests that prohibition deters illicit drug use.&lt;ref&gt;NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research{{cite web |url= http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/bocsar/ll_bocsar.nsf/vwFiles/mr_cjb58.pdf/$file/mr_cjb58.pdf |title= Does Prohibition Deter Cannabis Use |accessdate= 2010-04-20 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110321135719/http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/bocsar/ll_bocsar.nsf/vwFiles/mr_cjb58.pdf/$file/mr_cjb58.pdf |archivedate= 2011-03-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 29% of those who had never used cannabis cited the illegality of the substance as their reason for never using the drug, while 19% of those who had ceased use of cannabis cited its illegality as their reason.

Gil Kerlikowske, Director of the US [[ONDCP]] argues,

{{"|Controls and prohibitions help to keep prices higher, and higher prices help keep use rates relatively low, since drug use, especially among young people, is known to be sensitive to price. The relationship between pricing and rates of youth substance use is well-established with respect to alcohol and cigarette taxes. There is literature showing that increases in the price of cigarettes triggers declines in use."&lt;ref&gt;Gil Kerlikowske {{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/speech10/030410_Chief.pdf |pages=9, 10 |title=Why Marijuana Legalization Would Compromise Public Health and Public Safety |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The DEA argues "Legalization has been tried before—and failed miserably. Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally.

[[Drug Free Australia]] has cited the Netherlands as an example of drug policy failure because it is soft in approach. They argue that the Dutch idea of going soft on cannabis dealers, thereby creating a "separation of markets" from hard drug dealers has failed to stem the initiation to drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and amphetamines, saying that, in 1998, the Netherlands had the third highest cannabis and cocaine use in Europe.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt; According to Barry McCaffrey of the US [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], Dutch tolerance has allowed the Netherlands to become a criminal epicentre for illicit synthetic drug manufacture, particularly ecstasy, as well as the home for production and worldwide export of strains of cannabis with THC reportedly 10 times higher than normal.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Barry McCaffrey, Director, US Office of Drug Control Policy to House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. {{cite web

==Gateway drug theory==
{{Main|Gateway drug theory}}

===Arguments that cannabis is a gateway drug===
The US Drug Enforcement Agency's "2008 Marijuana Sourcebook" argues that recent research supports the gateway hypothesis that certain drugs (such as cannabis) act as gateways to use of 'harder' drugs such as heroin, either because of social contact or because of an increasing search for a better high.&lt;ref&gt;US DEA{{cite web|url= http://www.justice.gov/dea/statistics/Marijuana_2008.pdf |title=2008 Marijuana Sourcebook |accessdate=2010-04-20 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529133129/http://www.justice.gov/dea/statistics/Marijuana_2008.pdf| archivedate= 2010-05-29 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Lynskey M, Escalation of Drug Use in Early-Onset Cannabis Users vs Co-Twin Controls JAMA 289 No.4 427–433 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments that cannabis is not a gateway drug===
In the ''American Journal of Public Health'', Andrew Golub and Bruce Johnson of the [[National Development and Research Institute]] in New York wrote that young people who smoked marijuana in the generations before and after the baby boomers did not appear to be likely to move on to harder drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Drug Science.org (2006).

Researchers from the independent Rand Drug Policy Research Center in Santa Monica, California, looking at data from the [[National Household Survey on Drug Abuse]] between 1982 and 1994, concluded that teenagers who took hard drugs did so whether they had first tried cannabis or not.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (2002).

A twin study (of 510 same sex twin pairs) which adjusted for additional confounders such as peer drug use, found that cannabis use and associations with later hard drug use existed only for non-identical twins.

==Health==

===Health arguments for drug laws===
Advocates of prohibition argue that particular drugs should be illegal because they are harmful. Drug Free Australia for example argues "That illicit drugs are inherently harmful substances is attested by the very nomenclature of the 'harm reduction' movement."&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt; The U.S. government has argued that illegal drugs are "''far more deadly than alcohol''" saying "''although alcohol is used by seven times as many people as drugs, the number of deaths induced by those substances is not far apart. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during 2000, there were 15,852 drug-induced deaths; only slightly less than the 18,539 alcohol-induced deaths.''"&lt;ref name=DEA&gt;United States Drug Enforcement Administration, "[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/03so.htm Fact 3: Illegal drugs are illegal because they are harmful] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210094624/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/03so.htm |date=February 10, 2007 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; Ratios of the harms of illicit opiates to licit alcohol and tobacco in Australia are similar, with 2 deaths per hundred opiate users per annum versus 0.22 deaths per hundred for alcohol (9 times less) per year and 0.3 for tobacco (7 times less).&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

The DEA has said:

{{"|Marijuana is far more powerful than it used to be. In 2000, there were six times as many emergency room mentions of marijuana use as there were in 1990, despite the fact that the number of people using marijuana is roughly the same. In 1999, a record 225,000 Americans entered substance abuse treatment primarily for marijuana dependence, second only to heroin—and not by much. ... According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, "Studies show that someone who smokes five joints per week may be taking in as many cancer-causing chemicals as someone who smokes a full pack of cigarettes every day." Marijuana contains more than 400 chemicals, including the most harmful substances found in tobacco smoke. For example, smoking one marijuana cigarette deposits about four times more tar into the lungs than a filtered tobacco cigarette. ... The short-term effects are also harmful. They include: memory loss, distorted perception, trouble with thinking and problem solving, loss of motor skills, decrease in muscle strength, increased heart rate, and anxiety. Marijuana impacts young people's mental development, their ability to concentrate in school, and their motivation and initiative to reach goals. And marijuana affects people of all ages: Harvard University researchers report that the risk of a heart attack is five times higher than usual in the hour after smoking marijuana.|US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003).

Gil Kerlikowske, director of the US [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP) argues that in the United States, illegal drugs already cost $180 billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime, and other expenditures, and that number would only increase under legalization because of increased use.&lt;ref name="whitehousedrugpolicy.gov"&gt;See speech by Gil Kerlikowske, director of the US ONDCP {{cite web

Drug Free Australia claims arguments that increased health harms of illicit drugs are the result of lack of government regulation of their purity and strength are not well supported by evidence. In Australia, which has had the highest opioid mortality per capita in the OECD,&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt; studies found that "overdose fatality is not a simple function of heroin dose or purity. There is no evidence of toxicity from contaminants of street heroin in Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancd.org.au/images/PDF/Researchpapers/rp1_heroin_overdose.pdf |title=Heroin overdose: prevalence, correlates, consequences and interventions |accessdate=2009-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621040123/http://ancd.org.au/images/PDF/Researchpapers/rp1_heroin_overdose.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-21 |df= }} 2001 {{ISBN|1-877018-00-7}} p vi&lt;/ref&gt; Drug Free Australia claims that other causes of death such as suicide, murder and accidents are an effect of the drug themselves, not of their purity or otherwise.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

====Addiction====
Drug Free Australia argues "Regarding the freedom of choice of those addicted to a drug, it is important to recognize that addiction is defined as compulsive by its very nature and that addictions curb individual freedom." ... "As is the case with alcohol addiction, illicit drug addictions likewise serve to keep many such users functionally in poverty and often as a continued burden on friends, family and society. Where it is argued that all disabilities are a burden on society it must be recognized that most disabilities are not the result of a choice, whereas the decision to recreationally use illicit drugs is most commonly free, and with the knowledge that they may lead to an abundance of addictions."&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

====Health benefits====
Many trials have shown beneficial effects associated with psychoactive drug use:

* There is evidence that [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) can treat or cure [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and anxiety in cases of terminal illness.
* [[LSD]] has been widely researched as a therapeutic agent, and has shown effectiveness against [[alcoholism]], frigidity and various other disorders. See [[Psychedelic therapy]].
* Researchers at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital found members of a religious group regularly using peyote scored significantly better on several measures of overall mental health than did subjects who did not use the hallucinogen.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Science (2005).

====Quality control====
According to a World Health Organisation report: "As cannabis is an illegal drug its cultivation, harvesting and distribution are not subject to quality control mechanisms to ensure the reliability and safety of the product used by consumers. It is well recognised in developing countries, such as Kenya, that illicit alcohol production can result in the contamination with toxic by-products or adulterants that can kill or seriously affect the health of users. The same may be true of illicit drugs such as opiates, cocaine and amphetamine in developed societies."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation.

Addiction.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Block to research====
The illegality of many recreational drugs may be dissuading research into new, more effective and perhaps safer recreational drugs. For example, it has been proposed that a drug with many of the same desired effects as alcohol could be created with fewer adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg19025474.100-all-the-pleasures-of-alcohol-with-no-downsides.html|title=All the pleasures of alcohol, with no downsides|author=Graham Lawton|work=New Scientist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211033350/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg19025474.100-all-the-pleasures-of-alcohol-with-no-downsides.html|archivedate=2007-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misleading health statistics====
The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has suggested that illegal drugs are "far more deadly than alcohol", arguing that "although alcohol is used by seven times as many people as drugs, the number of deaths induced by those substances is not far apart", quoting figures from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), claiming "during 2000, there were 15,852 drug-induced deaths; only slightly less than the 18,539 alcohol-induced deaths."&lt;ref name="DEA"/&gt;

The DEA's use of such figures is questionable however. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association gave the number deaths caused by alcohol in year 2000 as 85,000 – over four and a half times greater than the DEA's preferred figure.&lt;ref name=Mokdad2004&gt;Mokdad, Ali H., PhD, James S.

===Medical uses===
A document published for the non-profit advocacy organization [[Europe Against Drugs]] (EURAD) argues that "one cannot vote for a medicine" and that a scientific approval basis is essential. It says that EU rules set out strict criteria for the acceptance of a drug for medical use:

{{Quote|All active ingredients have to be identified and their chemistry determined.  They have to be tested for purity with limits set for all impurities including pesticides, microbe &amp; fungi and their products.  These tests have to be validated and reproduced if necessary in an official laboratory.  Animal testing will include information on fertility, embryo toxicity, immuno-toxicity, mutagenic and carcinogenic potential.  Risks to humans, especially pregnant women and lactating mothers, will be evaluated.  Adequate safety and efficacy trials must be carried out.  They must state the method of administration and report on the results from different groups, i.e. healthy volunteers, patients, special groups of the elderly, people with liver and kidney problems and pregnant women.

====Arguments against medical uses of prohibited drugs====
According to Janet D. Lapey, M.D., of [[Concerned Citizens For Drug Prevention]], " Due to a placebo effect, a patient may erroneously believe a drug is helpful when it is not.  This is especially true of addictive, mind-altering drugs like marijuana. A marijuana withdrawal syndrome occurs, consisting of anxiety, depression, sleep and appetite disturbances, irritability, tremors, diaphoresis, nausea, muscle convulsions, and restlessness. Often, persons using marijuana erroneously believe that the drug is helping them combat these symptoms without realizing that actually marijuana is the cause of these effects. Therefore, when a patient anecdotally reports a drug to have medicinal value, this must be followed by objective scientific studies."&lt;ref&gt;EURAD {{cite web

The US Drug Enforcement Administration also says:{{"|There is a growing misconception that some illegal drugs can be taken safely.

====Arguments for medical uses of prohibited drugs====
Most of the psychoactive drugs now prohibited in modern societies have had medical uses in history. In natural plant drugs like opium, coca, cannabis, mescaline, and psilocybin, the medical history usually dates back thousands of years and through a variety of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Grinspoon, Lester; Bakalar, James B. gggg"[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/medical/meduse.htm Medical Uses of Illicit Drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902004339/http://www.druglibrary.org/SCHAFFER/hemp/medical/meduse.htm |date=2006-09-02 }}". Schaffer Library of Drug Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin (the main ingredient in most hallucinogenic mushrooms) are the subject of renewed research interest because of their therapeutic potential.

====Lack of access to controlled medications====
Under prohibition, millions of people find it very difficult to obtain controlled medications, particularly [[opiate]] pain-relievers. The [[United Nations]] 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] requires that opiates be distributed only by medical prescription, but this is impractical in many areas.

According to the [[Transnational Institute]], June 2008:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ungassondrugs.org/images/stories/brief26.pdf Rewriting history, A response to the 2008 World Drug Report], Transnational Institute, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) there is now an unmet demand in opiates. Ironically, the current drug control regulations hamper access to controlled opiate medications for therapeutic use. Many patients are unable to access morphine, methadone or an equivalent opioid. Global medical morphine consumption would rise five times if countries would make morphine available at the level of the calculated need, according to a recent WHO estimate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the New York Times, September 2007:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/health/10pain.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all Drugs Banned, Many of World's Poor Suffer in Pain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603160626/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/health/10pain.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |date=2013-06-03 }}, Donald G. McNeil Jr., New York Times, 10 Sept 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under Sierra Leone law, morphine may be handled only by a pharmacist or doctor, explained Gabriel Madiye, the hospice's founder. But in all Sierra Leone there are only about 100 doctors — one for every 54,000 people, compared with one for every 350 in the United States.... "How can they say there is no demand when they don't allow it?" he [Madiye] asked. "How can they be so sure that it will get out of control when they haven't even tried it?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Economic==

===Economic arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
The DEA argues that "compared to the social costs of drug abuse and addiction—whether in taxpayer dollars or in pain and suffering—government spending on drug control is minimal."&lt;ref name=DEA2003/&gt;

Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the [[UNODC|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], has said: {{"|The economic argument for drug legalization says: legalize drugs, and generate tax income. This argument is gaining favour, as national administrations seek new sources of revenue during the current economic crisis. This legalize and tax argument is un-ethical and uneconomical. It proposes a perverse tax, generation upon generation, on marginalized cohorts (lost to addiction) to stimulate economic recovery. Are the partisans of this cause also in favour of legalizing and taxing other seemingly intractable crimes like human trafficking? Modern-day slaves (and there are millions of them) would surely generate good tax revenue to rescue failed banks. The economic argument is also based on poor fiscal logic: any reduction in the cost of drug control (due to lower law enforcement expenditure) will be offset by much higher expenditure on public health (due to the surge of drug consumption). The moral of the story: don't make wicked transactions.|Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of [[UNODC]] (June 2009). Preface to [http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_eng_web.pdf World Drug Report 2009].}}

[[Gil Kerlikowske]], current director of the US [[ONDCP]], argues that legalizing drugs, then regulating and taxing their sale, would not be effective fiscally. {{"| The tax revenue collected from alcohol pales in comparison to the costs associated with it. Federal excise taxes collected on alcohol in 2007, totaled around $9 billion; states collected around $5.5 billion.

indicates that drug prohibition is in the midst of a pitched battle waged by those who are accepting not only of the drug user but who also strongly promote an acceptance of drug use itself.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

====Prohibition of hemp industry====
Opposition to the legalization of hemp, which uses plants of the cannabis genus for commercial purposes, centres on the fact that those wanting to legalize the use of cannabis for recreational and medical purposes themselves present it as their Trojan horse for that very purpose:{{"|  Alex Shum, importers of hemp fabric, "feel that the way to legalize marijuana is to sell marijuana legally. When you can buy marijuana in your neighbourhood shopping mall, IT`S LEGAL! So, they are going to produce every conceivable thing out of hemp.| High Times, "Hemp Clothing is Here!", March 1990}}

In a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' interview, [[Mark A.R. Kleiman|Mark Kleiman]], the "Pot Czar" of [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], said he was concerned that the [[National Cannabis Industry Association]] would favor profits over public health. He also said that it could become a predatory body like the lobbying arms of the tobacco and alcohol industries. Kleiman said: "The fact that the National Cannabis Industry Association has hired itself a [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]] [[Lobbying in the United States|suit [lobbyist]]] is not a good sign."&lt;ref name=huffpo2 /&gt;

===Economic arguments for drug law reform===
The [[United States]] [[War on Drugs|efforts at drug prohibition]] started out with a $350 million budget in 1971, and was in 2006 a $30 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugwarfacts.org/economi.htm |title=Economics |accessdate=2008-03-07 |author=Common Sense for Drug Policy |date=2007-05-21 |work=Drug War Facts | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080307053005/http://www.drugwarfacts.org/economi.htm| archivedate= 7 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers only include ''direct'' prohibition enforcement expenditures, and as such only represent ''part'' of the total cost of prohibition. This $30 billion figure rises dramatically once other issues, such as the economic impact of holding 400,000 prisoners on prohibition violations, are factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugwarfacts.org/prison.htm |title=Prisons, Jails and Probation – Overview |accessdate=2008-03-07 |author=Common Sense for Drug Policy |date=2007-12-31 |work=Drug War Facts | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080316025839/http://www.drugwarfacts.org/prison.htm| archivedate= 16 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war on drugs is extremely costly to such societies that outlaw drugs in terms of taxpayer money, lives, productivity, the inability of law enforcement to pursue ''[[mala in se]]'' crimes, and social inequality. Some proponents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/special/friedman/socialist.htm|title=The Drug War as a Socialist Enterprise by Milton Friedman|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613032051/http://druglibrary.org/special/friedman/socialist.htm|archivedate=2010-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of decriminalization say that the financial and social costs of drug law enforcement far exceed the damages that the drugs themselves cause. For instance, in 1999, close to 60,000 prisoners (3.3% of [[United States incarceration rate|the total incarcerated population]]) convicted of violating marijuana laws were behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of some $1.2 billion per year. In 1980, the total jail and prison population was 540,000, about one-quarter the size it is today. Drug offenders accounted for 6% of all prisoners. According to the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], drug offenders now account for nearly 51%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bop.gov/news/quick.jsp#4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811084224/http://www.bop.gov/news/quick.jsp|date=2011-08-11}}, Quick Facts About the Bureau of Prisons ''Federal Bureau of Prisons'', last updated 30 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that if the US government legalised marijuana it would save $7.7 billion per year in expenditure on enforcement of prohibition. Also, that marijuana legalization would yield tax revenue of $2.4 billion annually if it were taxed like all other goods and $6.2 billion annually if it were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miron, Jeffrey A. |date=June 2005 |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/mironreport.html |title=The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition |publisher=The Marijuana Policy Project |accessdate=2008-05-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512083517/http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/mironreport.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The creation of drug cartels====
Mass arrests of local growers of marijuana, for example, not only increase the price of local drugs, but lessens competition. Only major retailers that can handle massive shipments, have their own small fleet of aircraft, troops to defend the caravans and other sophisticated methods of eluding the police (such as lawyers), can survive by this regulation of the free market by the government
{{"|... it is because it's prohibited. See, if you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view, the role of the government is to protect the drug cartel. That's literally true.|[[Milton Friedman]]&lt;ref name="Trebach-LibertyAndDrugs" /&gt;}}

====Effect on producer countries====
The United States' "[[War on Drugs]]" has added considerably to the political instability in [[South America]]. The huge profits to be made from cocaine and other South American-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighbouring nation. This drives people in the relatively poor countries of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Brazil]] to break their own laws in organising the cultivation, preparation and trafficking of cocaine to the States. This has allowed criminal, [[paramilitary]] and [[guerrilla]] groups to reap huge profits, exacerbating already serious law-and-order and political problems. Within Bolivia, the political rise of current president [[Evo Morales]] is directly related to his grassroots movement against US-sponsored coca-eradication and criminalization policies. However, [[coca]] has been cultivated for centuries in the [[Andes]]. Among their various legitimate uses, coca leaves are chewed for their mild stimulant &amp; appetite suppression effects, and steeped as a tea which is known to reduce the effects of human altitude sickness. Rural farmers in the poor regions in which coca has historically been cultivated often find themselves at the difficult and potentially violent intersection of government-sponsored eradication efforts, illegal cocaine producers &amp; traffickers seeking coca supplies, anti-government paramilitary forces trafficking in cocaine as a source of revolutionary funding, and the historical hardships of rural subsistence farming (or its typical alternative – abandoning their land and fleeing to an urban slum). In some regions, farmers' coca and other crops are frequently destroyed by U.S.-sponsored eradication treatments (usually sprayed from the air with varying degrees of discrimination), whether or not the farmers directly supply the cocaine trade, thereby destroying their livelihoods. Agricultural producers in these countries are pushed further to grow coca for the cocaine trade by the [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] of subsidised farming products (fruit, vegetables, grain etc.) produced by Western countries (predominantly US and EU agricultural surpluses) (see BBC reference, below), which reduces the prices they could otherwise receive for alternate crops such as maize. The net effect can be a depression of prices for all crops, which can both make the farmer's livelihood more precarious, and make the cocaine producers' coca supplies cheaper.

After providing a significant portion of the world's poppy for use in heroin production, Afghanistan went from producing practically no illegal drugs in 2000 (following banning by the [[Taliban]]), to cultivating what is now as much as 90% of the world's opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101654.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Afghanistan Opium Crop Sets Record | first=Karen | last=DeYoung | date=2006-12-02 | accessdate=2010-04-25 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105165045/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101654.html | archivedate=2010-01-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban is currently believed to be heavily supported by the opium trade there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/news/afghanistan-moc/|title=Afghanistan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=bookrags.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304210341/http://www.bookrags.com/news/afghanistan-moc/|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the sale of the illegal drugs produces an influx of dollars that is outside the formal economy, and puts pressure on the currency exchange keeping the dollar low and making the export of legal products more difficult.&lt;ref name="VonBuelow-ImNamenDesStaates"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Im Namen des Staates.

====Prohibition of hemp industry====
{{Main|Hemp}}
The War on Drugs has resulted in the outlawing of the entire hemp industry in the United States. Hemp, which is a special cultivar of [[Cannabis Sativa]], does not have significant amounts of [[psychoactive]] ([[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]]) substances in it, less than 1%. Without even realizing the plant had been outlawed several months prior, Popular Mechanics magazine published an article in 1938 entitled ''The New Billion-Dollar Crop'' anticipating the explosion of the hemp industry with the invention of machines to help process it. Recently, governmental refusal to take advantage of taxing hemp has been a point of criticism. Hemp has a large list of potential industrial uses including [[textile]]s, [[paper]], [[rope]], [[fuel]], construction materials, and [[biocomposite]]s (for use in cars for example). Hemp has some drawbacks, however, one being that the long fibers in hemp are only a part of the outer bast, and this has contributed to hemp having only modest commercial success in countries (for example in Canada) where it is legal to harvest hemp.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The seed of the hemp plant is highly [[nutritious]]. Rare for a plant, it contains all essential [[amino acid]]s. Rare for any food, it is a good source of [[alpha-linolenic acid]], an [[omega 3 fatty acid]] which is deficient in most [[diet (nutrition)|diets]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Crime, terrorism and social order==

===Arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
While concerns are sometimes expressed that the "war on drugs" can never be won, there is a failure to recognize that other justifiably costly policing wars such as "blitzes" on speeding can likewise never be won. Such blitzes reduce and contain speeding, as with policing of illicit drug use.  Failure to police speeding drivers simply allows inordinate harm to be inflicted on other individuals. Speeding is not legalized simply because it can never be eradicated.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

There is an argument that much crime and terrorism is drug related or drug funded and that prohibition should reduce this.

Former US president George W. Bush, in signing the [[Drug-Free Communities Act Reauthorization Bill]] in December 2001, said, "If you quit drugs, you join the fight against terror in America."&lt;ref name=Bush2001/&gt;

The US Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) says that drug-related offences may include violent behavior resulting from drug effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html |title=ONDCP – Drug Related Crime |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218114141/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html |archivedate=2010-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Drug Enforcement Administration claims:{{"|Crime, violence and drug use go hand in hand. Six times as many homicides are committed by people under the influence of drugs, as by those who are looking for money to buy drugs. Most drug crimes aren't committed by people trying to pay for drugs; they're committed by people on drugs.|US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003).

The U.S. government began the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program in 1987 to collect information on drug use among urban arrestees. In 1997, the National Institute of Justice expanded and reengineered the DUF study and renamed it the [[Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring]] (ADAM) program. ADAM is a network of 34 research sites in select U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/druguse/|title=Office of National Drug Control Policy|work=The White House|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119142001/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/druguse/|archivedate=2010-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DUF research indicates that:

*  Frequent use of hard drugs is one of the strongest indicators of a criminal career.
*  Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals, engaging in both property and violent crime.
*  Early and persistent use of cocaine or heroin in the juvenile years is an indicator of serious, persistent criminal behavior in adulthood.
*  Those arrested who are drug users are more likely than those not using drugs to be rearrested on pretrial release or fail to appear at trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/war.on.drugs/debate/crime.link|title=Summary of DUF findings|author=|date=|website=lycaeum.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123805/http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/war.on.drugs/debate/crime.link|archivedate=28 August 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html|title=Office of National Drug Control Policy|work=The White House|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923202557/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/crime/index.html|archivedate=2008-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of drugs changes behavior and causes criminal activity because people will do things they wouldn't do if they were rational and free of the drug's influence.  Cocaine-related paranoia is an example. If drug use increases with legalization, so will such forms of related violent crime as assaults, drugged driving, child abuse, and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

That higher prices make the trade lucrative for criminals is recognized but countered by the argument that capitulating to illicit drug use on these grounds makes no more sense than capitulating to those who continue to traffic in human lives, a more expensive business because of its illegality and therefore more lucrative for the criminal, but necessary for the rights of vulnerable citizens.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

The Office of National Drug Control Policy says that the idea that our nation's prisons are overflowing with otherwise law-abiding people convicted for nothing more than simple possession of marijuana is a myth, "an illusion conjured and aggressively perpetuated by drug advocacy groups seeking to relax or abolish America's marijuana laws." ONDCP state that the vast majority of inmates in state and federal prison for marijuana have been found guilty of much more than simple possession. Some were convicted for drug trafficking, some for marijuana possession along with one or more other offenses. And many of those serving time for marijuana pleaded down to possession in order to avoid prosecution on much more serious charges. In the US, just 1.6 percent of the state inmate population were held for offences involving only marijuana, and less than one percent of all state prisoners (0.7 percent) were incarcerated with marijuana possession as the only charge. An even smaller fraction of state prisoners were first time offenders (0.3 percent). The numbers on the US federal prisons are similar. In 2001, the overwhelming majority of offenders sentenced for marijuana crimes were convicted for trafficking and only 63 served time for simple possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Detective superintendent Eva Brännmark from the [[Swedish National Police Board]], in a speech given to Drug Free Australia's first international conference on illicit drug use, said:

{{"|The police have been able to solve other crimes, e.g. burglaries, thefts and robberies, by questioning people arrested for using drugs.

The argument that drug addicts of certain drugs are forced into crime by prohibition should first and foremost highlight the fact that this argument presupposes and underlines the addictive nature of some illicit drugs (which legalization proponents often downplay), addictive enough to create a viable criminal supply industry.  Secondly, the harms of increased addictive drug use, which as previously outlined would be a consequence of legalization and its cheaper prices, far outweigh the current crime harms of prohibition.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt; It is worth pointing out, this argument is not useful for substances such as LSD and mescaline, with no addictive properties.

Although criminal punishments vary with rooting out drug usage, it is not the foremost eradication technique to resolve drug abuse issues. In order to combat these issues, the application of treatment and support group resources coupled with community support and understanding, has far higher long-term potential to cure the ever-growing epidemic plaguing the nation, especially in rural areas.

===Arguments for drug law reform===

====Violence and profits of drugs traffickers====
Prohibition protects the drug cartel insofar as it keeps the distribution in the [[black market]] and creates the risk that makes smuggling profitable.&lt;ref name="Trebach-LibertyAndDrugs"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedman and Szasz on Liberty and Drugs: Essays on the Free Market and Prohibition |last=Trebach |first=Arnold S. |authorlink= |author2=Kevin B.

:"I learned that not only did they not fear our war on drugs, they ''counted on it'' to increase the market price and to weed out the smaller, inefficient drug dealers. They found U.S. interdiction efforts laughable. The only U.S. action they feared was an effective demand reduction program. On one undercover tape-recorded conversation, a top cartel chief, Jorge Roman, expressed his gratitude for the drug war, calling it "a sham put on for the American taxpayer" that was actually "good for business".&lt;ref&gt;After Prohibition. An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century. p92. {{ISBN|1-882577-94-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of drug prohibition often cite the fact that the end of alcohol prohibition in 1933 led to immediate decreases in murders and robberies to support the argument that legalization of drugs could have similar effects. Once those involved in the narcotics trade have a legal method of settling business disputes, the number of murders and violent crime could drop. [[Robert W. Sweet]], a federal judge, strongly agrees: "The present policy of trying to prohibit the use of drugs through the use of criminal law is a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;Riga, Peter J. (July 1993).

Retrieved March 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When alcohol use was outlawed during prohibition, it gave rise to gang warfare and spurred the formation of some of the most well known criminals of the era, among them the infamous [[Al Capone]]. Similarly, drug dealers today resolve their disputes through violence and intimidation, something which legal drug vendors do not do. Prohibition critics also point to the fact that [[police]] are more likely to be corrupted in a system where [[bribe]] money is so available. Police corruption due to drugs is widespread enough that one pro-legalization newsletter has made it a weekly feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthedrugwar.org|title=StoptheDrugWar.org – raising awareness of the consequences of prohibition|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504023125/http://www.stopthedrugwar.org/|archivedate=2006-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2010, former [[Interpol]] President [[Jackie Selebi]] was found guilty of corruption by the South African [[High Courts of South Africa|High Court]] in Johannesburg for accepting bribes worth US$156,000 from a drug trafficker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-S Africa police chief convicted|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2010/07/201072111013944348.html|work=Al Jazeera|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=2012-05-31|date=2010-07-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102144130/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2010/07/201072111013944348.html|archivedate=2012-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being charged in January 2008, Selebi resigned as president of Interpol and was put on extended leave as National Police Commissioner of South Africa.

====Children being lured into the illegal drug trade====
Janet Crist of the White House [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] mentioned that the anti-drug efforts have had "no direct effect on either the price or the availability of cocaine on our streets".&lt;ref name=Boaz1999&gt;Boaz, David (16 June 1999).

The lack of government regulation and control over the lucrative illegal drug market has created a large population of unregulated drug dealers who lure many children into the illegal drug trade. The U.S. government's most recent 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported that nationwide over 800,000 adolescents ages 12–17 sold illegal drugs during the previous 12 months preceding the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k6nsduh/2k6Results.htm|title=Data|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014180559/http://oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k6nsduh/2k6Results.htm|archivedate=2007-10-14|df=|access-date=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 [[Youth Risk Behavior Survey]] by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that nationwide 25.4% of students had been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug by someone on school property. The prevalence of having been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school property ranged from 15.5% to 38.7% across state CDC surveys (median: 26.1%) and from 20.3% to 40.0% across local surveys (median: 29.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5505a1.htm|title=Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance --- United States, 2005|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916181902/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5505a1.htm|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana "easy to obtain." That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/data/05data/pr05t13.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724223128/http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/data/05data/pr05t13.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental====
With respect to drug crop cultivation, eradication efforts in line with prohibitionist drug policies ultimately force coca, poppy, and marijuana growers into more remote, ecologically sensitive areas.&lt;ref name="Narco-deforestation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McSweeney|first1=Kendra|last2=Nielsen|first2=Erik|last3=Taylor|first3=Matthew|last4=Wrathall|first4=David|last5=Pearson|first5=Zoe|last6=Wang|first6=Ophelia|last7=Plumb|first7=Spencer|title=Drug Policy as Conservation Policy: Narco-Deforestation|journal=Science|date=January 31, 2014|volume=343|pages=489–490|url=http://raisg.socioambiental.org/system/files/Science-2014-McSweeney-489-90.pdf|doi=10.1126/science.1244082|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082809/http://raisg.socioambiental.org/system/files/Science-2014-McSweeney-489-90.pdf|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crops, which are generally grown away from urban centers and state presence, tend to deplete forestland and expand the agricultural frontier.  Out of fear of eradication, cultivators are incentivized to accelerate production cycles in order to obtain the highest yield in the shortest period of time; the pace and methods used by growers neglect measures to promote sustainability, exacerbating the environmental impact.  Drug cultivators typically opt to produce in areas with ecosystems with abundant plant biomass to better conceal their operations.  Ultimately, this practice leads to increased deforestation which contributes to a greater influx of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the atmosphere.  Moreover, the aerial spraying of herbicides such as [[glyphosate]] used in eradication and control efforts have been shown to have negative effects on environmental and human health.&lt;ref name="OAS Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Insulza|first1=José Miguel|last2=Blackwell|first2=Adam|last3=Simons|first3=Paul|last4=Briones|first4=Alvaro|last5=Cumsille|first5=Francisco|last6=Henao|first6=Adriana|last7=Pardo|first7=Bryce|title=The Drug Problem in the Americas|url=http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/press/Introduction_and_Analytical_Report.pdf|website=OAS.org|publisher=Organization of American States|accessdate=2015-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010437/http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/press/Introduction_and_Analytical_Report.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[balloon effect]]" also operates further up the drug commodity chain in countries where drugs are trafficked rather than cultivated.  Like eradication programs, interdiction pushes traffickers into remote areas where they exacerbate preexisting pressures on forestland.  Traffickers use slash and burn practices to convert forest into arable land for cash crop production for the purposes of money laundering as well as the construction of clandestine roads and airstrips.  The [[War on Drugs|war on drugs]] and prohibitionist policies only serve to aggravate the already detrimental impacts of narco-trafficking on [[Deforestation in Central America|Central American forests]].  Intensified ecological devastation across cultivation and trafficking zones is yet another negative unintended consequence of emphasis on supply-side narcotic reduction borne by poor countries.&lt;ref name="Narco-deforestation"/&gt;

==Discriminatory==

===Arguments for inconsistent drug laws===
In response to the issue of consistency with regard to drug prohibition and the dangers of alcohol former director of the ONDCP [[John P. Walters]], has said, "It's ludicrous to say we have a great deal of problems from the use of alcohol so we should multiply that with marijuana".&lt;ref name=Stein2002/&gt;

===Arguments against inconsistent drug laws===
Since alcohol [[prohibition]] ended and the [[War on Drugs]] began there has been much debate over the issue of consistency among legislators with regard to drug prohibition. Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystisis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to [[anecdotal evidence]], they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/drving.htm |title=Impaired Driving |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2008-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313181132/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/drving.htm |archivedate=2008-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most "dangerous" drugs. When the level of harm associated with the other drugs includes harm that arises solely as a result of the drugs illegality rather than merely that danger which is associated with actually using the drugs, only heroin, cocaine, barbiturates and street methadone were shown to be more harmful than the legal drug alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In February 2009, the UK government was accused by its most senior expert drugs adviser Professor [[David Nutt]] of making political decisions with regard to drug classification, for example in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade ecstasy from a class A drug. The [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) report on ecstasy, based on a 12-month study of 4,000 academic papers, concluded that it is nowhere near as dangerous as other class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and should be downgraded to class B. The advice was not followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Travis, Alan|date=February 2009|title=Government criticised over refusal to downgrade ecstasy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/11/ecstasy-downgrade-drugs-class|publisher=''The Guardian''|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202142834/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/11/ecstasy-downgrade-drugs-class|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacqui Smith]], then Home Secretary, was also widely criticised by the scientific community for bullying Professor David Nutt into apologising for his comments that, in the course of a normal year, more people died from falling off horses than died from taking ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kmietowicz, Zosia|date=February 2009|title=Home secretary accused of bullying drugs adviser over comments about ecstasy|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/338/feb13_1/b612|publisher=''British Medical Journal''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215113723/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/338/feb13_1/b612|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Nutt was later sacked by Jacqui Smith's successor as Home Secretary [[Alan Johnson]]; Johnson saying "It is important that the government's messages on drugs are clear and as an advisor you do nothing to undermine public understanding of them.

====Consistency between drugs====
In the United States, defendants convicted of selling crack cocaine receive equal sentences to those convicted of selling 100 times the same amount of powder cocaine. This disparity was lessened during the Obama administration when the [[Fair Sentencing Act 2010]] changed the ratio to 18 to 1. The majority of offenders convicted for selling crack are poor and/or [[black people|black]], while the majority of those convicted for selling cocaine are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindesmith.org/library/factsheets/effectivenes/index.cfm|title=lindesmith.org|author=|date=|website=www.lindesmith.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030101071839/http://www.lindesmith.org/library/factsheets/effectivenes/index.cfm|archivedate=1 January 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Same policy for distinct drugs====
Many drug policies group all illegal drugs into a single category. Since drugs drastically vary in their effects, addictive potential, dosages, methods of production, and consumption the arguments either way could be seen as inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Weil-TheNaturalMind-17" /&gt;

====Race and enforcement of drug laws====

==Civil rights==

===Civil rights arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
Article 33 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] reads:

:''States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislative, administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances as defined in the relevant international treaties and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances.''

Drug Free Australia argues:

:''The notion that illicit drug use is a victimless crime and that everyone should be free to do what they want with their body disregards the web of social interactions that constitute human existence. Affected by an individual's illicit drug use are children, parents, grandparents, friends, colleagues, work, victims of drugged drivers, crime victims, [[elder abuse]], sexual victims etc. Illicit drug use is no less victimless than alcoholism.''&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

Drug Free Australia gives the example that in 2007 one in every nine children under the age of 18 in the United States lived with at least one drug dependent or drug abusing parent. 2.1 million children in the United States live with at least one parent who was dependent on or abused illicit drugs.

The [[Christian Institute]] argues that there is no point in having criminal laws unless those caught breaking them will at least face prosecution.  Less serious offenses, such as failing to complete a census form, may also attract a criminal record, so the contention that criminalizing drug use is draconian can be seen as overstatement.&lt;ref name="ChristianInstitute"&gt;The Christian Institute {{cite web |url= http://www.christian.org.uk/html-publications/cannabis.htm |title= Going Soft on Cannabis |accessdate= 2010-04-20 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227163718/http://www.christian.org.uk/html-publications/cannabis.htm |archivedate= 2010-12-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Parental substance dependence and abuse can have profound effects on children, including child abuse and neglect, injuries and deaths related to motor vehicle accidents, and increased odds that the children will become substance dependent or abusers themselves. Up-to-date estimates of the number of children living with substance-dependent or substance-abusing parents are needed for planning both adult treatment and prevention efforts and programs that support and protect affected children."&lt;ref name="oas.samhsa.gov"&gt;US National Survey on Drug Use and Health{{cite web |url=http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/2k9/SAparents/SAparents.htm |title=Children Living with Substance-Dependent or Substance-Abusing Parents: 2002 to 2007 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504195452/http://oas.samhsa.gov/2k9/SAparents/SAparents.htm |archivedate=2009-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug Free Australia concludes any democratic society that deems the use of a certain drug to present unacceptable harm to the individual user, to present unacceptable harm to the users' surrounding community or to transfer too great a burden to the community will seek legislation which will curb that particular freedom of the individual.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

Many people argue that only drug dealers should be fought and not the drug users themselves.  But this rests on the fundamental error that big-time drugs smugglers and dealers hawk illicit drugs to new consumers.  This is most often not the case.  Rather it is the users themselves that are mostly responsible for recruiting new users through networks of friends or relatives&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare {{cite web |url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10674 |title=2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey – detailed findings |page=117 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903150752/http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10674 |archivedate=2010-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that users need to be targeted as the recruiters of new drug use, and that an emphasis on early rehabilitation for young users is the best answer to curbing widespread dealing.

Likewise, the proposal that addictive drugs should be legalized, regulated and opened to "free market dynamics" is immediately belied by the recognition that the drug market for an addict is no longer a free market –  it is clear that they will pay any price when needing their drug.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"/&gt;

===Civil rights arguments for drug law reform===

====Cognitive liberty====
{{Main|Cognitive liberty}}
Authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Terence McKenna]] believed that what persons do in private should not be regulated by the government. It is argued that persons should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, including the recreational use of drugs, as long as they do not harm others. Such arguments often cite the [[harm principle]] of philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.' The argument is that drug use is a [[victimless crime]] and as such the government has no right to prohibit it or punish drug consumers, much like the government does not forbid overeating, which causes significantly more deaths per year. This can be equated with the quest for [[freedom of thought]].

====Spiritual and religious====
{{"|We're playing with half a deck as long as we tolerate that the cardinals of government and science should dictate where human curiosity can legitimately send its attention and where it can not. It's an essentially preposterous situation. It is essentially a civil rights issue, because what we're talking about here is the repression of a religious sensibility. In fact, not ''a'' religious sensibility, ''the'' religious sensibility.|[[Terence McKenna]] in: ''Non-Ordinary States Through Vision Plants'', Sound Photosynthesis, Mill Valley CA., 1988, {{ISBN|1-56964-709-7}}}}

Some religious groups including the ''[[União do Vegetal]]'', the [[Native American Church]], the [[Bwiti]] religion and the [[Rastafari movement]] (see [[religious and spiritual use of cannabis]]) use psychoactive substances as sacrament in religious rituals. In some religious practice, drugs are sometimes used as a conduit to an oceanic feeling or divine union, equated with [[mysticism]] or [[entheogen]]ic ('that which causes God to be within an individual') experiences. In others, the 'entactogenic' qualities of drugs are used to enhance feelings of [[empathy]] among congregations.&lt;ref name="Weil-TheNaturalMind-19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Natural Mind—An Investigation of Drugs and the Higher Consciousness |last=Weil |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Weil |year=1985 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=19–20 |isbn=0-395-91156-7 |quote=It is my belief that the desire to alter consciousness periodically is an innate, normal drive analogous to hunger or the sexual drive. Note that I do not say 'desire to alter consciousness by means of chemical agents.' Drugs a merely one means of satisfying this drive; there are many others, and I will discuss them in due course. In postulating an inborn drive of this sort, I am not advancing a proposition to be proved or disproved but simply a model to be tried out for usefulness in simplifying our understanding of our observations. The model I propose is consistent with observable evidence. In particular, the omnipresence of the phenomenon argues that we are dealing not with something socially or culturally based but rather with a biological characteristic of the species. Furthermore, the need for periods of nonordinary consciousness begins to be expressed at ages far too young for it to have much to do with social conditioning. Anyone who watches very young children without revealing his presence will find them regularly practicing techniques that induce striking changes in mental states. Three- and four-year-olds, for example, commonly whirl themselves into vertiginous stupors. They hyperventilate and have other children squeeze them around the chest until they faint. They also choke each other to produce loss of consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To my knowledge these practices appear spontaneously among children of all societies, and I suspect they have done so throughout history as well. In our society, children quickly learn to keep this sort of play out of sight of grownups, who instinctively try to stop them. The sight of a child being throttled into unconsciousness scares the parent, but the child seems to have a wonderful time; at least, he goes right off and does it again.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal development and exploration====
Some people believe that altered states of consciousness enable many people to push the boundaries of human experience, knowledge, and creativity. There is thus a moral imperative to experiment with drugs in terms of human progress, teleological development, or just increased artistic creativity; such ideas are central to [[Cognitive Liberty]], [[Terence McKenna#The "Stoned Ape" hypothesis of human evolution|Stoned Ape Hypothesis]] and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]''.&lt;ref name="McKenna-FoodOfTheGods"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge—A Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution |last=McKenna |first=Terence |authorlink=Terence McKenna |year=1993 |publisher=Bantam |isbn=0-553-37130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lilly-TheCentreOfTheCyclone"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Centre of the Cyclone |last=Lilly |first=John C. |authorlink=John C.

==Moral and ethical reasons==

===Moral arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}

===Moral arguments for drug law reform===
Many people, including some religious groups,&lt;ref&gt;Schabner, Dean. "[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91004&amp;page=1 Religious Groups Call Drug War Immoral]". ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Father John Clifton Marquis. (May 1990). "[http://idpi.us/compassion/resources/writings-by-religious-leaders/drug-laws-are-immoral Drug Laws are Immoral]". U.S. Catholic.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the war on drugs is itself immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Simon (September 2009). "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/03/drugs-prohibition-latin-america The war on drugs is immoral idiocy. We need the courage of Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907113913/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/03/drugs-prohibition-latin-america |date=2013-09-07 }}". ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Richard Brunstrom]], the Chief Constable of North Wales, one of Britain's most senior police officers, said "If policy on drugs is in future to be pragmatic not moralistic, driven by ethics not dogma, then the current prohibitionist stance will have to be swept away as both unworkable and immoral, to be replaced with an evidence-based unified system (specifically including tobacco and alcohol) aimed at minimisation of harms to society."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jonathan; Langton David (October 2007). "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/legalise-all-drugs-chief-constable-demands-end-to-immoral-laws-396884.html Legalise all drugs: chief constable demands end to 'immoral laws'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804223225/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/legalise-all-drugs-chief-constable-demands-end-to-immoral-laws-396884.html |date=2016-08-04 }}". ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author and physician [[Andrew Weil]] has commented on the peculiar attitude and emotional bias of some people who think "drug taking is bad", but who nevertheless consume alcohol, and formulate the unhelpful conception "We drink. Therefore alcohol is not a drug."&lt;ref name="Weil-TheNaturalMind-17"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Natural Mind—An Investigation of Drugs and the Higher Consciousness |last=Weil |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Weil |year=1985 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=17–18 |isbn=0-395-91156-7 |quote=The use of drugs to alter consciousness is nothing new. It has been a feature of human life in all places on the earth and all ages of history. In fact, to my knowledge, the only people lacking a traditional intoxicant are the Eskimos, who had the misfortune to be unable to grow anything and had to wait for the white men to bring them alcohol. Alcohol of course, has always been the most commonly used drug simply because it does not take much effort to discover that the consumption of fermented juices produces interesting variations from ordinary consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ubiquity of drug use is so striking that it must represent a basic human appetite. Yet many Americans seem to feel that the contemporary drug scene is something new, something qualitatively different from what has gone before. This attitude is peculiar because all that is really happening is a change in drug preference. There is no evidence that a greater percentage of Americans are taking drugs, only that younger Americans are coming to prefer illegal drugs like marijuana and hallucinogens to alcohol. Therefore, people who insist that everyone is suddenly taking drugs must not see alcohol in the category of drugs. Evidence that this is precisely the case is abundant, and it proves another example of how emotional biases lead us to formulate unhelpful conceptions. Drug taking is bad. We drink alcohol. Therefore alcohol is not a drug. It is, instead, a 'pick-me-up,' a 'thirst quencher,' a 'social lubricant,' 'an indispensable accompaniment to fine food,' and a variety of other euphemisms. Or, if it is a drug, at least it is not one of those bad drugs that the hippies use.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK drug policy reform group [[Release (agency)|Release]] believe that the stigma attached to drug use needs to be removed. Release's actions have included challenging such stigmatisation with its "Nice People Take Drugs" advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.release.org.uk/nice-people-take-drugs Nice People Take Drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327194255/http://www.release.org.uk/nice-people-take-drugs |date=2010-03-27 }}.

===Sending out signals===

====Arguments for sending out signals====
Some argue that sending out signals should be a consideration of drug policy. Previous UK Home Office Minister [[Vernon Coaker]] argued "is not part of any system with respect to drugs ... not only trying to send messages out to people who misuse drugs but also about trying to send messages out to people out there in the community?"&lt;ref name="5thReport"&gt;House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology (2006). [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmsctech/1031/103109.htm#a24 Fifth Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414234018/https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmsctech/1031/103109.htm |date=2018-04-14 }}. UK Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: "I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers – and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers – that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There's a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it's unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;Batty, David (2008). [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/03/drugspolicy PM keen to reclassify cannabis despite committee advice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313133523/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/03/drugspolicy |date=2016-03-13 }}. ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against sending out signals====
The [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into the Government's handling of scientific advice, risk and evidence in policy making agreed with [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]]'s view that "Criminal law is supposed to prevent crime, not 'send out' public health messages". Transform warned that sending out signals could backfire by "fostering distrust of police and public health messages amongst young people". The Select Committee's report said "The Government's desire to use the Class of a particular drug to send out a signal to potential users or dealers does not sit comfortably with the claim that the primary objective of the classification system is to categorise drugs according to the comparative harm associated with their misuse. It is also incompatible with the Government's stated commitment to evidence based policy making since it has never undertaken research to establish the relationship between the Class of a drug and the signal sent out and there is, therefore, no evidence base on which to draw in making these policy decisions."&lt;ref name="5thReport"/&gt;

===Political calculation===

====Arguments for political calculation====
John Donnelly, writing for the Boston Globe on the presidential race of 2000, suggested that the candidates' silence on drug policy may stem from a widely shared belief that any position even hinting at reducing penalties for drug use would be political suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Drug policy academic [[Mark A.R. Kleiman]] has argued: {{"|There are things we can do about drug policy that would reduce the number of people in prison, and the extent of drug abuse and drug related crime. Legalization isn't one of them because there's not public support for it. And if we acknowledge the fact that, from the point of view of the majority of the population it's a loser, then it's not as if we can talk them out of that, so I think the legalization debate is mostly a distraction from doing the real work of fixing our drug policies|Scott Morgan, quoting Mark Kleiman, [http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle_blog/2008/feb/18/rule_1_of_drug_legalization_is_d Rule #1 of Drug Legalization is Don't Talk About Drug Legalization], Drug Reform Coordination Network, February 2008.}}

Scott Morgan reports how he once attended a discussion of Peter Reuter and David Boyum's book ''An Analytic Assessment of U.S. Drug Policy'', in which the authors admitted ignoring the legalization option in their analysis. Boyum claimed that there was no legitimate political support for ending the drug war and that he and Reuter had therefore confined themselves to recommendations that they thought were politically viable.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Scott.

====Arguments against political calculation====
Two teenagers deaths in March 2010 triggered nationwide concern about the drug [[mephedrone]] in the UK. The [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) recommended a ban on 29 March, which was quickly passed into law, but the decision was criticised for being politically rather than scientifically driven and led to the resignation of the ACMD's Eric Carlin, the eighth member of the council to leave in five months in protest at what was seen as political interference. Toxicology reports released later in May 2010 revealed that the boys had never taken the drug.

Professor [[Colin Blakemore]], professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: "This shocking news should be a salutary lesson to tabloid journalists and prejudiced politicians who held a gun to the heads of the ACMD and demanded that this drug should be banned before a single autopsy had been completed ... The politicians talk about using drug classification as a way of sending 'messages' to young people. I fear that the only message that will be sent by the hasty decision on mephedrone is that the drug laws deserve no respect."

Professor David Nutt, the former chairman of the ACMD, said: "the previous government's rush to ban mephedrone never had any serious scientific credibility – it looks much more like a decision based on a short-term electoral calculation. This news demonstrates why it's so important to base drug classification on the evidence, not fear, and why the police, media and politicians should only make public pronouncements once the facts are clear."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Laurance, Health Editor, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mephedrone-did-not-kill-youths-tests-reveal-1986193.html ''Mephedrone did not kill youths, tests reveal''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212204211/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mephedrone-did-not-kill-youths-tests-reveal-1986193.html |date=2017-02-12 }}", ''The Independent'' (UK), May 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

}} 1928&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the view of those who could not control their use of the licit drug alcohol. The use of illicit drugs has been prohibited internationally since 1912, an entire century, because of international agreement that the general community has a greater right to protect itself from the harms of illicit drug use than does an individual user to use a harmful substance recreationally.

Currently there is still greater public support for the continued prohibiting of illicit drug use than there is for legalizing and regulating the use of these substances. In the United States 82% of those polled by the Family Research Association in 1998 were opposed to the legalization of heroin and cocaine in the same manner as alcohol is legal.&lt;ref name="drugwatch.org"/&gt;  In October 2009 a Gallup poll found that 54% of those polled were against the legalization of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/123728/u.s.-support-legalizing-marijuana-reaches-new-high.aspx |title=US Support For Legalizing Marijuana Reaches New High |accessdate=2009-11-08 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091104163117/http://www.gallup.com/poll/123728/U.S.-Support-Legalizing-Marijuana-Reaches-New-High.aspx| archivedate=2009-11-04 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |year=1999 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, which has had the highest levels of illicit drug use in [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (or OECD) countries for more than a decade,&lt;ref&gt;see for example UNODC {{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2000.html |title= World Drug Report 2000 |accessdate=2010-05-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100417180244/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2000.html| archivedate=2010-04-17 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} 2001 pp 162–165 (see aggregated average for each OECD country in Harm Reduction Discussion page)&lt;/ref&gt; according to a 2007 survey, 95% of Australians do not support the legalization of heroin, cocaine and amphetamines, and 79% do not support the legalization of cannabis.&lt;ref name=AIHW2008&gt;{{cite report

It can be argued that the negative attitudes to illicit drug use which issued in the international drug Conventions, with prohibitions against their use 100 years ago, still exist today. Taking again statistics from Australia, 97% disapprove of the regular use of heroin, 96% disapprove the regular use of amphetamines or cocaine, and 76.5% disapprove of the regular use of cannabis. In any democracy where "the will of the people" is respected by its political representatives, the prohibition of these substance might well be expected to remain intact.&lt;ref name="AIHW2008"/&gt;

===Public opinion on drug law reform===
According to [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]], over the past decade there has been strong shift in public opinion in favour of drug policy reform. This shift has taken place ''despite'' successive government's reluctance to consider or debate the subject, or even call to for an independent inquiry.

A national telephone survey conducted in 1993 found that between 52% and 55% of Australians believed that growing and possessing cannabis for personal use should be legalised.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Russell Newcombe (December 2004). [http://www.tdpf.org.uk/newcombe2004.pdf Attitudes to Drug Policy and Drug Laws; a review of the international evidence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928122416/http://www.tdpf.org.uk/newcombe2004.pdf |date=September 28, 2011 }}. School of Psychology, Faculty of Science Liverpool John Moore's University.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ICM poll of 1201 people for ''The Guardian'' in 1998 found that 47% believed that the illegality of drugs actually encourages young people to try them.

46% of UK adults in a 2002 Guardian poll (of 1075) felt that drug addicts who register themselves as such should have access to certain illegal drugs via prescription.

An ICM poll of 1008 UK adults (aged 16+) for ''The Guardian'' in 2008 found that 38% would support a scheme, similar to that established in Portugal and Spain, whereby it is not a criminal offence to possess and use drugs privately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/MediaNews_FactResearchGuide_public_opinion.htm Public opinion on drugs and drug policy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724002325/http://www.tdpf.org.uk/MediaNews_FactResearchGuide_public_opinion.htm |date=July 24, 2010 }}.

Following [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s win of the 2008 [[presidential election]], [[Change.gov]] hosted a service on their website named the [[Citizen's Briefing Book]] allowing United States citizens to give their opinion on the most important issues in America, and allow others to vote up or down on those ideas. The top ten ideas are to be given to Obama on the day of his inauguration, January 20, 2009. The most popular idea according to respondents was "Ending Marijuana Prohibition", earning 92,970 points and obtaining a total of 3,550 comments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090114023405/http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/ideas/viewIdea.apexp?id=087800000004lrP Most popular argument on citizensbriefingbook.change.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;
The second most popular hope, by contrast, was "Commit to becoming the "Greenest" country in the world." with 70,470 points.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090114030238/http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/ideas/viewIdea.apexp?id=087800000004muZ Commit to becoming the greenest country in the world, citizensbriefingbook.change.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana has seen a renaissance in its utopian representation in films such as the suburban satire ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999, dir. Sam Mendes) and the stoner comedy ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'' (2008, dir. David Gordon Green). Another venue for contemporary criticism of marijuana prohibition is television, such as the SHOWTIME series ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' (2005–2012, dev. Jenji Kohan); the HBO series ''[[True Blood (TV series)|True Blood]]'' (2008–2014, dev. Alan Ball); and adult animation shows such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[American Dad!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braun|first1=James R|last2=Lavoie|first2=Dusty|title=Marijuanatopia?|year=2011|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations|location=ProQuest Dissertations|isbn=978-1-243-67119-6|page=333|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/34/84/3484680.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528083717/http://gradworks.umi.com/34/84/3484680.html|archivedate=2014-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Simon]], creator of the television series ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', in 2011 told [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] that he'd "give him another season of the [[HBO]] show for an end to the [[war on drugs]]." Holder had invited show stars [[Wendell Pierce]], [[Sonja Sohn]], and [[Jim True-Frost]] to Washington on behalf of an anti-drug public relations campaign and at the time called on Simon and [[Ed Burns]] for another season or a movie of the show. Simon replied via a letter to a newspaper offering the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mychal Denzel, [http://www.theroot.com/views/fair-trade-drugs?wpisrc=xs_wp_0005 "A Fair Trade on Drugs"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209144132/http://www.theroot.com/views/fair-trade-drugs?wpisrc=xs_wp_0005 |date=February 9, 2012 }}, ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'', June 17, 2011 at 12:37 AM.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7576">An '''astronomical complex''' or '''commemorative astronomical complex''' is a series of man-made structures with an [[astronomy|astronomical]] purpose. It has been used when referring to a group of [[Megalithic]] structures that it is claimed show high precision astronomical alignments.&lt;ref name="Laporte1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Juan Pedro Laporte]]|title=Tikal y Uaxactún en el preclásico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ic-RR4r720IC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=13 March 2011|year=1993|publisher=UNAM|isbn=978-968-36-2673-8|pages=5, 9, 27, 37, 38, 72, 79, 81, 86 &amp; 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fialko, Vilma., Laporte, Juan Pedro., New Perspectives on Old Problems: Dynastic references for the Early Classic at Tikal. In Vision and Revision in Maya Studies, edited by F. Clancy and P. Harrison, pp. 33–66, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For the study of [[Archaeoastronomy]], such complexes of similar structures are required for adequate measurement and calculation to ensure that similar celestial sightlines were intended by the designers. These arrangements have also been known as observational, [[ceremonial]] or [[ritual]] complexes with importance for the study of prehistoric cultures.

The term has been used in the naming of various series of [[observatories]] used for observing the stars in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ripio Turismo|url=http://www.ripioturismo.com.ar/np-leo.htm|title=National Parks and Reserves in Argentina: El Leoncito National Park|accessdate=2006-09-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060908204759/http://www.ripioturismo.com.ar/np-leo.htm| archivedate= 8 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito |url=http://www.casleo.gov.ar/indexingles.htm |title=Public Outreach |accessdate=2006-09-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829173510/http://www.casleo.gov.ar/indexingles.htm |archivedate=2006-08-29 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient astronomical complexes==
{{see|List of archaeoastronomical sites by country}}
Examples of suggested ancient astronomical complexes that may have been used as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Moon|lunar]] [[observatories]] include, in reverse-chronological order:

===Mesoamerica===
* The E-group ruins of a plaza with three temples and two viewing platforms at [[Uaxactún]], near the [[Petén Basin]], [[Guatemala]], accredited to the [[Mayan civilization]] referred to as a ''Complejo Conmemorativo Astronomico''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fh402zxnOQcC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=astronomical+complex&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t9R2TZq_FdCwhAfEi5n6Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=astronomical%20complex&amp;f=false Rice, Prudence M., Maya political science: time, astronomy, and the cosmos, Page 87, University of Texas Press, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
* It has been suggested that the grouping of [[stone circles]] and ridge-top [[cairns]] on [[Bodmin Moor]] in [[Cornwall]] compose a ritual or astronomical complex.&lt;ref name="CollegeArchaeology2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=University College|author2=London.

* The series of recumbent [[stone circles]] in [[Aberdeenshire]] in the North East of [[Scotland]], including [[Balquhain]] stone circle and the cupmarked stone on its west flank.
* [[Wandlebury Hill]], Portingbury Warren Mound in [[Portingbury Hills]] and a series of 11 marker stones including the [[Leper Stone]] in [[Cambridgeshire]] and [[Essex]] in [[England]], also known as the [[Wandlebury Enigma]] or ''The Wandlebury-Hatfield Heath Astronomical Complex''.&lt;ref name="Hoppit1978"&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Hoppit | title = The Wandlebury Enigma Solved? – Line A Loxodrome | year = 1978 | work = ''Sunday Telegraph Magazine'', Issue 78, March 18th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe===
* [[Goseck circle]] and other [[Neolithic circular enclosures in Central Europe]]

===Nile Valley===
* The circular stone structure (calendar circle) at [[Nabta Playa]] in [[Egypt]] dating to the [[5th millennium BC]] is believed to be the among the oldest astronomical complexes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NJI5KiH6MLsC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=astronomical+complex&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t9R2TZq_FdCwhAfEi5n6Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=astronomical%20complex&amp;f=false Bauval, Robert., The Egypt Code, Page 277, Century, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levant===
* In 2006, then [[Atlit Yam]] was discovered in Israel in 2009, dated with certainty to at least 6300 BCE, at which point it was abandoned and submerged in the Mediterranean, but still being excavated and analyzed as of 2014. Atlit Yam has human skeletons ceremoniously buried, and is a small semi-circle of long, narrow uprighted stones etched with [[cupmarks]].
* [[Rogem Hiri]], 40,000,000&amp;nbsp;kg of stone with a 'gate' or opening in the outer stone circle through which the sun rises on each Summer Solstice (with this 'gate' matching the Summer Solstice's sunrise even more accurately millennia ago), and a burial chamber in the center under two 5-tonne megaliths, a layer of circa 3,000 BCE exposed, with a surveyed but unexcavated, estimated 4,000 BCE, layer beneath.
* [[Mnajdra]] and other [[Megalithic Temples of Malta]], circa 3100 BCE and younger.

==Modern astronomical complexes==

Examples of modern astronomical complexes of [[star|stellar]] observatories include:

* The [[Leoncito Astronomical Complex]] in the [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan Province]] of [[Argentina]].
* The [[University of Idaho]] Astronomical Complex in the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M6ZuNwAACAAJ Johnson, Mark, R., University of Idaho Astronomical Complex, Moscow, Idaho, 214 pages, University of Idaho, 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5115">[[Image:Ballotboxballs.jpg|thumb|right|One of the earliest American [[ballot box]]es using [[ballot]]tas. This ballot box was used by members of the [[Association of the Oldest Inhabitants of the District of Columbia]], a social club.]]

'''Blackballing''' is a rejection in a traditional form of [[secret ballot]], where a white ball or [[ballot]] constitutes a vote in support and a black ball signifies opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blackball|title= Blackball|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is typically used where a club's rules provide that one or two objections, rather than an at-least-50% share of votes, are sufficient to defeat a proposition.  Since the seventeenth century, these rules have commonly applied to elections to membership of many [[gentlemen's club]]s and similar institutions such as [[Freemasonry]] and [[fraternities]].
 
A large supply of black and white balls is provided for voters. Each voter audibly casts a single ball into the [[ballot box]] under cover of the box, or of a combination of a cloth and the box itself, so that observers can see who votes but not how they are voting. When all voting is complete, the box is opened and the balls displayed: all present can immediately see the result, without any means of knowing which members are objecting.

==Overview==
The principle of such election rules in a club is that it is self-perpetuating to preserve the current ethos (and exclusivity) of the club, by ensuring that candidates are congenial to (almost) all the existing members; i.e., new members are elected by unanimous or near-unanimous agreement of voting members. A difference of opinions could be divisive, so that an election must be taken secretly as well as correctly.

The number of votes in support is often irrelevant, except to prove a quorum.  Whilst in many such cases even a single black ball will be fatal to the candidate's election, rules in larger clubs ensure that a single member cannot exercise a veto to the detriment of the future of the club. For example, two black balls are required to exclude; a limited category or committee of members vote, rather than all members; or in the event of a blackball, the election may be repeated immediately to ensure that there is no mistake, or after a fixed period to allow further information or opinions to be discussed discreetly. A variant sometimes used is that all incoming candidates are voted on as a group; if the group as a whole is blackballed, then each member must be voted on individually.

The practice also found popularity in areas outside of [[social clubs]]. In the [[Soviet Union]], dissertation panels would typically cast their vote on a [[thesis defense]] using this system.

''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' notes that the use of black and white balls can be ordered by passing an [[incidental motion]] to that effect. The manual notes, "This custom, however, is apparently declining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 283, 412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term still remains in use for many different electoral systems which have applied from club to club and from time to time: for example, instead of differently coloured balls, ballot-balls may be dropped into separate "yes" or "no" drawers inside the ballot box.

In some Masons' lodges, a black cube is used instead of a black ball so that a black ball can be differentiated from a dirty white ball, as the lighting in the meeting hall is very dim during voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Image:Scribe Book Scanner.jpg|thumb|[[Internet Archive]] Scribe book scanner in 2011]]
[[File:Internet Archive book scanner 1.jpg|thumb|Internet Archive book scanner]]
'''Book scanning''' (or '''magazine scanning''') is the process of converting physical [[book]]s and magazines into [[digital media]] such as [[digital image|images]], [[electronic text]], or [[e-book|electronic books]] (e-books) by using an [[image scanner]].

Digital books can be easily distributed, reproduced, and [[screen reading|read on-screen]]. Common file formats are [[DjVu]], [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF), and [[Tagged Image File Format]] (TIFF). To convert the raw images [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) is used to turn book pages into a digital text format like [[ASCII]] or other similar format, which reduces the file size and allows the text to be reformatted, searched, or processed by other applications.

Image scanners may be manual or automated. In an ordinary commercial image scanner, the book is placed on a flat glass plate (or platen), and a light and optical array moves across the book underneath the glass. In manual book scanners, the glass plate extends to the edge of the scanner, making it easier to line up the book's spine. Other book scanners place the book face up in a v-shaped frame, and photograph the pages from above. Pages may be turned by hand or by automated paper transport devices. Glass or plastic sheets are usually pressed against the page to flatten it.

After scanning, software adjusts the document images by lining it up, cropping it, picture-editing it, and converting it to text and final e-book form. Human proofreaders usually check the output for errors.

Scanning at {{nowrap|118 dots/centimeter}} ({{nowrap|300 [[dots per inch|dpi]]}}) is adequate for conversion to digital text output, but for archival reproduction of rare, elaborate or illustrated books, much higher resolution is used.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} High-end scanners capable of thousands of pages per hour can cost thousands of dollars, but [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY), manual book scanners capable of 1200 pages per hour have been built for US$300.&lt;ref name="instructables"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-High-Speed-Book-Scanner-from-Trash-and-Cheap-C/|title=DIY High-Speed Book Scanner from Trash and Cheap Cameras|publisher=instructables.com|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial book scanners==
[[File:V-shaped-cradle - en.svg|thumb|Sketch of a V-shaped book scanner from Atiz]]
[[File:book scanner.svg|thumb|Sketch of a typical manual book scanner]]
Commercial book scanners are not like normal [[image scanner|scanners]]; these book scanners are usually a high quality [[digital camera]] with light sources on either side of the camera mounted on some sort of frame to provide easy access for a person or machine to flip through the pages of the book. Some models involve V-shaped book cradles, which provide support for book spines and also center book position automatically.

The advantage of this type of scanner is that it is very fast, compared to the productivity of overhead scanners.

==Book scanning by organizations on a large scale==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Projects like [[Project Gutenberg]] (est. 1971), [[Million Book Project]] (est. circa 2001), [[Google Books]] (est. 2004), and the [[Open Content Alliance]] (est. 2005) scan books on a large scale.

One of the main challenges to this is the sheer volume of books that must be scanned. In 2010 the total number of works appearing as books in human history was estimated to be around 130&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taycher |first=Leonid |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.co.at/2010/08/you-can-count-number-of-books-in-world.html |title=As of Aug 5, 2010, google estimates that there are 129,864,880 different books in the world |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.co.at |date=2010-08-05 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these must be scanned and then made searchable online for the public to use as a [[universal library]]. Currently, there are three main ways that large organizations are relying on: outsourcing, scanning in-house using commercial book scanners, and scanning in-house using robotic scanning solutions.

As for outsourcing, books are often shipped to be scanned by low-cost sources to [[India]] or [[China]]. Alternatively, due to convenience, safety and technology improvement, many organizations choose to scan in-house by using either overhead scanners which are time-consuming, or digital camera-based scanning machines which are substantially faster and is a method employed by Internet Archive as well as Google. Traditional methods have included cutting off the book's spine and scanning the pages in a [[image scanner|scanner]] with automatic page-feeding capability, with subsequent rebinding of the loose pages.

Once the page is scanned, the [[data]] is either entered manually or via OCR, another major cost of the book scanning projects.{{According to whom|date=January 2016}}

Due to [[copyright]] issues, most scanned books are those that are out of copyright; however, [[Google Book Search]] is known to scan books still protected under copyright unless the [[publisher]] specifically prohibits this.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Destructive scanning methods==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
For book scanning on a low budget, the least expensive method to scan a book or magazine is to cut off the binding. This converts the book or magazine into a sheaf of looseleaf papers, which can then be loaded into a standard [[automatic document feeder]] (ADF) and scanned using inexpensive and common scanning technology. While this is not a desirable solution for very old and uncommon books, it is a useful tool for book and magazine scanning where the book is not an expensive collector's item and replacement of the scanned content is easy. There are two technical difficulties with this process, first with the cutting and second with the scanning.

===Unbinding===
More precise and less destructive than cutting pages with a paper guillotine or razor or scissors is the technique of meticulous unbinding by hand, assisted with tools.  This technique has been successfully employed for tens of thousands of pages of archival original paper scanned for the Riazanov Library digital archive project from newspapers and magazines and pamphlets, varying from 50 to 100 years old and more, and often composed of fragile, brittle paper.  Although the monetary value for some collectors (and for most sellers of this sort of material) is destroyed by unbinding, unbinding in many cases actually greatly assists preservation of the physical pages themselves, making them more accessible to researchers and less likely to be damaged when subsequently examined. The down side is that unbound stacks of pages are "fluffed up", and therefore more exposed to oxygen in the air, which may in some cases (theoretically) speed deterioration.  This can be addressed by putting weights on the pages after they are unbound, and storage in appropriate containers.

Hand unbinding will preserve text that runs into the gutters of bindings, and most critically allows more easy and complete high quality scans to be made of two page wide material, such as center cartoons, graphic art, and photos in magazines.  The digital archive of The Liberator 1918-1924 on Marxist Internet Archive nicely demonstrates the quality of two page wide graphic art scans made possible by careful hand unbinding prior to flat bed or other scanning.

Unbinding techniques vary with the binding technology, from simply removing a few staples to unbending and removing nails to meticulous grinding down of layers of glue on the spine of a book to precisely the right point, followed by laborious removal of the string used to hold the book together.

Note that with some newspapers (such as Labor Action 1950-1952) there are columns on the center facing pages that run right in-between the pages.  Chopping off part of the spine of a bound volume of such papers  will lose part of this text.  Even the Greenwood Reprint of this publication failed to preserve the text content of those center columns, cutting off significant amounts of text there.  Only when bound volumes of the original newspaper were meticulously unbound, and the opened pair of center pages were scanned as a single page on a flat bed scanner was the center column content made digitally available. Alternatively, one can present the two facing center pages as three scans. One of each individual page, and one of a page sized area situated over the center of the two pages.

===Cutting===
One method of cutting a stack of 500 to 1000 pages in one pass is accomplished with a [[Paper cutter|guillotine]] paper cutter. This is a large steel table with a paper [[vise]] that screws down onto the stack and firmly secures it before cutting. The cut is accomplished with a large sharpened steel blade which moves straight down and cuts the entire length of each sheet all at once. A lever on the blade permits several hundred pounds of force to be applied to the blade for a quick one-pass cut.

A clean cut through a thick stack of paper cannot be made with a traditional inexpensive sickle-shaped hinged [[paper cutter]]. These cutters are only intended for a few sheets, with up to ten sheets being the practical cutting limit. A large stack of paper applies torsional forces on the hinge, pulling the blade away from the cutting edge on the table. The cut becomes more inaccurate as the cut moves away from the hinge, and the force required to hold the blade against the cutting edge increases as the cut moves away from the hinge.

The guillotine cutting process dulls the blade over time, requiring that it be resharpened. [[Coated paper]] such as slick magazine paper dulls the blade more quickly than plain book paper, due to the [[kaolinite]] [[clay]] coating. Additionally, removing the binding of an entire hardcover book causes excessive wear due to cutting through the cover's stiff backing material. Instead the outer cover can be removed and only interior pages need be cut.

An alternate method of unbinding books is to use a table saw.  While this method is potentially dangerous and does not leave as smooth an edge as the guillotine paper cutter method, it is more readily available to the average person.  The ideal method is to clamp the book between two thick boards using heavy machine screws to provide the clamping force.  The entire wood and book package is fed through the table saw using the rip fence as a guide.  A sharp fine carbide tooth blade is ideal for generating an acceptable cut.  The quality of the cut depends on the blade, feed rate, type of paper, paper coating, and binding material.

===Scanning===
Once the paper is liberated from the spine, it can be scanned one sheet at a time using a traditional [[flatbed scanner]] or [[automatic document feeder]].

Pages with a decorative riffled edging or curving in an arc due to a non-flat binding can be difficult to scan using an ADF. An ADF is designed to scan pages of uniform shape and size, and variably sized or shaped  pages can lead to improper scanning. The riffled edges or curved edge can be guillotined off to render the outer edges flat and smooth before the binding is cut.

The coated paper of magazines and bound textbooks can make them difficult for the rollers in an ADF to pick up and guide along the paper path. An ADF which uses a series of rollers and channels to flip sheets over may jam or misfeed when fed coated paper. Generally there are fewer problems by using as straight of a paper path as is possible, with few bends and curves. The clay can also rub off the paper over time and coat sticky pickup rollers, causing them to loosely grip the paper. The ADF rollers may need periodic cleaning to prevent this slipping.

Magazines can pose a bulk-scanning challenge due to small nonuniform sheets of paper in the stack, such as magazine subscription cards and fold out pages. These need to be removed before the bulk scan begins, and are either scanned separately if they include worthwhile content, or are simply left out of the scan process.

===A test case: PGP===
In 1995, [[Phil Zimmerman]] published ''PGP Source Code and Internals'' as a $60 hardbound book, which under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] could legally be shipped abroad. The buyer could either display it in a library or destructively scan it so that the source code could be compiled via freely available GNU software into the [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) cryptosystem that the U.S. government regarded as a restricted munition. Zimmerman was being prosecuted for distributing PGP software and wanted to test the law in the courts. It was not directly tested, but export restrictions have eased: it is [[Export of cryptography in the United States|legal to export PGP]] anywhere but the seven countries and specified groups and individuals to which nothing can be exported from the U.S.

==Non-destructive scanning==

[[File:MyBookScanner,June12,2011.JPG|thumb|An example of a DIY non-destructive book scanner/digitizer, with the book downwards design, allowing gravity to flatten pages]]
Software driven machines and robots have been developed to scan books without the need of disbinding them in order to preserve both the contents of the document and create a digital image archive of its current state. This recent trend has been due in part to ever improving imaging technologies that allow a high quality digital archive image to be captured with little or no damage to a rare or fragile book in a reasonably short period of time.

The first fully automated book scanner was the DL (Digitizing Line) scanner, manufactured by 4DigitalBooks in Switzerland. First known installation was at Stanford University in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=John|title=4DigitalBooks launches digital book scanner|url=http://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1107446/4digitalbooks-launches-digital-book-scanner|publisher=PrintWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford University Libraries (SUL) Robotic Book Scanner|url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/prod//depts/diroff/DLStatement.html|publisher=Stanford University Libraries (SUL)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scanner received a Dow Jones Runner-Up award under Business Applications Category in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Innovation Awards: Winners 2001|url=http://www.dowjones.com/innovation/ei_winners_2001.html|publisher=Dow Jones|access-date=2017-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923220139/http://www.dowjones.com/innovation/ei_winners_2001.html|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most high-end commercial robotic scanners use traditional air and [[suction]] technology while some others use alternative approaches like bionic finger for turning the pages. Some scanners take advantage of [[Ultrasonic sensor]] or [[Photoelectric sensor]] to detect dual pages and prevent skipping of pages.

'''Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum''' (''BLM'') is a [[history museum]] in [[Braunschweig]], Germany, operated by the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. The museum is scattered on four locations: ''Vieweghaus'', ''Hinter Ägidien'' (both in Braunschweig), ''Kanzlei'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and ''Bauernhausmuseum'' ([[Bortfeld]]).

The collection covers 500,000 years and includes objects from the history of the [[Brunswick Land|Braunschweig area]], including culture, economy, technology, folk arts, and social history. Today, the BLM hosts a collection of 600,000 to 800,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} [http://www.3landesmuseen.de/Geschichte.467.0.html BLM] Sammlung &gt; Sammlungsbestände &gt; Die Sammlungsbestände des Braunschweigischen Landesmuseums. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum's history dates back to October 11, 1891, when it was founded in the [[Duchy of Brunswick]] as ''Vaterländisches Museum für Braunschweigische Landesgeschichte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} [http://www.3landesmuseen.de/Geschichte.467.0.html BLM] Über uns &gt; Geschichte &gt; Landesgeschichte seit mehr als 120 Jahren. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was located in a street called ''Hagenscharrn'' in the city of Braunschweig. In 1938, the museum was renamed to Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum für Geschichte und Volkstum. This name remained until December 31, 1982.

==Vieweghaus==
The [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] building, the former publishing house of [[Vieweg+Teubner Verlag|Vieweg Verlag]], hosts the main collection, and is located in the [[Innenstadt (Braunschweig)|city center]] at the [[Dankwarderode Castle|castle square]] (''Burgplatz''). A large part of the collection was moved there in 1986. &lt;!-- Highlights are... --&gt;

==Hinter Ägidien==
Located in the street ''[[Aegidienkirche, Braunschweig|Hinter St. Aegidien]]'', this annex exhibits [[Jewish ceremonial art|Judaica]] and was opened to the public in 1746. Center piece is a [[synagogue]] interior from [[Hamburg]].

==Kanzlei Wolfenbüttel==
This annex focuses on prehistoric and ancient history (500,000 BC until 8th century AD) of the region and was established there in 1959. The building was built in the 16th century and is located in the city center.

==Bauernhausmuseum==
The Bortfelder Bauernhausmuseum section was opened in 1968 and is located in Bortfeld, a village in the municipality of [[Wendeburg]], [[Peine (district)|district of Peine]]. This museum reflects on the rural life of the region. The central attraction is a [[farmhouse]] from 1639 (reetgedecktes Hallenhaus).

All varieties of English pronounce the ''-s-'' as in the English word ''pest''. The ''-u'' in ''Buda-'' is pronounced either /u/ like ''food'' (as in {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|uː|d|ə|p|ɛ|s|t}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C. |year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-1-4058-8118-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or /yu/ like ''cue'' (as in {{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|b|(|j|)|uː|d|ə|ˈ|p|ɛ|s|t|,_|ˌ|b|ʊ|d|-|,_|ˈ|b|(|j|)|uː|d|ə|p|ɛ|s|t|,_|ˈ|b|ʊ|d|-}}). In Hungarian, the ''-s-'' is pronounced /sh/ as in ''wash''; in IPA: {{IPA-hu|ˈbudɒpɛʃt|lang|Hu-Budapest.ogg}}.

The origins of the names "Buda" and "Pest" are obscure. The first name probably comes from:
* a derivative of ''Bod'' or ''Bud'', a personal name of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origin, meaning 'twig'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=FJoDDAAAQBAJ "Dictionary of American Family Names"](Volume A–F), by Patrick Hanks, Oxford University Press, 2003, pages 179, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] personal name, ''Buda'', the short form of ''Budimír'', ''Budivoj''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiss|first=Lajos|title=Földrajzi nevek etimológiai szótára|trans-title=Etymological Dictionary of Geographic Names|location=Budapest|publisher=Akadémiai|year=1978|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistically, however, a German origin through the Slavic derivative вода (''voda'', water) is not possible, and there is no certainty that a Turkic word really comes from the word ''buta'' ~ ''buda'' 'branch, twig'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Györffy|first=György|title=Pest-Buda kialakulása: Budapest története a honfoglalástól az Árpád-kor végi székvárossá alakulásig|trans-title=The Development of Pest and Buda: History of Budapest from the Great Migration until the End of the Árpád Dynasty|location=Budapest|publisher=Akadémiai|year=1997|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pest_Buda_kialakul%c3%a1sa.html?id=uDUyAAAAMAAJ|isbn=978-963-05-7338-2|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a legend recorded in chronicles from the [[Middle Ages]], Buda comes from the name of its founder, [[Bleda]], brother of Hunnic ruler [[Attila]].

There are several theories about Pest. One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gudmund|last=Schütte|title=Ptolemy's Maps of Northern Europe|publisher=[[Royal Danish Geographical Society]]|location=Copenhagen|year=1917|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ptolemy_s_Maps_of_Northern_Europe.html?id=SkngAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the name derives from [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Roman times]], since there was a local fortress ([[Contra-Aquincum]]) called by [[Ptolemaios]] "Pession" ("Πέσσιον", iii.7.§&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=William|editor-last=Smith|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography|location=London|publisher=I.B.

=== Early history ===

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - BVJA.png|left|thumb|upright=2.05|[[Buda]] during the [[Middle Ages]], woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] (1493)]]

[[Hungarian people|The Magyar]] tribes led by [[Árpád]], forced out of their original homeland north of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] by [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Tsar Simeon]] after the [[Battle of Southern Buh]], settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century displacing the founding Bulgarian settlers of the towns of Buda and Pest,&lt;ref name=Travel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, A Concise History of Hungary, Chronology pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and a century later officially founded the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref name=Travel/&gt; Research places the probable residence of the [[Árpáds]] as an early place of central power near what became Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, A Concise History of Hungary, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tatars|Tatar]] invasion in the 13th century quickly proved it is difficult to defend a plain.&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Travel/&gt; King [[Béla IV of Hungary]] therefore ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns&lt;ref name=Travel/&gt; and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda.

The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias Corvinus]]. The [[Italian Renaissance]] had a great influence on the city.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] conquered Buda in 1526, as well in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/400 |title=Budapest, including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|date=|publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish Rule]] lasted for more than 140 years.&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; The [[Turkish people|Turks]] Ottomans constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city.&lt;ref name=Travel/&gt; Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their rule are still in use 500 years later ([[Rudas Baths]] and [[Király Baths]]).

Sugar page 88"/&gt; The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the [[Habsburg Empire]] as [[Royal Hungary]].

In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful [[siege of Buda (1684)|siege of Buda]], a renewed campaign was started to enter the Hungarian capital. This time, the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]]'s army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including [[Holy Roman Empire|German]], [[Croat]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], Hungarian, [[England|English]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Czechs|Czech]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[French people|French]], [[Burgundians|Burgundian]], [[Danes|Danish]] and [[Swedes|Swedish]] soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, [[artillery]]men, and officers. The Christian forces seized Buda, and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near [[Timișoara]] (Temesvár), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 [[Treaty of Karlowitz]], these territorial changes were officially recognized to show the end of the rule of the Turks, and in 1718 the entire [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was removed from Ottoman rule.

The 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; and modernisation. The national insurrection against the [[Habsburgs]] began in the Hungarian capital [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|in 1848]] and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Reconciliation]] that brought about the birth of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the [[history of Budapest]], lasting until [[World War I]]. In 1849 the [[Chain Bridge (Budapest)|Chain Bridge]] linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Holly|title=Frommer's 500 Places to Take Your Kids Before They Grow Up|publisher=Wiley Indianapolis Composition Services|chapter=7 Famous Briges|isbn= 0-470-57760-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wd0znOQhqOwC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=chain+bridge+budapest#v=onepage&amp;q=chain%20bridge%20budapest|date=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic [[Hungarians]] overtook [[Danube Swabians|Germans]] in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural [[Transdanubia]] and [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%.&lt;ref&gt;Budapest statisztikai évkönyve 1943 (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1943), p. 33, Hungarian Central Statistical Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Budapest székes főváros Statisztikai és Közigazgatási Évkönyve 1921–1924'' (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1921–1924), p. 38, Hungarian Central Statistical Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budapest 1946 p. 12"&gt;Budapest statisztikai évkönyve 1944–1946 (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1944–1946), p. 12, Hungarian Central Statistical Office&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the "Jewish Mecca"&lt;ref name=Eleventh/&gt; or "Judapest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judapest.org/faq/ |title=History of the word (Jewish-Hungarian Cultural Site) |language=Hungarian |publisher=Judapest.org |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531202859/http://www.judapest.org/faq/ |archivedate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jüdische Nachrichten |url=http://buecher.hagalil.com/mandelbaum/budapest.htm |title=Karl Pfeifer: Jüdisches Budapest (Jewish Budapest) |language=German |publisher=Buecher.hagalil.com |date=28 November 2004 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic ([[Republic of Hungary]]). In 1920 the [[Treaty of Trianon]] partitioned the country, and as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.&lt;ref name="Macartney37"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macartney|first =C.A.|title=Hungary and her successors – The Treaty of Trianon and Its Consequences 1919–1937|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=East on the Danube: Hungary's Tragic Century |work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/09/world/east-on-the-danube-hungary-s-tragic-century.html|date=9 August 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2008 |first=Richard |last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, a year before the end of [[World War II]], Budapest was partly destroyed by [[Royal Air Force|British]] and [[United States Army Air Forces|American]] air raids (first attack 4 April 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/17889740 |title=RAF raids Budapest – second heavy attack|date=5 April 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/47691625 |title=RAF Follows US Raid on Budapest|date=5 April 1944|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11807143 |title=Budapest bombed by RAF|date=5 April 1944|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
From 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the [[Battle of Budapest]]. Budapest suffered major damage caused by the attacking [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Romania]]n troops and the defending [[Wehrmacht|German]] and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians lost their lives during the conflict. [[List of crossings of the Danube#Hungary|All bridges]] were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war.&lt;ref name=chbridge&gt;{{cite web|title = Bridges of Budapest – Chain bridge|url =http://www.bridgesofbudapest.com/bridge/chain_bridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 [[Jew]]ish inhabitants died through [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Arrow Cross Party]], during the [[Operation Panzerfaust|German occupation of Hungary]], from 1944 to early 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budapest|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005264 |accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- links to relevant materials in the ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'' on the site of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. --&gt;

Swiss diplomat [[Carl Lutz]] rescued tens of thousands of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wallenberg.html|title=Raoul Wallenberg|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom. [[Giorgio Perlasca]], an Italian citizen, saved thousands of Hungarian Jews posing as a Spanish diplomat.&lt;ref name="timeisrael"&gt;The Times of Israel, ''[https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-orchestra-honors-italian-who-saved-5000-jews-from-nazis/ Israeli orchestra honors Italian who saved 5,000 Jews from Nazis]'', 9 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ushm"&gt;Interview to [[Giorgio Perlasca]] by the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], 5 September 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest.

Following the liberation of Hungary from [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[Red Army]], [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|Soviet military occupation]] ensued, which ended only in 1991. The Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs. In 1949, Hungary was declared a [[Communism|communist]] People's Republic ([[People's Republic of Hungary]]). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the [[Buda Castle]] symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see [[Stalin era]]).
On 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic reform. The demonstrators went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered troops to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. This initiated the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. The demonstrators demanded to appoint [[Imre Nagy]] to be [[Prime Minister of Hungary]]. To their surprise, the central committee of the "[[Hungarian Working People's Party]]" did so that same evening. This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared that Hungary was to leave the [[Warsaw Pact]] and become neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]]. Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shapedscape.com/projects/memorial-to-the-1956-hungarian-revolution-and-war-of-independence|title=Memorial to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence|date=6 July 2017|publisher=Shapedscape|access-date=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729004014/http://www.shapedscape.com/projects/memorial-to-the-1956-hungarian-revolution-and-war-of-independence|archive-date=29 July 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as "[[Goulash Communism|the happiest barrack]]" within the [[Eastern bloc]], and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on [[Erzsébet Bridge]], the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, [[Budapest Metro]]'s East-West [[Line 2 (Budapest Metro)|M2 line]] was first opened, followed by the [[Line 3 (Budapest Metro)|M3 line]] in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]]. [[Andrássy Avenue]] (including the [[Millennium Underground Railway]], [[Hősök tere]], and [[Városliget]]) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s, the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in [[Pest county]], i.e., suburbanisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11871881.pdf|title=Suburbanization and Its Consequences in the Budapest Metropolitan Area|date=6 July 2017|publisher=Tocqueville Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989–90 ([[Fall of the Iron Curtain]]) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were removed from public places, into [[Memento Park]]. In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by its mayor, [[Gábor Demszky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://budapest.hu/Lapok/Budapest-kor%C3%A1bbi-polg%C3%A1rmesterei-%C3%A9s-f%C5%91polg%C3%A1rmesterei.aspx|title=Former Mayors of Budapest (Budapest korábbi polgármesterei és főpolgármesterei)|date=6 July 2017|publisher=Government of Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Topography ===

[[File:Budapest SPOT 1022.jpg|thumb|left|[[Satellite imagery]] illustrating the core of the [[Budapest metropolitan area|Budapest Metropolitan Area]]]]

Budapest, strategically placed at the centre of the [[Carpathian Basin]], lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the [[Great Plain]].  By road it is {{convert|216|km}} south-east of [[Vienna]], {{convert|545|km}} south of [[Warsaw]], {{convert|1565|km}} south-west of [[Moscow]], {{convert|1122|km}} north of [[Athens]], {{convert|788|km}} north-east of [[Milan]], and {{convert|443|km}} south-east of [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budapest|url=https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Budapest/@47.4812134,19.1303031,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4741c334d1d4cfc9:0x400c4290c1e1160|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|525|sqkm|sqmi}} area of Budapest lies in [[Central Hungary]], surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends {{convert|25|and|29|km|0|abbr=on}} in the north-south, east-west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, [[Óbuda Island]] and [[Margaret Island]].&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; The third island [[Csepel Island]] is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is {{convert|230|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly.&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt;

The wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river's opposite bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Budapest#toc59294 |title=Budapest|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=21 November 2013|first=Laszlo|last=Péter|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably [[Gellért Hill]] and Castle Hill.&lt;ref name="budapest.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=General information – Geography|url=https://www.budapest.com/city_guide/general_information/geography_of_budapest.en.html |publisher=Budapest.com|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created [[speleothem]]s, the most famous ones being the Pálvölgyi cave (total length {{convert|7,200|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the Szemlőhegyi cave (total length {{convert|2,200|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The hills were formed in the Triassic Period. The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is János hill, at {{convert|527|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is {{convert|96|m|abbr=off}} above sea level.  Budapest is also rich in green areas. Of the {{convert|525|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} occupied by the city, {{convert|83|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} is green area, [[park]] and [[forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapest-tourist.info/en/geography.php|title=Geography of Budapest|publisher=Budapest Tourist Info|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forests of [[Buda hills]] are environmentally protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protected Landscape Area of Buda|url=https://www.dunaipoly.hu/en/places/protected-areas/protected-areas-1/protected-landscape-area-of-buda |publisher=Duna-Ipoly National Park Directorate|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's importance in terms of traffic is very central, because all major [[European roads]] and [[Rail transport in Europe|European railway]] lines lead to Budapest.&lt;ref name="budapest.com" /&gt; The Danube was and is still an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of [[trade route]]s.&lt;ref name="budpocketguide.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geography of Budapest|url=http://www.budpocketguide.com/TouristInfo/Geography_of_Bp.php|accessdate=4 December 2014|publisher=Budapest Pocket Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Budapest is one of  only two capital cities in the world which has [[Hot spring|thermal springs]] (the other being Reykjavík in Iceland). Some 125 springs produce {{convert|70|e6l|abbr=off}} of thermal water a day, with temperatures ranging up to 58 Celsius. Some of these waters have medicinal effects due to their medically valuable mineral contents.&lt;ref name="budapest.com"/&gt;

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Budapest}}

Budapest has a borderline [[humid continental]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with relatively cold winters and warm summers according to the 1971-2000 climatological norm when the 0&amp;nbsp;°C isotherm is used.&lt;ref name="Peel, M. C.; Finlayson, B. L.; McMahon, T. A"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Koppen_World_Map_(retouched_version).png |title=World Map of Köppen-Geiger climate classification |last1=Peel|first1=M.

Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of {{convert|-10|C|F|}} are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. Budapest's long summer – lasting from May until mid-September – is warm or very warm. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. The autumn in Budapest (mid-September until late October) is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October. Spring and Autumn are generally mild.

Mean annual precipitation in Budapest is around {{convert|23.5|in|1|abbr=out}}. On average, there are 84 days with precipitation and 1988 hours of sunshine (of a possible 4383) each year.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Budapest – Hungary|url=https://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=huxx0002&amp;lang=en |publisher=Climatedata.eu|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunshine &amp; Daylight Hours in Budapest, Hungary|url=https://www.budapest.climatemps.com/sunlight.php |publisher=climatemps.com|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city lies on the boundary between Zone 6 and Zone 7 in terms of the [[hardiness zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenology.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone |title=Hardiness zone – Gardenology.org – Plant Encyclopedia and Gardening wiki |publisher=Gardenology.org |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.backyardgardener.com/garden-forum-education/hardiness-zones/europa-hardiness-zone-map/ |title=Europa Hardiness zone map |publisher=Backyardgardener.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the 1981-2010 climatological norm, widely used in most other European countries, the climate in Budapest has shifted to [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with averages above 0&amp;nbsp;°C in the coldest month and above 22&amp;nbsp;°C in the warmest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logboekweer.nl/International/Hungary/BUDAPEST_Temp.pdf|title=Climate of Budapest|accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in Óbuda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern [[Palace of Arts (Budapest)|Palace of Arts]], the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.&lt;ref name="Budapest Architecture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-architecture/ |title=Budapest Architecture |publisher=visitbudapest.travel |year=2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbase.com/helenpb/the_incredible_architecture_of_budapest |title=The Incredible Architecture of Budapest|publisher=pbase.com |year=2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.budapest.com/city_guide/attractions/exceptional_buildings.en.html |title= Exceptional Buildings Budapest|publisher=budapest.com |year=2014 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than {{convert|45|m}}. The number of [[high-rise]] buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the [[World Heritage Site]]. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the [[inner city]] does not have any. Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of [[skyscraper]]s, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city's historic core has been raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prestigecity.hu/towers/en/lakasok/magas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016232556/http://www.prestigecity.hu/towers/en/lakasok/magas |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 October 2007 |title=The high-rise buildings as emblematique element of luxury district, 13th District of Budapest |publisher=Prestigecity |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euscreen.eu/play.jsp?id=EUS_D1935399A8EF4E8891F15BA4C0800C86 |title=The coming of skyscrapers?|publisher=euscreen.eu |date=17 December 2006 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest represents on the entire timeline. Start with the Roman City of Aquincum represents the [[History of architecture|ancient architecture]].

[[File:Matthias Church Budapest Corrected.jpg|thumb|left|[[Matthias Church]] in Budapest, built in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Gothic revival style]]]]

The next determinative style is the [[Gothic architecture]] in Budapest. The few remaining ones can be found in the Castle District. Buildings to look for are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Another building with Gothic remains is the [[Inner City Parish Church in Pest|Inner City Parish Church (Budapest)]], built in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visitbudapest.travel/local-secrets/inner-city-parish-church/ |title=The oldest church in Pest |publisher=visitbudapest.travel |year=2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]], like the most well-known Budapest [[landmark]]s, the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]].&lt;ref name=Steves&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rick |last1=Steves |first2=Cameron |last2=Hewitt |title=Rick Steves' Budapest |date=2009 |publisher=Avalon Travel Publishing |isbn=978-1-59880-217-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Matthias Church]], where much of the original material was used (originally built in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] in 1015).&lt;ref name="budapestbylocals.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.budapestbylocals.com/matthias-church.html |title=Matthias Church Budapest Castle-Church of Our Lady Buda, Tickets, Concerts|publisher=Budapestbylocals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next chapter of the human architecture is the [[Renaissance architecture]] and one of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary and Budapest. The style appeared following the marriage of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous [[Hungarian State Opera House]], the [[St. Stephen's Basilica]] and the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovelybudapest.com/en/about-budapest/budapest-attractions/the-basilica-of-st-stephen.html|title=The Basilica of Saint Stephen|publisher=Lovelybudapest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), Islamic culture flourished in Budapest, multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of [[Ottoman architecture]], which was influenced by Muslims from around the world not limited to Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, [[Byzantine architecture]] as well as Islamic traditions. After Holy Army conquered Budapest they turned most of the mosques with Churches, Minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point in time distinct sloping central square in Budapest became an bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with “the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/10/travel/glimpsing-hungary-s-ottoman-past.html|title=Glimpsing Hungary's Ottoman Past|last=Times|first=Celestine Bohlen; Celestine Bohlen Is Chief Of The Budapest Bureau Of The New York|date=1991-03-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original [[Turkish bath]]houses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or [[Király Baths]]. Another little known fact is that Budapest is home to the northernmost place where a Tomb of an influential Islamic  [[Turkey|Turkish]] Sufi Dervish, the [[Tomb of Gül Baba]], a dervis [[Turkey|could be found]]. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary's own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city's self-conscious is the top section of the city's main square, currently named as [[Széchenyi square (Pécs)|Szechenyi]]. In medieval time. When Turks came to the city, they built Mosque here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is [[spolia]]. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the [[Inner City Parish Church in Pest|Inner City Parish Church (Budapest)]]. The [[minaret]] and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—“two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon”.

[[File:Budapest Hungary 08.jpg|thumb|right|The most famous [[Bridges of Budapest|Budapest bridge]], the [[Chain Bridge (Budapest)|Chain Bridge]], the icon of the city's 19th century development, built in 1849]]

After 1686, the [[Baroque architecture]] designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/400 |title=Budapest, including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of original Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in [[Batthyány tér|Batthyhány square]]. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful historic buildings with original Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The [[Classical architecture]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]] are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two [[architect]]s that were masters of the Classicist style. [[Mihály Pollack]] (1773–1855) and [[József Hild]] (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the [[Hungarian National Museum]], the [[Lutheran Church of Budavár]] (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the [[List of heads of state of Hungary|Hungarian president]], the [[Sándor Palace, Budapest|Sándor Palace]]. The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in Budapest is the [[Chain Bridge (Budapest)|Chain Bridge]].&lt;ref name=structurae&gt;{{Structurae|id=s0000455|title=Széchenyi Chain Bridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budapest's two most beautiful [[Gothic Revival architecture#Romanticism and nationalism|Romantic architecture]] buildings are the [[Dohány Street Synagogue|Great Synagogue]] in Dohány Street and the [[Vigadó Concert Hall]] on the [[Danube Promenade]], both designed by architect [[Frigyes Feszl]] (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the [[Budapest-Nyugati Railway Terminal|Budapest Western Railway Station]], which was designed by August de Serres and built by the [[Eiffel (company)|Eiffel Company]] of [[Paris]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/nyugati-railway-station-2/|title=Nyugati Railway Station - WeLoveBudapest EN|publisher=Welovebudapest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HUN-2015-Budapest-Hungarian Parliament (Budapest) 2015-01 crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]], completed in 1904]]

Art Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian [[Millennium]] celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boedapestrondleiding.com/text/rondleidingen/artnouveaurondleiding_en.php |title=Budapest Tour: Early Art Nouveau 1897–1904 |publisher=budapestarchitect.com |year=2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529120059/http://www.boedapestrondleiding.com/text/rondleidingen/artnouveaurondleiding_en.php |archivedate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art Nouveau in Hungary (''Szecesszió'' in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary's specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, [[Ödön Lechner]] (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]]. Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the [[Gresham Palace]] in front of the Chain Bridge, the [[Hotel Gellért]], the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] or [[Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name="Budapest Architecture"/&gt;

The second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of [[blocks of flats]] ([[panelház]]), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving Budapest's unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, is force Budapest to balance between them. The [[Contemporary architecture]] has wide margin in the city. [[Public space]]s attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central [[Kossuth Lajos tér, Budapest|Kossuth Lajos square]], [[Deák Ferenc tér|Deák Ferenc square]] and [[Liberty Square (Budapest)|Liberty Square]]. Budapest's current urban landscape is one of the modern and contemporary architecture. Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in Budapest, like the [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National Theatre]], Palace of Arts, [[Rákóczi Bridge]], [[Megyeri Bridge]], [[Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport#Sky Court between Terminal 2A and 2B|Budapest Airport Sky Court]] among others, and millions of square meters of new [[office buildings]] and [[residential area|apartments]]. But there are still large opportunities in [[real estate development]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joneslanglasalle.eu/ResearchLevel1/Budapest%20high%20streets%20_%20electronic%20version.pdf |title=Budapest High Street Overview 2013 |publisher=[[Jones Lang LaSalle]] |date=October 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/asset-management/emerging-trends-real-estate/assets/pwc-emerging-trends-in-real-estate-2013-europe.pdf |title=Emerging Trends in Real Estate, 2013 Europe |publisher=[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] |year=2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbre.hu/hu_en/news_events/news_detail?p_id=16464 |title=Bulls return to the European commercial real estate market (Budapest)|publisher=[[CBRE Group]] |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of today's Budapest is the result of a late-nineteenth-century renovation, but the wide [[boulevard]]s laid out then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of Budapest's city evolution.
Budapest's vast [[urban area]] is often described using a set of district names. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units of former boroughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.frommers.com/destinations/budapest/neighborhoods-in-brief#sthash.WyAc5THZ.dpbs |publisher=Frommer's Budapest|title=Neighborhoods in Brief |year=2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapestbydistrict.com/ |publisher=budapestbydistrict.com |title=Budapest district by district |year=2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506005516/http://www.budapestbydistrict.com/ |archivedate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally Budapest had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in 1873. Since 1950, [[Greater Budapest]] has been divided into 22 [[borough]]s (and 23 since 1994). At that time there were changes both in the order of districts and in their sizes. The city now consists of 23 districts, 6 in Buda, 16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them.
The city centre itself in a broader sense comprises the District '''V, VI, VII, VIII, IX'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.urbandivercities.eu/budapest/ |title=Urbandivercities.eu, Case study Budapest and Budapest's 8th district |year=2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''XIII''' on the Pest side, and the '''I, II, XI''' and '''XII''' on the Buda side of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://geogr.elte.hu/TGF/TGF_Doktorik/eberenyitezisangol.pdf |first=Eszter B.|last=Berényi|location=Budapest|title=The transformation of historical city districts in inner city of Budapest (PhD dissertation) |format=PDF |year=2010 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

District I is a small area in central Buda, including the historic Buda Castle. District II is in Buda again, in the northwest, and District III stretches along in the northernmost part of Buda. To reach District IV, one must cross the Danube to find it in Pest (the eastern side), also at north. With District V, another circle begins, it is located in the absolute centre of Pest. Districts VI, VII, VIII and IX are the neighbouring areas to the east, going southwards, one after the other.
District X is another, more external circle also in Pest, while one must jump to the Buda side again to find Districts XI and XII, going northwards. No more districts remaining in Buda in this circle, we must turn our steps to Pest again to find Districts XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX (mostly external city parts), almost regularly in a semicircle, going southwards again.
District XXI is the extension of the above route over a branch of the Danube, the northern tip of a [[Csepel-sziget|long island]] south from Budapest. District XXII is still on the same route in southwest Buda, and finally District XXIII is again in southernmost Pest, irregular only because it was part of District XX until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/02100/02120/00030/pdf/ORSZ_BPTM_TBM_30_337.pdf|location=Budapest|title= After a local referendum, Soroksár became an independent district.

Budapest is the most [[List of cities and towns in Hungary|populous city in Hungary]] and [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|one of the largest cities]] in the [[European Union]], with a growing number of inhabitants, estimated at 1,742,000 in 2014, whereby inward migration exceeds outward migration.&lt;ref name="TIME2"/&gt; These trends are also seen throughout the [[Budapest metropolitan area]], which is home to 3.3 million people.&lt;ref name="Budapest City Review2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euromonitor.com/budapest-city-review/report |title=Budapest City Review |publisher=Euromonitor International|date=December 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.emta.com/spip.php?article206&amp;lang=en |title=Members of EMTA |publisher=European Metropolitan Transport Authorities (EMTA)|date=August 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amounts to about 34% of Hungary's population.
In 2014, the city had a population density of 3,314 people per square kilometre (8,580/sq mi), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities in Hungary. The population density of [[Erzsébetváros|Elisabethtown-District VII]] is 30,989/km² (80,260/sq mi), which is the highest population density figure in Hungary and [[List of cities by population density|one of the highest in the world]], for comparison the density in [[Manhattan]] is 25,846/km².&lt;ref&gt;[http://gislounge.com/features/aa041101c.shtml "Population Density"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210010305/http://gislounge.com/features/aa041101c.shtml |date=10 February 2007 }}, Geographic Information Systems&amp;nbsp;– GIS of Interest.

Productivity gains and the relatively large economically active share of the population explain why [[household income]]s have increased in Budapest to a greater extent than in other parts of Hungary. Higher incomes in Budapest are reflected in the lower share of expenditure the city's inhabitants allocate to necessity spending such as food and non-alcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="Budapest City Review2"/&gt;

As the capital of Hungary, Budapest is the seat of the country's [[Central government|national government]]. The President of Hungary resides at the Sándor Palace in the District I (Buda Castle District),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keh.hu/about_the_institution_of_the_president_of_the_republic/1586-About_the_institution_of_the_President_of_the_Republic|title=About the institution of the President of Hungary|publisher=Office of the President of the Republic|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the office of the Hungarian Prime Minister is in the Hungarian Parliament. [[Ministry (government department)|Government ministries]] are all located in various parts of the city, most of them are in the District V, [[Inner City (Budapest)|Leopoldtown]]. The [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] is seated in the Hungarian Parliament, which also located in the District V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.hu/fotitkar/angol/general_info.htm|title=The Hungarian National Assembly|year=2014|publisher=Office of the National Assembly|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Speakers of the National Assembly of Hungary|President of the National Assembly]], the third-highest public official in Hungary, is also seated in the largest building in the country, in the Hungarian Parliament.

Hungary's highest [[court]]s are located in Budapest. The Curia ([[supreme court]] of Hungary), the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the District V, Leopoldtown. Under the authority of its President it has three departments: criminal, civil and administrative-labour law departments. Each department has various chambers. The Curia guarantees the uniform application of [[law]]. The decisions of the Curia on uniform [[jurisdiction]] are binding for other courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birosag.hu/en/curia-hungary|title=Curia of Hungary|publisher=National Office for the Judiciary|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]] is one of the highest level actors independent of the politics in the country. The Constitutional Court serves as the main body for the protection of the [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]], its tasks being the review of the constitutionality of statutes. The Constitutional Court performs its tasks independently. With its own budget and its judges being elected by Parliament it does not constitute a part of the ordinary judicial system. The constitutional court passes on the [[constitutionality]] of laws, and there is no right of [[appeal]] on these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkab.hu/constitutional-court/about-the-constitutional-court/history|title=Brief history of the Constitutional Court of Hungary|year=2014|publisher=The Constitutional Court|accessdate=12 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513080644/http://www.mkab.hu/constitutional-court/about-the-constitutional-court/history|archivedate=13 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Crime'' in Budapest investigated by different bodies. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] notes in their 2011 Global Study on Homicide that, according to criminal justice sources, the homicide rate in Hungary, calculated based on UN population estimates, was 1.4 in 2009, compared to Canada's rate of 1.8 that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/5035fef1d9.html|title=Hungary: Crime situation, including organized crime; police and state response including effectiveness – 1.1 Homicide|date=10 July 2012|publisher=UNHCR-The UN Refugee Agency|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Budapest Széchenyi Baths R02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Széchenyi Medicinal Bath|Széchenyi Thermal Bath]] in [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]]]]

One of the reasons the Romans first colonised the area immediately to the west of the River Danube and established their regional capital at Aquincum (now part of Óbuda, in northern Budapest) is so that they could utilise and enjoy the thermal springs. There are still ruins visible today of the enormous baths that were built during that period. The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541–1686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mini guide to Budapest's spas|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20130415-mini-guide-to-budapest-spas|accessdate=25 December 2017|publisher=BBC|date=26 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fallon|first1=Steve|title=A guide to Budapest’s thermal baths|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/hungary/budapest/travel-tips-and-articles/a-guide-to-budapests-thermal-baths/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d2760252|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budapest gained its reputation as a city of [[Spas in Budapest|spas]] in the 1920s, following the first realisation of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 Budapest was officially ranked as a "City of Spas". Today, the baths are mostly frequented by the older generation, as, with the exception of the "Magic Bath" and "Cinetrip" water discos, young people tend to prefer the lidos which are open in the summer.

Construction of the Király Baths started in 1565, and most of the present-day building dates from the Turkish period, including most notably the fine cupola-topped pool.

The Rudas Baths are centrally placed – in the narrow strip of land between Gellért Hill and the River Danube – and also an outstanding example of architecture dating from the Turkish period. The central feature is an octagonal pool over which light shines from a {{convert|10|m|ft}} diameter cupola, supported by eight pillars.

The [[Gellért Baths]] and Hotel were built in 1918, although there had once been Turkish baths on the site, and in the Middle Ages a hospital. In 1927, the Baths were extended to include the wave pool, and the effervescent bath was added in 1934. The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues.

The Lukács Baths are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. There is still something of an atmosphere of fin-de-siècle about the place, and all around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.

The [[Széchenyi Baths]] are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only "old" medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city. The indoor medicinal baths date from 1913 and the outdoor pools from 1927. There is an atmosphere of grandeur about the whole place with the bright, largest pools resembling aspects associated with Roman baths, the smaller bath tubs reminding one of the bathing culture of the Greeks, and the saunas and diving pools borrowed from traditions emanating in northern Europe. The three outdoor pools (one of which is a fun pool) are open all year, including winter. Indoors there are over ten separate pools, and a whole host of medical treatments is also available. The Szécheny Baths are built in modern Renaissance style.

Budapest is served by [[Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport]] (BUD) (named after [[Franz Liszt]], the notable Hungarian composer), one of the busiest airports in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], located {{convert|16|km|mi}} east-southeast of the centre of Budapest, in the [[Pestszentlőrinc-Pestszentimre|District XVIII]]. The airport offers international connections among all major European cities, and also to [[North America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]].
As Hungary's busiest airport, it handles nearly all of the country's air passenger traffic. Budapest Liszt Ferenc handled around 250 [[Airline|scheduled flights]] daily in 2013, and an ever-rising number of [[Air charter|charters]]. [[London]], [[Brussels]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Munich]], Paris, and [[Amsterdam]] are the busiest international connections respectively, while [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Dubai]], [[Doha]] and [[Alicante]] are the most unusual in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianaviationnews.wordpress.com/2014/10/15/air-transat-unveils-its-new-europe-program-for-2015/ |title=Air Transat unveils its new Europe program for 2015 |date=15 October 2014 |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017125912/http://canadianaviationnews.wordpress.com/2014/10/15/air-transat-unveils-its-new-europe-program-for-2015/ |archivedate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today the airport serves as a base for [[Ryanair]], [[Wizz Air]], [[Budapest Aircraft Service]], [[CityLine Hungary]], [[Farnair Hungary]] and [[Travel Service Hungary]] among others. The airport is accessible via public transportation from the city centre by the Metro line 3 and then the airport bus No. 200E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bkk.hu/apps/docs/terkep/repter.pdf |title=From the Airport to the City centre by public transport |date=2014 |publisher=Centre for Budapest Transport|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a strategic development plan, €561 million have been spent on expanding and modernising the [[airport infrastructure]] until December 2012. Most of these improvements are already completed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bud.hu/english/business-and-partners/property |title=Budapest Airport Property development |date=17 March 2014 |publisher=Budapest Airport |accessdate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65bMJ1asG?url=http://www.bud.hu/english/business-and-partners/property |archivedate=20 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the postponed ones are the new cargo area and new piers for terminal 2A and 2B, but these development are on standby also, and will start immediately, when the airport traffic will reach the appropriate level.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Further|Hungarian cuisine}}

In the modern age, Budapest developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby region, such as lamb, pork and vegetables special to the region. Modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with French, Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary can be considered a melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] cuisine. Considerable numbers of [[Saxons]], Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the Ottoman era, in the form of sweets (for example different [[nougat]]s, like white nougat called ''törökméz''), [[quince]] (''birsalma''), [[Turkish delight]], [[Turkish coffee]] or rice dishes like [[pilaf]], meat and vegetable dishes like the [[eggplant]], used in [[eggplant salads and appetizers]], stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called ''[[töltött káposzta]]''. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by [[Austrian cuisine]] under the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Germany-to-Japan/Hungary.html|title=Food in Hungary|publisher=foodbycountry.com|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budapest restaurants reflect diversity, with menus carrying traditional regional cuisine, fusions of various culinary influences, or innovating in the leading edge of new techniques. Budapest' food shops also have a solid reputation for supplying quality specialised culinary products and supplies, reputations that are often built up over generations. These include many shops, such as Café Gerbeaud, one of the greatest and most traditional [[coffeehouse]]s in Europe, or the [[Gundel]] restaurant and gastro shop in the City Park.
Foodies can also find the highest quality foods served in several [[List of Michelin starred restaurants#By country|Michelin-starred]] restaurants, like Onyx, Costes, Borkonyha or Tanti.

Budapest has quite a few [[Twin towns and sister cities|sister cities]] and many partner cities around the world.&lt;ref name="Budapest twinnings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budapest.hu/Lapok/Fovaros/Testvervarosok.aspx|title=Budapest – Testvérvárosok|accessdate=14 August 2013|publisher=Budapest Főváros Önkormányzatának hivatalos oldala [Official site of the Municipality of Budapest]|language=Hungarian|trans-title=Budapest – Twin Cities|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809185135/http://budapest.hu/Lapok/Fovaros/Testvervarosok.aspx|archivedate=9 August 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like Budapest, many of them are the most influential and largest cities of their country and region, most of them are the primate city and political, economical, cultural capital of their country.
The Mayor of Budapest says the aim of improving sister city relationships is to allow and encourage a mutual exchange of information and experiences, as well as co-operation, in the areas of city management, education, culture, tourism, media and communication, trade and business development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kultura.hu/budapest-to-sign-sister |title=Budapest to Sign Sister City Agreement with Beijing |accessdate=25 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427033819/https://www.kultura.hu/budapest-to-sign-sister |archivedate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bulverket''' is the remnants of a large wooden fortification or [[Glossary of architecture#B|bulwark]] at [[Lake Tingstäde]] on the island of [[Gotland]], Sweden. When built, it consisted of a platform with houses surrounded by a double palisade with the entire construction around {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.

According to a 1989 archeological survey, the structure was built in the 1130s and may have been used for less than a century. Although its original purpose is unknown, theories suggest it was either used as a shelter during the turbulent times on Gotland at the end of the [[Viking Age]] or that it was the site of a [[last stand]].

Among the archeological finds at the Bulverket are the remains of three boats. One of these served as a model for the reconstruction of a Viking boat, the ''Krampmacken'', in 1980. The ''Krampmacken'' has subsequently made several journeys following old Viking waterways through [[Eastern Europe]].

== Etymology ==

The name Bulverket originates from the old Swedish words ''bul'', meaning "log", and ''verk'' which refers to something "built". It is related to the English word "[[Glossary of architecture#B|bulwark]]", a form of fortification, as well as the Dutch ''bolwerk'' with the same meaning and the Swedish ''bålverk''.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=34}}

== Discovery ==
It is likely that the Bulverket has been known to the local people for centuries, as thousands of logs can be seen through the water on a calm day, and it is also considered the best place for [[European perch|perch]] fishing on the lake. However, there is no [[Oral tradition|oral lore]] regarding its construction, purpose, or fate.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=34}} All that remains is a saying used in the northern part of Gotland that concerns large amounts of smoke: "There is smoke just like when Lake Tingstäde burned".({{lang-sv|Det ryker som när Tingstäde träsk brann.}})&lt;ref name=MT91&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grannholm|first1=Tore|title=När byggdes bulverket i Tingstäde träsk?|trans-title=When was the Bulverket in Lake Tingstäde built?|journal=Marinarkeologisk Tidskrift|date=1991|issue=3-4|url=http://marinarkeologi.nu/MT/1991/mt_1991_3_4__546a.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bulverket was first mentioned in written sources in 1868, when Swedish archeologist Oscar Montelius wrote that [[Natural history|naturalist]] and teacher Dr. Lindström discovered poles in Lake Tingstäde in 1866.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=34}}

One of the recommended ways of seeing the Bulverket is during the winter, when the ice is smooth and clear&lt;ref name=Ting /&gt; and the lake is used for [[tour skating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eriksson|first1=Margareta|title=Pimpelfiske och långfärdsskridsko|trans-title=Fishing and tour skating|url=http://www.gotland.net/se-och-gora/arkiv/pimpelfiske-och-langfardsskridsko|website=www.gotland.net|publisher=Gotlands Media AB|date=5 January 2010|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
[[File:Karta Bulverket i Tingstäde Träsk.jpg|thumb|Location an size of the Bulverket in Lake Tingstäde, Gotland]]
The Bulverket is the remnants of a large wooden fortification or bulwark on the island of Gotland. It was raised in the middle of Lake Tingstäde, in the least accessible part of the lake.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=49}} It has now collapsed and the logs are scattered over an area of {{convert|40,000|sqm|sqft}}. The main part of the Bulverket consisted of four [[pier]]s on square [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] made of logs. The piers, {{convert|30|to|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, formed a square platform, each side of which was {{convert|170|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with an open, but sheltered, water area in the middle. The platform was aligned so that each side faced one of the [[cardinal direction]]s. On the platform were houses for people living on the Bulverket as well as storage sheds, and in the central part were landings for [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] boats. It is estimated that about 200 ships of the early [[Viking Age]] type could be moored there.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=49}}

=== Platform and palisade ===
[[File:Bulverket modell av nordvästra hörnet.jpg|thumb|left|A 1:40 scale model of the north west corner of the Bulverket.]]
The platform was enclosed by two concentric circles of poles (or timber [[Deep foundation|piles]]) driven into the bottom of the lake. In some parts, this outer defence stood as far as {{convert|50|m|ft||abbr=on}} from the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rönnby|first1=Johan|title=Sjunket förflutet: arkeologiska möjligheter under vatten|trans-title=Sunken past: Archeological possibilities under water|date=2014|publisher=MTM|location=Johanneshov|isbn=91-974166-1-4|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/16957970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire construction was about {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=MT89&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rönnby|first1=Johan|title=Bulverket – och vikingatid medeltid på Gotland|trans-title=The Bulverket – and Viking and Middle Ages on Gotland|journal=Marinarkeologisk Tidskrift|date=1989|issue=1-2|page=13|url=http://marinarkeologi.nu/MT/1989/mt_1989_1_2__484.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palisade and the platform had openings in the northwest part of the construction to allow boats in and out.{{sfn|Varenius|Eriksson|Eriksson|1979|p=7}} Analysis of vertical posts show that the water surface is at approximately the same height when the Bulverket was built as it is today, but that the depth of the water has decreased due to sedimentation. The sedimentation layer is {{convert|0.5|to|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the site.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=50}}

The Bulverket was not surveyed and built as a single unit, but rather one caisson at a time. Some of these caissons were linked by making rectangular holes in the ends of the vertical logs, stacking the logs on top of each other and driving a horizontal pole about {{convert|20|x|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} through the holes. The caissons were approximately {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and covered with a flooring that rested {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the water.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|pp=49–50}}

=== Houses ===
The houses were built using different methods such as [[post-and-plank]], [[log house]] technique and [[Palisade church|palisade walls]].{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=52}} Construction details found at the site indicates that the houses were approximately {{convert|3|x|3|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Ting&gt;{{cite web|title=30.000 Stockar i Tingstäde|trans-title=30,000 logs in Tingstäde|url=http://www.tingstadefastning.se/historiska-vandringar/30000-stockar-i-tingstade/|website=www.tingstadefastning.se|publisher=Tingstäde Heritage Society|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of about 25,000 logs, mostly pine, were used to build the Bulverket. This equals approximately {{convert|50|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of forest. Studies of the construction show that it was built in a relatively short period of time, perhaps no less than a year. This would have required about 100 men to work on the site.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|pp=60–62}} Given the amount of organization needed for such a project and that the farms around Lake Tingstäde could not spare all of their workers for the construction, most of northern Gotland must have been involved in the work.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=65}}

== Purpose ==
Although the reason for the construction of the Bulverket is unknown, such a heavily fortified construction in the middle of a large lake suggests a place of refuge. The concept of such a building has no equivalent on Gotland or western Scandinavia, suggesting that it may have been influenced by [[Slavs|Slavic]] or [[Baltic states|Baltic]] buildings. Different theories as to why this shelter was needed have been presented. At the beginning of the 12th century, pirates and lesser kings ravaged the Baltic Sea and the fortification may have been used as the site of a [[last stand]] in one of these battles. Many finds at the site indicate fishing and trade, and one theory is that it was a central trading and storage hub. Opposition to this theory points out that the fortification is too heavy for a simple trading post. During the time of the Bulverket, Gotland came under pressure from representatives of the new [[Christian]] religion, which climaxed with the island coming under the dominion of the diocese of [[Linköping]]. One theory is that it was built to make a stand against this tide of religious colonisation. Yet another theory has to do with the social upheaval that took place on Gotland at the end of the Viking Age. This was not a peaceful time, and Tingstäde was just as strategic then as it has been until the beginning of the 1900s. The chieftains on Gotland were at war and a shelter may have been needed by those avoiding the conflict. {{As of|2015}}, none of the theories have so far been confirmed.&lt;ref name=MT90-4&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rönnby|first1=Johan|title=Bulverket|trans-title=The Bulverket|journal=Marinarkeologisk Tidskrift|date=1990|issue=4|pages=6–7|url=http://marinarkeologi.nu/MT/1990/mt_1990_4__523.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archeological surveys ==
[[File:Bulverket pålar från palissaden 1923.jpg|thumb|upright|Two poles from the palisade retrieved during the 1923 survey]]
Because of Lake Tingstäde's natural [[sedimentation]] the remains of the Bulverket are well preserved and the [[Maritime archaeology|underwater archeological]] finds from the site are in very good condition. {{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=66}} Even small [[juniper]] boughs placed on the ice by the carpenters to mark the layout of the Bulverket during its construction have been preserved.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|pp=66–70}} It is likely that the logs and timbers were cut during the winter and transported on the ice to the Bulverket.&lt;ref name=MT91 /&gt;

=== 1921–1936 ===
[[File:Arvid Zetterling.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Arvid Zetterling]]
Arvid Zetterling, born in [[Åtvidaberg]] on 29{{nbsp}}May 1865, was a Captain with the [[Gotland Artillery Regiment]] who saw the Bulverket when he went fishing on Lake Tingstäde. He became fascinated by the logs he saw on the bottom of the lake{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=36–38}} and made a small survey of the Bulverket in 1915. However, it was not until he retired and became a Major in the reserve in 1918 that he could undertake a more thorough examination of the structure. The first real archeological survey started in 1921, despite the fact that Zetterling lived in [[Hässleholm]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zetterling|first1=Arvid|title=Bulverket : en svensk pålbyggnad i Tingstäde träsk på Gotland|trans-title=The Bulverket : A Swedish stilt building in Lake Tingstäde on Gotland|journal=[[Fornvännen]]|date=1927|issue=22|pages=161–178|language=Swedish|url=http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/831/1927_161.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired completely from the military in 1932, to spend most of his time studying the Bulverket. In 1932–35, he rented lodgings at Furubjär Farm in [[Tingstäde]], where he also founded a museum dedicated to the Bulverket.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|pp=42–48}} The museum closed when he died on 18{{nbsp}}January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Kjellberg|editor-first1=H.E.|title=Svenska Dagbladets Årsbok / Sjuttonde årgången (händelserna 1939)|trans-title=Svenska Dagbladet's yearbook (events of 1939)|edition=17
|date=1940|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|location=Stockholm|page=251|url=http://runeberg.org/svda/1939/0251.html|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zetterling was an amateur archeologist with limited resources. He dredged the site using homemade tools, drew large parts of the Bulverket sitting on a tall chair, resembling that of a tennis umpire's, in the lake and through contacts had [[Aerial photography|aerial photos]] taken of the site. Zetterling was probably the first in Sweden to use aerial photography in archeology.{{sfn|Varenius|Eriksson|Eriksson|1979|p=10}} During the dredging, he found mostly different types of timber from the platform and houses, among these a wooden chest about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long made from a log, a {{convert|4.5|x|0.3|m|ft}} [[watering trough]], a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=on}} ladder, the remnants of two kinds of boats as well as some [[bronze]] objects, [[Fishing float|floats]], [[hazelnut]]s and bones from cattle, sheep, pigs and fowls. He also found some fire-damaged timber and therefore concluded that a large part of the Bulverket had burned down. He compiled a 1:50 scale "Plan of the Bulverket".{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|pp=42–48}}

=== 1989–1994 ===

The latest surveys of the Bulverket were done in 1989–1994 and led by Johan Rönnby. Among other things, a [[side-scan sonar]] was used to map the bottom of the lake.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=49}} [[Stratigraphy|Stratigraphic]] surveys were made of an area of {{convert|27|by|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the south part of the site and 20 [[core sample]]s were taken in different parts of the site. No [[dark earth]] was found, indicating that the construction was not used as a habitation for long.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|p=70}} Neither were any traces of fire found, suggesting that if there was a fire, it must have been a relatively small one that did not destroy the entire Bulverket.{{sfn|Rönnby|1995|pp=72–74}} An alternative hypothesis suggests that the construction became unstable and was abandoned before it finally collapsed.&lt;ref name=MT90&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rönnby|first1=Johan|title=Bulverket i Tingstäde Träsk|trans-title=The Bulverket in Lake Tingstäde|journal=Marinarkeologisk Tidskrift|date=1990|issue=1|page=14|url=http://marinarkeologi.nu/MT/1990/mt_1990_1__504.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] and [[Carbon-14]] examinations shows that the Bulverket was built in the 1130s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bråthen|first1=Alf|title=Dated wood from Gotland and the diocese of Skara|date=1995|publisher=Hikuin|location=Højbjerg|isbn=87-87270-75-7|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/7727718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bartholin|first1=Thomas S.|title=Dendrokronologiens tilforlidelighed|url=http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/2894/1998_141.pdf?sequence=1|website=www.raa.se|publisher=[[Swedish National Heritage Board]]|date=1998|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and archeologists are {{as of|2015|lc=y}} trying to ascertain how long it was in use. The current estimates are a few years up to a century.&lt;ref name=MT90 /&gt;

== Bulverket boat ==
During the survey in the 1920s, pieces of three different boats were found at the Bulverket then in the 1990 survey additional pieces of the largest of these came to light.&lt;ref name=soder&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rönnby|first1=Johan|title=The Bulverket Boat|url=https://www.abc.se/~pa/publ/bulvboat.htm|website=www.abc.se|publisher=[[Södertörn University]]|date=November 1999|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 29 pieces of the boat were found,{{efn|35 pieces according to Cederlund.{{sfn|Cederlund|1979|p=253}}}} but since many vital parts of it were missing, it is not possible to determine the vessel's exact measurements.{{sfn|Varenius|Eriksson|Eriksson|1979|p=36}} It is estimated that the boat was approximately {{convert|8|m|ft}} long,{{efn|{{convert|10|m|ft}} according to Rönnby in November 1999.&lt;ref name=soder /&gt;}} {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide and had a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|0.8|m|ft}}. It was [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker]] built, double-ended with a mast, probably with a
[[square rig]] and side rudder. The construction of the boat was a common Viking style, the same design used for the [[longship]]s and was probably used for fishing and the day-to-day activities on the lake.{{sfn|Cederlund|1979|p=253}}

The boat had a T-shaped keel, probably seven [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] and six [[strake]]s joined with wooden pegs. This and the positioning of the mast in a hole in one of the frames, suggests influences from Slavic boatbuilding techniques.{{sfn|Varenius|Eriksson|Eriksson|1979|pp=36–37}} It is built in the tradition going back to the [[Hjortspring boat]] (400-300 BC) and is compared to the boats from Danzig-Ohra 2, [[Skuldelev ships#Skuldelev 6|Skuldelev 6]] and [[Valsgärde|Valsgärde 2]].{{sfn|Varenius|Eriksson|Eriksson|1979|p=34}}

[[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon-14 dating]] of the boat was carried out in 1975 by the laboratory at the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]], which dated it to around 1200. This posed a problem since the boat would have been used by the inhabitants of the fortification, but the rest of the Bulverket was dated to the 1130s. It was later explained that the remnants of the boat were treated with [[linseed oil]] and [[alum]] in the 1930s, as part of the conservation process, and this may have distorted the results.{{sfn|Cederlund|1979|pp=256–257}} Further examination of the wood showed that the boats were made of pine.{{sfn|Varenius|Eriksson|Eriksson|1979|p=12}} The pieces of the boat were kept in the [[Swedish History Museum]] until 1975, when they were moved to the [[Maritime Museum (Stockholm)|Maritime Museum]] for complete documentation.{{sfn|Varenius|Eriksson|Eriksson|1979|p=36}}

=== ''Krampmacken'' ===
[[File:Palaemon adspersus Italy cropped rotated.jpg|thumb|left|A ''"krampmack"''&lt;br /&gt;(''Palaemon adspersus'')]]
[[File:Tjängvide.jpg|thumb|upright|Picture stone from Tjängvide, Gotland. One of the stones depicting a square sail of the kind used on ''Krampmacken''.]]
In 1979–80, the ''Krampmacken'', a reconstruction of a Viking boat, was built based on the Bulverket boat. One of the initiators of the project was archeologist and director of the Gotlandic department of [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] (''RAGU''), Erik Nylén.&lt;ref name=kramp&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nylén|first1=Erik|title=Vikingaskepp mot Miklagård – Krampmacken i österled|trans-title=Viking ship set for Micklagård – Krampmacken journeying eastward|date=1987|publisher=Carlsson|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-7798-119-7|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/7665731|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after the [[Gutnish]] word for the common Baltic shrimp, ''[[Palaemon adspersus]]'': ''"krampmack"'', since the shape of the boat resembled a small shrimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enderborg|first1=Bernt|title=Krampmacken|url=http://www.guteinfo.com/?id=3238|website=www.guteinfo.com|publisher=Guteinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat is {{convert|8|x|2|m|ft}}, has six oars and is manned by a crew of eleven people. While the hull is based on the Bulverket boat, the sail is patterned after sails depicted on Gotlandic [[picture stone]]s. ''Krampmacken'' has in turn been used a model for other reconstructed Viking ships such as ''Nöiriven'' (1990), ''Aifur'' (1992), ''Thor Viking'' (1994) and ''Langsvaige'' (1997).&lt;ref name=kramp /&gt;

In 1983–85, the ''Krampmacken'' sailed from Gotland, via the [[Vistula]] and [[Danube]] rivers to the [[Black Sea]] and [[Istanbul]], which was called ''[[Names of Istanbul#Old Norse|Micklagård]]'' by the Swedish Vikings. In 1995–97, a journey was made following the [[Caucasus]] rivers all the way to [[Baku]] on the [[Caspian Sea]]. Following these expeditions, several other reconstructed Viking ships have made journeys on the rivers of [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=kramp /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1187">'''Chromolithe''' ("light from stone") is a [[light art]] that gives the impression that the buildings have been painted with glowing colours. 
Chromolithe installations have been made for cathedrals and churches, historic public buildings, modern art museums, and even banks.

The chromolithe process starts with data collection, using a specially-built photographic chamber, months of meticulous art work on computer screens, and finally re-projecting the image, printed to 24x24 cm photographic plates, back onto the building from a series of custom-built 6000Kva [[Xenon]] projectors, discreetly placed, so as to make the light source appear invisible. 

Some of the cathedrals and intricate sculptured Gothic buildings that have been chromolithed, were originally painted. Thus, work like that of [[Patrice Warrener]]'s can be seen as a restoration of heritage buildings.

The procedure and rate of [[eviction]] in the [[United States]] varies by locality. Landlord-initiated expulsion of tenants is not officially tracked or monitored by the Federal government, and has historically not been subject to comprehensive analysis. The 2016 publication of the book ''[[Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City]]'' by [[Matthew Desmond]] raised awareness of the issue. A database created by Desmond found that landlords had been granted eviction notices for one in 50 renter households in analyzed regions. This rate only counts evictions that engage the legal process, as many evictions are informally conducted between landlords and renters, it likely undercounts actual evictions.&lt;ref name="NYT_20180416"&gt;{{cite news

Most evictions in the United States occur because the tenant cannot or will not pay [[renting|rent]]. Landlords can also expel tenants for breaking the law, damaging property, sub-leasing, or causing a disturbance. In most American municipalities, tenants who haven't violated their lease can be expelled, in what is known as "no-fault evictions."&lt;ref name = "Lab_why"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://evictionlab.org/why-eviction-matters/ |title= Why Eviction Matters |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-04-16 |website=Eviction Lab |publisher=Princeton University |access-date=2018-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most renting families under the poverty line spend more than 50% of their income on rent, with one in four such families spending over 70% of their income on rent and utilities. About one in four low-income renters receives housing assistance.&lt;ref name = "Lab_why"/&gt; Eviction rates are higher in communities with multiple aggravating factors, including high levels of poverty. These include local laws that give advantage to landowners and a lack of available [[affordable housing]] that would increase [[market economy|market]] pressures to keep rents low.&lt;ref name="NYT_20180416"/&gt; 

When housing pressures are extreme, even middle-class and working class renters are evicted by landlords eager to capitalize on the rising market rates, such as in [[San Francisco]] during the various tech booms. In such circumstances, landlords may seize upon minor violations that were previously tolerated, such as keeping a small pet or storing a bicycle in the hallway, to evict renters. The situation in California is aggravated by the [[Ellis Act]], which allows landlords to evict tenants and immediately sell the vacant apartments as condominiums.&lt;ref name="CNN_20141029"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evictions disproportionately affect low-income women, in particular [[women of color]].&lt;ref name = "Lab_why"/&gt; Approximately one in five [[African Americans|African-American]] women renters report being evicted as some point in their life, while the equivalent rate for white women renters is one in 15.&lt;ref name="Atlantic_20160401"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of [[domestic violence]] and families with children are also at high risk of eviction.&lt;ref name = "Lab_why"/&gt; Renters who appear in eviction court are three times more likely to actually be evicted if they live with children.&lt;ref name="Atlantic_20160401"/&gt;

== Consequences ==
[[File:Protesters in front of the International Hotel.jpg|thumb|Protesters linking arms to prevent San Francisco Sheriffs' deputies from evicting elderly tenants. August 4, 1977]]
Eviction is a cause of poverty, as well as a result of it. The loss of home often results in the loss of community connections, as well as children being forced into a new school. Possessions are routinely lost, as they are placed outside on the sidewalk or placed in storage that can only be accessed by paying a fee. A legal eviction typically goes on the permanent record of the boarder, resulting in automatic rejection by other landlords or housing authorities.&lt;ref name = "Lab_why"/&gt;

Persons who are evicted lose their jobs at higher rates, either because of the new stress or because the job is no longer easily accessible in a new residence. [[Mental health]] often suffers, with one study finding that evicted mothers reported higher rates of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] two years after being expelled.&lt;ref name = "Lab_why"/&gt;

== Rates and locations ==
There is no government reporting system on eviction, so variance by location and time were, at best, little understood and, at worst, invisible. This began to change with the implementation of [[Princeton University]]'s Eviction Lab which published the results of an analysis of 900,000 eviction notices that occurred in 2016.&lt;ref name="NYT_20180416"/&gt;

== Editions and collections ==

=== Works and first publications in German ===

Only a few of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections ''{{lang|de|[[Contemplation (Kafka)|Betrachtung]]}}'' (''Contemplation'') and ''{{lang|de|[[A Country Doctor (collection)|Ein Landarzt]]}}'' (''A Country Doctor''), and individual stories (such as "{{lang|de|[[The Metamorphosis|Die Verwandlung]]}}" ("The Metamorphosis")) in literary magazines. He prepared the story collection ''{{lang|de|[[A Hunger Artist (collection)|Ein Hungerkünstler]]}}'' (''A Hunger Artist'') for print, but it was not published until after his death. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels ''{{lang|de|Der Process}}'', ''{{lang|de|Das Schloss}}'' and ''{{lang|de|[[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]}}'' (also known as ''{{nowrap|{{lang|de|Der Verschollene}}}}'', ''The Man Who Disappeared''), were published posthumously, mostly by his friend [[Max Brod]], who ignored Kafka's wish to have the manuscripts destroyed. Brod also published letters, diaries and aphorisms.

Many of Kafka's works have uncertain dates of writing and/or were written over long periods of time. In such cases the year the writing of the work began is used. Year and place of the first publication is shown. For many works the German text is available, for several works also an English translation. It is linked in columns "de" (short for "deutsch", German) and "en" (short for English).

=== English translations ===

Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language allowing for long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—that being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is achieved due to the construction of certain sentences in German which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in other languages, so it is up to the resourceful translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text.{{sfn|Kafka|1996|p=xi}} German's more flexible word order is not the only problem translating German into other languages. German also lacks an informal language register, uses modal connectives, and syntactic structures which can be translated in more than one way.{{sfn|Newmark|1991|pp=63–64}} Kafka did not write in standard High German, but rather in a Praguean German heavily influenced by the Yiddish and Czech languages.{{sfn|Deleuze|Guattari|1986|pp=22–25}} This has led philosophers Deleuze and Guattari to describe Kafka's linguistic style as "[[deterritorialized]]", characterized by a "withered vocabulary" and an "incorrect syntax".{{sfn|Deleuze|Guattari|1986|pp=22–25}}

German sentences also have a different [[syntax|syntactic structure]]. Unlike English, German is a verb-final language, which places the main verb of a verb string (e.g., "transformed" in "had been transformed") at the end of a phrase. The difference can be seen in the contrast between the original German version of the first sentence in Kafka's "The Metamorphosis":
[[File:Kafka 1'.png|English|thumb|center|600px|[[dependency grammar|Dependency tree]] illustrating the difference in syntax between the first sentence of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" in translation by Ian Johnston and in the original German]]
{{clear}}

:''Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Traumen erwachte fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt''. (Original)
: As Gregor Samsa one morning from restless dreams awoke, found he himself in his bed into an enormous vermin transformed. (literal word for word translation){{sfn|Prinsky|2002}}{{sfn|Poulakis|2005}}

Another virtually insurmountable problem facing translators is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which result in writings difficult to precisely translate.{{sfn|Lawson|1960|pp=216–219}}{{sfn|Rhine|1989|pp=447–458}} One such instance is found in the first sentence of [[The Metamorphosis#Lost in translation|"The Metamorphosis"]].{{sfn|Lawson|1960|pp=216–219}} English translators have often sought to render the word ''Ungeziefer'' as "insect"; &lt;!-- in Middle German, however, ''Ungeziefer'' literally means "unclean animal not suitable for sacrifice" --&gt; in today's German it means vermin. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean "bug"&amp;nbsp;– a very general term, unlike the scientific sounding "insect". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation.
Translators have chosen numerous inexact and unsatisfactory ways to represent "[zu einem] ungeheuren Ungeziefer", unable to convey the repetition of the first two syllables and the equal four syllables of the two words in German:
* "gigantic insect" (Muir, 1948)
* "monstrous vermin" (Corngold, 1972, Neugroschel, 1993/1995, Freed, 1996)
* "giant bug" (Underwood, 1981)
* "monstrous insect" (Pasley, 1992)
* "enormous bug" (Appelbaum, 1996)
* "monstrous cockroach" (Hofmann, 2007)

Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun ''[[wikt:Verkehr|Verkehr]]'' in the final sentence of ''The Judgment''. Literally, ''Verkehr'' means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: "At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge".{{sfn|Kafka|1996|p=75}} What gives added weight to the obvious double meaning of 'Verkehr' is Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of "a violent ejaculation".{{sfn|Brod|1960|p=129}}{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p=50}}

[[File:Comadreja Frías2.JPG|250px|thumb|Golden Weasel of the Frías culture, Peru]]The '''Gold Museum of Peru and Weapons of the World''' is a Peruvian museum, located in [[Lima]].

== History ==
[[File:Nariguera Moche2.JPG|250px|thumb|Nose ring of the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture.]]In the 1960s, Miguel Mujica Gallo used his private collection, gathered throughout his life, to open the "Gold Museum of Peru and Weapons of the World", located in the district of [[Santiago de Surco]]. It is in a two-story building made of reinforced concrete and accessed through a vault-style entrance.

The museum was donated to the state of Perú by Gallo and is now administered by Foundation Miguel Mujica Gallo, which is currently directed by Victoria Mujica Diez Canseco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/01/09/0109connguide.html|title=Fakes In Peru's Gold Museum|date=2002-01-09|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==

=== Gold of Peru ===
Gallo's acquisition of more than seven thousand artifacts was inspired by an admiration for Peruvian history. He desired to leave a legacy to this country as homage to the [[Peru]]vian [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[culture]]s in its various manifestations, containing materials such as precious [[metal]]s like [[gold]], [[silver]] and some of [[platinum]], multiple textiles, [[ceramic]]s, [[mummies]] and other valuable objects.

The collection demonstrates what the Spanish found when they came to [[South America]], resulting in fighting between the ancient Peruvians and the Spanish. The collection is valued at over $10 million. The works were found mostly in the Republican era and acquired at the time by They demonstrated advances in metallurgy, customs, beliefs and life.

[[Gold]] and [[silver]] are ubiquitous in the complex religious and magical symbolism of Peruvian cultures. For pre-Inca civilizations, these metals represented the sun-moon, day-night, male-female duality. In the [[Inca Empire]], the sun god or [[Inti]] represented sovereignty on the divine plane and [[Mama Killa]] ("mother moon"), the moon goddess, was Inti's wife, mother of the sky. The Temple of the Sun is an order of priestesses.

The forms that these metals acquired indicated the seniority and power of those who used them and their importance for burials. The ancient Peruvians developed techniques unknown to Europeans at the time, such as adding color to other metal surfaces with gold or silver plating.

Four [[pre-Incan]] cultures stood out at the highest level of goldsmithy. They are [[Vicús culture|Vicus]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Sican culture|Sican]] and [[Chimú culture|Chimu]] that developed on the northern coast of Peru. The [[Inca Empire]] was richer in possession of metal objects in [[gold]] and [[silver]] and the quality and finesse of its finished than its predecessors.

Victoria Mujica, referring to historical documents found in the Archive of the Indies, cites one that says: 

{{quote|In the magnificent temple of Koricancha (Cusco) was a solid gold disc the size of a wagon wheel representing the sun god, golden idols-size human figure with gold and silver llamas also life-size and many of the same metal plates covering the walls of the temple.}}

===Arms of the world===

[[File:Guante Lambayeque.JPG|160px|thumb|Golden Glove of the Sican culture]]
[[File:Bolsa ceremonial2.JPG|100px|thumb|Ceremonial bag of the Frías culture]]

Gallo also collected weapons from around the world. The oldest dated from the 13th century.

Twenty thousand weapons of all times and countries are exhibited in the museum. This collection is one of the world's foremost, for its quantity, quality, superb condition and the famous original holders.

The collection also includes military [[uniform]]s, saddles, armor, [[spur]]s and other objects that define the early through time and characters of history for more than three thousand and three hundred years.

In the early 2000s, accusations arose that a vast majority of gold pieces in the museum were false.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2002/01/09/0109connguide.html Fakes In Peru's Gold Museum] Retrieved 2017-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that "The Consumer Defense Institute has examined 4,257 artifacts from the Peruvian Museum of Gold and concluded they were 'false without a shadow of a doubt'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1524767.stm Peru museum's 'fake' gold] Retrieved 2017-08-04&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Government Bullies: How Everyday Americans are Being Harassed, Abused, and Imprisoned by the Feds''''' is a book by [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] of [[Kentucky]]. The book contains anecdotes of difficulties people have had dealing with agencies of the US federal government.

The book was released in 2012, and is published by [[Center Street]], a main publishing division of [[Hachette Book Group USA]]. The forward to the book was written by Paul's father, [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kenny|first=Jack|title=Senator Paul Takes On Government Bullies|url=http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/books/item/13284-senator-paul-takes-on-government-bullies|newspaper=The New American|date=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In his review of ''Government Bullies'' for ''[[The Washington Times]]'', William Murchison wrote that Paul "never really ties things together with any artistry" and that the book is "more political barrage than academic rendering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murchison|first=William|title=BOOK REVIEW: ‘Government Bullies’|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/24/book-review-government-bullies/|newspaper=Washington Times|date=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism==
Journalists discovered that ''Government Bullies'' contained passages that were copied from articles from the [[Heritage Foundation]] and the [[Cato Institute]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trujillo|first=Mario|title=Plagiarism charges against Paul pile up|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/homenews/189077-plagiarism-charges-against-paul-pile-up|newspaper=The Hill|date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation revealed another four instances of plagiarism from articles by [[Jonathan H.

'''Heritage streetcars''' or '''heritage trams''' are a part of the efforts to preserve rail transit heritage. In addition to preserving street-running rail vehicles, heritage streetcar operations can include upkeep of historic rail infrastructure. Working heritage streetcars are closely related to the growing global [[heritage railway]] movement and form a part of the [[living history]] of rail transport.

As with modern [[streetcar]] systems, the vehicles are referred to as ''trams'' or ''tramcars'' in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australasia]] and certain other places (with ''tramway'' being the line or system), but as streetcars or trolleys in [[North America]]. The last two terms are often used interchangeably in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;Young, Andrew D. (1997). ''Veteran &amp; Vintage Transit'' ({{ISBN|0-9647279-2-7}}). St. Louis: Archway Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''trolley'' being preferred in the eastern US and ''streetcar'' in Canada and the western US. In parts of the United States, internally powered [[bus]]es made to resemble a streetcar are often referred to—inaccurately—as "trolleys". To avoid further confusion with [[trolley bus]]es,  the [[American Public Transportation Association]] (APTA) refers to them as "[[trolley-replica bus]]es".&lt;ref name="APTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apta.com/research/stats/bus/definitions.cfm  |title=Bus and Trolleybus Definitions |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-09-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016074721/http://www.apta.com/research/stats/bus/definitions.cfm |archivedate = 2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==

=== Streetcar preservation ===
Museums, heritage tram line operators, and amateur enthusiasts can preserve original vintage vehicles or create replicas of historic vehicles to re-create or preserve streetcar technology of the past. Heritage vehicles that are kept fully functional can be used on heritage tramlines or for charter traffic.

=== Heritage tramlines ===
Heritage tram lines that offer scheduled service on a certain route and showcase historic aspects of streetcar systems are usually operated by heritage vehicles. Heritage tramlines that operate on a rail network that mainly serves the interest of modern urban mobility have difficulty in exhibiting historic tramway infrastructure, apart from the car itself.  This kind of tramline is often operated mainly to attract tourists instead of providing urban access. Some technical aspects of historic tram infrastructure can prevent the use of a heritage line as an integral part of the public transport system. For example, heritage tramlines often lack [[Disability|handicapped]] access which is required by law in many countries. Heritage tramlines can be either newly installed lines (created in modern times, 1970s or later) or be surviving older tramlines that have retained use of historic trams for all or most of their scheduled service.

=== Heritage tramways ===
Rail tracks designated solely or mainly to heritage streetcar traffic offer best opportunities for preservation of historic streetcar scenes. Some heritage tramways use all-new construction while others make use of an existing, usually disused, [[freight railway]], by installing [[overhead line|overhead wires]] and passenger stops. In some cities, new heritage tramways have been installed in the city center, to attract tourists and shoppers. Proponents of such projects claim that using a simple, reliable form of transit from 50 or 100 years ago can bring history to life for 21st century users.  In serving certain types of transport needs, heritage tramways can turn out to be more economical than their modern counterparts, often with installations that can be built at a fraction of the cost of a corresponding modern standard. However, there are trade-offs; among other things, heritage systems can offer slower speeds, less capacity and higher upkeep costs due to use of non-industry-standard technology.

== Around the world ==

=== Europe ===

==== Austria ====
The Remise Museum in Vienna, opened in 2014, covers the history of public transport in the city of Vienna and offers an extensive tram collection to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wienerlinien.at/museum|title=Verkehrsmuseum Remise - Attraktionen - Fahrgastinfo - Wiener Linien|website=wienerlinien.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Styrian municipality centre [[Graz]] has a tram museum since 1971 located in the depot of Mariatrost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramway-museum-graz.at/|title=Tramway Museum Graz|first=LearnConsult (info@learnconsult.com), OfficeCMS|last=(info@officecms.com)|website=www.tramway-museum-graz.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another heritage tram is operating in Styria between the railway station of [[Mariazell]] and the nearby Erlaufsee, mainly with Ex-Vienna streetcars. This line was recently electrified on longer sections and also extended towards the city center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumstramway.at/|title=Museumstramway Mariazell|website=www.museumstramway.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Innsbruck]] the city's trams are collected and renovated – together with other Tyrolean railway vehicles – by the association [[Tiroler MuseumsBahnen]] which has its museum in the old station of the [[Stubaitalbahn]].

==== Benelux ====
In [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] the Electrisch Museumtramlijn operates historic trams over a {{convert|7|km|1|abbr=on}} length of former railway line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumtramlijn.org/|title=Electrische Museumtramlijn Amsterdam|website=museumtramlijn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tram networks of [[Hague]] and [[Rotterdam]] have also their tram museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hovm.nl/ Haags Openbaar Vervoer Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122747/http://www.hovm.nl/ |date=2015-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumtramlijn.org/|title=Electrische Museumtramlijn Amsterdam|website=www.museumtramlijn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trammuseumrotterdam.nl/ Stichting RoMeO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210181300/http://www.trammuseumrotterdam.nl/ |date=2015-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association Tramweg Stichting maintains and operates in every three cities its own vehicles, partly as collection of these museums. In [[Belgium]] there are 3 tram museums, one in [[Brussels]] – organizing several weekend rides to Tervueren and around the city – and other in [[Antwerpen]]. The 70&amp;nbsp;km-long [[Kusttram]] (the coastal line between Knokke and De Panne via [[Oostende]]) features also some vehicles of the once extensive interurban network stored in the depot of De Panne and Knokke operated by [http://www.ttonoordzeevzw.be/ TTO].
[[File:Tramasvi.jpg|thumb|ASVi museum line. Standard type tram 10308 with Brabant type trailer 19220 in the city of Thuin.]][http://www.asvi.be ASVi] run a museum in Thuin and an 8&amp;nbsp;km line with electric and diesel cars on a part of the once SNCV line 92 and on a part on the once SNCB line 109 after regauging to meter gauge.

==== Central Europe ====
In [[Prague]] the [[Czech Republic]] the [[Prague Integrated Transport]] operates Historical Tram Line No. 41 at weekends using historical tram vehicles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpp.cz/en/historical-tram-line-no-41|title=dpp.cz &gt; Historical Tram Line No. 41 – Dopravní podnik hlavního města Prahy|first=Dopravní podnik hlavního města Prahy, WDF – Web Design Factory, s. r.|last=o.|website=www.dpp.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a week-long operating Nostalgic Tram Line No. 23&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpp.cz/en/nostalgic-line-no-23|title=dpp.cz &gt; Nostalgic Line No. 23 – Dopravní podnik hlavního města Prahy|first=Dopravní podnik hlavního města Prahy, WDF – Web Design Factory, s. r.|last=o.|website=www.dpp.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; using old PCC based ČKD Tatra T3&lt;ref&gt;[[Tatra T3|/ Tatra T3]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} tram vehicles.

In Budapest, Hungary, heritage public transport services, two vintage tram lines and a riverboat line, are operated from May to the end of September on weekends.

==== Estonia ====
In [[Tallinn]] there are renovated retrotrams in public use since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrotram.eu/product/|title=Retrotram|website=http://www.retrotram.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finland ====
In [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], Oy Stadin Ratikat Ab offers charter tramrides with vintage cars and in summer months operates an in-street heritage [[Helsinki tram#Additional Lines|tram line]] on the [[Helsinki tram]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadinratikat.fi/english/museoliikenne.html|title=Oy Stadin Ratikat Ab|website=www.stadinratikat.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
[[File:Wambrechies Tram Marquette.JPG|thumb|French Deûle Valley tourist tram]]
In France, the Deûle Valley tramway near [[Lille]] which runs along a {{convert|3|km|1|abbr=on}} track from [[Marquette-lez-Lille]] to [[Wambrechies]] features several tram vehicles dating back to the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linternaute.com/sortir/chemins-de-fer/tramway-touristique/marquette-wambrechies.shtml La vallée de la Deûle en tramway from Linternaute (in French).] Retrieved 2009-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
[[File:Tram a Sassi.jpg|thumb|left|Turin historic streetcars at depot]]
[[Turin]], in the northwest of [[Italy]], operates the historical route 7, a double way circular route around the town centre.
Turin is the first town in Italy with tramway lines powered by historical streetcars.
The inauguration of the heritage tramway line was during the
celebrations of the 150th anniversary of national unity, in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atts.to.it/|title=Home|website=www.atts.to.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nearby metropolis of [[Milan]], the continued, extensive use of the "Series 1500 tram"&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Tram ATM serie 1500]]&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a heritage tramway which blends into everyday urban life to the extent that it is not regarded as one.

==== Norway ====
In [[Bergen]] the [[Bergen's Electric Tramway|Bergens Elektriske Sporvei]] has operated a short heritage tramway since 1993.

In [[Oslo]] the [[Oslo Tramway Museum|Tramway Museum]] operates veteran trams on the [[Trams in Oslo|tram network of Oslo]] on the first Sunday of every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sporveismuseet.no/english/|title=English|date=13 May 2013|website=sporveismuseet.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Portugal ====
Heritage trams provide all of the service on some of the [[Trams in Lisbon|Lisbon tramway network]] in [[Portugal]], and in [[Porto]] a [[Trams in Porto|long-closed section of tramway]] in the historic Batalha section of the town center was reopened in 2007 for use by historic trams.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Michael (Dec. 2007). "The return to Batalha". ''[[Tramways &amp; Urban Transit]]'', p. 490.  LRTA Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are now three such heritage routes in Porto, as well as a [[Porto Tram Museum|tram museum]]. In [[Sintra]], there is a seasonally operated heritage tramway.

==== Russia ====
In [[Saint Petersburg|Saint-Petersburg]] on [[Vasilyevsky Island]] the former [[Vasileostrovsky tram depot]], which closed in the 1990s after the city's extensive tram network was cut down due to increasing automobile traffic, was converted into the [[Museum of Electrical Transport (Saint Petersburg)|Museum of Electrical Transport]]. Apart from excursions to itself, the museum organizes museum fleet rides along downtown tracks (including some now otherwise unused for regular tram service) on a number of public festivals and some summer weekends. A heritage tram of the type that used to run from the inner city nearly to the nearby front line during the [[World War II]] [[siege of Leningrad|siege of the city]] is installed as a war and tram memorial, not far from [[Avtovo (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Avtovo]] metro station. A modern replica of a late-19th-century [[horsecar]] stands in front of [[Vasileostrovskaya (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Vasileostrovskaya]] metro station.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==== Spain ====
[[File:port de soller to soller tram arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Port de Sóller]] to [[Soller tram]], [[Majorca]], [[Spain]]]]
In [[Spain]], a new heritage tramway was opened in [[A Coruña]] (La Coruña) in 1997 (now out of order). [[Tramvia Blau]] in [[Barcelona]] has been in operation since 1904 but still uses trams built in 1904–15, and thus has become a heritage line. Similarly, the tramway connecting [[Sóller]] with [[Port de Sóller|Puerto de Sóller]], on the island of [[Majorca]], is operated with vintage trams; thus, although opened in 1913, it is a heritage line.

==== Sweden ====
In [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]], a technical museum operates an [[Street running|in-street]] heritage tram line in summer months. In Sweden's [[Capital city|capital]], [[Stockholm]], a {{convert|3|km|1|adj=on}} section of former route 7 was reopened in 1991 as [[Djurgårdslinjen|a heritage tramway]], using vintage cars.

==== Turkey ====
Two separate heritage tramways operate in [[Istanbul, Turkey]], one on the European side of the [[Bosporus]] and one on the Asian side. The former opened in 1991 between [[Tünel]] (funicular station) and [[Taksim Square|Taksim]] metro station, and the latter in 2003 in the suburb of [[Kadıköy]].

A heritage tramline, opened in 2011, serves [[Bursa]].

==== United Kingdom ====
In the [[United Kingdom]] the majority of tram lines were lifted before the heritage movement began to flourish, and tracks and trams scrapped. Although trams are returning to British Cities, they are modern transportation systems (also known as [[light rail]]), not heritage operations. There are, however, three notable heritage tram operations in the UK.

The [[National Tramway Museum]] at [[Crich]] near [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]], is located in an old limestone quarry in Derbyshire, and has a collection of preserved trams. Strictly speaking, this would be considered a tramway museum with an operating tram line, rather than being a heritage tramway.  Among the [[List of heritage railways in the Isle of Man|heritage railways on the Isle of Man]], at least the [[Manx Electric Railway]] qualifies as a heritage tramway as well. Otherwise, the [[Blackpool tramway]] is the only surviving first-generation urban tram system in the UK and provides a service running along the town's promenade and also as far as Fleetwood using both historic and modern trams. There is also a modern "[[Wirral Tramway|Heritage Tramway]]" [http://www.mtps.co.uk/] in [[Birkenhead]], [[Merseyside]].

==== United States ====
{{See also|Streetcars in North America#Heritage streetcar systems|Streetcars in North America#Museums}}

Heritage streetcar lines are operating in over 20 U.S. cities, and are in planning or construction stages in others. Several new heritage streetcar lines have been opened since the 1970s; some are stand-alone lines while others make use of a section of a modern [[light rail]] system.

[[File:Route 15 PCC.jpg|thumbnail|A [[SEPTA]] [[SEPTA route 15|Route 15]] trolley in [[Philadelphia]] around 2006]]
Heritage [[streetcar]] systems operating in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]; [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Dallas, Texas]]; [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] ([[SEPTA route 15]]) and [[Tampa, Florida]] are among the larger examples. A heritage line operates in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and will become a part of the city's new transit system. Another such line, called [[Silver Line (San Diego Trolley)|The Silver Line]], operates in [[San Diego]].  The [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]], or Muni, runs exclusively historic trolleys on its heavily used [[F Market &amp; Wharves]] line, serving Market Street and the tourist areas along the Embarcadero, including [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, California|Fisherman's Wharf]]. [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's]] [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] runs exclusively [[PCC streetcars]] on its [[Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line]], part of that authority's [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]]. The historic rolling stock is retained because doing so cost less than would a full rebuild of the line to accommodate either a [[Passenger rail terminology#Heavy rail|heavy rail]] line (like the rest of the Red Line or the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] or [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange]] Lines) or a modern [[light rail]] line (like the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]). It is also unique in that it used almost exclusively by commuters and is not particularly popular with tourists (and thus may not really be a true heritage system, despite the historic rolling stock).

[[Dallas]] has the [[McKinney Avenue Transit Authority]]. [[Denver]] has the [[Platte Valley Trolley]], a heritage line recalling the open-sided streetcars of the early 20th century. [[Old Pueblo Trolley]] is a volunteer-run heritage line in [[Tucson, Arizona]]; its popularity inspired, in large part, a modern streetcar system for Tucson currently in the final planning stages, which would incorporate the heritage line. The [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] in [[San Jose, California]] also maintains a heritage trolley fleet, for occasional use on the downtown portion of a new [[light rail]] system opened in 1988. Other cities with heritage streetcar lines include [[Galveston, Texas]]; [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro, California]] (home of the [[port of Los Angeles]]). The [[National Park Service]] operates a system in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].

Most heritage streetcar lines use overhead [[overhead line|trolley wires]] to power the cars, as was the case with the vast majority of original streetcar lines. However, on the [[Galveston Island Trolley]] heritage line, which opened in 1988, using modern-day replicas of vintage trolleys, the cars were powered by an on-board diesel engine, as local authorities were concerned that overhead wires would be too susceptible to damage from hurricanes.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; In spite of that precaution, damage in 2008 from [[Hurricane Ike]] was heavy enough to put the line out of service indefinitely, and as of 2014 it has yet to reopen.

Another heritage line lacking trolley wires is [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah, Georgia's]] [[River Street streetcar|River Street Streetcar]] line, which opened in February 2009. It is the first line to use a diesel/electric streetcar whose built-in electricity generator is powered by [[biodiesel]].  In [[El Reno, Oklahoma]], the ''Heritage Express Trolley'' connects Heritage Park with downtown,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elreno.org/tour/attractions.asp El Reno Attractions] (El Reno Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau)&lt;/ref&gt; using a single streetcar that has been equipped with a propane-powered on-board generator. The car formerly operated on [[SEPTA|SEPTA's]] [[Norristown High Speed Line]], where [[third rail|third-rail]] current collection is used.  The El Reno line is [[single track (rail)|single-track]] and {{convert|0.9|mi|km}} long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jtbell.net/transit/ElReno/ El Reno, Oklahoma: Heritage Express Trolley] (unofficial page)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portland, Oregon]], replica-vintage cars provided a heritage streetcar service, named [[Portland Vintage Trolley]], along a section of that city's 1986-operated [[MAX light rail|light rail]] line from 1991 to 2014.&lt;ref name=Kgw2014-03-02&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in Portland, the [[Willamette Shore Trolley]] is a seasonal, volunteer-operated excursion service on a former freight railroad line, to [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]]. This operation uses a diesel-powered generator on a trailer towed or pushed by the streetcar, as the line lacks trolley wires. Similarly, the [[Astoria Riverfront Trolley]] in Astoria, Oregon, is a seasonal heritage-trolley service along a section of former freight railroad and using a diesel-powered generator on a trailer to provide electricity to the streetcar.

Other seasonal or weekends-only heritage streetcar lines operate in [[Yakima, Washington]] ([[Yakima Electric Railway Museum]]); [[Fort Collins Municipal Railway|Fort Collins, Colorado]]; and [[Fort Smith Trolley Museum|Fort Smith, Arkansas]].  The Fort Collins and Fort Smith lines are both operated by an original (as opposed to replica) [[Birney]]-type streetcar, and in both cases the individual car in use is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="fort collins hc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort Collins Municipal Railway Birney Safety Streetcar #21|year=2009|work=Fort Collins History Connection|publisher=City of Fort Collins|url=http://history.poudrelibraries.org/u?/hd,883 | accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ahpp-birney&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places: Search results for Fort Smith, Sebastian County |year=2012 |publisher=Arkansas Historic Preservation Program (an agency of the state government's Department of Arkansas Heritage) |url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/historic-properties/national-register/results.aspx?county=Sebastian&amp;city=Fort%20Smith&amp;historic_name=&amp;description= |accessdate=2012-06-14 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Philadelphia, the Penn's Landing Trolley operated seasonal and weekend service as a volunteer operation with former [[Philadelphia and Western Railroad|P&amp;W]] equipment between September 1982 and December 17, 1995 on the [[Philadelphia Belt Line Railroad|Philadelphia Belt Line]] track on [[Columbus Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Columbus Boulevard]] in the historic [[Penn's Landing]] district.

Over 50 years later, the revival of extended [[Streetcars in New Orleans|streetcar operations]] in [[New Orleans]] is credited by many to the worldwide fame gained by its streetcars built by the [[Perley A. Thomas Car Works]] in 1922–23. These cars were operating on the system's Desire route made famous by [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''.  Some Perley Thomas cars were maintained in continuous service on the [[St. Charles Avenue Streetcar]] line until [[Hurricane Katrina]] caused major damage to the right-of-way in 2005. The historic streetcars suffered only minor damage and several have been transferred to serve on the recently rebuilt Canal Street line while the St. Charles line is being repaired. New Orleans' St. Charles streetcar line is a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Pre-Katrina, New Orleans had plans to reconstruct the Desire line along its original route down St. Claude Avenue.

In [[San Francisco]], parts of the [[San Francisco cable car system|cable car]] and [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|Muni]] streetcar system (specifically the above-mentioned F Market &amp; Wharves line) are heritage lines, although they are also functioning parts of the city's transit system. The cable cars are a National Historic Landmark and are rare examples of vehicles with this distinction. Located east of San Francisco is one of several museums in the U.S. that restore and operate vintage streetcars and [[interurban]]s, the [[Western Railway Museum]].

==== Argentina ====
{{Main|Trams in Buenos Aires}}
In [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], a heritage tram line was inaugurated In 1980&lt;ref name=morrison /&gt; in the [[Caballito, Buenos Aires|Caballito neighbourhood]] on existing vintage street tracks. Presently a proposal for a heritage tram in colonial [[San Telmo]] is under discussion.


[[Buenos Aires|Argentina's capital]] also hosts the ''La Brugeoise cars'', the [[Buenos Aires Metro]] (''Subte'') [[Line A (Buenos Aires Metro)|Line A]] [[rolling stock]], since its inauguration in 1913.  They were built by Belgian [[Rolling stock|railway rolling stock]] manufacturer ''[[La Brugeoise et Nicaise et Delcuve|La Brugeoise, et Nicaise, et Delcuve]]'' between 1911 and 1919 for the [[Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company|Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company's]] (''Compañía de Tranvías Anglo-Argentina'', CTAA in Spanish) first metro line.  They were originally designed to run both as [[Rapid transit|metro]] and [[tram]]way cars, but they were refurbished in 1927 for underground use only.  They are the oldest metro rolling stock in commercial service in the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enelsubte.com/ enelSubte.com] – [http://www.enelsubte.com/noticias/la-linea-avanza-los-anos-80-425 La línea A avanza hasta los años ochenta] (Spanish only)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a tourist attraction and part of [[Buenos Aires]] cultural heritage. The A line also contains a vintage station, ''[[Perú (Buenos Aires Metro)|Perú]]''. They have been in continuous use for a whole century since 1913 to January 2013 when they were replaced by new coaches, with an average of about 300 thousand daily passengers, up from the 170,000 who traveled on them on their first day. Some of the coaches had already been preserved for touristic purposes, and now the rest of the fleet is under careful restoration and is intended to render service on weekends and holidays.

==== Brazil ====
After briefly operating a short heritage line along Embaré Beach in the mid-1980s, [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], [[Brazil]], in 2000 opened a new heritage tramway in the historic Valongo district, using a car built in 1911 with an peculiar rail gauge of {{RailGauge|1350mm}}. The line is being extended, and additional trams have been added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramz.com/br/ss/ss.html|title=The Tramways of Santos (São Paulo state), Brazil|first=Allen|last=Morrison|date=June 2006|accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A heritage tramway was opened in [[Belém, Brazil]], in 2005.

A heritage tramway has operated in [[Campinas|Campinas, Brazil's]], [[Lagoa do Taquaral|Parque Portugal]] since 1972.&lt;ref name=morrison&gt;Morrison, Allen (1996). ''Latin America by Streetcar''. New York: Bonde Press. {{ISBN|0-9622348-3-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7069">'''Hocus pocus''' is a generic term that may be derived from an ancient language and is currently used by stage [[Magician (illusion)|magicians]], usually the [[magic word]]s spoken when bringing about some sort of change. It was once a common term for a magician, [[Juggling|juggler]], or other similar [[entertainers]].

== History ==
The earliest known [[English language|English-language]] work on magic, or what was then known as ''[[legerdemain]]'' (sleight of hand), was published anonymously in 1635 under the title ''Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34375/34375-h/34375-h.htm "Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain"]&lt;/ref&gt; Further research suggests that "Hocus Pocus" was the stage name of a well known magician of the era. This may be William Vincent, who is recorded as having been granted a license to perform magic in [[England]] in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hocuspocusjr.com/hocvspocvsjr.htm The Web Site About the First Illustrated Book in the English Language Devoted Entirely to the Subject of Magic]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he was the author of the book is unknown.

== Conjectured origins ==
{{Refimprove

}}
The origins of the term remain obscure. The most popular conjecture is that it is a garbled Latin religious phrase or some form of [[dog Latin|‘dog’ Latin]]. Some have associated it with similar-sounding fictional, mythical, or legendary names. Others dismiss it as merely a combination of [[nonsense word]]s.

In some [[Slavic language]]s, "pokus" means an "attempt" or an "experiment", as for example in [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Slovak language]]. The word is derived from the [[Protoslavic]] word "kusiti", which is itself derived from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] "kausajn" meaning "to try", "to attempt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Králik|first1=Ľubor|title=Stručný etymologický slovník slovenčiny|date=2015|publisher=Veda}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This may indicate that the wording belongs to the [[alchemy]] kitchen and court of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1552 – 1612). Also, ''hocus'' may mean "to cheat" in Latin or a distorted form of the word ''hoc'', "this". Combination of the two words may give a sense, especially both meanings together "this attempt/experiment" and "cheated attempt/experiment".{{cn|date=December 2016}}

=== Dog Latin ===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the term originates from ''hax pax max Deus adimax'', a [[pseudo-Latin]] phrase used as a [[magical formula]] by [[Conjuror|conjurors]].&lt;ref&gt;Compact Oxford English Dictionary. [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/hocuspocus] http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/hocuspocus&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe it originates from a corruption or [[parody]] of the [[Catholic liturgy]] of the [[Eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]], which contains the phrase “''[[Words of Institution|Hoc est enim corpus meum]]''”, meaning ''This is my body''.&lt;ref&gt;''Online Etymology Dictionary'' [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hocus-pocus] http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hocus-pocus&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation goes back to speculations by the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[prelate]] [[John Tillotson]], who wrote in 1694:{{Quote|In all probability those common juggling words of ''hocus pocus'' are nothing else but a corruption of ''hoc est corpus'', by way of ridiculous imitation of the priests of the [[Catholic Church|Church of Rome]] in their trick of [[Transubstantiation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19991007 Random House Words@Random: The Mavens' Word of the Day]; see [[Talk:Hocus Pocus (magic)]] for full quotation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This claim is substantiated by the fact that in the [[Netherlands]], the words ''Hocus pocus'' are usually accompanied by the additional words ''pilatus pas'', and this is said to be based on a post-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] parody of the traditional Catholic rite of [[transubstantiation]] during [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], being a Dutch corruption of the [[Latin]] words "''Hoc est corpus meum''" and the [[credo]], which reads in part, "''sub [[Pontius Pilate|Pontio Pilato]] [[Passion (Christianity)|passus]] et [[Burial of Jesus|sepultus est]]''", meaning ''under Pontius Pilate he suffered and was buried''.&lt;ref&gt;In de Kou, ''[[Godfried Bomans]] en Michel van der Plas over hun roomse jeugd en hoe het hun verging'', Amsterdam, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way the phrase is in [[Scandinavia]] usually accompanied by ''filiokus'', a corruption of the term [[filioque]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} from the [[Latin Church|Latin]] version of the [[Nicene Creed]], meaning “''and from the Son''”. The variant spelling ''filipokus'' is common in [[Russia]], a predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox]] nation, as well as certain other post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Additionally, the word for "stage trick" in [[Russian language|Russian]], ''fokus'', is derived from ''hocus pocus''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Magician’s name ===
Others believe that it is an appeal to the folkloric [[Norse mythology|Norse]] magician Ochus Bochus:{{Quote|text=Hocus Pocus: Words of pseudomagical import. According to [[Sharon Turner]] in ''The History of the Anglo-Saxons'' (4 vols., 1799-1805), they were believed to be derived from ''Ochus Bochus'', a magician and [[demon]] of the north.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}}}

=== Nonsense word ===
As an alternative to other theories, it may simply be [[pseudo-Latin]] with no meaning, made up to impress people:{{Quote|text=I will speak of one man... that went about in King James his time ... who called himself, “''The Kings Majesties most excellent Hocus Pocus''”, and so was he called, because that at the playing of every Trick, he used to say, “''Hocus pocus, tontus talontus, vade celeriter jubeo''”, a dark composure of words, to blinde the eyes of the beholders, to make his Trick pass the more currently without discovery, because when the eye and the ear of the beholder are both earnestly busied, the Trick is not so easily discovered, nor the Imposture discerned.|author=[[Thomas Ady]] |source= ''A Candle in the Dark'', 1656&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/hocus-pocus.html The Phrase Finder.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"'''I'm a Good Ol' Rebel'''", also called "'''The Good Old Rebel'''", is a pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Folk music|folk song]] and rebel song commonly attributed to Major [[James Innes Randolph]]. It was initially created by Randolph as a poem before evolving into an oral folk song and was only published in definitive written form in 1914.
== Background ==
After the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]'s loss to the U.S. in the [[American Civil War]], "I'm a Good Ol' Rebel" was created as a poem by former Confederate major James Innes Randolph in the 1860s.&lt;ref name=dd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Good_Old_Rebel.htm |title=The Good Old Rebel (Song) |publisher=Deaddisc.com |date=1914-04-04 |accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WRt_siIW22sC&amp;pg=PA9|title=The Lost Colony of the Confederacy|first=Eugene C. |last=Harter|year=1985|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=1585441023|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its music was based upon the [[Minstrel]] song "[[Joe Bowers (song)]]". It is not known who initially created the music, with a claim in 1864 attributing it to "J.R.T." and an 1866 sheet music copy ironically dedicating it to [[Thad Stevens]].&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite book |title=Folk Songs of Middle Tennessee: The George Boswell Collection |first=Charles |last=Wolfe |year=1997 |publisher=University of Tennessee Press |isbn=0870499580|page=95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I'm a Good Ol' Rebel" was first published as a poem locally in [[Maryland]] in 1898 but was published as a song nationwide in the April 4, 1914 edition of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name=dd /&gt;&lt;ref name=bf&gt;{{cite book |title=American Ballads and Folk Songs |first=Allan |last=Lomax |year=1934 |publisher=Courier Corporation |isbn=0486282767|page=535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] in tone, expressing hatred towards the U.S. and its national symbols such as the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]]. It reflected a view held by some ex-Confederates who were reluctant to accept [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] with the United States and an expression of the bitterness and anger they felt after the Confederacy had lost the [[American Civil War]] to the U.S.&lt;ref name=m&gt;{{cite book |title=Maryland Wits and Baltimore Bards: A Literary History with Notes on Washington Writers |first=Frank |last=Shivers |year=1985 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=0801858100|page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is speculated that the song did not reflect Randolph's personal views and was intended "... to illustrate the irreconcilable spirit of the illiterate in some sections", as it had been sung and passed through oral tradition throughout [[Southern United States|Southern]] bars.&lt;ref name=bf /&gt;

The published version initially contained only four verses, but individual performers have added their own verses to reflect their own opinions on the United States.&lt;ref name=m /&gt;&lt;ref name=t /&gt; In 1991, a version was released on the ''[[Songs of the Civil War]]'' album performed by [[Hoyt Axton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Dirt Band |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/songs-of-the-civil-war-columbia-mw0000265333 |title=Songs of the Civil War |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The song became known outside the United States. The American-born [[Consuelo Montagu, Duchess of Manchester]], once performed the song uncensored for the future [[King Edward VII]] when he was [[Prince of Wales]] in London. Upon hearing the song, he later requested a repeat performance of "...that fine American song with the cuss words in it."&lt;ref name=bf /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/pooroldrebel.htm |title=O, I'm a Good Old Rebel (Song) |publisher=Civilwarhome.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the band Junto released a parody of the song as an anti-[[Barack Obama]] song titled "I'm A Good Ole American".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Junto |url=https://open.spotify.com/album/6UGWvA8FcVUdnMnj1tBNuI |title=I'm a Good Ole American by Junto |publisher=Spotify |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''imagined community''' is a concept developed by [[Benedict Anderson]] in his 1983 book ''[[Imagined Communities]]'', to analyze [[nationalism]]. Anderson depicts a [[nation]] as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who perceive themselves as part of that group.&lt;ref name="ic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Imagined communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism |last=Anderson |first=Benedict R. O'G. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=978-0-86091-546-1
 |pages=6–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mmoZFtCpuoC |edition=Revised and extended.|accessdate= 5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

The [[mass media|media]] also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.

==Origin==
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible because of "[[print capitalism]]".&lt;ref name=nationalismproject&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalismproject.org/books/a_b.htm|title=The Nationalism Project: Books by Author A-B|work=nationalismproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and media in the [[vernacular]] (instead of exclusive script languages, such as [[Latin]]) in order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged. Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around their "national print-languages."

==Nationalism and imagined communities==
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of nationalism are the declining importance of privileged access to particular script languages (such as [[Latin]]) because of mass vernacular literacy;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and hereditary monarchy;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily newspapers")&lt;ref name=nationalismproject/&gt;—all phenomena occurring with the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=nationalismproject/&gt;

While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:

"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists. (2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and] (3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and even incoherence."&lt;ref name="ic" /&gt;

Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but each nation with these kinds of memorials claim these soldiers as their own. No matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed them within their own imagined community.&lt;ref name="ic" /&gt;

==Nation as an imagined community==
He defined a nation as "an imagined political community".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; As Anderson puts it, a nation "is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; Members of the community probably will never know each of the other members face to face; however, they may have similar interests or identify as part of the same nation. Members hold in their minds a mental image of their affinity: for example, the nationhood felt with other members of your nation when your "imagined community" participates in a larger event such as the [[Olympic Games]].

Finally, a nation is a [[community]] because,{{quote|regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;}}

==Context and influence==
Benedict Anderson arrived at his theory because he felt that neither [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] nor liberal theory adequately explained nationalism.

Anderson falls into the "[[historicist]]" or "[[modernist]]" school of [[nationalism]] along with [[Ernest Gellner]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in that he posits that nations and nationalism are products of [[modernity]] and have been created as means to political and economic ends. This school stands in opposition to the [[primordialists]], who believe that nations, if not nationalism, have existed since early human history. Imagined communities can be seen as a form of [[social constructionism]] on a par with [[Edward Said|Edward Said's]] concept of [[imagined geographies]].

In contrast to Gellner and Hobsbawm, Anderson is not hostile to the idea of nationalism nor does he think that nationalism is obsolete in a globalizing world. Anderson values the utopian element in nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161125065519/https://www.uio.no/english/research/interfaculty-research-areas/culcom/news/2005/anderson.html Interview with Benedict Anderson by Lorenz Khazaleh], University of Oslo website&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harald Bauder, the concept of imagined communities remains highly relevant in a contemporary context of how nation-states frame and formulate their identities in relation to domestic and foreign policy, such as policies towards immigrants and migration.&lt;ref&gt;Bauder, H. (2011) Immigration Dialectic: Imagining Community, Economy and Nation. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Euan Hague, "Anderson's concept of nations being 'imagined communities' has become standard within books reviewing geographical thought".&lt;ref name=sage&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/9613_020037ch1and2.pdf|title=Benedict Anderson|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the term was coined to specifically describe nationalism, it is now used more broadly, almost blurring it with [[community of interest]]. For instance, it can be used to refer to a community based on sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, C. (2012). Imagined communities: initiatives around LGBTQ ageing in Italy. ''Modern Italy'', 17(4), 449-464. doi:10.1080/13532944.2012.706997&lt;/ref&gt; or awareness of global risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, U 2011, "Cosmopolitanism as Imagined Communities of Global Risk", ''American Behavioral Scientist'', 55, 10, pp. 1346-1361, Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost, viewed 2 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karel Hubáček''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈkarɛl ˈɦubaːtʃɛk}}; 23 February 1924 &amp;ndash; 25 November 2011) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[architect]] who designed the [[Ještěd Tower]] and hotel atop the [[Ještěd]] mountain near [[Liberec]].&lt;ref name=ctk&gt;{{cite news|title=Czech architect Hubacek, author of famous Jested hotel, dies |url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-architect-hubacek-author-of-famous-jested-hotel-dies/719894 |work=[[Czech News Agency]] |publisher=[[ČeskéNoviny.cz]] |date=25 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112132100/http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-architect-hubacek-author-of-famous-jested-hotel-dies/719894|archivedate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubáček's best known work was the Ještěd Tower, which was constructed between 1966 and 1973.&lt;ref name=ctk/&gt; In 1969, the Ještěd Tower received the [[Perret Prize]] from the [[International Union of Architects]].&lt;ref name=ctk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/outstanding-czech-architect-dies|title=Outstanding Czech architect dies|work=[[Czech Radio]]|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Czech architects named Hubáček's tower most successful domestic architectural work of the 20th Century.&lt;ref name=ctk/&gt;

In addition to the Ještěd Tower, Hubáček designed buildings throughout the Czech Republic. Czech architects named Hubáček the fourth most influential Czech architect of all time. He was the only living architect to place in the top ten in the same survey.&lt;ref name=ctk/&gt;

Hubáček was born in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], on 23 February 1924.  He died in the [[Czech Republic]] on 25 November 2011, at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=ctk/&gt;

A '''lexicon''', '''word-hoard''', '''wordbook''', or '''word-stock''' is the [[vocabulary]] of a person, [[language]], or branch of [[knowledge]] (such as [[nautical]] or [[medical]]).  In [[linguistics]], a '''lexicon''' is a language's inventory of [[lexeme]]s. The word "lexicon" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|λεξικόν}} (''lexicon''), neuter of {{lang|grc|λεξικός}} (''lexikos'') meaning "of or for words."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός] in Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Perseus Digital Library). Sc. βιβλίον "book").&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language's words (its [[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]); and a [[grammar]], a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences. The lexicon is also thought to include [[bound morpheme]]s, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most [[affix]]es).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=OKvziaqXzXwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=morphemes+lexicon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CB_0QMidAO&amp;sig=1YiUJnAc0kj-Pbh0V6duJhHPktg&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl99OPt_TTAhWK0xoKHUolARo4ChDoAQgpMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=morphemes%20lexicon&amp;f=false|title=Morphological structure, lexical representation, and lexical access|last2=Taft|first2=Marcus|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|last1=Dominiek|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some analyses, [[compound word]]s and certain classes of [[idiom]]atic expressions and other [[collocation]]s are also considered to be part of the lexicon. [[Dictionary|Dictionaries]] represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.

== Size and organization ==

Items in the lexicon are called lexemes, or lexical items, or word forms. Lexemes are not atomic elements but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe the size of a lexicon, [[lexeme]]s are grouped into lemmas. A [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] is a group of lexemes generated by [[Inflection#Inflectional morphology|inflectional morphology]]. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords which list the [[citation form]]s and any [[English irregular verbs|irregular forms]], since these must be learned to use the words correctly. Lexemes derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. [[Part of speech|Closed categories]], such as [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] or [[pronoun]]s, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily [[Syntax|syntactic]]. Open categories, such as [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s, have highly active generation mechanisms and their lexemes are more [[Semantics|semantic]] in nature.

== Lexicalization and other mechanisms in the lexicon ==
{{anchor#Lexicalization}}

A central role of the lexicon is the documenting of established ''lexical norms and conventions''. [[Lexicalization]] is the process in which new words, having gained widespread usage, enter the lexicon. Since lexicalization&lt;ref name="Geert2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geert |first=Booij |title=The grammar of words : an introduction to linguistic morphology |series=Oxford textbooks in linguistics |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-928042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; may modify lexemes phonologically and morphologically, it is possible that a single etymological source may be inserted into a single lexicon in two or more forms. These pairs, called a [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]], are often close semantically. Two examples are ''[[wikt:aptitude|aptitude]]'' versus ''[[wikt:attitude|attitude]]'' and ''[[wikt:employ|employ]]'' versus ''[[wikt:imply|imply]]''.&lt;ref name="Skeat 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skeat |first=Walter |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRGhnkZq3HQC |date=2010-04-17 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=978-1-4400-5722-9 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ornan |first=Uzzi |authorlink=Uzzi Ornan |title=The Final Word — Mechanism For Hebrew Word Generation |year=2003 |publisher=Haifa University Press |location=Haifa |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf |first=Allan |title=Predicting New Words — The Secrets of Their Success |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-13006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the planned creation of new roots (often on a large-scale), such as ''slang'', ''branding''.
* Borrowing of foreign words.
* [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] (composition), the combination of lexemes to make a single word.
* [[Abbreviation]] of compounds.
* [[Acronyms]], the reduction of compounds to their initial letters, such as [[wikt:NASA|NASA]] and [[wikt:laser|laser (from "LASER")]].
* [[Inflection]], a morphology change with a category, such as number or tense.
* [[Morphological derivation|Derivation]], a morphological change resulting in a change of category.
* [[Agglutination]], the compounding of morphemes into a single word.

===Neologisms (new words)===
[[Neologism]]s are new lexeme candidates which, if they gain wide usage over time, become part of a language's lexicon. Neologisms are often introduced by children who produce erroneous forms by mistake.&lt;ref name="Jaeger2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaeger |first=Jeri J. |title=Kid's slips: what young children's slips of the tongue reveal about language development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1YGd1FkRgAC |accessdate=8 April 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-8058-3579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common source is slang and activities such as advertising and branding.

===Neologisms that maintain the sound of their external source===
There are two types of borrowings (neologisms based on external sources) that retain the sound of the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] material:
* Borrowing using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization: guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords
* Borrowing using a target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization: phono-semantic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phonetic matching.

====Guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords====
The following are examples of external lexical expansion using the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] lexical item as the basic material for the neologization, listed in decreasing order of phonetic resemblance to the original lexical item (in the source language):&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guestword (in German: ''Gastwort''): unassimilated borrowing.
* Foreignism (in German: ''Fremdwort''): foreign word, e.g. phonetic adaptation.
* Loanword (in German: ''Lehnwort''): totally assimilated borrowing, e.g. morphemic adaptation.

====Phono-semantic matches, semanticized phonetic matches and phonetic matches====
The following are examples of simultaneous external and internal lexical expansion using [[Target language (translation)|target language]] lexical items as the basic material for the neologization but still resembling the sound of the lexical item in the source language:&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew'', by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phono-semantic matching]] (PSM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item both phonetically and semantically.
* Semanticized phonetic matching (SPM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically, and only in a loose way semantically.
* Phonetic matching (PM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically but not semantically.

===Role of morphology===
Another mechanism involves [[Generative grammar|generative]] devices that combine morphemes according to a language's rules. For example, the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] "-able" is usually only added to [[transitive verb]]s, as in "readable" but not "cryable".

===Compounding===
A compound word is a lexeme composed of several established lexemes, whose semantics is not the sum of that of their constituents. They can be interpreted through [[analogy]], [[Pragmatics|common sense and, most commonly, context]].&lt;ref name="Geert2005" /&gt; Compound words can have simple or complex morphological structures. Usually only the head requires inflection for agreement. Compounding may result in lexemes of unwieldy proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where hashtags compound to form longer-sized hashtags that are at times more popular than the individual constituent hashtags forming the compound.&lt;ref name="Maity2016"&gt;Suman Kalyan Maity, Ritvik Saraf and Animesh Mukherjee (2016). #Bieber + #Blast = #BieberBlast: Early Prediction of Popular Hashtag Compounds. In ''ACM CSCW'', San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding is the most common of word formation strategies cross-linguistically. 

== Diachronic mechanisms ==

Comparative historical linguistics studies the evolutions languages and takes a [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] view of the lexicon. The evolution of lexicons in different languages occurs through parallel mechanism. Over time historical forces work to  shape the lexicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutscher |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist) |title=The Unfolding of Language: An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention  |date=May 19, 2005 |publisher=Metropolitan Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it simpler to acquire and often creating an illusion of great regularity in language.
* [[Assimilation (linguistics)|Phonological assimilation]], the modification of loanwords to fit a new language's sound structure more effectively. If, however, a loanword sounds too "foreign", inflection or derivation rules may not be able to transform it.
* [[Analogy]], where new words undergo inflection and derivation analogous to that of words with a similar sound structure.
* [[Stress (linguistics)|Emphasis]], the modification of words' stress or accenting.
* [[Metaphor]], a form of semantic extension.

== Second-language lexicon ==
{{main|Bilingual lexical access}}

The term "lexicon" is generally used in the context of single language. Therefore, multi-lingual speakers are generally thought to have multiple lexicons. Speakers of language variants ([[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]], for example) may be considered to possess a single lexicon. Thus a ''[[wikt:cash dispenser|cash dispenser]]'' (British English) as well as an  [[wikt:automatic teller machine|automatic teller machine]] or [[wikt:ATM|ATM]] in American English would be understood by both American and British speakers, despite each group using different dialects.

When linguists study a lexicon, they consider such things as what constitutes a word; the word/[[concept]] relationship; [[lexical access]] and lexical access failure; how a word's [[phonology]], [[syntax]], and meaning intersect; the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]-word relationship; vocabulary structure within a given language; language use ([[pragmatics]]); [[language acquisition]]; the history and evolution of words ([[etymology]]); and the relationships between words, often studied within [[philosophy of language]].

Various models of how lexicons are organized and how words are retrieved have been proposed in [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2234">Radical Thinkers is a series of books released through [[Verso Books]]. The series was first released in October 2005. The series shifted towards themes in set 9 and began to release more frequently with fewer titles in each set. In 2010, ''Minima Moralia'', ''For Marx'', ''Aesthetics and Politics'', and ''Culture and Materialism'' were reprinted in hardback under the Radical Thinkers Classics designation as part of Verso's 40th anniversary celebration.

{{History of war}}

This article lists and summarises the [[war crime]]s committed since the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] and the [[crimes against humanity]] and [[crimes against peace]] that have been committed since these crimes were first defined in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]].{{efn|This list is a work in progress and is not complete.}}

Since many war crimes are not ultimately prosecuted (due to lack of political will, lack of effective procedures, or other practical and political reasons&lt;ref&gt;Comment by ''[[The Times]]'', November 21, 2006 p. 17, in relation to [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]: "There was nothing funny about his soldiers' actions in Eastern Congo... Among the crimes alleged are mass murder, rape and acts of cannibalism. Yet one senior UN diplomat has indicated privately that for the sake of peace, the investigation [by the [[International Criminal Court]]] into Bemba's responsibility may be sidelined. It isn't just in Congo that trade-offs are being made. [...] Skeptics point out that those who have stood trial so far have either been defeated in war or are retired and irrelevant. They insist there would be no chance of hauling powerful political figures in Washington and London before a court to answer for their actions..."&lt;/ref&gt;), historians and lawyers will often make a serious case that war crimes occurred, even if there was no formal investigations or prosecution of the alleged crimes or an investigation cleared the alleged perpetrators.

War crimes under [[international law]] were firmly established by international trials such as the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and the [[Tokyo Trials]], in which Austrian, German and Japanese leaders were prosecuted for war crimes committed during [[World War II]].

== 1914–1918: World War I ==
[[World War I]] was the first major international conflict to take place following the codification of war crimes at the [[Hague Convention of 1907]], including derived war crimes, such as the use of poisons as weapons, as well as crimes against humanity, and derivative crimes against humanity, such as torture, and genocide. Before, the [[Second Boer War]] took place after the [[Hague Convention of 1899]]. The Second Boer War (1899 until 1902) is known for the first concentration camps (1900 until 1902) for civilians in the 20th century.

==1939–1945: World War II==
{{TopicTOC-World War II}}
{{WWII timeline}}

===Axis powers===
The [[Axis Powers]] (particularly Germany and Japan) were some of the most systematic perpetrators of war crimes in modern history. Contributing factors included [[Nazi]] race theory, a desire for "living space" that justified the eradication of native populations, and militaristic indoctrination that encouraged the terrorization of conquered peoples and [[prisoners of war]]. The [[Holocaust]], the German attack on the Soviet Union and occupation of much of Europe, the Japanese occupation of [[Manchuria]] and the Philippines and attack on China all contributed to well over half of the civilian deaths in World War II and the conflicts that led up to the war. Even before post-war revelations of atrocities, both militaries were notorious for their brutal treatment of captured combatants.

====Crimes perpetrated by Germany====
{{Further|Nazi Germany|German war crimes#World War II|Consequences of Nazism}}
According to the [[International Military Tribunal|Nuremberg Trials]], there were four major war crimes that were alleged against German military (and Waffen-SS and NSDAP) men and officers, each with individual events that made up the major charges.

'''1. Participation in a common plan of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] for the accomplishment of [[crimes against peace]]'''

'''2. Planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace'''
* Planning and executing a campaign of invasion of its European neighbors, as well as the conspiracy to violate the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] through the [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]], and the annexations of [[Anschluss|Austria]] and [[Munich Crisis|Czechoslovakia]].

'''3. War Crimes'''
Atrocities against enemy combatants or conventional crimes committed by military units (see [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]), and include:
* [[Invasion of Poland]], in the period of 1 September – 25 October 1939 German forces during their military actions engaged in executions of Polish POWs, bombed hospitals, murdered civilians, shot refugees, executed wounded soldiers. The cautious estimates give a number of at least 16,000 murdered victims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/a_130804_wehrmacht_wyst.html |title=Otwarcie wystawy „»Z największą brutalnością...«.

* The suppression of the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]] and [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|subsequent leveling of the whole city]] [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-208, KZ Mauthausen, Sowjetische Kriegsgefangene.jpg|thumb|Naked [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet prisoners of war]] in Mauthausen concentration camp. Unknown date]]
* The treatment of Soviet POWs throughout the war, who were not given the protections and guarantees of the [[Geneva Convention]] unlike other Allied prisoners. [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs]], resulted in some 3.3 million to 3.5 million deaths, about 60% of all Soviet [[POW]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Streit: Keine Kameraden: Die Wehrmacht und die Sowjetischen Kriegsgefangenen, 1941–1945, Bonn: Dietz (3. Aufl., 1. Aufl. 1978), {{ISBN|3-8012-5016-4}} – "Between 22 June 1941 and the end of the war, roughly 5.7 million members of the Red Army fell into German hands. In January 1945, 930,000 were still in German camps. A million at most had been released, most of whom were so-called "volunteers" (Hilfswillige) for (often compulsory) auxiliary service in the Wehrmacht. Another 500,000, as estimated by the Army High Command, had either fled or been liberated. The remaining 3,300,000 (57.5 percent of the total) had perished."&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Heusden]]; town hall massacre (November 1944).
* [[German war crimes during the Battle of Moscow]]

'''4. Crimes against Humanity'''
Crimes committed well away from the lines of battle and unconnected in any way to military activity, distinct from war crimes
* The major crime was the [[Holocaust]], including:
** The construction and use of ''[[Extermination camp|Vernichtungslagern]]'' (extermination camps) to commit genocide, most prominently at [[Auschwitz]], [[Treblinka]], [[Majdanek]], [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibór]], and [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]]
*** The employment of other concentration camps across Europe, including [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], [[Mauthausen]] and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], which held Soviet POWs and political prisoners in inhuman conditions, and transported Jews and Roma to extermination camps
** [[Death marches (Holocaust)|Death marches]] of prisoners, particularly in the last months of the war when the aforementioned camps were being overrun by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]
** The widespread use of [[slavery|slave labor]] and forced/unfree labor by the Nazi regime, including the use of [[concentration camp]] and [[extermination camp]] prisoners as slaves, often with the intent of [[extermination through labor]] [[File:Einsatzgruppe shooting.jpg|thumb|German police shooting women and children from the [[Mizocz Ghetto]], 14 October 1942]]
** The establishment of Jewish [[Ghetto]]s in Eastern Europe intended to isolate Jewish communities for deportation and subsequent extermination
** The use of [[SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen]], mobile extermination squads, to exterminate Jews and anti-nazi "partisans"
*** [[Babi Yar]] a series of massacres in Kiev, the most notorious and the best documented of these massacres took place on 29–30 September 1941, wherein 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation. The decision to kill all the Jews in Kiev was made by the military governor, Major-General Kurt Eberhard, the Police Commander for Army Group South, SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Jeckeln, and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch. It was carried out by Sonderkommando 4a soldiers, along with the aid of the SD and SS Police Battalions backed by the local police.
*** [[Rumbula massacre|Rumbula]] a collective term for incidents on two non-consecutive days (November 30 and December 8, 1941) in which about 25,000 Jews were killed in or on the way to Rumbula forest near Riga, Latvia, during the Holocaust
*** [[Kaunas massacre of October 29, 1941|Ninth Fort]] By the order of SS-Standartenführer Karl Jäger and SS-Rottenführer [[Helmut Rauca]], the Sonderkommando under the leadership of SS-Obersturmführer Joachim Hamann, and 8 to 10 men from Einsatzkommando 3, in collaboration with Lithuanian partisans, murdered 2,007 Jewish men, 2,920 women, and 4,273 children in a single day at the Ninth Fort, Kaunas, Lithuania.
*** [[Simferopol]] Germans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol, killing in total over 22,000 locals—mostly [[Jews]], [[Russians]], [[Krymchaks]], and [[Romani people|Gypsies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simferopol.ws|title=Simferopol|accessdate=2008-05-13|work=simferopol.ws|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, starting December 9, 1941, the [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppen D]] under [[Otto Ohlendorf]]'s command killed an estimated 14,300 Simferopol residents, most of them being Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;
*** The massacre of 100,000 Jews and Poles at [[Ponary massacre|Paneriai]]
** The suppression of the 1943 [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] which erupted when the SS came to clear the Jewish ghetto and send all of the occupants to extermination camps
** [[Izieu|Izieu Massacre]] Izieu was the site of a Jewish orphanage during the Second World War. On 6 April 1944, three vehicles pulled up in front of the orphanage. The Gestapo, under the direction of the 'Butcher of Lyon' Klaus Barbie, entered the orphanage and forcibly removed the forty-four children and their seven supervisors, throwing the crying and terrified children on to the trucks. Following the raid on their home in Izieu, the children were shipped directly to the "collection center" in Drancy, then put on the first available train towards the concentration camps in the East.
Other crimes against humanity included:
* The [[Porajmos]], the mass killings of the [[Romani people|Romany]] peoples of Europe by the Nazis
* The [[Łapanka]] or "Catching Game", – Nazi roundups of Poles in the major cities for slave labor
* [[Nikolaev Massacre]], which resulted in the deaths of 35,782 Soviet citizens, most of whom were Jews.
* [[Operation Tannenberg]], the [[AB Action]] and the [[Massacre of Lwów professors]], all Nazi actions in Poland meant to mass murder the Polish intelligentsia and other potential leaders of resistance.
* Both "encouraging" and "compelling" abortion, prosecuted as a crime against the child in the womb. The crime consisted of three parts: (a) providing abortion services, (b) withdrawing the protection of German law from the unborn child, (c) refusing to enforce existing Polish law prohibiting abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Nuremberg and the Crime of Abortion, Jeffrey C. Toumala, Liberty University, 1-1-2011, 42 University of Toledo Law Review, Rev. 283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=lusol_fac_pubs&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Nazi [[T-4 Euthanasia Program]], an aborted eugenics program meant to kill German children who were mentally or physically handicapped. 200,000 people were murdered due to this program.

At least 10 million, and perhaps over 20 million perished directly and indirectly due to the commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes by the Nazi regime, of which the Holocaust lives on in particular infamy, for its particularly cruel nature and scope, and the industrialised nature of the genocide of Jewish citizens of states invaded or controlled by the Nazi regime. At least 5.9 million [[Jew]]s were murdered by the Nazis, or 66 to 78% of Europe's Jewish population, although a complete count may never be known. Though much of Continental Europe suffered under the Nazi occupation, Poland, in particular, was the state most devastated by these crimes, with 90% of its Jews as well as many ethnic Poles slaughtered by the Nazis and their Ukrainian affiliates. After the war, from 1945–49, the Nazi regime was put on trial in two [[Nuremberg Trials|tribunals]] in [[Nuremberg]], Germany by the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]].

The [[Nuremberg Trials|first tribunal]] [[indictment|indicted]] 24 major Nazi war criminals, and resulted in 19 [[conviction (law)|convictions]] (of which 12 led to [[death sentence]]s) and 3 [[acquittal]]s, 2 of the accused died before a verdict was rendered, at least one of which by killing himself with cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuremberg: Tyranny on Trial", The History Channel, 40:30, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJCPkmrYZw&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials|second tribunal]] indicted 185 members of the military, economic, and political leadership of Nazi Germany, of which 142 were convicted and 35 were acquitted. In subsequent decades, approximately 20 additional war criminals who escaped capture in the immediate aftermath of World War II were tried in [[West Germany]] and Israel. In Germany and many other European nations, the Nazi Party and denial of the Holocaust is outlawed.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Yamashita pleaded inability to act and lack of knowledge of the massacre, due to his commanding other operations in the area. The defense failed, establishing the [[Yamashita Standard]], which holds that a commander who makes no meaningful effort to uncover and stop atrocities is as culpable as if he had ordered them. His chief of staff [[Akira Mutō]] was condemned by the [[Tokyo tribunal]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

====Crimes perpetrated by the Chetniks====
[[Chetniks|Chetnik]] ideology revolved around the notion of a [[Greater Serbia]] within the borders of Yugoslavia, to be created out of all territories in which Serbs were found, even if the numbers were small. A directive dated 20 December 1941, addressed to newly appointed commanders in Montenegro, Major Đorđije Lašić and Captain Pavle Đurišić, outlined, among other things, the cleansing of all non-Serb elements in order to create a Greater Serbia:{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=170}}

{{quote|
# The struggle for the liberty of our whole nation under the scepter of His Majesty King Peter II;
# the creation of a Great Yugoslavia and within it of a [[Great Serbia]] which is to be ethnically pure and is to include Serbia, [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Srijem]], the [[Banat]], and [[Bačka]];
# the struggle for the inclusion into Yugoslavia of all still unliberated Slovene territories under the Italians and Germans ([[Trieste]], [[Gorizia]], [[Istria]], and [[Slovenian Carinthia|Carinthia]]) as well as Bulgaria, and northern [[Albania]] with [[Skadar]];
# the cleansing of the state territory of all national minorities and a-national elements;
# the creation of contiguous frontiers between Serbia and Montenegro, as well as between Serbia and [[Slovenia]] by cleansing the Muslim population from [[Sandžak]] and the Muslim and Croat populations from Bosnia and Herzegovina.|sign=Directive of 20 December 1941{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=170}}}}
[[File:Chetniks in Šumadija kill a Partisan through heart extraction.jpg|thumb|Chetniks in [[Šumadija]] kill a Partisan through heart extraction]]
The Chetniks systemically massacred Muslims in villages that they captured.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=143}} In late autumn of 1941 the Italians handed over the towns of Višegrad, Goražde, Foča and the surrounding areas, in south-east Bosnia to the Chetniks to run as a puppet administration and NDH forces were compelled by the Italians to withdraw from there. After the Chetniks gained control of [[Goražde]] on 29 November 1941, they began a massacre of Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials that became a systematic massacre of the local Muslim civilian population.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=145}}

Several hundred Muslims were murdered and their bodies were left hanging in the town or thrown into the Drina river.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=145}} On 5 December 1941, the Chetniks received the town of [[Foča]] from the Italians and proceeded to massacre around 500 Muslims.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=145}} Additional massacres against the Muslims in the area of Foča took place in August 1942. In total, more than 2000 people were killed in Foča.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256–61}}

In early January, Chetniks entered [[Srebrenica]] and killed around 1000 Muslim civilians there and in nearby villages. Around the same time the Chetniks made their way to [[Višegrad]] where deaths were reportedly in the thousands.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=146-47}} Massacres continued in the following months in the region.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=146}} In the village of [[Žepa]] alone about three hundred were killed in late 1941.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=146}} In early January, Chetniks massacred fifty-four Muslims in [[Čelebić]] and burned down the village. On 3 March, Chetniks burned forty-two Muslim villagers to death in Drakan.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=146-47}}

In early January 1943 and again in early February, Montenegrin Chetnik units were ordered to carry out "cleansing actions" against Muslims, first in the [[Bijelo Polje]] county in Sandžak and then in February in the [[Čajniče]] county and part of Foča county in southeastern Bosnia, and in part of the [[Pljevlja]] county in Sandžak.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}}

[[Pavle Đurišić]], the officer in charge of these operations, reported to Mihailović, Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command, that on 10 January 1943: "thirty-three Muslim villages had been burned down, and 400 Muslim fighters (members of the Muslim self-protection militia supported by the Italians) and about 1,000 women and children had been killed, as against 14 Chetnik dead and 26 wounded".{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}}

In another report sent by Đurišić dated 13 February 1943, he reported that: "Chetniks killed about 1,200 Muslim fighters and about 8,000 old people, women, and children; Chetnik losses in the action were 22 killed and 32 wounded".{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}} He added that "during the operation the total destruction of the Muslim inhabitants was carried out regardless of sex and age".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=331}} The total number of deaths caused by the anti-Muslim operations between January and February 1943 is estimated at 10,000.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}} The casualty rate would have been higher had a great number of Muslims not already fled the area, most to [[Sarajevo]], when the February action began.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}} According to a statement from the Chetnik Supreme Command from 24 February 1943, these were countermeasures taken against Muslim aggressive activities; however, all circumstances show that these massacres were committed in accordance with implementing the directive of 20 December 1941.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256–61}}

Actions against the Croats were of a smaller scale but comparable in action.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=259}} In early October 1942 in the village of [[Gata, Croatia|Gata]], where an estimated 100 people were killed and many homes burnt in reprisal taken for the destruction of roads in the area carried out on the Italians' account.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256–61}} That same month, formations under the command of Petar Baćović and Dobroslav Jevđević, who were participating in the Italian [[Operation Alfa]] in the area of [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]], massacred over 500 Croats and Muslims and burnt numerous villages.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256–61}} Baćović noted that "Our Chetniks killed all men 15 years of age or older.&amp;nbsp;... Seventeen villages were burned to the ground."{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=146}} [[Mario Roatta]], commander of the [[Second Army (Italy)|Italian Second Army]], objected to these "massive slaughters" of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=146}}

====Crimes perpetrated by the Ustashas====
Numerous concentration camps were built in [[Independent State of Croatia]], most notably [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], the largest, where around 100,000 [[Serbs]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]] (Roma), [[Jews]], as well as a number of Croatian political dissidents, died, mostly from torture and starvation. It was established by the [[Ustaša]] regime of the Independent State of Croatia in August 1941 and not dismantled until April 1945, shortly before the end of the war. Other concentration camps were in [[Gospić]], [[Rab concentration camp|Rab]], [[Đakovo]], [[Jastrebarsko]], and [[Lepoglava]].

According to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] (citing the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]''), "Ustasa terrorists killed 500,000 Serbs, expelled 250,000 and forced 250,000 to convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon Wiesenthal Center Multimedia Learning Center|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/pages/t081/t08100.html|accessdate=8 November 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021108152138/http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/pages/t081/t08100.html|archivedate=8 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasenovac was a complex of five subcamps and three smaller camps spread out over {{convert|240|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, in relatively close proximity to each other, on the bank of the Sava river. Most of the camp was at [[Jasenovac, Sisak-Moslavina County|Jasenovac]], about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Zagreb]]. The complex also included large grounds at Donja Gradina directly across the [[Sava|Sava River]], a camp for children at [[Jastrebarsko]] to the northwest, and a women's camp in [[Stara Gradiška]] to the southeast.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

An escape attempt on 22 April 1945 by 600 male inmates failed and only 84 male prisoners escaped successfully. The remainder and about 400 other prisoners were then murdered by Ustasa guards, despite the fact that they knew the war was ending with Germany's capitulation. All the female inmates from the women's camp (more than 700) had been massacred by the guards the previous day. The guards then destroyed the camp and everything associated with it was burned to the ground.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[Ante Pavelić]], leader of the Ustasha, fled to Argentina and Spain which gave him protection, and was never extradited to stand trial for his war crimes. Pavelić died on 28 December 1959 at the Hospital Alemán in [[Madrid]], where the Roman Catholic church had helped him to gain asylum, at the age of 70 from gunshot wounds sustained in an earlier assassination attempt by Montenegrin [[Blagoje Jovović]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

====Crimes perpetrated by the Ukrainians====
The Ukrainian [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN-B]] group, along with their military force – [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]](UPA) – are responsible for a [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|genocide on the Polish population in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia]]. Starting in March 1943, with its peak in the summer 1943, as many as 130,000 people (according to [[Ewa Siemaszko]]) were murdered, mostly women, children and elderly. Although the main target were [[Poles]], many [[Jews]], [[Czechs]] and those [[Ukrainians]] unwilling to participate in the crimes, were massacred as well. Lacking good armament and ammunition, UPA members commonly used tools such as axes and pitchforks for the slaughter. As a result of these massacres, almost the entire non-Ukrainian population of Volhynia was either killed or forced to flee.

UPA commanders responsible for the genocide:
* [[Roman Shukhevych]] - general of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. As a leader of the UPA he was to be aware and to approve the project of ethnic cleansing in [[Volhynia]] and Eastern Galicia.
* [[Dmytro Klyachkivsky]] - colonel of the UPA. He gave the order "to wipe out an entire polish male population between 16 and 60 years old". Klyachkivsky is regarded as the main initiator of the massacres.
* [[Mykola Lebed]] - one of the OUN leaders, and UPA fighter. By the National Archives, he is described as "Ukrainian fascist leader and suspected [[Nazism|Nazi]] collaborator"
* [[Stepan Bandera]] - leader of the OUN-B. His view was to remove all Poles, who were hostile towards the OUN, and assimilate the rest of them. The role of the main architect of the massacres is often assigned to him. However, he was imprisoned in German concentration camp since 1941, so there is a strong suspicion, that he wasn't fully aware of events in Volhynia.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

On two occasions, once off the coast of [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], and the other off the coast of [[Crete]], the crew attacked and killed dozens of shipwrecked German sailors and troops.

* [[Rudolph Rummel]] estimated that the North Korean Army executed at least 500,000 civilians during the Korean War with many dying in North Korea's drive to conscript South Koreans to their war effort. Throughout the conflict, North Korean and Chinese forces routinely mistreated U.S. and UN prisoners of war. Mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run [[POW camps]] during the winter of 1950–51. About 43 percent of all U.S. POWs died during this period. In violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]] which explicitly stated that captor states must [[repatriate]] prisoners of war to their homeland as quickly as possible, North Korea detained South Korean POWs for decades after the ceasefire. Over 88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing and the Communists' themselves had claimed they had captured 70,000 South Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP10.HTM |title = STATISTICS OF DEMOCIDE Chapter 10 |publisher= |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heo2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heo |first=Man-ho |title=North Korea's Continued Detention of South Korean POWs since the Korean and Vietnam Wars |journal=The Korean Journal of Defense Analysis |year=2002 |volume=14 |issue=2 |url=http://www.kida.re.kr/data/2006/04/14/08-heo.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108084151/http://www.kida.re.kr/data/2006/04/14/08-heo.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}

== 1952–1960: Mau Mau uprising ==
{{Main|Mau Mau uprising#War_crimes}}
* In attempt to suppress the insurgency in [[Kenya]], British colonial authorities suspended [[civil liberties]] within the country. In response to the rebellion, many Kikuyu were relocated. 320,000–450,000 of them were moved into [[concentration camps]]. Most of the remainder – more than a million – were held in "enclosed villages". Although some were Mau Mau guerillas, many were victims of [[collective punishment]] that colonial authorities imposed on large areas of the country. Thousands suffered beatings and [[sexual assaults]] during "screenings" intended to extract information about the Mau Mau threat. Later, prisoners suffered even worse mistreatment in an attempt to force them to renounce their allegiance to the insurgency and to obey commands. Significant numbers were murdered; official accounts describe some prisoners being roasted alive. Prisoners were questioned with the help of "slicing off ears, boring holes in eardrums, flogging until death, pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight, and burning eardrums with lit cigarettes". British soldiers used a "metal [[castrating]] instrument" to cut off testicles and fingers. "By the time I cut his balls off", one settler boasted, "he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him." According to David Anderson,{{who|date=August 2017}} the British hanged over 1,090 suspected rebels: far more than the French had executed in [[Algeria]] during the [[Algerian War]]. It was found out that over half of them executed were not rebels at all. Thousands more were [[summarily executed|killed]] by British soldiers, who claimed they had "failed to halt" when challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WEB OF DECEIT: BRITAIN'S REAL FOREIGN POLICY: BRITAIN'S REAL ROLE IN THE WORLD|pages=324–30|publisher=VINTAGE|author=Mark Curtis|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britain's gulag: the brutal end of empire in Kenya|pages=124–45|publisher=Pimlico|author=Caroline Elkins|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire|pages=150–54|publisher=W.W.

* The [[Chuka Massacre]], which happened in [[Chuka, Kenya]], was perpetrated by members of the [[King's African Rifles]] B Company in June 1953 with 20 unarmed people killed during the Mau Mau uprising. Members of the 5th KAR B Company entered the Chuka area on June 13, 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. It is found out that most of the people executed were actually belonged to the [[Kikuyu Home Guard]] – a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight an increasingly powerful and audacious guerrilla enemy. In an atmosphere of atrocity and reprisal, the matter was swept under the carpet and nobody ever stood trial for the massacre.
* The [[Hola massacre]] was an incident during the conflict in [[Kenya]] against [[British colonial rule]] at a colonial detention camp in [[Hola, Kenya]]. By January 1959 the camp had a population of 506 detainees of whom 127 were held in a secluded "closed camp". This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial "rehabilitation process" or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action – as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.&lt;ref&gt;Maloba, Wunyabari O. Mau Mau and Kenya: An Analysis of a Peasant Revolt.(Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN: 1993) pp. 142–43.&lt;/ref&gt; 77 surviving detainees sustained serious permanent injuries.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The British government accepts that the colonial administration tortured detainees, but denies liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20543140|title=Mau Mau massacre documents revealed|work=BBC News|date=30 November 2012|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Lari massacre in the settlement of [[Lari Constituency|Lari]] occurred on the night of 25–26 March 1953, in which Mau Mau militants herded Kikuyu men, women and children into huts and set fire to them, killing anyone who attempted to escape. Official estimates place the death toll from the Lari massacre at 74 dead.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, David (2005). Histories of the Hanged. W.W.

The insurgency began in 1945 and was [[Algerian War|revived in 1954]], winning independence in the early 1960s. The French army killed thousands of Algerians in the first round of fighting in 1945.&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt; After the Algerian independence movement formed a National Liberation Front (FLN) in 1954, the French Minister of the Interior joined the Minister of National Defense in 1955 in ordering that every rebel carrying a weapon, suspected of doing so, or suspected of fleeing, must be shot.&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt; French troops executed civilians from nearby villages when rebel attacks occurred, tortured both rebels and civilians, and interned Arabs in camps, where forced labor was required of some of them.&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt; 2,000,000 Algerians were displaced or forcibly resettled during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Windrow|pages=13|title=The Algerian War 1954–62|ISBN=1 85532 658 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; French sources estimated that 70,000 Muslim civilians were killed, or abducted and presumed killed, by the FLN during the war.

In answer to a Marine sentry's shouted question, he responded that he was going after a VC. Two Marines were dispatched to retrieve McGhee and as they approached the village they heard a shot and a woman's scream and then saw McGhee walking toward them from the village. McGhee said he had just killed a VC and other VC were following him. At trial Vietnamese prosecution witnesses testified that McGhee had kicked through the wall of the hut where their family slept. He seized a 14-year-old girl and pulled her toward the door. When her father interceded, McGhee shot and killed him. Once outside the house the girl escaped McGhee with the help of her grandmother. McGhee was found guilty of unpremeditated murder and sentenced him to confinement at hard labor for ten years.

Potter, Jr. took effective command of the patrol. They entered the hamlet of Xuan Ngoc (2) and seized Dao Quang Thinh, whom they accused of being a Viet Cong, and dragged him from his hut. While they beat him, other patrol members forced his wife, Bui Thi Huong, from their hut and four of them raped her. A few minutes later three other patrol members shot Dao Quang Thinh, Bui, their child, Bui's sister-in-law, and her sister in- law's child. Bui Thi Huong survived to testify at the courts-martial. The company commander suspicious of the reported "enemy contact" sent Second Lieutenant Stephen J. Talty, to return to the scene with the patrol. Once there, Talty realized what had happened and attempted to cover up the incident. A wounded child was discovered alive and Potter bludgeoned it to death with his rifle. Potter was convicted of premeditated murder and rape, and sentenced to confinement at hard labor for life, but was released in February 1978, having served 12 years and 1 month. Hospitalman John R. Bretag testified against Potter and was sentenced to 6 month's confinement for rape. PFC James H. Boyd, Jr., pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 4 years confinement at hard labor. Sergeant Ronald L. Vogel was convicted for murder of one of the children and rape and was sentenced to 50 years confinement at hard labor, which was reduced on appeal to 10 years of which he served 9 years.Two patrol members were acquitted of major charges, but were convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and sentenced to 6 months' confinement.

The boys said they had been forced to walk for days knowing they would be killed if they showed any weakness, and in some cases forced even to murder their family members... every night up to 10,000 children walk into the centre of [[Kitgum]]... because they are not safe in their own beds... more than 25,000 children have been kidnapped ...this year an average of 20 children have been abducted every week.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

: ''"[[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]], the former [[Liberia]]n President who is one of Africas most wanted men, has gone into hiding in [[Nigeria]] to avoid [[extradition]] to a UN war crimes tribunal... The UN war crimes tribunal in [[Sierra Leone]] holds Mr Taylor responsible for about 250,000 deaths. Throughout the 1990s, his armies and supporters, made up of child soldiers orphaned by the conflict wreaked havoc through a swath of West Africa. In Sierra Leone he supported the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (R.U.F) whose rebel fighters were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians.''
* Current action – Indicted on 17 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the UN, which has issued an international warrant for his arrest. As of April 2006 located, extradited, and facing trial in [[Sierra Leone]] but then transferred to the Netherlands as requested by the [[Liberia]]n government. As of the status of the main state actor in the war crimes in Liberia, Sierra Leone and the ongoing war crimes tribunal in the Hague for violating the UN sanctions, Libya's Muamar Gaddafi was elected to the post of President of the African Union. As of late January, 2011, Exxon/Mobile has resumed explorationary drilling in Libya after the exchange of the Lockerbie bombing terrorist was returned to Libya and Libya was taken off terrorist list by the Bush administration with the legal stipulation that Libya could never be prosecuted for past war crimes(regardless of guilt)in the future.

== 1991–2000/2002: Algerian Civil War ==
{{Main|List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War}}

During the [[Algerian Civil War]] of the 1990s, a variety of [[massacre]]s occurred through the country, many being identified as war crimes. The [[Armed Islamic Group|Armed Islamic Group (GIA)]] has avowed its responsibility for many of them, while for others no group has claimed responsibility.  In addition to generating a widespread sense of fear, these massacres and the ensuing flight of population have resulted in serious depopulation of the worst-affected areas.  The massacres peaked in 1997 (with a smaller peak in 1994), and were particularly concentrated in the areas between [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]], with very few occurring in the east or in the [[Sahara]].

* Fighting involves [[Mai-Mai]] militia and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] government soldiers. The Government originally armed the Mai-Mai as civil defence against external invaders, who then turned to banditry.
* 100,000 refugees living in remote disease ridden areas to avoid both sides
* Estimated 1000 deaths a day according to [[Oxfam]]:
: ''"The army attacks the local population as it passes through, often raping and pillaging like the militias. Those who resist are branded Mai-mai supporters and face detention or death.

In September 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to [[starvation]]. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticised, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence.&lt;ref name="How many have died"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4268733.stm How many have died in Darfur?] By Russell Smith (BBC) 16 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent British Parliamentary Report has estimated that over 300,000 people have died,&lt;ref name="death toll may be 300,000"&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30582172.htm Darfur death toll may be 300,000, say UK lawmakers] (Reuters), 30 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and others have estimated even more.

'''Manson Sherrill (Manse) Jolly''' (died 1869) was the fifth son of Joseph Moorhead Jolly and Anna Cole Sherrill. He had six brothers and four sisters, one of whom died in infancy. Jolly was known for his brutal revenge against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers stationed in [[Anderson, South Carolina]] after the close of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Jolly's furlough papers describe him at twenty years of age as "six feet four inches high, ruddy complexion, blue eyes, red hair, and by profession a farmer, born in Anderson district in the state of S.C." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andersonuniversity.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=8895312 Manse Jolly furlough paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of Jolly's brothers were killed during the war, and the sixth committed suicide, possibly from the effects of the war. Upon returning home to find his town taken over by the men he had been fighting, Jolly swore an oath to kill five "Yankee" soldiers for every brother he lost during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandersweb.net/ed/Manse-Ride/ManseMyth-Ride.html|title=Manse Jolly Myth - The Big Ride|work=sandersweb.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolly more than made good on his oath. He reportedly hid out in the forests surrounding Anderson, and preyed upon the Union soldiers stationed nearby. Jolly used [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, which he would have been familiar with from his experience as a [[Reconnaissance|scout]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandersweb.net/ed/MSJ1932article.htm|title=Manse Jolly Articles - The State Newspaper - 1932|work=sandersweb.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became too dangerous for him to stay in Anderson, Jolly fled to [[Cameron, Texas]] to his Sherrill relatives in 1867 where he died by drowning two years later while attempting to cross a swollen stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandersweb.net/ed/Manse-Article/ManseFactsAndFiction.htm|title=The Manse Jolly Story, fact and fiction|work=sandersweb.net |first=Ed |last=Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandersweb.net/ed/Manse-death/Manse-Death.html|title=Manse Jolly's Death|work=sandersweb.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andersonuniversity.libguides.com/c.php?g=220922&amp;p=1466190|title=Special Collections: Manse Jolly Collection|work=Thrift Library Research Guides |publisher=[[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proactive law''' seeks a new approach to legal issues in businesses and societies. Instead of perceiving law as a constraint that companies and people in general need to comply with, '''proactive law''' considers law as an instrument that can create success and foster sustainable relationships, which in the end carries the potential to increase value for companies, individuals, and societies in general.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[proactive]] is the opposite of reactive, meaning that the approach to law is based on an [[ex ante]] view rather than an [[ex post]] view. According to the dictionary of [[Merriam-Webster]], the word proactive refers to ''acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the proactive law approach challenges the traditional backwards and failure oriented approach to law by acting in [[67th World Science Fiction Convention|anticipation]] of legal [[disputes]], taking control of potential problems, providing solutions, and self-initiation, instead of reacting to failures and shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotbed of the proactive law movement is the Nordic countries and Finland in particular. The movement took off in the late 1990s and is almost similar to the American movement – Law as a Competitive Source. Both of these parallel evolutions are founded on the work of [[Louis M. Brown]], developed in the 1950s known as the [[preventive]] approach to law.

== From Preventive Law to Proactive Law ==
The proactive law movement has become more visible in recent years, but the idea of an [[ex ante]] view is not new. It is generally known that the earlier a dispute or a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chances of a fair, just and prompt solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Louis M. Brown]] was the first to introduce the [[ex ant]]e view in his ground-laying book “Preventive Law”.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he identified and organized the preventive law into a distinctive way of thinking, he was not the inventor of this approach. It has been, and still is, well known to many legal professionals and every business manager that:

“It usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out of trouble.”&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the general principles of proactive law requires understanding the core principles of [[preventive law]], as these principles create the foundation for proactive law and [[proactive contracting]]. [[Edward Dauer]] identifies four core principles of preventive law:&lt;ref&gt;Dauer E. A., Four Principles for a Theory of Preventive Law, p. 13-35&lt;/ref&gt;

* Predicting human behavior to anticipate and account for what people will do, and by doing so, prevents litigation. This improves personal and business relationships, and constitutes an essential part of the preventive law.
* Conflict management—preventive law draws parallels from the medical world, e.g., successful medical treatment is prophylactic.
* Embracement of risks: Instead of focusing solely on reducing one or a few risks to zero, the preventive law approach strives to reduce the overall sum of risk.
* Preventive legal service: Lawyers and in-house counsels must participate with others in multi-disciplinary teams in the planning of business ventures. Bringing legal expertise in earlier helps detect and prevent legal problems.

The proactive law movement encompasses the basic principles of preventive law stated above, namely preventing what is not desirable, and keeping problems and risks from materializing.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, as proactive law consists of preventive law, the characteristics above constitute the foundation of proactive law.

=== The Promotive Dimension ===
To this preventive dimension of law, proactive law adds a second aspect, which is often neglected in traditional law – known as the ''[[promotive]] dimension''.

The nature of the promotive dimension is positive and constructive and promotes what is desirable while encouraging good behavior. This is where we find the distinction to preventive law. 
In a legal context, proactive law emphasizes the importance of collaboration between legal professionals and other disciplines to achieve the desired goals in circumstances where legal expertise collaborates with other disciplines. Proactive law therefore emphasizes the need for dialogue between different understandings. In a medical context, the preventive law prevents ill health, while proactive law promotes well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proactive law approach is based on legal certainty, [[literacy]], and cross-professional collaboration to “localize the mines and preventing them from exploding.”&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to navigating past the mines, the legal professionals should create economic value, and thus must be outcome-orientated to exploit the promotive dimension. Lawyers and [[in-house counsel]] thus must act to achieve results by watching for changes or opportunities and setting improved goals. To do so, legal professionals must highlight opportunities to build a solid business foundation, roadmaps for performance, trust, and better sustainable relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides achieving these business goals, it is important to focus on legal [[risk management]] to prevent disputes. Many legal disputes arise due to misunderstandings and disappointed expectations. However, careful attention to legal clarity along with early warning mechanisms, and enhanced collaboration between business partners, through establishment of common goals, avoids the business from getting to the stage of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential in proactive law that legal professionals, managers, and other involved stakeholders collaborate on a cross-professional basis to avoid disputes. In addition to avoiding disputes, it is also important to promote creative thinking. To develop new ideas, and concepts that correspond to the needs, problems or challenges, it is necessary to look towards the future rather than the past, maybe by using already known approaches, but also non-existing approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; This invites businesses, authorities and researchers to develop solutions through creative thinking.

Thus, proactive law is about problem-solving, detecting real-life causes for potential misunderstandings and failures, but most of all it is about fostering and promoting fruitful and sustainable relationships that enables the stakeholders to reach their goals, creating value for business, individuals, and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proactive Law in Legislation ==

An indication that Proactive Law is gaining prominence is the fact that the [[European Commission]] has published an [[opinion]] on Proactive Law.

The EESC urges a [[paradigm]] shift, as the time has come to give up the centuries-old reactive approach to law and to adopt a pro active approach. It is time to look at law in a different way: to look forward rather than back, to focus on how the law is used and oper ates in everyday life and how it is received in the community it seeks to regulate. While responding to and resolving problems remain important, preventing causes of problems is vital, along with serving the needs and facilitating the productive interaction of citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

By its very nature, the Community legal system is precisely the type of area in which the proactive approach should be adopted when planning, drawing up and implementing laws; against this backdrop, the EESC would argue that rules and regu lations are not the only way nor always the best way to achieve the desired objectives; at times, the regulator may best support valuable goals by refraining from regulating and, where appropri ate, encouraging self-regulation and co-regulation. This being the case, the fundamental principles of [[subsidiarity]], [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], [[precaution]] and [[sustainability]] take on new importance and a new dimension.

The EESC believes that the single market can benefit greatly when EU law and its makers — [[legislators]] and administrators in the broadest sense — shift their focus from inward, from inside the legal system, rules and institutions, to outward, to the users of the law: to society, citizens and businesses that the legal system is intended to serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

While the transposition and implementation of laws are important steps towards better regulation at EU level, regulatory success should be measured by how the goals are achieved at the level of the users of the law, EU citizens and businesses. The laws should be communicated in ways that are meaningful to their intended audience, first and foremost to those whose behaviour is affected and not just to the relevant institutions and administrators.

The application of the Proactive Law approach should be considered systematically in all lawmaking and implementation within the EU. The EESC strongly believes that by making this approach not only part of the Better Regulation agenda, and but also a priority for legislators and administrators at the EU, national and regional levels, it would be possible to build a strong legal foundation for individuals and businesses to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive Law in a Business Context==

While Proactive Law in general has gained increased attention at the highest legislatory authorities, businesses seem to be the first movers in this developing research field.

When Proactive Law is adapted to businesses the approach is called [[Proactive Contracting]] and Proactive [[Contract Management]]. The idea is that [[Proactive Contracting]] may constitute a sustainable [[competitive advantage]], when implemented thoroughly.

In recent years law has gained increased prominence as a source of competitive advantage to businesses. This prominence originated with the work of scholars and professionals in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the US, research of Robert Bird has contributed to the movement of Law as a [[Competitive Advantage]]. 
Robert Bird uses a strategy framework to analyze the attributes of law necessary to obtain a competitive advantage. In Europe, the proactive law movement constitutes the same. 
As contracts and contract law are major components of successful [[R&amp;D]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[operations management]], [[outsourcing]] etc., it is important that the contracts and contracting processes involved are successful. 
In the words of [[Tim Cummins]], [[CEO]] of the IACCM, “contracts lie at the heart of most business relationships, certainly within Western [[cultures]] and [[economies]], and increasingly among all companies or entities that seek to operate in an international market”.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, T. (2006): Best Practices In Commercial Contracting, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

As international trading grows in value and quantity, it is important for businesses to excel in contracting. Businesses that can manage contracting successfully have a competitive advantage [[ceteris paribus]].

By incorporating both a [[preventive]] and a [[promotive]] focus, the proactive law movement encourages both legal goals, which are often preventive—and business goals, which tend to be promotive.&lt;ref&gt;Siedel, G. J. &amp; Haapio, H.: Using Proactive Law for Competitive Advantages, (2010) p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

By combining these two approaches to reaching goals, businesses take advantage of both the preventive focus and the promotive focus.
[[Tory Higgins]] has developed a [[psychological]] theory called the [[Regulatory Focus Theory]] that focuses on motivations and how people tend to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. T.: Promotion and Prevention: Regulatory Focus as a Motivational Principle. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two different orientations towards goal achievement, which have been recognized by [[Tory Higgins]], are:

(1) a preventive focus that emphasizes [[safety]], [[Legal liability|responsibility]] and [[security]], and

(2) a promotive focus that emphasizes [[hopes]], [[accomplishments]], and [[advancements]].

Thus, the way of businesses to pursuing a goal depends on whether their approach is [[preventive]] or [[promotive]]. According to Mayer and [[Weber]], people with a preventive focus view goals as minimal targets that produce a low-intensity response when the goal is achieved.  On the other hand, people with a promotive approach see goals as maximal targets. Thus, “achievement of the goal results in feelings of high-intensity happiness instead of low-intensity calm”.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, K. J. &amp; Weber, L.: Unpacking Contract Capabilities: Shaping Behavior by Implementing Appropriate Contract Framing, (2009) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

If businesses succeed in incorporating both the preventive and promotive approach in reaching their goals, they may able to utilize the advantages of both legal and business goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054654/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin question '''''Quem quaeritis?''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''"Whom do you seek?"'') refers to four lines of the medieval [[Easter]] liturgy that later formed the kernel of the large body of medieval [[liturgical drama]], which is also known as '''Visitatio sepulchri''' ("Visit to the tomb"). It was introduced into the liturgy in the tenth century, as a new genre of liturgical ceremony:&lt;ref&gt;Nils Holger Petersen, "Les textes polyvalents du Quem quaeritis à Winchester au xe siècle", ''Revue de musicologie'', '''86'''.1 (2000:105-118), with extensive bibliography in notes.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
:''Interrogatio. Quem quaeritis in sepulchro, o Christicolae?
:''Responsio. Jesum Nazarenum crucifixum, o caelicolae.
:''Angeli. Non est hic; surrexit, sicut praedixerat. Ite, nuntiate quia surrexit de sepulchro
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Translation:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
:''Question [by the Angels]: Whom do ye seek in the sepulchre, O followers of Christ?
:''Answer [by the Marys]: Jesus of Nazareth, the Crucified, O heavenly ones.
:''The Angels: He is not here; he is risen, just as he foretold. Go, announce that he is risen from the sepulchre.''  
:::&amp;mdash;John Gassner, editor, ''Medieval and Tudor Drama''
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The lines were then followed by a sung chorus of [[Hallelujah]]s.

The ''Quem Quaeritis?'' was an exchange of one question, one answer, and one command between the [[Angel]]s at [[Jesus|Christ's]] tomb and [[the three Marys]], the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and [[Mary, sister of Lazarus|Mary, the sister of Lazarus]]. The specific question "Quem quaeritis?" "Whom do you seek?" is not in fact in Luke 24, where it is implied but omitted: "Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen". The actual question is directly expressed only in the [[Non-canonical gospels|non-canonical]] [[Gospel of Peter]]: 
:"And they went and found the tomb opened, and coming near they looked in there; and they see there a certain young man sitting in the midst of the tomb, beautiful and clothed in a robe exceeding bright: who said to them, Wherefore are ye come? Whom seek ye? Him that was crucified? He is risen and gone. But if ye believe not, look in and see the place where he lay, that he is not [here]; for he is risen and gone thither, whence he was sent. Then the women feared and fled."

In the [[canonical gospels]] it is Mary Magdalene, [[Joanna (disciple)|Joanna]], Mary (the mother of James), and "other women" who were present at this event.

Although short, this excerpt of text would later snowball into a huge body of religious medieval plays, and evolve into various genres, such as [[liturgical drama]] and [[mystery play]]s.  The plays that can trace their genealogy to the ''Quem Quaeritis?'' lasted for about 650 years, until the end of the [[Protestant Reformation]].

'''Ravenspurn''' was a town in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England, which was lost due to [[coastal erosion]], one of more than 30 along the [[Holderness]] Coast which have been lost to the [[North Sea]] since the 19th century. The town was located close to the end of a peninsula near [[Ravenser Odd]], which has also been flooded.  The peninsula still survives and is known as [[Spurn|Spurn Head]].  The North Sea lies to the east of the peninsula, the river [[Humber]] to the west.

The nearest major city was [[Kingston upon Hull]].

The region of coastline is known as the Holderness Coast; geologically the land is formed of [[Till|glacial till]]s ([[boulder clay]]), which are subject to coastal erosion. Now at sea, areas around the site are being drilled for [[natural gas]].

Ravenspurn appears in [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', under the spelling "Ravenspurgh".

Two medieval English kings landed at Ravenspurn: [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in 1399, on his way to dethrone [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], and [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] in 1471, on his way back from exile in the [[Netherlands]], where he was resisted by the local lord, Sir Martin de la See.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spurnhead.co.uk/ravenspurn.html | title=Spurn Head - East Riding of Yorkshire | publisher=spurnhead.co.uk | accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11477">The '''Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England''' ('''RCHME''') was a government advisory body responsible for documenting buildings and monuments of archaeological, architectural and historical importance in England. It was established in 1908 (shortly after the parallel commissions for [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|Wales]]); and was merged with [[English Heritage]] in 1999.

==History==
The Royal Commission was established in 1908, twenty-six years after the passage of the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]], which provided the first state protection for ancient monuments in the United Kingdom, and eight years after the passage of the wider-ranging [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]]. Critics, including David Murray in his ''Archaeological Survey of the United Kingdom'' (1896) and [[Gerard Baldwin Brown]] in his ''Care of Ancient Monuments'' (1905), had argued that, for the legislation to be effective, a detailed list of significant monuments needed to be compiled, and had made unfavourable comparisons between the policies of Britain and its European neighbours. [[Learned society|Learned societies]] including the [[British Archaeological Association]], the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and the [[Royal Society of Arts]] also lobbied for action to be taken. Brown had explicitly proposed that the issues should be addressed by a [[Royal Commission]], comparable to the [[Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts]]. His suggestion bore fruit, and led to the establishment in turn of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]] on 14 February 1908; the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] in August 1908; and, finally, by [[Royal sign-manual|Royal Warrant]] dated 27 October 1908, the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England).&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, pp. 57–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of its warrant, the Commission's remit was "to make an inventory of the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions connected with or illustrative of the contemporary culture, civilization and conditions of life of the people of England, excluding [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], from the earliest times to the year 1700, and to specify those which seem most worthy of preservation".&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; A revised warrant of 29 November 1913 extended the terminal date to 1714 (the accession of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A new warrant of 29 March 1946 gave the Commissioners discretion to undertake recording beyond 1714, and an informal terminal date of 1850 was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Commissioners comprised [[Herbert Gardner, 1st Baron Burghclere|Lord Burghclere]] (chairman); Sir [[Henry Howarth]] (nominated by the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]]); [[David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford|Lord Balcarres]] (nominated by the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]]); [[J.G.N. Clift]] (nominated by the British Archaeological Association); [[Leonard Stokes]] (nominated by the Royal Institute of British Architects); [[Francis J. Haverfield|Francis Haverfield]]; [[James Fitzgerald (archaeologist)|James Fitzgerald]]; [[Harold Dillon, 17th Viscount Dillon|Viscount Dillon]]; the [[Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Earl of Plymouth]]; [[Emslie Horniman|E.J. Horniman]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]]; and Sir [[John F.F. Horner]].&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Royal Warrants, revising the Commission's terms of reference, were granted in 1963 and on 15 April 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, pp. 74, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was merged with [[English Heritage]] on 1 April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/Conservation_Bulletin_35.pdf ''Conservation Bulletin'', Issue 35, April 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Commission determined from the outset to publish its inventories of monuments, and to compile them on a [[Historic counties of England|county]]-by-county basis.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The first county selected for survey was [[Hertfordshire]]: the resultant volume was published in 1910. Some 40 inventory volumes were published over the next 70 years, before the project was wound down, in favour of more thematic publications, in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the Commission's warrant, the inventories were initially limited to identifying constructions up to 1714, but were later extended to 1850.

Several inventories were not geographically complete at the time the project was abandoned. Cities and counties covered in part are [[York]] (abandoned after 1981) [[Cambridgeshire]] (abandoned after 1972), [[Northamptonshire]] (abandoned after 1986), [[Gloucestershire]] (abandoned after 1976) and [[Salisbury]] (abandoned after 1977). In some cases research for forthcoming volumes had started after the decision not to proceed with publication was taken, and these appeared in later HMSO publications or elsewhere. [[Dorset]] is the only county which was completed in its entirety to the revised 1850 date, with [[Cambridge]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] the only urban areas to be completed to the same date.

The published inventories are now available to view in full at [[British History Online]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/search/series/rchme Inventories available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Monuments Record==
{{main|Historic England Archive}}
The National Buildings Record (NBR) was established on a partially voluntary basis in 1940 as a survey – primarily photographic – of buildings of national importance considered to be at risk of damage or destruction through [[World War II|military action]]. Although originally independent of the RCHME, the two bodies shared premises and frequently worked in close collaboration. The NBR continued its activities after the end of the war, and in 1963 was taken over by the RCHME. At this point it was renamed the National Monuments Record (NMR) to reflect the fact that its remit was archaeological as well as architectural.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, pp. 72-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, with the rest of the Commission's activities, it was absorbed into English Heritage, and in 2012 was renamed the English Heritage Archive. In 2015 the work of the NMR moved with the archive to [[Historic England]] and became the [[Historic England Archive]].

==Ordnance Survey Archaeology Division==
The [[Ordnance Survey]] had always endeavoured to mark visible antiquities on its maps, and in 1920 had appointed its first archaeology officer: the role had subsequently developed into a department of specialists maintaining a national record of archaeological sites. In 1983 the responsibilities of the Archaeology Division were transferred to the three Royal Commissions for England, Wales and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent 2001, pp. 74-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survey of London==
The [[Survey of London]], a project to undertake an architectural survey of the former [[County of London]], was founded as a private initiative in 1894, but was later taken over by the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC). On the abolition of the GLC in 1986, responsibility for the Survey was transferred to the RCHME.

'''Site-specific art''' is [[work of art|artwork]] created to exist in a certain place. Typically, the artist takes the location into account while planning and creating the artwork. Site-specific art is produced both by commercial artists, and independently, and can include some instances of work such as [[sculpture]], [[stencil graffiti]], [[rock balancing]], and other art forms. Installations can be in urban areas, remote natural settings, or underwater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lataco.com/interview-rafael-schacter-author-amazing-new-book-world-atlas-street-art-graffiti/ http://www.lataco.com] Interview with Rafael Schacter, Author of ''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/city-as-canvas-and-the-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti.html https://www.nytimes.com] Aerosol Art.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filippominelli.com/project/silence-shapes/ http://www.filippominelli.com] Filippo Minelli "''Silence/Shapes''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Schacter, author of "''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''", September, 2013; {{ISBN|9780300199420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2014/02/13/rafael-schacter-and-his-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti/ http://www.brooklynstreetart.com] Rafael Schacter and His "World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bANKhbe1Vg8 https://www.youtube] Gravity Glue 2015; (Underwater [[Rock balancing|Rock balance]] at 3:55).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "site-specific art" was promoted and refined by Californian artist [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of light + space|last=Butterfield|first=Jan|publisher=Abbeville|year=1993|isbn=1558592725|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Irwin: All the Rules Will Change|last=Hankins|first=Evelyn|publisher=Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|year=2016|isbn=3791355147|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was actually first used in the mid-1970s by young sculptors, such as [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], and [[Athena Tacha]], who had started executing public commissions for large urban sites.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For ''Two Jumps for Dead Dog Creek'' (1970), Oppenheim attempted a series of standing jumps at a selected site in Idaho, where "the width of the creek became a specific goal to which I geared a bodily activity," with his two successful jumps being "dictated by a land form."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Site-Specific Art: Performance, Place and Documentation|chapter=Embodying Site: Dennis Oppenheim and Vito Acconci|last=Kaye|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-203-13829-5|location=New York|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Site specific environmental art was first described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett and art critic [[Lucy Lippard]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Emerging out of [[minimalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Place After Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity|chapter=|last=Kwon|first=Miwon|publisher=MIT|year=2002|isbn=0-203-13829-5|location=Cambridge (Massachusetts), London|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; site-specific art opposed the [[Modernism|Modernist]] program of subtracting from the artwork all cues that interfere with the fact that it is "art",&lt;ref&gt;Kaye (citing O'Docherty's ''Inside the White Cube'', 1986), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernist art objects were transportable,  nomadic, could only exist in the museum space and were the objects of the market and commodification. Since 1960 the artists were trying to find a way out of this situation, and thus drew attention to the site and the context around this site. The work of art was created in the site and could only exist and in such circumstances - it can not be moved or changed. '''Site''' is a current location, which comprises a unique combination of physical elements: depth, length, weight, height, shape, walls, temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Works of art began to emerge from the walls of the museum and galleries ([[Daniel Buren]], Within and Beyond the Frame, John Weber Gallery, New York, 1973), were created specifically for the museum and galleries ([[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], untitled installation at Claire Copley Gallery, Los Angeles, 1974, [[Hans Haacke]], Condensation Cube, 1963–65, [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], Hartford Wash: Washing Tracks, Maintenance Outside, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, 1973), thus criticizing the museum as an institution that sets the rules for artists and viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Max Albert]], created [[Sculptures Bachelard]] in [[Parc de la Villette]] related to the site, or ''Carlotta’s Smile'', a [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] construction related to Ar. Co,’s architecture [[Lisbon]], and to a choreography in collaboration with Michala Marcus and [[Carlos Zingaro]], 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcoabecedario.pt/entries/41?locale=en|title=Abecedário — AR.CO — Centro de Arte e Comunicação Visual|website=www.arcoabecedario.pt|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the public debate over ''[[Tilted Arc]]'' (1981) resulted in its removal in 1989, its author [[Richard Serra]] reacted with what can be considered a definition of site-specific art: "To move the work is to destroy the work."&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carlotta's Smile.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Max Albert]], ''Carlotta's Smile'', a trellis construction with a choreography, in collaboration with Michala Marcus and [[Carlos Zingaro]], Lisbon, 1979]]

==Examples==
Outdoor site-specific artworks often include [[landscaping]] combined with permanently sited [[sculpture|sculptural]] elements; it is sometimes linked with [[environmental art]]. Outdoor site-specific artworks can also include [[dance]] [[performance]]s created especially for the site. More broadly, the term is sometimes used for any work that is more or less permanently attached to a particular location. In this sense, a building with interesting [[Architecture (built environment)|architecture]] could also be considered a piece of site-specific art.

In Geneva, Switzerland, two Contemporary Art Funds of the city have been looking to integrate art into the architecture and the public space since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/fr/fmac/fmac/missions/|title=Missions {{!}} Fonds d'art contemporain {{!}} Ville de Genève : Sites des institutions|website=institutions.ville-geneve.ch|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neons Parallax project initiated in 2007 was conceived specifically for the Plaine de Plainpalais, located in the heart of the city. The challenge of the artists invited was to transpose commercial advertising signs of the harbour into artistic messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neons.ch Neons Parallax]&lt;/ref&gt; The project has received the Swiss [https://www.juliusbaer.com/global/en/news-insights/news-insights-detail-page/item/the-prix-visarte-2017-an-award-for-public-art/ Prix Visarte 2017].

Site-specific performance art, site-specific visual art and interventions are commissioned for the annual [[Infecting the City]] Festival in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. The site-specific nature of the work allows artists to interrogate the contemporary and historic reality of the Central Business District and create work that allows the city's users to engage and interact with public spaces in new and memorable ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africacentre.net/infecting-the-city/|title=Infecting The City - Africa Centre|date=2014-03-28|work=Africa Centre|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Starchild skull''' is part of a malformed [[human skull]] which paranormalist [[Lloyd Pye]] had claimed is of extraterrestrial origin. The skull is of a child who likely died as a result of [[congenital hydrocephalus]].

== Claims of Lloyd Pye ==
Pye claimed to have obtained the skull from Ray and Melanie Young of [[El Paso, Texas]], in February 1999, stating that the skull was found around 1930 in a mine tunnel about 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]], buried alongside a normal human skeleton that was exposed and lying [[Supine position|supine]] on the surface of the tunnel.&lt;ref name=Fortean_127&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCoy |first=Max |title=Star Child |journal=[[Fortean Times]] |issue=127 |pages=42–45 |date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yorkshire Evening Post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alien skull' star attraction at Leeds extra-terrestrial conference|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/central-leeds/video_alien_skull_star_attraction_at_leeds_extra_terrestrial_conference_1_2216272|accessdate=13 August 2011|newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pye claimed the skull to be a hybrid offspring of an extraterrestrial and a human female.&lt;ref name="Regal2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Regal|title=Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia: A Critical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6PACQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|date=15 October 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35508-0|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feder&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmDnhPNLwYwC&amp;pg=PA246 | title=Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum | accessdate=March 17, 2011 | author=Feder, Kenneth L. | year=2010 | publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment of the evidence ==

A dentist who examined the upper right [[maxilla]] found with the skull determined that the skull was that of a child aged 4.5 to 5 years. The volume, however, of the interior of the Starchild skull is 1,600 cubic centimeters, which is 200&amp;nbsp;cm³ larger than the average adult's brain, and 400&amp;nbsp;cm³ larger than an adult of the same approximate size. The [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]s are oval and shallow, with the [[optic nerve]] canal situated closer to the bottom of the orbit than to the back. There are no [[frontal sinus]]es.&lt;ref name=Fortean_127 /&gt; The back of the skull is flattened.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The skull consists of [[hydroxyapatite|calcium hydroxyapatite]], the normal material of [[mammal]]ian bone.

Neurologist [[Steven Novella]] of [[Yale Medical School|Yale University Medical School]] says that the cranium exhibits all of the characteristics of a child who has died as a result of [[hydrocephalus|congenital hydrocephalus]], and the cranial deformations were the result of accumulations of cerebrospinal fluid within the skull.&lt;ref name=Feder /&gt;&lt;ref name=NESS&gt;{{cite web|last=Novella|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella|title=The Starchild Project|url=http://www.theness.com/index.php/the-starchild-project/|publisher=The New England Skeptical Society|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{cite book|title=The Incredible Unlikeliness of Being: Evolution and the Making of Us|last=Roberts|first=Alice|authorlink=Alice Roberts|pages=87–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYg0CwAAQBAJ|publisher=Quercus|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=feder&gt;{{cite book|last=Feder|first=Kenneth L.|title=Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum|date=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlRz2symkAsC|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProtheroCALLAHAN2017"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DI8uDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 UFOs, Chemtrails, and Aliens: What Science Says]''. Indiana University Press; 2 August 2017. {{ISBN|978-0-253-02706-1}}. p. 113–.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DNA testing]] in 1999 at BOLD ([[Forensic dentistry#Organizations|Bureau of Legal Dentistry]]), a [[forensic]] DNA lab in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], found standard [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome]]s in two samples taken from the skull. Novella considers this "conclusive evidence" that the child was both male and human, and that both of his parents must have been human in order for each to have contributed one of the human sex chromosomes.&lt;ref name=NESS /&gt;

Further DNA testing in 2003 at Trace Genetics, which specializes in extracting DNA from ancient samples, isolated [[mitochondrial DNA]] from both recovered skulls. The child belongs to [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|haplogroup C]]. Since mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother, it makes it possible to trace the offspring's maternal lineage. The DNA test therefore confirmed that the child's mother was a Haplogroup C human female. However, the adult female found with the child belonged to [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|haplogroup A]]. Both haplotypes are characteristic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] haplogroups, but the different haplogroup for each skull indicates that the adult female was not the child's mother.&lt;ref name="Regal2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Feder /&gt;

Paranormal researcher [[Ben Radford]] states that often "anything not immediately explainable or obvious is interpreted as a baffling mystery, often with paranormal connotations. ... Science fiction speculation is fun but should not eclipse the real science and significance of these stories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radford |first1=Ben |authorlink= Ben Radford|title='Alien' Mummy Identified by DNA |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=10-11 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''straight man''' is a [[stock character]] in a [[comedy]] performance, especially a [[double act]], [[sketch comedy]], or [[farce]]. When a comedy partner behaves [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentrically]], the straight man is expected to maintain composure. The ability to maintain a serious demeanor in the face of even the most preposterous comedy is crucial to a successful straight man.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Whatever direct contribution to the comedy a straight man provides usually comes in the form of [[deadpan]]. A straight man with no direct comedic role has historically been known as a '''stooge'''.  Typically he is expected to feed the funny man lines that he can respond to for laughs, while seeking no acclamation for himself.

In [[vaudeville]], effective straight men were much less common than comedians. The straight man's name usually appeared first and he usually received 60% of the take. This helped take the sting out of not being the laugh-getter and helped ensure the straight man's loyalty to the team.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Nachman, Gerald]] (1998). Raised on Radio, p. 36. Pantheon Books, New York. {{ISBN|037540287X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abbott and Costello]], one of America's most popular comedy duos of the 1940s and 50s in radio, film and television, began as nightclub performers when the straight-faced [[Bud Abbott]] contrasted against the bumbling [[Lou Costello]]; Abbott, unusually, allowed Costello a larger paycheck to keep him on the team.

The role is still found today in [[sitcoms]]. In the [[manzai]] comedy of Japan, the straight man is called ''[[tsukkomi]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''''The Book of Disquiet''''' ('''''Livro do Desassossego: Composto por Bernardo Soares, ajudante de guarda-livros na cidade de Lisboa''''') is a work by the Portuguese author [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888–1935). Published posthumously, ''The Book of Disquiet'' is a fragmentary lifetime project, left unedited by the author, who introduced it as a "factless autobiography."
The publication was credited to Bernardo Soares, one of the author's alternate writing names, which he called [[heteronym (literature)|semi-heteronym]]s, and had a preface attributed to Fernando Pessoa, another alternate writing name or [[heteronym (literature)|orthonym]].

{{quote|In Lisbon there are a few restaurants or eating houses located above decent-looking taverns, places with the heavy, domestic look of restaurants in towns far from any rail line. These second-story eateries, usually empty except on Sundays, frequently contain curious types whose faces are not interesting but who constitute a series of digressions from life.|Fernando Pessoa, from ''The Book of Disquiet'', trans. Alfred MacAdam.}}

Much studied by "Pessoan" critics, who have different interpretations regarding the book's proper organization, ''The Book of Disquiet'' was first published in Portuguese in 1982, 47 years after Pessoa's death (the author died at age 47 in 1935). The book has seen publication in Spanish (1984), German (1985), Italian (1986), French (1988), and English (1991). The ''Book'' in 1991 had four English editions by different translators: [[Richard Zenith]] (editor and translator), Iain Watson, Alfred MacAdam and [[Margaret Jull Costa]]. The ''Book'' is a bestseller, especially in German (16 editions, from different translators and publishers).

The book was listed on the [[Bokklubben World Library|Norwegian Book Clubs list of the 100 best works of fiction of all time]], based on the responses of 100 authors from 54 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/content/view/print/505597/|title=The 100 best books of all time|date=2012-06-12|accessdate=2012-10-20|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|first=Molly|last=Driscoll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[Teresa Sobral Cunha]] considers that there are two versions of ''The Book of Disquiet''. According to Cunha, who with [[Jacinto do Prado Coelho]] and [[Maria Aliete Galhoz]] edited the first edition in 1982, there are two authors of the book: [[Vicente Guedes]] in a first phase (in the 1910s and 20s), and the aforementioned [[Bernardo Soares]] (late 1920s and 30s).

However, [[António Quadros]] considers that the first phase of the book belongs to Pessoa himself. The second phase, more personal and diary-like, is the one credited to Bernardo Soares.

Richard Zenith, editor of a new Portuguese edition in 1998, took the option of presenting a single volume, as in his English translation of 1991. In his introduction, he writes that "if Bernardo Soares does not measure up to the full Pessoa, neither are his diary writings the sum total of ''Disquietude'', to which he was after all a johnny-come-lately. ''The Book of Disquietude'' was various books (yet ultimately one book), with various authors (yet ultimately one author), and even the word ''disquietude'' changes meaning as time passes."&lt;ref&gt;PESSOA, Fernando, ''The Book of Disquietude'', tr. Richard Zenith, Carcanet Press, 1991, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|'''[[George Steiner]] on ''The Book Of Disquiet'': '''

"The fragmentary, the incomplete is of the essence of Pessoa's spirit. The very kaleidoscope of voices within him, the breadth of his culture, the catholicity of his ironic sympathies – wonderfully echoed in Saramago's great novel about Ricardo Reis – inhibited the monumentalities, the self-satisfaction of completion. Hence the vast torso of Pessoa's ''Faust'' on which he laboured much of his life. Hence the fragmentary condition of ''The Book of Disquiet,'' which contains material that predates 1913 and which Pessoa left open-ended at his death. As Adorno famously said, the finished work is, in our times and climate of anguish, a lie.&lt;br/&gt;

"It was to Bernardo Soares that Pessoa ascribed his ''Book of Disquiet'', first made available in English in a briefer version by Richard Zenith in 1991. The translation is at once penetrating and delicately observant of Pessoa's astute melancholy. What is this ''Livro do Desassossego''? Neither 'commonplace book', nor 'sketchbook', nor 'florilegium' will do. Imagine a fusion of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s [[Coleridge's notebooks|notebooks]] and marginalia, of Valéry's philosophic diary and of Robert Musil's voluminous journal. Yet even such a hybrid does not correspond to the singularity of Pessoa's chronicle. Nor do we know what parts thereof, if any, he ever intended for publication in some revised format."&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, "A Man of Many Parts," ''The Observer'', Sunday, 3 June 2001. http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/jun/03/poetry.features1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16474">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Perfect Moment''}}
'''''The Perfect Moment''''' was the most comprehensive retrospective of works by New York photographer [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]. The show spanned twenty-five years of his career, featuring [[celebrity portrait]]s, [[self-portrait]]s, [[interracial]] figure studies, floral still lifes, [[homoerotic]] images, and collages. The exhibition, organized by [[Janet Kardon]] of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Arts in Philadelphia]], opened in the winter of 1988 just months before Mapplethorpe’s death from [[AIDS]] complications on March 9, 1989.  On tour, in the summer of 1989, the exhibition became the centerpiece of a controversy concerning federal funding of the arts and censorship.

== Exhibition ==
=== Background ===
''The Perfect Moment'' covered all aspects of the photographer’s career from the late 1960s to 1988. The traveling exhibition had been scheduled to appear at five other museums in various regions of the country during the next year and a half. It included more than 150 images. Despite the controversial character of some of the [[photograph]]s, critical response was enthusiastic and attendance was robust throughout the show's [[Philadelphia]] run (from December 1988 through January 1989).

''The Perfect Moment'' traveled to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago]]. Again, it generated no unfavorable public or critical attention. In June 1989, after the cancellation of the exhibition by the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington D.C.]], two and a half weeks before it was to open there, ''The Perfect Moment'' unexpectedly provoked national controversy and ICA became a key player in the congressional debate over what public funds should and should not fund. The issues of censorship and artistic freedom that the show raised occupied the forefront of the debates between conservatives and liberals during the [[Ronald Reagan]] era and in its aftermath. Members of the religious right, especially, criticized academics and artists for what they regarded as their indecent, subversive and blasphemous works. 

=== Layout and works displayed ===
''The Perfect Moment'' grouped photos into three categories: 
*Rigorously conceived portraits and figure studies;
*Dramatically lit flower arrangements in color, and in black and white;
*Photographs of gay [[sadomasochism]] (S&amp;M) that left nothing to the imagination.

Robert Mapplethorpe’s XYZ portfolios, explored three subjects: homosexual [[sadomasochism]] (X); flower still lifes (Y); and nude portraits of [[African American]] men (Z). The extremely graphic S&amp;M photos from Mapplethorpe’s X Portfolio were displayed in a separate, age-restricted area during at each venue of the exhibition. The portfolios were displayed with a series of poems by poet and singer [[Patti Smith]]. The poems echo Mapplethorpe's X,Y,Z trope.

{{quote|“Y is the symbol of the covenant which exists between the artist and his creator/ Y is the consummation of this idea thru the projection of the perfect shot. ”Please use the poetry as sandwich quotes; I want them to be obvious.” (Patti Smith)}}

The images that sparked the most controversy include:
*Jim and Tom, Sausalito, 1977
*Man in a Polyester Suit, 1980
*Jesse McBride, 1976
*Rosie (Honey), 1976
 
Rosie, a black and white portrait of a very young girl crouched down on a bench outdoors with part of her dress lifted, exposing her genitals, generated controversy because of the subject's age and the issue of consent. This photograph was deemed [[child pornography]] by Mapplethorpe's detractors, and it is surprising that it was featured in the exhibition catalogue, considering that the printer had refused to print it for the Mapplethorpe retrospective at the [[Whitney Museum of Art]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=Playing with the Edge: The Photographic Achievement of Robert Mapplethorpe|date=1996|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one other photograph of a naked child, "Jessie McBride" which also contributed to the controversy created by "Rosie". 
 
A 55-minute videotape of a [[BBC]] interview with the photographer accompanied the exhibition.

== Reception ==
The art critics in Philadelphia, the show's first venue, critiqued Mapplethorpe's work along formalist lines, without commenting on the provocative content of the X portfolio photographs. Overall, the exhibition was met enthusiastically by critics both Philadelphia and in Chicago, where the show appeared at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]].

However, a campaign launched by the [[American Family Association]], a conservative watchdog group, to censor what they considered “indecent” art changed the climate of reception. In June 12, 1989 [[Christina Orr-Cahall]], the director of the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], cancelled “The Perfect Moment,” which was scheduled to open there on June 30. Orr-Cahall feared that ''The Perfect Moment'' would endanger [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) appropriations in the [[United States Congress]].

The exhibition set off one of the fiercest episodes of America's "[[culture war]]s" —  and sparked a recurring debate about state-funded cultural production and the support of [[sexually explicit]] or [[sacrilegious]] art by public funds.

=== Debate about National Endowment for the Arts ===
The canceling of the ''Perfect Moment'' provoked a [[censorship]] battle about national funding for the arts that was front page news for the next year.

On June 30, 1989, protesters angered by the cancellation of the show by the Corcoran Gallery projected slides of Mapplethorpe’s photographs on the facade of the museum. Seven hundred people rallied to express their outrage about the Corcoran's decision. [[Michael Brenson]], art critic for the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote, “This exhibit should be seen. It is extremely unfortunate that the Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled it last month in the hope of averting a political outcry…. As much as he has been made out to be a renegade and outlaw, Mapplethorpe is an utterly mainstream artist. He loved freshness and glamor and was obsessed with the moment, which his photographs always reflect. In his restricted spaces and his feeling for abstraction and attentiveness to every shape, edge and texture, Mapplethorpe is a child of the Formalism of the 1960’s."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brenson|first1=Michael|title=The Many Roles of Mapplethorpe, Acted out in Ever Shifting Images,|date=July 22, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) stepped in to host the show, and on July 22, 1989, “The Perfect Moment” opened at this alternative art space. No incidents marred the show's run at the Washington Project for the Arts.

However, Senator [[Jesse Helms]] introduced legislation that would stop the NEA from funding artwork he considered “obscene.” The legislation subsequently required any recipients of NEA funds to sign an oath that declared they would not promote obscenity. The oath provoked protests from artists and arts organizations. When, during the next grant cycle, in this climate of fear, applications for support equaling hundreds of thousands of dollars were rejected. Outraged artists filed lawsuits against the agency. A compromise was reached in Congress. Although the radically restrictive Helms amendment did not pass, restrictions were placed on NEA funding procedures.

=== Censorship ===
In March 1990, anti-pornography advocates in [[Cincinnati Ohio]], the [[Citizens for Community Values]], launched a campaign to pressure the [[Contemporary Arts Center]] (CAC) to cancel “The Perfect Moment.” Cincinnati law enforcement ordered four hundred visitors from the museum to leave while they videotaped Mapplethorpe’s photographs as evidence to support obscenity charges brought against [[Dennis Barrie]], the director of the CAC, and against the CAC. This was the first time a museum in the [[United States]] faced prosecution for the art it displayed.

On October 5, 1990, Dennis Barrie and the CAC were acquitted in the [[obscenity]] case. The prosecution failed to convince the jury that Mapplethorpe’s photographs lacked [[artistic merit]]. In Cincinnati, more than 80,000 people saw the show. The censorship proceedings doubtless brought more attention to Mapplethorpe's work than it would have otherwise received.

=== Legacy ===
Since the CAC debacle, images from ''The Perfect Moment'', including the X, Y, and Z portfolios, have circulated to in hundreds of exhibitions internationally. Mapplethorpe's work is currently represented by 12 galleries worldwide, with the largest collection of his works at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. These photographs and history of their attempted censorship during the 1990s have influenced artists, inspired [[LGBTQ]] advocates, and generated much scholarship.

[[Image:White Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''White Chapel''' of [[Senusret I]]]]

The '''White Chapel''' of pharaoh [[Senusret I]], also referred to as the [[sed festival|Jubilee]] [[Jubilee Pavilion (hieroglyph)|Chapel]] of Senusret I, was built during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. During the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] it was demolished and used as filler for the Third Pylon of the temple of Karnak, [[Precinct of Amun-Re]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karnak: Evolution of a Temple|first=Elizabeth|last=Blyth|page=15|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the dismantled pieces were found inside the Third Pylon of the main temple, constructed in the time of [[Amenhotep III]], at Karnak, and between 1927 and 1930 all of the pieces were carefully removed. These pieces were then assembled into the building that is seen today in the [[Karnak Open Air Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacau &amp; Chevrier 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Chapel is made of [[limestone]]. Its columns hold reliefs of a very high quality, which are hardly seen elsewhere at Karnak, and depicts Pharaoh Senusret being crowned and embraced by [[Amun]], [[Horus]], [[Min (god)|Min]] and [[Ptah]].

All along the base of the outer walls runs a series of reliefs depicting the emblems and deities of the [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]], or provinces, of Egypt. On the      western side are the nomes of [[Upper Egypt]], and on the eastern side are the nomes of [[Lower Egypt]].
