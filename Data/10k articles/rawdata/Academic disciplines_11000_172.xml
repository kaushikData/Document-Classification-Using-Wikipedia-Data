'''Alluvium''' (from the [[Latin]] ''alluvius'', from ''alluere'', "to wash against") is loose, unconsolidated (not cemented together into a solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]]) [[soil]] or [[sediment]] that has been [[Erosion|eroded]], reshaped by water in some form, and redeposited in a non-[[marine (ocean)|marine]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110501155938/http://www.geotech.org/survey/geotech/dictiona.html Glossary of Geological Terms]. Geotech.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/dictionary/glossary-a.shtml Geology Dictionary – Alluvial, Aquiclude, Arkose]. Geology.Com. Retrieved on 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Alluvium is typically made up of a variety of materials, including fine particles of [[silt]] and [[clay]] and larger particles of [[sand]] and [[gravel]].  When this loose alluvial material is deposited or cemented into a [[Lithology|lithological]] unit, or [[Lithification|lithified]], it is called an '''alluvial deposit'''.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Chisholm, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The term "alluvium" is not typically used in situations where the formation of the sediment can clearly be attributed to another geologic process that is well described.  This includes (but is not limited to): lake sediments ([[Lake|lacustrine]]), river sediments ([[fluvial]]), or glacially-derived sediments ([[glacial till]]).  Sediments that are formed or deposited in a perennial stream or [[river]] are typically not referred to as alluvial.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Age==
Most alluvium is geologically [[Quaternary]] in age, and is often referred to as "cover" because these sediments obscure the underlying [[bedrock]].  Most sedimentary material that fills a [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] ("basin fill") that is not lithified is typically lumped together as "alluvial".&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Alluvium of [[Pliocene]] age occurs, for example, in parts of Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ames | first = Dan | contribution = Formation of the Soils | year = 1998 | title = Soil Survey of Jerome County and Part of Twin Falls County, Idaho | pages = 238 | publisher = Natural Resources Conservation Service, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] | contribution-url = https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MANUSCRIPTS/idaho/ID704/0/id704_text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alluvium of late [[Miocene]] age occurs, for example, in the valley of the [[San Joaquin River]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1197/report.pdf | title=Amount and Timing of Late Cenozoic Uplift and Tilt of the Central Sierra Nevada, California—Evidence from the Upper San Joaquin River Basin (USGS Professional Paper 1197) | publisher=[[USGS]] | author=Huber, N. King | year=1981 | location=Washington D.C. | pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ores==
Alluvium can contain valuable [[ore]]s such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]] and a wide variety of [[gemstone]]s. Such a concentration of valuable ores is termed a [[placer deposit]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

'''The Alpheios Project''' is an open source initiative originally focused on developing software to facilitate reading [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]]. Dictionaries, grammars and inflection tables were combined in a set of web-based tools to provide comprehensive reading support for scholars, students and independent readers. The tools were implemented as browser add-ons so that they could be used on any web site or any page that a user might create in Unicoded HTML.
  
In collaboration with the Perseus Digital Library, the goals of the Alpheios Project were subsequently broadened to combine reading support with language learning. Annotation and editing tools were added to help users contribute to the development of new resources, such as enhanced texts that have been syntactically annotated or aligned with translations.
  
The Alpheios tools are designed modularly to encourage the addition of other languages that have the necessary digital resources, such as morphological analyzers and dictionaries. In addition to Latin and ancient Greek, Alpheios tools have been extended to [[Arabic]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. 
 
The Alpheios Project is a non-profit ([[501c3]]) initiative. The software is open source, and resides on Sourceforge.com. The Alpheios software is released as [[GNU General Public License#|GPL 3.0]] and texts and data as [[Creative Commons license|CC-by-SA]].

== History ==

The Alpheios Project was established in 2007 by Mark Nelson, the founder of the commercial software company [[Ovid Technologies]], which he started after writing a search engine for medical literature that became widely popular in medical libraries and research facilities (Strauch, 1996). Nelson, who holds an MA in English literature from Columbia University, sold the company to [[Wolters Kluwer]] in 1999 (Quint, 1998). Nelson created Alpheios by recruiting several developers and programmers from his previous company, defining the project's initial goals and funding its first three years of operation. In 2008 he also provided the initial funding for The Perseus Treebank of Ancient Greek, which has subsequently been crowd-sourced.

In 2011, the Perseus Project hired key Alpheios staff and the activities of the projects were extensively integrated, although Alpheios remains an independent organization focused on developing adaptive reading and learning tools that can provide formative assessment customized to the individual user's special abilities and goals, including the study of specific authors or texts.

To date, all Alpheios applications, enhanced texts and code have been provided without any fees or licenses. A separate Alpheios LLC provides commercial consultation on customization and extension of the Alpheios tools.

Scholarship in American political development focuses on "the causes, nature, and consequences of key transformative periods and central patterns in American political history."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersh|first=Rogan|date=2005-01-01|title=The Growth of American Political Development: The View from the Classroom|jstor=3688034|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=335–345|doi=10.1017/s1537592705050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Orren]] and [[Stephen Skowronek]], co-founders of the subfield's [[Studies in American Political Development|flagship journal]], define American political development as the study of "durable shifts in governing authority" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Search-American-Political-Development/dp/0521547644|title=The Search for American Political Development|date=2004-05-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521547642|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield emerged within [[American political science]] in the 1980s, alongside a general renewal of work in [[historical institutionalism]], as an "insurgent movement" that sought to refocus attention on the study of historical American politics and to use such historical study to recast the study of contemporary political phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-21|chapter=Distinctiveness and Necessity of American Political Development |title=Oxford Handbook of American Political Development| editors=Richard M.

APD shares overlaps with the research agendas of [[comparative politics]] (particularly [[Comparative historical research|comparative historical analysis]]), [[historical sociology]], and [[political history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/research/department-strengths/american-political-development.html|title=American Political Development: Department of Political Science - Northwestern University|website=www.polisci.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarship in APD differs from political history in that the former's "primary concerns are analytical, conceptual, and theoretical rather than historical."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-36|title=Qualitative Methods and American Political Development|last=Galvin|first=Daniel J.|date=2015-07-09|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.013.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodologically, the subfield tends to use within-case analysis and conduct causes-of-effects research (as opposed to effects-of-causes research).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Major journals in the subfield include the flagship journal ''[[Studies in American Political Development]]'', founded in 1986, and ''The Journal of Political History'', founded in 1989. As of 2005, the Politics and History section (founded in 1989) of the [[American Political Science Association]] was the eighth-largest in membership out of 35 total sections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/section24|title= MEMBERSHIP &gt; Organized Sections by Title &gt; Politics and History (Section 24)|website=American Political Science Association|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anglo-Saxon glass''' has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewellery.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"&gt;Bayley. Glass-working in Early Medieval England. In Price 2000: 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD with the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]], there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass.&lt;ref name="Evison2000"&gt;Evison. Glass vessels in England, AD 400-1100. In Price 2000: 47–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation of [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] sites have revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;

The majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently. This is directly related to the introduction of [[Christianity]] and the construction of churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"&gt;Heyworth 1992&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastical: Of or relating to a church or to an established religion.&lt;/ref&gt; literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to window glass used in ecclesiastical buildings.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harden1978"&gt;Harden 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewellery, both as enamel or as cut glass insets.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"&gt;Bimson and Freestone. Analysis of some glass from Anglo-Saxon Jewellery. In Price 2000: 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bimson1978"&gt;Bimson 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glass manufacture==

It is the only complete piece of late Saxon glass in England.]]

A clear distinction between glass making and glass working must be made. Glass making is the production of raw glass from the raw materials.&lt;ref name="Biek1979"&gt;Biek and Bayley 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Glass working on the other hand refers to the processing of raw glass or recycled glass to create new glass objects, although this may take place in the same location as glass making, it can also take place elsewhere.

===Glass making===
Glass consists of four principal components; a former, alkali flux, stabiliser and colourants/opacifiers.
* '''Former''': '''''Silica''''', which in the Roman and Anglo-Saxon period was added in the form of sand.
* '''Alkali flux''': '''''Soda '''''or''''' potash'''''. The Roman sources, in addition to chemical analysis of glass dating to the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods, suggest that mineral [[natron]] was used as the flux. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] also states that the preferred source of natron for glass making was from Egypt.&lt;ref name="Freestone2005"&gt;Freestone 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1st millennium AD a new source of flux was being used, wood ash, which is a source of potash.&lt;ref name="Henderson1992"&gt;Henderson 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stabiliser''': '''''Lime''''' or '''''magnesia'''''. In Anglo-Saxon glass the main stabiliser was lime. This may have been deliberately added to the glass batch, but may simply have been a component of the sand that was used. Roman writer Pliny stated that sand from the [[Belus (river)|River Belus]] was particularly suitable for glass-making,&lt;ref&gt;Eichholz 1989&lt;/ref&gt; this is a calcareous sand, rich in marine shells, and therefore lime.&lt;ref name="Freestone2005"&gt;Freestone 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Price1991"&gt;Price and Cool 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Colourants/Opacifiers''': These can be naturally present in the glass due to impurities in the raw materials, e.g. in the case of green/blue-green glass which results from the presence of iron in the sand. Other colourants are likely to be deliberate additions to the glass melt of small quantities of mineral-rich material&lt;ref name="Guido1999"&gt;Guido and Welch 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"&gt;Brugmann 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or in some cases [[slag]]s from metalworking processes.&lt;ref&gt;Heck and Hoffmann 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The elements in ancient glass that affect its appearance are mainly '''''iron, manganese, cobalt, copper, tin''''' and '''''antimony'''''. The presence or absence of '''''lead''''' is also important, while it doesn’t produce a colour itself (except in the form lead-tin oxide or lead-antimony oxide) it can change the hue of other colourants. In addition when added to opaque glasses it ensures that the colourants form in a controlled way and are uniformly distributed. [[Opacity (optics)|Opacity]] in glass can be due to a number of factors; intensity of colour, bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of opacifying agents, such as tin (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and antimony (Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; CaSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Guido1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt;

The main type of glass found in the Anglo-Saxon period is a soda-lime-silica glass, continuing the Roman tradition of producing glass.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt; There is very little evidence for glass making from the raw materials in Roman Britain&lt;ref name="Price1991"/&gt; and even less evidence in Anglo-Saxon Britain.&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt; It would have been nearly impossible to transport the natron from the Middle East to Britain. It is therefore far more likely, that as in the Roman period, glass was being produced near the raw materials and then lumps of raw glass transported. Another source of glass was [[cullet]], recycled broken or crushed glass. Recycling was carried out throughout the Roman period,&lt;ref name="Price1991"/&gt; and large deposits of broken glass at [[Winchester]] and [[Hamwic]] suggest glass was also being recycled in the Anglo-Saxon period.&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter and Heyworth 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that by recycling glass in this way it was possible to keep up to the demand for glass products without new raw glass having to be introduced into the system. Additional cullet may also have been collected from the ruins of abandoned Romano-British sites.&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt; In the late 7-8th century with the construction of many ecclesiastical establishments and large windows, the demand for glass grew.&lt;ref name="Henderson1992"/&gt; At this time political problems in the Delta-Wadi Natrun region caused a shortage of natron in the Middle East where the raw glass was produced.&lt;ref&gt;Shortland ''et al.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This possibly led to  glass makers experimenting with new fluxes, which finally led to the introduction of wood ash glasses using potash as the main alkali flux, which was more readily available.&lt;ref name="Henderson1992"/&gt;

===Glass working===
[[File:Claw beaker from Ringmere Farm BM 2005.12-5.1.jpg|thumb|left|Claw beaker from an Anglo-Saxon site.]]

Excavation of Anglo-Saxon sites has produced some evidence for limited glass working in the form of crucibles for melting glass, glass debris and furnaces, although, to date, no furnaces have been found associated with [[crucible]]s or glass working debris, or vice versa. All the glass working furnaces that have been found are associated with ecclesiastical sites such as monasteries. This gives the impression that these centres sponsored the majority of glass working in Anglo-Saxon Britain, presumably to primarily work on making glass windows for the church buildings. Documentary sources suggest glass workers were [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] travelling around the country, producing glass on demand, possibly re-using broken glass, rather than there being a single centre producing worked glass objects which would then need to be transported.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt; Although we can identify the production processes it is still not known how much glass working took place in the Anglo-Saxon period and how widespread it was. The absence of evidence has often been used to argue that the majority of glass was imported from the continent. But this seems unlikely as there are limited numbers of glass vessel manufacturing sites found elsewhere in Europe and some of the Anglo-Saxon glass vessels are unique to England, suggesting the presence of some manufacture centres, possibly in Kent.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harden1956"&gt;Harden 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the number of glass working sites reflects not only the nature of the fragmented Anglo-Saxon archaeological record but also the nature of glass, which could be melted down and re-used.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price1991"/&gt;

==Glass vessels==
The vast majority of complete vessels come from early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, allowing similar glass vessel to be grouped together creating [[Typology (archaeology)|typologies]]. More recent excavations of contemporary settlements have revealed fragments of similar vessels types, indicating there are few, if any, differences between domestic glass and those ritually deposited in graves.&lt;ref name="Harden1978"/&gt; There is a significant difference between Roman and Anglo-Saxon vessel forms, and glass working techniques became more limited. Few of the Anglo-Saxon forms can be classified as tableware, as this term implies to some extent that vessels can be set on a flat surface. The forms used had primarily rounded or pointed bases, or when bases were present would have been too top heavy and unstable. This implies that vessels were held in the hand until the drink was completed.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt; The evidence for glass vessels is patchier in the 8th century, as the number of complete vessels found decreases. This is directly related to the introduction of Christianity and the change in burial rite.&lt;ref name="Harden1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harden1956"/&gt;

The first typology for Anglo-Saxon glass vessels was devised by Dr. Donald B. Harden in 1956,&lt;ref name="Harden1956"/&gt; which was later revised in 1978.&lt;ref name="Harden1978"/&gt; The names established by Harden have now become familiar with usage, and Professor Vera Evison’s typology retained many categories while adding some new types, some from newly excavated vessels that could not be placed into Harden’s typology.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;

The chemical composition of Anglo-Saxon glass vessels is very similar to late Roman glass, which has high amounts of iron, manganese and titanium. The slightly higher amounts of iron in the Early Anglo-Saxon glass results in a colourless glass, with a green-yellow tinge. By the end of the 7th century some innovations can be observed. With generally better quality glass, a greater range of colours found and the beginning of the tendency to use a second colour for decoration.  Most Anglo-Saxon vessels were free blown, although occasionally some mould blown examples are found, mostly with vertical ribbing. The rims were fire rounded, sometimes slightly thickened and cupped, rolled or folded either inwards or outwards. Decoration was accomplished almost entirely by the application of trails which could be in the same colour as the vessel or contrasting, or in the form of a reticella&lt;ref&gt;The term reticella is often used incorrectly to describe fine twists and cables, often in a herringbone design and generally in two colours. The term is only correctly applicable to a particular technique used to decorate glass vessels by Venetian glassworkers.&lt;/ref&gt; like trail.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harden1978"/&gt;

==Glass beads==
:''See also: [[Glass bead|Glass Beads]] and [[Bead]].''

[[Image:Beads.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A collection of Anglo-Saxon beads from a cemetery at Sarr]]
The vast majority of early Anglo-Saxon female graves contain beads, which are often found in large numbers in the area of the neck and chest. Beads are also sometimes found in male burials, with large beads often associated with prestigious weapons. A variety of materials other than glass were available for Anglo-Saxon beads including; amber, rock crystal, amethyst, bone, shells, coral and even metal.&lt;ref name="Guido2000"&gt;Guido and Welch. Indirect evidence for glass bead manufacture in early Anglo-Saxon England. In Price 2000 115–120.&lt;/ref&gt; These beads are usually considered to have been decorative but may also have a social or ritual function.&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt; Anglo-Saxon glass beads show a wide variety of bead manufacturing techniques, sizes, shapes, colours and decorations. Various studies have been carried out investigating the distribution and chronological change of bead types.&lt;ref name="Guido1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt;

Several bead manufacturing sites have been identified on the continent, by the presence of waste glass, beads and glass rods. Two late Roman to 5th century sites have been discovered at Trier and [[Tibiscum]] in Romania, while closer to England and dating to the 6th-7th century two more sites have been found at Jordenstraat and Rothulfuashem (Netherlands). There is also extensive evidence for bead making workshops in Scandinavia which have been dated to the 8th century or later. The best known examples are Eketorp on Öland (Sweden) and Ribe in Jutland (Denmark).&lt;ref name="Guido1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt; There is a tendency for British archaeologists to assume that the majority of glass beads recovered were imported. Although to date there is a lack of direct evidence for bead manufacture in early Anglo-Saxon England, there is evidence for it in early Christian Ireland, northern Britain and the post-Roman west. It is also present on Saxon monastic and settlement sites between the 7th and 9th century. Even so, indirect evidence from the distribution of early Saxon beads has been used to suggest that there is at least three bead groups which were being manufactured in England.&lt;ref name="Guido2000"/&gt;

To date only two extensive chemical analysis studies of Anglo-Saxon bead assemblages have been carried out, from the cemeteries of Sewerby in Yorkshire and Apple Down in Sussex. These studies showed that, like glass vessels, the beads had a modified soda-lime-silica composition with high manganese and iron oxide contents. Variations in the composition directly related to the glass colour.&lt;ref name="Guido1999"/&gt; Lead rich opaque glass was also prominent in Anglo-Saxon Britain, most likely due to its lower softening temperature and longer working period, which would not melt or distort the bead body.&lt;ref name="Hirst2000"&gt;Hirst. An approach to the study of Anglo-Saxon glass beads. In J. Price 2000 121–130.&lt;/ref&gt; The bead body could be constructed in a number of different ways; winding, drawing, piercing, folding or even a combination of these. Decoration was applied by adding twisting rods of colour, coloured mosaic patterns, enclosing metal between layers of clear glass or simply adding a different colour in either drops or trails.&lt;ref name="Brugmann2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirst2000"/&gt;

==Window glass==
With the introduction of Christianity in the early 7th century and the building of ecclesiastical structures the amount of window glass also increased. Window glass, some of which was also coloured, has been identified at more than 17 sites, of which 12 are ecclesiastical. Hundreds of window glass fragments have been found at [[Jarrow]], [[Monkwearmouth|Wearmouth]], [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]], [[Whithorn]] and Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"&gt;Cramp. Anglo-Saxon Window Glass. In Price 2000: 105–114.&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence supports the historical records, such as [[Bede]]’s account of [[Benedict Biscop]]’s importation of glaziers from Gaul to glaze the windows in the monastery at Wearmouth in AD 675.&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"/&gt;

Most Anglo-Saxon window glass is thin, durable, bubbly and when colourless has a pale bluish-green tint. Many of the ecclesiastical sites have also produced strongly coloured glass from the 7th century onwards. Analysis of window glass from [[Beverley]], [[Uley]], Winchester, Whithorn, Wearmouth and Jarrow, has revealed that the majority was again a soda-lime-silica glass but it has also revealed that the composition is different from that of vessel glass, with lower quantities of iron, manganese and titanium suggesting a different source of raw material, possibly from [[The Levant]].&lt;ref name="Freestone2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"/&gt; The analysis also revealed more about the transition from using soda as a flux, to potash.&lt;ref name="Henderson1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"/&gt;

Window glass in antiquity could be produced in three ways; [[Cylinder blown sheet|cylinder blown]], [[Crown glass (window)|crown manufacture]] or cast. In Anglo-Saxon England there is evidence for all three types of methods being used. The vast majority of glass windows were produced by the cylinder blown method, although possibly on a smaller scale than the classic methods mentioned by [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]]. Some Anglo-Saxon window glass was produced by the crown method and at [[Repton]] thick pieces of window glass with swirling layered surfaces were possibly made using the cast method.&lt;ref name="Cramp2000"/&gt;

==Jewellery glass==
[[Image:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sutton Hoo]] shoulder-clasps with inlays of garnets and glass chequer [[millefiori]].]]

The majority of jewellery in the 6th-7th century made intensive use of flat, cut [[almandine garnet]]s in gold and garnet [[cloisonné]] (or "cellwork") but occasionally glass was also cut and inset as gems. The colours used were almost entirely limited to blue and green.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"/&gt; Occasionally red glass has been used as a substitute for garnet,&lt;!-- Strange! The BM pages do not mention red glass being used for either of these objects --&gt; for example in some of the [[Sutton Hoo]] objects, such as the [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|purse-lid]] and blue glass in the shoulder clasps.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bimson1978"/&gt; The 7th-century [[Forsbrook Pendant]] also mixes garnet and [[blue glass]] inlays. Anglo-Saxon enamel was also used in the production of jewellery, with coloured glass melted in separate cells.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"/&gt;

Chemical analysis of this glass has revealed that they are a soda-lime-silica glass but with a lower iron and manganese oxide content than the high iron, manganese and titanium glass used to make vessels. The similarity between the composition of the glass inlays and Roman coloured glass is remarkable, so much so that it is likely that the Anglo-Saxon craftworkers were re-using Roman opaque glass, possibly Roman glass [[tessera]]e.&lt;ref name="Bimson2000"/&gt;

The '''China Academy of Urban Planning and Design''' ({{lang-zh|c=中国城市规划设计研究院|p=Zhōngguó Chéngshì Guīhuà Shèjì yán Jiùyuàn}}) is a [[research institution]] under the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development]] (MOHURD) and a national information center for planning studies. It is a service provider in the areas of urban planning, engineering design, engineering consulting, tourism planning, engineering surveying for heritage preservation, water-resource assessment for development projects, and architectural design and system integration for intelligent buildings. It is also qualified as a national service provider to undertake overseas projects in civil engineering surveying, consulting, design and inspection. In addition, the Academy is entitled to organize overseas study tours and to run international training programs in the planning field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukna.asia/organisation/china-academy-urban-planning-and-design-caupd |title=China Academy of Urban Planning and Design (CAUPD) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Urban Knowledge Network Asia |publisher= |access-date=20 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sci.uoregon.edu/sci-china-partners |title=Partners |last= |first= |date= |website=Sustainable Cities Initiative |publisher=University of Oregon |access-date= 20 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==

CAUPD has four major roles: 
# to offer planning advice for government authorities; 
# to undertake planning studies and compose relevant norms; 
# to provide planning consulting services; and 
# to carry out works for social and public welfare.

==Relationships with other organisations==

CAUPD is authorized by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council to confer [[Master's Degree]]s in Urban Planning and to operate a post-doctorate research station. It also is the backing and sponsoring body of over ten academic organizations such as the [[Urban Planning Society of China]], the Urban Transport Planning Committee of China and the National Network of Scientific and Technological Information in Urban Planning.  The organization routinely sends groups of its employees to the [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs]] in Los Angeles, California to study and participate in social exchanges with master's degree students in Urban Planning.  In a related exchange, masters students in Urban Planning from the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, [[USC Sol Price School of Public Policy]], and [[Portland State University]] have been welcomed to participate in internships in various CAUPD offices. CAUPD has also established links with relevant academic institutions and companies from more than 20 countries in the world. It is the corporate member of the International Federation of Housing and Planning (IFHP).

CAUPD is the corporate member of China International Engineering Consulting Corporation. It is also the national administrative and technical office on planning norms and rail transport codes. Three research centers of MHURD are located in CAUPD: the Urban Transport Center, the Urban Rail and LRT Research Center, the Urban Water Resources Center and Urban Water Quality Inspecting Center.

CAUPD advocates and promotes the ethos of “realistic in spirit, active in thinking and rigorous in style”. In its staff pool of over 550 people, there are two academicians of the Chinese Engineering Academy, one counselor of the State Council, 360 professional workers in which more than 200 people have senior professional titles (including 55 professors).

CAUPD has 3 studios and 12 institutes in Beijing, and 6 branch offices in [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Chongqing]], [[Haikou]], [[Shantou]], and [[Xiamen]].  Its Beijing office is located a No. 5 West Chegongzhuang Road, [[Haidian District]], [[Beijing]], China. Since 1982, the Academy has completed over 3500 planning related projects, in which 50 projects have won national or ministry-level prizes and over 160 projects won provincial prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.devex.com/organizations/chinese-academy-of-urban-planning-design-38594 |title= Chinese Academy of Urban Planning &amp; Design  |last= |first= |date=2017 |website=Devex |publisher= |access-date=20 August 2017 |quote=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">'''Computational irreducibility''' is one of the main ideas proposed by [[Stephen Wolfram]] in his book ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''.

==The idea==
Wolfram terms the inability to shortcut a program (e.g., a [[system]]), or otherwise describe its behavior in a simple way, "computational irreducibility". The [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]] is that the world of simple programs contains a great diversity of [[behavior]], but, because of [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], it is impossible to [[predict]] what they will do before essentially running them. The idea demonstrates that there are occurrences where theory's predictions are effectively not possible. Wolfram states several [[phenomena]] are normally computationally irreducible.

Computational irreducibility explains observed limitations of existing mainstream science. In cases of computational irreducibility, only observation and experiment can be used. Computational irreducibility may also provide a scientifically-based resolution for [[free will]].

==Implications==

* There is no easy theory for any behavior that seems [[Complexity|complex]].
* Complex behavior features can be captured with models that have simple underlying structures.
* An overall system's behavior based on simple structures can still exhibit behavior indescribable by reasonably "simple" laws.

==Analysis==

Israeli and Goldenfeld found that some less complex systems behaved simply and predictably (thus, they allowed [[approximation]]s). However, more complex systems were still computationally irreducible and unpredictable. It is unknown what conditions would allow complex phenomena to be described simply and predictably.

{{Cosmology}}

In [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the '''cosmological constant''' (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter [[lambda]]: Λ) is the energy density of space, or [[vacuum energy]], that arises in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[field equations]] of [[general relativity]]. It is closely associated to the concepts of [[dark energy]] and [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]].&lt;ref name="CC Definition" /&gt; 

Einstein originally introduced the concept in 1917 &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Einstein|1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; to counterbalance the effects of gravity and achieve a [[static universe]], a notion which was the accepted view at the time. Einstein abandoned the concept in 1931 after [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery of the expanding universe.&lt;ref name="Rugh 2001 3"/&gt; From the 1930s until the late 1990s, most physicists assumed the cosmological constant to be equal to zero.&lt;ref name="Λ = 0?"/&gt; That changed with the surprising discovery in 1998 that the [[accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion of the universe is accelerating]], implying the possibility of a positive nonzero value for the cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="1998 Discovery"/&gt; 

Since the 1990s, studies have shown that around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to so-called [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Redd|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmological constant Λ is the simplest possible explanation for dark energy, and is used in the current standard model of cosmology known as the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]]. While dark energy is poorly understood at a fundamental level, the main required properties of dark energy are that it functions as a type of anti-gravity, it dilutes much more slowly than matter as the universe expands, and it clusters much more weakly than matter, or perhaps not at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

According to [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) which underlies modern [[particle physics]], empty space is defined by the [[vacuum state]] which is a collection of [[quantum fields]]. All these quantum fields exhibit fluctuations in their [[ground state]] (lowest energy density) arising from the [[zero-point energy]] present everywhere in space. These zero-point fluctuations should act as a contribution to the cosmological constant Λ, but when calculations are performed these fluctuations give rise to an enormous vacuum energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy between theorized vacuum energy from QFT and observed vacuum energy from cosmology is a source of major contention, with the values predicted exceeding observation by some 120 orders of magnitude, a discrepancy that has been called "the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!".&lt;ref name="CC Problem"/&gt; This issue is called the [[cosmological constant problem]] and it is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science with many physicists believing that "the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature".&lt;ref name="CC Problem 3"/&gt;

== History ==
[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] included the cosmological constant as a term in his [[Einstein field equations|field equations]] for [[general relativity]] because he was dissatisfied that otherwise his equations did not allow, apparently, for a [[static universe]]: gravity would cause a universe that was initially at dynamic equilibrium to contract. To counteract this possibility, Einstein added the cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="Rugh 2001 3"/&gt; However, soon after Einstein developed his static theory, observations by [[Edwin Hubble]] indicated that the universe appears to be expanding; this was consistent with a cosmological solution to the ''original'' general relativity equations that had been found by the mathematician [[Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann|Friedmann]], working on the Einstein equations of general relativity. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to accept the validation of his equations—when they had predicted the expansion of the universe in theory, before it was demonstrated in observation of the cosmological [[red shift]]—as his "biggest blunder".&lt;ref name="Biggest Blunder"/&gt;

In fact, adding the cosmological constant to Einstein's equations does not lead to a static universe at equilibrium because the [[equilibrium point|equilibrium]] is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases [[vacuum energy]], which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe that contracts slightly will continue contracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ryden|2003|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the cosmological constant remained a subject of theoretical and empirical interest. Empirically, the onslaught of cosmological data in the past decades strongly suggests that our universe has a positive cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="1998 Discovery"/&gt;  The explanation of this small but positive value is an outstanding theoretical challenge, the so-called [[cosmological constant problem]].

Some early generalizations of Einstein's gravitational theory, known as [[classical unified field theories]], either introduced a cosmological constant on theoretical grounds or found that it arose naturally from the mathematics. For example, Sir [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] claimed that the cosmological constant version of the vacuum field equation expressed the "[[epistemology|epistemological]]" property that the universe is "self-[[gauge theory|gauging]]", and [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s pure-[[affine connection|affine]] theory using a simple [[History of variational principles in physics|variational principle]] produced the field equation with a cosmological term.

According to current theories of physics, dark energy now dominates as the largest source of energy of the universe, in contrast to earlier epochs when it was insignificant.]]
{{Technical|section|date=March 2014}}
The cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; appears in [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equation]] in the form

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

where the Ricci tensor/scalar [[Ricci tensor|''R'']] and the metric tensor [[metric tensor (general relativity)|''g'']] describe the structure of [[spacetime]], the stress-energy tensor [[stress–energy tensor|''T'']] describes the energy and momentum density and flux of the matter in that point in spacetime, and  the universal constants [[gravitational constant|''G'']] and [[speed of light|''c'']] are conversion factors that arise from using traditional units of measurement. When ''Λ'' is zero, this reduces to the field equation of general relativity usually used in the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century. When ''T'' is zero, the field equation describes empty space (the [[vacuum]]).

The cosmological constant has the same effect as an intrinsic [[energy density]] of the vacuum, ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt; (and an associated [[pressure]]). In this context, it is commonly moved onto the right-hand side of the equation, and defined with a [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] factor of 8''π'': {{nowrap|1=Λ = 8''πρ''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where unit conventions of general relativity are used (otherwise factors of ''G'' and ''c'' would also appear, i.e. {{nowrap|1=Λ = 8''π''(''G''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt; = ''κρ''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''κ'' is [[Einstein's constant]]). It is common to quote values of energy density directly, though still using the name "cosmological constant", with [[Planck units#Gravity|convention]] {{nowrap|1=8''πG'' = 1}}. The true dimension of Λ is a length&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Given the Planck (2018) values of Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|0.6889|0.0056}} and H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|67.66|0.42|u=(km/s)/Mpc}} = {{val|2.1927664|0.0136|e=-18|u=s-1}}, Λ has the value of

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = 1.1056 \times 10^{-52}\, \text{m}^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Λ is evaluated as {{nowrap|3 (''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

or {{val|2.888|e=-122}} in reduced Planck units or {{val|4.33|e=-66}} eV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in natural units.

A positive vacuum energy density resulting from a cosmological constant implies a negative pressure, and vice versa. If the energy density is positive, the associated negative pressure will drive an accelerated expansion of the universe, as observed. (See [[dark energy]] and [[cosmic inflation]] for details.)

===Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; (Omega Lambda)===
Instead of the cosmological constant itself, cosmologists often refer to the ratio between the energy density due to the cosmological constant and the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]] of the universe, the tipping point for a sufficient density to stop the universe from expanding forever. This ratio is usually denoted Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;, and is estimated to be {{val|0.6889|0.0056}}, according to results published by the [[Planck Collaboration]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Planck Collaboration|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a flat universe, Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; is the fraction of the energy of the universe due to the cosmological constant, i.e., what we would intuitively call the fraction of the universe that is made up of dark energy. Note that this value changes over time: the critical density changes with [[cosmological time]], but the energy density due to the cosmological constant remains unchanged throughout the history of the universe: the amount of dark energy increases as the universe grows, while the amount of matter does not.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Equation of state===
Another ratio that is used by scientists is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]], usually denoted ''w'', which is the ratio of pressure that dark energy puts on the universe to the energy per unit volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brumfiel|2007|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio is {{nowrap|''w'' {{=}} &amp;minus;1}} for a true cosmological constant, and is generally different for alternative time-varying forms of vacuum energy such as [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. The Planck Collaboration (2018) has measured ''w'' = {{val|-1.028|0.032}}, consistent with {{val|-1}}, assuming no evolution in ''w'' over cosmic time.

==Positive value==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Observations announced in 1998 of distance–redshift relation for [[Type Ia supernovae]]&lt;ref name="1998 Discovery"/&gt; indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. When combined with measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] these implied a value of Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.7,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{harvp|Baker et al.|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; a result which has been supported and refined by more recent measurements.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Table 9 in {{harvp|The Planck Collaboration|2015a|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other possible causes of an [[accelerating universe]], such as [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], but the cosmological constant is in most respects the [[Occam's razor|simplest solution]]. Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], includes the cosmological constant, which is measured to be on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−52&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, in metric units.  It is often expressed as 10&lt;sup&gt;−35&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;−122&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barrow|Shaw|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other unit systems. The value is based on recent measurements of vacuum energy density, &lt;math&gt; \rho_\text{vacuum} = 5.96 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/m}^3&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Calculated based on the Hubble constant and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; from {{harvp|The Planck Collaboration|2015b}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;−47&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;GeV&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in other unit systems.

As was only recently seen, by works of [[Gerardus 't Hooft|'t Hooft]], [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]] and others, a positive cosmological constant has surprising consequences, such as a finite maximum [[entropy]] of the observable universe (see the [[holographic principle]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson|Kleban|Susskind|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictions==

===&lt;span id="Cosmological constant problem"&gt; Quantum field theory &lt;/span&gt;===
{{see also|Cosmological constant problem}}
{{unsolved|physics|Why does the [[zero-point energy]] of the quantum vacuum not cause a large cosmological constant? What cancels it out?}}
A major outstanding [[Unsolved problems in physics|problem]] is that most [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict a huge value for the [[quantum fluctuation|quantum vacuum]]. A common assumption is that the [[quantum fluctuation|quantum vacuum]] is equivalent to the cosmological constant. Although no theory exists that supports this assumption, arguments can be made in its favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2001|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such arguments are usually based on [[dimensional analysis]] and [[effective field theory]]. If the universe is described by an effective local quantum field theory down to the [[Planck scale]], then we would expect a cosmological constant of the order of &lt;math&gt;M_{\rm pl}^2&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;6\times 10^{54}\, \text{eV}^2&lt;/math&gt; in natural unit or &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in reduced Planck unit). As noted above, the measured cosmological constant is smaller than this by a factor of ~10&lt;sup&gt;−120&lt;/sup&gt;. This discrepancy has been called "the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!".&lt;ref name="CC Problem"/&gt;

Some [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero, which further complicates things. This is the [[cosmological constant problem]], the worst problem of [[fine-tuning]] in [[physics]]: there is no known natural way to derive the tiny cosmological constant used in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] from [[particle physics]].

===Anthropic principle===
One possible explanation for the small but non-zero value was noted by [[Steven Weinberg]] in 1987 following the [[anthropic principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg explains that if the vacuum energy took different values in different domains of the universe, then observers would necessarily measure values similar to that which is observed: the formation of life-supporting structures would be suppressed in domains where the vacuum energy is much larger. Specifically, if the vacuum energy is negative and its absolute value is substantially larger than it appears to be in the observed universe (say, a factor of 10 larger), holding all other variables (e.g. matter density) constant, that would mean that the universe is closed; furthermore, its lifetime would be shorter than the age of our universe, possibly too short for intelligent life to form. On the other hand, a universe with a large positive cosmological constant would expand too fast, preventing galaxy formation. According to Weinberg, domains where the vacuum energy is compatible with life would be comparatively rare. Using this argument, Weinberg predicted that the cosmological constant would have a value of less than a hundred times the currently accepted value.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vilenkin|2006|pages=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Weinberg refined this prediction of the cosmological constant to 5 to 10 times the matter density.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|1992|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument depends on a lack of a variation of the distribution (spatial or otherwise) in the vacuum energy density, as would be expected if dark energy were the cosmological constant. There is no evidence that the vacuum energy does vary, but it may be the case if, for example, the vacuum energy is (even in part) the potential of a scalar field such as the residual [[inflaton]] (also see [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]). Another theoretical approach that deals with the issue is that of [[multiverse]] theories, which predict a large number of "parallel" universes with different laws of physics and/or values of fundamental constants. Again, the anthropic principle states that we can only live in one of the universes that is compatible with some form of intelligent life. Critics claim that these theories, when used as an explanation for fine-tuning, commit the [[inverse gambler's fallacy]].

In 1995, Weinberg's argument was refined by [[Alexander Vilenkin]] to predict a value for the cosmological constant that was only ten times the matter density,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vilenkin|2006|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. about three times the current value since determined.

&lt;ref name="CC Definition"&gt;It may well be that [[dark energy]] is explained by a static cosmological constant, or that this mysterious energy is not constant at all and has changed over time, as in the case with [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], see for example:
* "Physics invites the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein’s cosmological constant, Λ; nowadays the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence." {{harvp|Peebles|Ratra|2003|p=1}}
* "It would then appear that the cosmological fluid is dominated by some sort of fantastic energy density, which has negative pressure, and has just begun to play an important role today. No convincing theory has yet been constructed to explain this state of affairs, although cosmological models based on a dark energy component, such as the cosmological constant (Λ) or quintessence (Q),are leading candidates." {{harvp|Caldwell|2002|p=2}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name="Rugh 2001 3"&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Λ = 0?"&gt;On the Cosmological Constant being thought to have zero value see for example:
*"Since the cosmological upper bound on &lt;math&gt;|\left \langle  \rho \right \rangle + \lambda /8 \pi G |&lt;/math&gt; was vastly less than any value expected from particle theory, most particle theorists simply assumed that for some unknown reason this quantity was zero." {{harvp|Weinberg|1989|p=3}}
* "An epochal astronomical discovery would be to establish by convincing observation that Λ is nonzero."{{harvp|Carroll|Press|Turner|1992|p=500}}
* "Before 1998, there was no direct astronomical evidence for Λ and the observational upper bound was so strong – Λ &lt; 10−120 Planck units –that many particle physicists suspected that some fundamental principle must force its value to be precisely zero." {{harvp|Barrow|Shaw|2011|p=1}}
* "The only other natural value is Λ = 0. If Λ really is tiny but not zero, it adds a most stimulating though enigmatic clue to physics to be discovered." {{harvp|Peebles|Ratra|2003|p=333}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="1998 Discovery"&gt;See for example:
* "This is the independent result of two teams. [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] ({{harvp|Perlmutter et al.|1999}}; also see {{harvp|Perlmutter et al.|1998}}) and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]] ({{harvp|Riess et al.|1998}}; also see {{harvp|Schmidt et al.|1998}})" {{harvp|Weinberg|2015|p=376}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Biggest Blunder"&gt;There is some debate over whether Einstein labelled the cosmological constant his “biggest blunder”, with all references being traced back to a single person, [[George Gamow]] (See {{harvs|txt|last1=Gamow|year1=1956|year2=1970}}) . For example:
* "Astrophysicist and author Mario Livio can find no documentation that puts those words into Einstein's mouth (or, for that matter, his pen). Instead, all references eventually lead back to one man, physicist George Gamow, who reported Einstein's use of the phrase in two sources: his posthumously published autobiography My World Line (1970) and a Scientific American article from September 1956." {{harvp|Rosen|2013}}
* " We also find it quite plausible that Einstein made such a statement to Gamow in particular. We conclude that there is little doubt that Einstein came to view the introduction of the cosmological constant a serious error, and that it is very plausible that he labelled the term his “biggest blunder” on at least one occasion" {{harvp|O'Raifeartaigh|Mitton|2018|p=1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="CC Problem"&gt;See for example:
*"Theoretical expectations for the cosmological constant exceed observational limits by some 120 orders of magnitude." {{harvp|Weinberg|1989|p=1}}
*"This, as we will see later, is approximately 120 orders of magnitude larger then what is allowed by observation." {{harvp|Carroll|Press|Turner|1992|p=503}}
*"This gives an answer about 120 orders of magnitude higher than the upper limits on Λ set by cosmological observations. This is probably the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!" {{harvp|Hobson|Efstathiou|Lasenby|2006|p=187}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="CC Problem 3"&gt;See for example:
*"the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature" {{harvp|Davies|1985|p=104}}
*"The theoretical problem of explaining the cosmological constant is one of the greatest challenges of theoretical physics. It is most likely that we require a fully developed theory of quantum gravity (perhaps superstring theory) before we can understand Λ." {{harvp|Hobson|Efstathiou|Lasenby|2006|p=188}}

'''Depression glass''' is clear or colored translucent machine made glassware that was distributed free, or at low cost, in the United States and Canada around the time of the [[Great Depression]]. 

==History==
Much depression glass is [[uranium glass]]. The [[Quaker Oats Company]], and other food manufacturers and distributors, put a piece of glassware in boxes of food, as an incentive to purchase. Some movie theaters and businesses handed out pieces to patrons.

Most of this glassware was made in the Ohio River Valley of the United States, where access to raw materials and power made manufacturing inexpensive in the first half of the twentieth century. More than twenty manufacturers made more than 100 patterns, and entire dinner sets were made in some patterns. Common colors are clear (crystal), pink, pale blue, green, and amber. Less common colors include yellow (canary), ultramarine, [[Jadeite (kitchenware)|jadeite]] (opaque pale green), delphite (opaque pale blue), cobalt blue, red (ruby and royal ruby), black, amethyst, monax, and white (milk glass).

Although of marginal quality, Depression glass has been highly collectible since the 1960s. Due to its popularity as a [[collectible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/east-jefferson/index.ssf/2011/03/crescent_city_depression_glass.html|title=Crescent City Depression glass show to be held in Kenner|publisher=The Times-Picayune |date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is becoming more scarce on the open market. Rare pieces may sell for several hundred dollars. Some manufacturers continued to make popular patterns after World War II, or introduced similar patterns, which are also collectible. Popular and expensive patterns and pieces have been reproduced, and reproductions are still being made.

==Elegant glass==
Often confused with Depression glass is [[Elegant glass]], which is of much better quality. It was distributed through jewelry and department stores from the 1920s through the 1950s, and was an alternative to fine china. Most of the Elegant glassware manufacturers had closed by the end of the 1950s, when cheap glassware and imported china replaced Elegant glass.

Some Elegant glass manufacturers were:

*[[Consolidated Lamp and Glass Company]]
*[[Duncan Miller Glass Company]]
*[[Fenton Art Glass Company]]
*[[Fostoria Glass Company]]
*[[Heisey Glass Company]]

'''Joseph Ernest Renan''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁənɑ̃|lang}}; 28 February 1823&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;2 October 1892)&lt;ref&gt;{{wsPSM|Notes &amp; Obituary Notes|42|December 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French expert of [[Semitic languages]] and civilizations ([[philology]]), [[philosopher]], [[historian]], and writer, devoted to his native province of [[Brittany]]. He is best known for his influential historical works on [[early Christianity]], and his [[political theory|political]] theories, especially concerning [[nationalism]] and [[national identity]]. Renan is credited as being among the first scholars to advance the [[Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry|Khazar theory]], which held that [[Ashkenazi Jews]] were descendants of the [[Khazars]], Turkic peoples who had adopted Jewish religion and migrated to Western Europe following the collapse of their [[khanate]].

==Life==

===Birth and family===
[[File:Maison Musée Ernest Renan Tréguier.jpg|thumb|Ernest Renan birthplace museum in [[Tréguier]]]]
He was born at [[Tréguier]] in Brittany to a family of fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Alfred (1924). "Renan: The Man," ''The Catholic Historical Review'', Vol. 10, No. 3, pp. 388-398.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, having made a small fortune with his fishing-shack, bought a house at Tréguier and settled there, and his father, captain of a small cutter and an ardent [[republicanism|republican]], married the daughter of a Royalist tradesman from the neighbouring town of [[Lannion]]. All his life, Renan was aware of the conflict between his father's and his mother's political beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} He was five years old when his father died, and his sister, Henriette, twelve years his senior, became the moral head of the household. Having in vain attempted to keep a school for girls at Tréguier, she departed and went to [[Paris, France|Paris]] as a teacher in a young ladies' boarding-school.

===Education===
Ernest, meanwhile, was educated in the ecclesiastical seminary of his native town.&lt;ref&gt;Loth, Joseph (1892). "Renan au Collège de Tréguier," ''Annales de Bretagne'' '''8''' (1), pp. 124-9.&lt;/ref&gt; His school reports describe him as "docile, patient, diligent, painstaking, thorough". While the priests taught him mathematics and Latin, his mother completed his education. Renan's mother was half [[Breton people|Breton]]. Her paternal ancestors came from [[Bordeaux]], and Renan used to say that in his own nature the [[Gascony|Gascon]] and the Breton were constantly at odds.&lt;ref&gt;[[René Galand|Galand, René]] (1959). ''L'Âme Celtique de Renan''. Presses Universitaires de France.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1838, Renan won all the prizes at the college of Tréguier. His sister told the doctor of the school in Paris where she taught about her brother, and he informed [[Félix Dupanloup|F.A.P. Dupanloup]], who was involved in organizing the ecclesiastical college of St [[Nicholas du Chardonnet]], a school in which the young Catholic nobility and the most talented pupils of the Catholic seminaries were to be educated together, with the idea of creating friendships between the aristocracy and the priesthood. Dupanloup sent for Renan, who was only fifteen years old and had never been outside [[Brittany]]. "I learned with stupor that knowledge was not a privilege of the church ... I awoke to the meaning of the words talent, fame, celebrity." Religion seemed to him wholly different in Tréguier and in Paris. The superficial, brilliant, pseudo-scientific Catholicism of the capital did not satisfy Renan, who had accepted the austere faith of his Breton masters.

===Study at Issy-les Moulineaux===
In 1840, Renan left St Nicholas to study philosophy at the seminary of [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]]. He entered with a passion for Catholic [[scholasticism]]. The rhetoric of St Nicholas had wearied him, and his serious intelligence hoped to satisfy itself with the vast and solid material of Catholic [[theology]]. [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] first attracted him among the philosophers, and, after these, he turned to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|J. G. Herder]]. Renan began to see an essential contradiction between the [[metaphysics]] which he studied and the faith he professed, but an appetite for truths that can be verified restrained his scepticism. "Philosophy excites and only half satisfies the appetite for truth; I am eager for mathematics", he wrote to Henriette. Henriette had accepted in the family of Count [[Zamoyski]] an engagement more lucrative than her former job. She exercised the strongest influence over her brother.

===Study at college of St Sulpice===
It was not mathematics but [[philology]] which was to settle Renan's gathering doubts. His course completed at Issy, he entered the college of St Sulpice in order to take his degree in philology prior to entering the church, and, here, he began the study of Hebrew.  He realized that the second part of the ''[[Book of Isaiah]]'' differs from the first not only in style but in date, that the grammar and the history of the ''[[Pentateuch]]'' are later than the time of [[Moses]], and that the ''[[Book of Daniel]]'' is clearly written centuries after the time in which it is set. Secretly, Renan felt himself denied the [[communion of saints]], yet desired to live the life of a Catholic priest. The struggle between vocation and conviction was won by conviction. In October 1845, Renan left St Sulpice for Stanislas, a lay college of the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratorians]]. Still feeling too much under the domination of the church, he reluctantly ended the last of his associations with religious life and entered M. Crouzet's school for boys as a teacher.

===Scholarly career===
[[File:Joseph Ernest Renan, by F. Mulnier.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Joseph Ernest Renan, by F. Mulnier]]
Renan, educated by priests, was to accept the scientific ideal with an extraordinary expansion of all his faculties. He became ravished by the splendor of the cosmos. At the end of his life, he wrote of [[Henri-Frédéric Amiel|Amiel]], "The man who has time to keep a private diary has never understood the immensity of the universe." The certitudes of physical and natural science were revealed to Renan in 1846 by the chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]], then a boy of eighteen, his pupil at M. Crouzet's school. To the day of Renan's death, their friendship continued. Renan was occupied as usher only during evenings. During the daytime, he continued his researches in [[Semitic languages|Semitic philology]]. In 1847, he obtained the [[Volney prize]], one of the principal distinctions awarded by the [[Academy of Inscriptions]], for the manuscript of his "General History of Semitic Languages." In 1847, he took his degree as ''Agrégé de Philosophie'' – that is to say, fellow of the university – and was offered a job as master in the ''lycée'' [[Vendôme]].

In 1856, Ernest Renan married in Paris Cornélie Scheffer, daughter of [[Hendrik Scheffer]] and niece of [[Ary Scheffer]], both French painters of Dutch descent. They had two children, [[Ary Renan]], born in 1858, who became a painter, and Noémi, born in 1862, who eventually married [[Yannis Psycharis]].

====''Life of Jesus''====
Within his lifetime, Renan was best known as the author of the enormously popular ''Life of Jesus'' (''Vie de Jésus'', 1863).&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Terence R. (1994). "The Letter and the Spirit: Deconstructing Renan's "Life of Jesus" and the Assumptions of Modernity," ''Religion &amp; Literature'', Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 55-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Alan (2000). "The Cultural Impact of Science in France: Ernest Renan and the Vie de Jésus," ''The Historical Journal'', Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 79-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Renan attributed the idea of the book to his sister, Henriette, with whom he was traveling in [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman Syria and Palestine]] when, struck with a fever, she died suddenly.  With only a [[New Testament]] and copy of [[Josephus]] as references, he began writing.&lt;ref&gt;Hammerton, J.A. (1937). ''Outline of Great Books'', New York: Wise &amp; Co., p. 998.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was first translated into English in the year of its publication by [[Charles E. Wilbour]] and has remained in print for the past 145 years.&lt;ref&gt;As of this writing, [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24540192/editions?editionsView=true&amp;start_edition=1&amp;se=yr&amp;sd=asc&amp;qt=sort_yr_asc WorldCat reports 115 different editions] of the book [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24540192&amp;referer=brief_results in 1426 different libraries].&lt;/ref&gt; Renan's ''Life of Jesus'' was lavished with ironic praise and criticism by [[Albert Schweitzer]] in his book ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, William (1992). ''History of New Testament Research: From Deism to Tubingen''. Augsburg: Fortress Press, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renan claimed Jesus was able to purify himself of [[Jewish traits]] and that Jesus became an [[Aryan]], his ''Life of Jesus'' promoted racial ideas and infused race into theology and the person of Jesus, he depicted Jesus as a [[Galilea]]n who was transformed from a Jew into a Christian, and that Christianity emerged purified of any Jewish influences.&lt;ref name="Heschel2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susannah Heschel|title=The Aryan Jesus: christian theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiCJeNJIhoAC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=31 May 2013|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12531-2|page=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was based largely on the Gospel of John, and was a scholarly work.&lt;ref name="Heschel2008"/&gt;  It depicted Jesus as a man but not God, and rejected the miracles of the Gospel.&lt;ref name="Heschel2008"/&gt; Renan believed by humanizing Jesus he was restoring to him a greater dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Chadbourne, Richard M. (1968). ''Ernest Renan''. New York: Twayne Publishers, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's controversial assertions that the [[life of Jesus]] should be written like the life of any historic person, and that the Bible could and should be subject to the same critical scrutiny as other historical documents caused some controversy&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dublinreview27unkngoog#page/n396/mode/2up "Renan's 'Vie de Jesus',"] ''The Dublin Review'' '''2''', January/April 1864, pp. 386-419.&lt;/ref&gt; and enraged many Christians,&lt;ref&gt;Jules Théodose Loyson ''[https://archive.org/details/uneprtenduevied00loysgoog Une prétendue Vie de Jésus, ou M.

===Continuation of scholarly career: social views===
Renan was not only a scholar. In his book on [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], as in the [[Apostles]], he shows his concern with the larger social life, his sense of fraternity, and a revival of the democratic sentiment which had inspired ''L'Avenir de la Science''. In 1869, he presented himself as the candidate of the liberal opposition at the parliamentary election for [[Meaux]]. While his temper had become less aristocratic, his liberalism had grown more tolerant. On the eve of its dissolution, Renan was half prepared to accept the Empire, and, had he been elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he would have joined the group of ''l'Empire liberal'', but he was not elected. A year later, war was declared with Germany; the Empire was abolished, and [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] became an exile. The [[Franco-Prussian War]] was a turning-point in Renan's history. Germany had always been to him the asylum of thought and disinterested science. Now, he saw the land of his ideal destroy and ruin the land of his birth; he beheld the German no longer as a priest, but as an invader.
[[File:ErnestRenan.jpg|thumb|left|Ernest Renan in his study by [[Anders Zorn]]]]

In ''La Réforme Intellectuelle et Morale'' (1871), Renan tried to safeguard France's future. Yet, he was still influenced by Germany. The ideal and the discipline which he proposed to his defeated country were those of her conqueror—a feudal society, a monarchical government, an elite which the rest of the nation exists merely to support and nourish; an ideal of honor and duty imposed by a chosen few on the recalcitrant and subject multitude. The errors attributed to the ''Commune'' confirmed Renan in this reaction. At the same time, the irony always perceptible in his work grows more bitter. His ''Dialogues Philosophiques'', written in 1871, his ''[[Ecclesiastes]]'' (1882) and his ''Antichrist'' (1876) (the fourth volume of the ''Origins of Christianity'', dealing with the reign of [[Nero]]) are incomparable in their literary genius{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}, but they are examples of a disenchanted and sceptical temper. He had vainly tried to make his country obey his precepts. The progress of events showed him, on the contrary, a France which, every day, left a little stronger, and he roused himself from his disbelieving, disillusioned mood and observed with interest the struggle for justice and liberty of a democratic society. The fifth and sixth volumes of the ''Origins of Christianity'' (the Christian Church and [[Marcus Aurelius]]) show him reconciled with democracy, confident in the gradual ascent of man, aware that the greatest catastrophes do not really interrupt the sure if imperceptible progress of the world and reconciled, also, if not with the truths, at least with the moral beauties of Catholicism and with the remembrance of his pious youth.

====Definition of nationhood====
Renan's definition of a [[nation-state|nation]] has been extremely influential. This was given in his 1882 discourse ''[[What is a Nation?|Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]'' ("What is a Nation?"). Whereas German writers like [[Fichte]] had defined the nation by [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] criteria such as a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or an [[ethnic group]] "sharing common characteristics" (language, etc.), Renan defined it by the desire of a people to live together, which he summarized by a famous phrase, "avoir fait de grandes choses ensemble, vouloir en faire encore" (having done great things together and wishing to do more). Writing in the midst of the dispute concerning the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region, he declared that the existence of a nation was based on a "daily [[plebiscite]]." Some authors criticize that definition, based on a "daily plebiscite", because of the ambiguity of the concept. They argue that this definition is an idealization and it should be interpreted within the German tradition and not in opposition to it. They say that the arguments used by Renan at the conference '' What is a Nation? '' are not consistent with his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]] ''. Historia, arraza, nazioa ''. Donostia: Elkar, 2014. {{ISBN|978-84-9027-297-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Deutsch]] (in "Nationalism and its alternatives") suggested that a nation is "a group of people united by a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of their neighbors." This phrase is frequently, but mistakenly, attributed to Renan himself. He did indeed write that if "the essential element of a nation is that all its individuals must have many things in common", they "must also have forgotten many things. Every French citizen must have forgotten the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|night of St. Bartholomew]] and the [[Albigensian Crusade|massacres in the 13th century in the South]]." Renan's work has especially influenced 20th century theorist of nationalism, [[Benedict Anderson]].

===Late scholarly career===
[[File:Renan in his Study in the College of France.jpg|thumb|Renan in his study in the College of France]]
[[File:Caricature of Ernest Renan, Vanity Fair.jpg|right|thumb|Renan caricatured by GUTH in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1910]]
Shifting away from his pessimism regarding liberalism's prospects during the 1870s while still believing in the necessity of an intellectual elite to influence democratic society for the good, Renan rallied to support the [[French Third Republic]], humorously describing himself as a ''légitimiste'', that is, a person who needs "about ten years to accustom myself to regarding any government as legitimate," and adding "I, who am not a republican ''a priori'', who am a simple Liberal quite willing to adjust myself to a constitutional monarchy, would be more loyal to the Republic than newly converted republicans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=David C. J. |title=Ernest Renan |date=1996 |publisher=Ardent Media |pages=97-99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progress of the sciences under the Republic and the latitude given to the freedom of thought that Renan cherished above all had allayed many of his previous fears, and he opposed the deterministic and fatalist theories of philosophers like [[Hippolyte Taine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=David C. J. |title=Ernest Renan |date=1996 |publisher=Ardent Media |pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Noronha-DiVanna |first1=Isabel |title=Writing History in the Third Republic |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he got older, the philosopher contemplated his childhood. He was nearly sixty when, in 1883, he published the autobiographical ''Souvenirs d'Enfance et de Jeunesse'', the work by which he is now best known in France.

They showed the blasé modern reader that a world no less poetic, no less primitive than that of the ''Origins of Christianity'' exists or still existed within living memory on the northwestern coast of France. They have the [[Celt]]ic magic of ancient romance and the simplicity, the naturalness, and the veracity which the 19th century prized so highly. But his ''Ecclesiastes'', published a few months earlier, his ''Drames Philosophiques'', collected in 1888, give a more adequate image of his fastidious critical, disenchanted, yet optimistic spirit. They show the attitude towards uncultured Socialism of a philosopher liberal by conviction, by temperament an aristocrat. We learn in them how [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] (democracy), the mindless brute, educated to his own responsibility, makes after all an adequate ruler; how [[Prospero]] (the aristocratic principle, or, if we will, the mind) accepts his dethronement for the sake of greater liberty in the intellectual world, since Caliban proves an effective policeman and leaves his superiors a free hand in the laboratory; how [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] (the religious principle) acquires a firmer hold on life and no longer gives up the ghost at the faintest hint of change. Indeed, Ariel flourishes in the service of Prospero under the external government of the many-headed brute. Religion and knowledge are as imperishable as the world they dignify. Thus, out of the depths rises unvanquished the essential [[idealism]] of Renan.

Renan was a great worker. At sixty years of age, having finished the ''Origins of Christianity'', he began his ''History of [[Israel]]'', based on a lifelong study of the ''[[Old Testament]]'' and on the ''Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum'', published by the [[Académie des Inscriptions]] under Renan's direction from the year 1881 till the end of his life. The first volume of the ''History of Israel'' appeared in 1887; the third, in 1891; the last two posthumously. As a history of facts and theories, the book has many faults; as an essay on the evolution of the religious idea, it is (despite some passages of frivolity, irony, or incoherence) of extraordinary importance{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}; as a reflection of the mind of Renan, it is the most lifelike of images. In a volume of collected essays, ''Feuilles Détachées'', published also in 1891, we find the same mental attitude, an affirmation of the necessity of [[piety]] independent of [[dogma]]. During his last years, he received many honors, and was made an administrator of the [[Collège de France]] and grand officer of the [[Legion of Honor]]. Two volumes of the ''History of Israel'', his correspondence with his sister Henriette, his ''Letters to M. Berthelot'', and the ''History of the Religious Policy of [[Philip IV of France|Philippe-le-Bel]]'', which he wrote in the years immediately before his marriage, all appeared during the last eight years of the 19th century.

Renan died after a few days' illness in 1892 in Paris, and was buried in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]] in the [[Montmartre Quarter]].

==Reputation and controversies==
Hugely influential in his lifetime, Renan was eulogised after his death as the embodiment of the progressive spirit in western culture. [[Anatole France]] wrote that Renan was the incarnation of modernity. Renan's works were read and appreciated by many of the leading literary figures of the time, including [[James Joyce]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Edith Wharton]], and [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singley |first1=Carol J. |title=Race, culture, nation: Edith Wharton and Ernest Renan |journal=Twentieth Century Literature |date=2003 |volume=49 |issue=1 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Richard |title=James Joyce and Sexuality |date=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his greatest admirers was [[Manuel González Prada]] in [[Peru]] who took the ''Life of Jesus'' as a basis for his anticlericalism. In his 1932 document "[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]", Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] also applauded perceived "prefascist intuitions" in a section of Renan's "Meditations" that argued against democracy and individual rights as "[[Chimera (mythology)|chimerical]]" and intrinsically opposed to "nature's plans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini] Complete text of the essay "''Dottrina''" (Doctrines).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statue===
[[File:Renan12.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Ernest Renan in Tréguier town square]]
In 1903 a major controversy accompanied the installation of a monument in Tréguier designed by [[Jean Boucher (artist)|Jean Boucher]]. Placed in the local cathedral square, it was interpreted as a challenge to Catholicism, and led to widespread protests, especially because the site was normally used for the temporary pulpit erected at the traditional Catholic festival of the [[Pardon (ceremony)|Pardon of St Yves]]. It also included the Greek goddess [[Athena]] raising her arm to crown Renan gesturing in apparent challenge towards the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeanboucher.net/?d=monuments&amp;p=ernest_renan Ernest Renan à Tréguier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue, ''Ernest Renan (1823–1892) un Celte en Orient'', Musée d’Art et d’histoire, Musée de Bretagne, 1992, Ville de Saint-Brieuc, Ville de Rennes.&lt;/ref&gt; The local clergy organised a protest [[Calvary (sculpture)|Calvary sculpture]] designed by [[Yves Hernot]] as "a symbol of the triumphant [[ultramontane|ultramontaine]] church."

===Views on race===
Renan believed that racial characteristics were instinctual and [[deterministic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Olender|Olender, Maurice]] (1992). ''The Languages of Paradise: Race, Religion, and Philology in the Nineteenth Century''. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heschel20081"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susannah Heschel|title=The Aryan Jesus: christian theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiCJeNJIhoAC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=31 May 2013|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12531-2|page=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been criticised for his [[antisemitic]] claims that the [[Semitic race]] is inferior to the [[Aryan race]].&lt;ref&gt;"I am therefore the first to recognize that the Semitic race, compared to the Indo-European race, truly represents an inferior combination of human nature."—Arvidsson, Stefan (2006). ''Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science''. University of Chicago Press, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Renan claimed that the Semitic mind was limited by dogmatism and lacked a cosmopolitan conception of civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;"The Racial Motif in Renan's Attitude to Jews and Judaism", in: S. Almog (ed.), ''Antisemitism Through the Ages'', Oxford, 1988, pp. 255–278.&lt;/ref&gt; For Renan, Semites were "an incomplete race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A#4621 Anti-Semitism, by Gotthard Deutsch, ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors argue that Renan developed his antisemitism from [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] anti-Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]] (2014). ''Historia, arraza, nazioa''. Donostia: Elkar. pp.177-86. {{ISBN|978-84-9027-297-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he did not regard the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] of Europe as being a Semitic people; Renan is credited with launching the so-called [[Khazar theory]]. This theory states that Ashkenazim had their origin in Turkic refugees that had converted to Judaism and later migrated from the collapsed [[Khazar Khanate]] westward into the [[Rhineland]], and exchanged their native [[Khazar language]] for the [[Yiddish language]] while continuing to practice the Jewish religion. In his 1883 lecture "Le Judaïsme comme race et comme Religion" he disputed the concept that [[Jewish people]] constitute a unified racial entity in a ''biological'' sense,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lejudasmecommer00renagoog#page/n9/mode/2up ''Le Judaïsme comme Race et comme Religion: Conférence faite au Cercle Saint-Simon'']. Paris: Calmann Lévy, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; which made his views unpalatable within [[racial antisemitism]]. Renan was also known for being a strong critic of [[German nationalism|German ethnic nationalism]], with its antisemitic undertones.&lt;ref&gt;Mian, Aristide (1945-46). "Renan on War and Peace," ''The American Scholar'', Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 90-96.&lt;/ref&gt; His notions of race and ethnicity were completely at odds with the European antisemitism of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Renan wrote the following about the long history of [[persecution of Jews]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When all nations and all ages have persecuted you, there must be some motive behind it all. The Jew, up to our own time, insinuated himself everywhere, claiming the protection of the common law; but, in reality, remaining outside the common law. He retained his own status; he wished to have the same guarantees as everyone else, and, over and above that, his own exceptions and special laws. He desired the advantages of the nations without being a nation, without helping to bear the burdens of the nations. No people has ever been able to tolerate this. The nations are military creations founded and maintained by the sword; they are the work of peasants and soldiers; towards establishing them the Jews have contributed nothing. Herein is the great fallacy inspired in Israelite pretensions. The tolerated alien can be useful to a country, but only on condition that the country does not allow itself to be invaded by him. It is not fair to claim family rights in a house which one has not built, like those birds which come and take up their quarters in a nest which does not belong to them, or like the crustaceans which steal the shell of another species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/renansantichrist00renaiala#page/n3/mode/2up ''Antichrist'']. London: Walter Scott, Ltd., 1900, pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, during the 1880s, Renan shifted away from these views. In a lecture on "Judaism as a Race and as a Religion", he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When, in 1791, the National Assembly decreed the emancipation of the Jews, it concerned itself very little with race. It considered that men ought to be judged, not by the blood that runs in their veins, but by their moral and intellectual value. It is the glory of France to take these questions by their human side. The work of the nineteenth century is to tear down every ghetto, and I have no praise for those who seek to rebuild them. The Israelite race has in the past rendered the greatest services to the world. Blended with the different nations, in harmony with the diverse national unities of Europe, it will continue to do in the future what it has done in the past. By its collaboration with all the liberal forces of Europe, it will contribute eminently to the social progress of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Paul Lawrence |title=Renan versus Gobineau: Semitism and Antisemitism, Ancient Races and Modern Liberal Nations |journal=History of European Ideas |date=2013 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=528-540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gidley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gidley |first1=Ben |title=On the Nation and the 'Jewish People' |journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies |date=2011 |volume=35 |issue=4 |page=782-783 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.2011.643817?journalCode=rers20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in 1883, in a lecture called "The Original Identity and Gradual Separation of Judaism and Christianity":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Judaism, which has served so well in the past, will still serve in the future. It will serve the true cause of liberalism, of the modern spirit. Every Jew is a liberal ... The enemies of Judaism, however, if you only look at them more closely, you will see that they are the enemies of the modern spirit in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trawny |first1=Peter |title=Heidegger, “World Judaism,” and Modernity |journal=Gatherings: The Heidegger Circle Annual |date=2015 |volume=5 |page=1-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other comments on race, have also proven controversial, especially his belief that political policy should take into account supposed racial differences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nature has made a race of workers, the Chinese race, who have wonderful manual dexterity and almost no sense of honor... A race of tillers of the soil, the Negro; treat him with kindness and humanity, and all will be as it should; a race of masters and soldiers, the European race. Reduce this noble race to working in the [[ergastula|ergastulum]] like Negroes and Chinese, and they rebel... But the life at which our workers rebel would make a Chinese or a [[fellaheen|fellah]] happy, as they are not military creatures in the least. Let each one do what he is made for, and all will be well.&lt;ref&gt;From Ernest Renan, "La Reforme Intellectuelle et Morale". Paris: Calmann-Levy, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This passage, among others, was cited by [[Aimé Césaire]] in his ''Discourse on Colonialism'', as evidence of the alleged hypocrisy of Western humanism and its "sordidly racist" conception of the rights of man.&lt;ref&gt;Césaire, Aimé (2000). ''[[Discourse on Colonialism]]'', Joan Pinkham, trans. New York: Monthly Review Press, pp. 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Shlomo Sand]] has argued for a more complex assessment of Renan's legacy, pointing out that the anti-essentialist arguments found in Renan's later writings and lectures provided tools with which to combat and deconstruct the racialist ideas he had advocated earlier.&lt;ref name="Gidley" /&gt;

===Republican racism===
During the arising of racism theories around Europe and specifically in France—[[French Republic (1870–1940)]]—Renan had an important influence on the matter. He was a defender of people's self-determination concept,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/poetryofcelticra00renauoft#page/60/mode/2up "What is a Nation?"] In: ''The Poetry of the Celtic Races, and Other Essays''. London: The Walter Scott Publishing Co., 1896, pp. 61-83.&lt;/ref&gt; but on the other hand was in fact convinced of a "racial hierarchy of peoples" that he said was "established".&lt;ref&gt;Preface to [https://archive.org/stream/futureofsciencei00rena#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Future of Science'']. London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; Discursively, he subordinated the principle of self-determination of peoples to a racial hierarchy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/futureofsciencei00rena#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Future of Science'']. London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. he supported the colonialist expansion and the racist view of the Third Republic because he believed the French to be hierarchically superior (in a racial matter) to the African nations.&lt;ref&gt;Manceron, Gilles (2005). ''Marianne et les Colonies: Une Introduction à l'Histoire Coloniale de la France''. Editions La Découverte.&lt;/ref&gt; This subtle racism, called by [[:fr:Gilles Manceron|Gilles Manceron]] "Republican racism"&lt;ref&gt;Manceron (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; was common in France during the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], and was also a well-known defensing discourse in politics. Supporters of colonialism used the concept of cultural superiority, and described themselves as "protectors of civilization" to justify their colonial actions and territorial expansion.

A '''floral zone''' is an area with similar distributions of plant species, usually a horizontal belt determined by elevation.&lt;ref name=DVE&gt;Death Valley Expedition (1891), Historic Expeditions, Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, [http://www.botany.si.edu/colls/expeditions/expedition_page.cfm?ExpedName=3]&lt;/ref&gt; In a historic report on plant distribution in the United States, ''[[The Death Valley Expedition: A Biological Survey of Parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah]]", naturalist [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] describes ''“Most of the desert shrubs are social plants and are distributed in well-marked belts or zones, the vertical limits of which are fixed by the temperature during the period of growth and reproduction.”''&lt;ref name=DVE/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6588">The '''Futures of American Studies''' is a weeklong academic summer institute dedicated to presenting new work and critiquing the field of [[American Studies]] held at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. The first Futures of American Studies Institute was held in the summer of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;The Futures of American Studies. http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald E. Pease]], Professor of English at Dartmouth College, founded, organizes, and directs the annual Institute.&lt;ref&gt;''Futures of American Studies,'' Edited by Donald E. Pease, Robyn Wiegman, Duke University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8223-2957-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of the Institute==
After the [[School of Criticism and Theory]] left Dartmouth for [[Cornell University]] in 1995, Dartmouth faculty member Donald E. Pease started the Futures Institute as an alternative summer program for faculty and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures/about/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Futures Institute celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its founding.

==Institute Description==
The Institute is divided into two daily plenary sessions, which feature current work from Institute faculty, and multiple three-hour research seminars in which all participants present and discuss their own work-in-progress. Speakers in the plenary sessions typically examine the relation between emergent and residual practices in the field of American Studies from a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives. Participants come from a variety of programs and schools and represent fields as diverse as American history, social geography, American literature, gender studies, and the digital humanities. The Institute welcomes participants who are involved in a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields and who are interested in current critical debates in American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">'''Genetic exceptionalism''' is the belief that genetic information is special and so must be treated differently from other types of medical data or other personally identifiable information.  

For example, patients are able to obtain information about their [[blood pressure]] without involving any medical professionals, but to obtain information about their genetic profile might require an order from a physician and expensive counseling sessions. Disclosure of an individual's genetic information or its meaning, such as telling a woman with red hair that she has a higher risk of skin cancer, has been legally restricted in some places, as providing [[medical advice]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Turna. 18 August 2010.  [http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/uc-berkeley-halts-genetic-testing-program-touts-opportunity-ethical-debate UC Berkeley Halts Genetic Testing Program, but Touts Opportunity for Ethical Debate] ''Pharmacogenomics Reporter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

That policy approach has been taken by state legislatures to safeguard individuals' genetic information in the [[United States]] from individuals, their families, their employers, and the government. The approach builds upon the existing protection required of general health information provided by such laws as the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]].

== Expert Debate ==

There is ongoing debate over whether or when certain genetic information should be considered exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=James P|last2=Burke|first2=Wylie|date=July 2008|title=Genetic exceptionalism. Too much of a good thing?|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1097/GIM.0b013e31817f280a|journal=Genetics in Medicine|language=En|volume=10|issue=7|pages=500–501|doi=10.1097/gim.0b013e31817f280a|issn=1098-3600}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the predictive power of genetic information (such as a risk for a disease like [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]], which is highly penetrant) may justify special considerations for genetic exceptionalism, in that individuals with a high risk for developing this condition may face a certain amount of discrimination. However, for most common human health conditions, a specific genetic variant only plays a partial role, interacting with other genetic variants and environmental and lifestyle influences to contribute to disease development. In these cases, genetic information is often considered similarly to other medical and lifestyle data, such as smoking status, age, or [[Biomarker|biomarkers]].

'''Genital jewellery''', also known as '''sex jewellery''' and '''adult jewellery''', is [[jewellery]] which is designed specifically for wear on or to accentuate the [[genital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d0NRAyl-2EEC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=%22genital%20jewellery%22&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=%22genital%20jewellery%22&amp;f=false Judith Green, Ronald N. Labonté (2007) ''Critical perspectives in public health''], pp198, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-40952-7}} Retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;   In a wider sense also [[Nipple shield (jewelry)|nipple rings]] and some [[butt-plug]]s may be called genital jewellery.

Genital jewellery includes [[cock ring]]s and [[Labia piercing|vaginal jewellery]] as well as [[anal piercing]]s. These items often blur the line between jewellery and [[sex toys]]. Genital jewellery is available for men and women and some models may be worn by both sexes. While some genital piercings have been around since at least Victorian times (e.g. [[Prince Albert piercing]] jewellery), a recent increase in popularity and social acceptance has resulted in the fusion between function and [[fashion]] that is sex jewellery.

The practice is not new, however, with genital piercings, designed to stimulate as well as to decorate, being described as early as 300 in ''The Kama Sutra''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DuNTznUH8ZkC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=%22genital%20jewellery%22&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=%22genital%20jewellery%22&amp;f=false Guy N.

Wearing genital jewellery in nudist resorts may sometimes be considered inappropriate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcn.ca/gn_sample.htm Federation of Canadian Naturalists] Retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; because it may be seen as overtly sexual (see [[Issues_in_social_nudity#Appropriate_dress|Issues in social nudity]]).

[[File:Archilochus-alexandri-003.jpg|300x300px|thumb|right|The black-chinned hummingbird (''[[Archilochus alexandri]]'') is the bird species known to have the smallest genome among birds, which is only 0.91 Gb long.]]

[[Birds]] are the group of [[amniotes]] with the smallest [[genomes]]. Whereas [[mammal]] and [[reptile|reptilian]] genomes range between 1.0 and 8.2 [[Base pair|giga base pairs]] (Gb), bird genomes have sizes between 0.91 Gb (black-chinned hummingbird, ''[[Archilochus alexandri]]'') and 1.3 Gb (common ostrich, ''[[Struthio camelus]]'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zhang, G., Li, C., Li, Q., Li, B., Larkin, D. M., Lee, C., ... &amp; Ödeen, A. (2014). Comparative genomics reveals insights into avian genome evolution and adaptation. ''Science'', ''346''(6215), 1311-1320. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4390078/]&lt;/ref&gt; Just as happens to any other [[living being]], bird genomes’ reflect the action of [[natural selection]] upon these animals. Their genomes are the basis of their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[behaviour]].

==Current features of bird genomes==
Compared to any other group of [[tetrapods]], [[birds]] are the ones that have less repeated elements in their genomes, comprising only 4-10% of its extent, a rather small number when compared to the 34-52% that they take up in mammals. Another example of genome reduction in birds is that of [[short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs)]]. Their total size has been drastically reduced, averaging only ~1.3 mega base pairs (Mb), whereas those of American alligator (''[[Alligator mississippiensis]]'') total an average of 12.6 Mb, and those from the green sea turtle (''[[Chelonia mydas]]'') average 34.9 Mb. These data suggest that the [[Most recent common ancestor|last common ancestor]] of modern birds already had a reduced number of SINEs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Exon-intron 2.jpg|300x300|thumb|Introns are DNA sequences that occur in eukaryotic genes. They are transcribed to mRNA, but they are edited out before the mRNA is translated by ribosomes.]]
It can also be appreciated that the medium size of [[introns]], [[Intergenic region|intergenic sequences]], and even [[exons]] is significantly reduced. [[Mammal]] and reptilian introns have an average size of 4.3 kb and 3.1 kb respectively, whereas those of birds are only 2.1 kb long. Likewise, gene spacing is 91 kb (average) for mammals and 61 kb for reptiles, but only 49 kb in birds. It is known that similar reductions have also taken place in [[bats]]. This fact suggests that genome-size reduction could give advantages for [[flying animals]], such as rapid gene-expression regulation, which is required in powered [[flight]]. Some researchers remark that, in fact, bird genomes have undergone successive deletions, ruling out the possibility of genomic expansion in mammals and reptiles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also, there is no such genomic loss in any [[vertebrate]] group as great as that of birds. Its possible that the early chromosomic fragmentation event that lead to the appearance of [[microchromosomes]] in birds significantly contributed to this gene loss.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These fragmentation events must have taken place in a [[common ancestor]] of most birds, since approximately every two out of three species studied have at least 30 pairs of [[microchromosomes]], [[Diploid|2n]] = 80 being the size of the average [[karyotype]] of birds (with the only exception the family [[Falconidae]], which are 2n = 6-12).&lt;ref&gt;Fillon, V. (1998). The chicken as a model to study microchromosomes in birds: a review. ''Genetics Selection Evolution'', ''30''(3), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrosynteny]] studies have determined that, in [[Bird vocalization|vocal learner birds]], genes have undergone a deeper rearrangement along their corresponding chromosomes than those of [[Bird vocalization|non-vocal learner birds]]. In addition to that, [[microsynteny]] studies revealed that birds possess a higher number of [[Homology (biology)|orthologous genes]] that maintain [[synteny]]. This proves that gene order along chromosomes is more conserved in birds than in other animal groups. A clear example are genes coding for [[haemoglobin]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]]s. These genes are easily duplicated and lost. As a consequence, there are huge differences regarding the number and relative position of the genes of alpha-hemoglobins and beta-hemoglobins in mammals. In birds, that is not the case. Both position and number of these genes are highly conserved among them.
[[File:Gorrión 1 (8203064583).jpg|300x300px|thumb|right|The genus name of the sparrows, ''[[Passer]]'', gives its name to the order of [[Passeriformes]]. Birds classified in this order have the highest rate of point mutations among birds, though birds generally have lower rates than mammals.]]

It has also been proven that birds’ [[point mutation]] rate (~1.9 x 10-3 mutations per site and Ma in average) is smaller when compared to that of mammals (~2.7 x 10-3 mutations per site and Ma). This rate is also smaller among [[aequornithes]] (water birds) than that of [[telluraves]] (land birds). In this last group, [[birds of prey]] have the smallest mutation rate, and [[songbirds]] have the highest. These rates are consistent with the broad distribution of birds in different [[Natural environment|environment]]s, and the changes in [[phenotype]] consequent of [[evolutive pressure]] exert by the different [[ecological niches]] as they were been occupied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The presence of functional restrictions in genome self-regulation can be studied by comparing the genomes of species whose [[last common ancestor]] is more ancient. It is known that, approximately, 7.5% of bird genome is comprised by [[Conserved sequence|highly conserved elements]] (HCE’s). ~12.6% of those HCE’s are directly involved in  protein coding genes functionality. Non-coding HCE’s that are bird specific (not found in mammals) happen to be related with the [[regulation]] of the activity of [[transcription factors]] related to [[metabolism]]. In comparison, mammal HCE’s are related to controlling [[cell signalling]], development, and [[Sense|response to stimuli]].

==Evolutive Changes in the Genome==
Genetic evolution is not homogenous across the genome. This can be assayed using [[Ka/Ks ratio]] studies (also known as dN/dS). The ratio is used to estimate the balance between neutral mutations, purifying mutations and beneficial mutations.

In birds, [[ZW sex-determination system|Z-chromosome]] genes have the highest variability. This may  be due to the fact that the Z-chromosome has the lowest gene [[density]]. Also, gene variability is higher in [[macrochromosomes]] than in [[microchromosomes]]. This could be related to the lower [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] frequency of microchromosomes, which is a consequence of the smaller size and greater gene density.

When compared to [[mammals]], it can be appreciated that the fastest evolving bird genes are those that mediate [[developmental biology|development]], whereas in mammals the fastest evolving genes are those that mediate in the development of the [[central nervous system]].

===Genome Relation to Singing===

It seems that the ability to [[singing|sing]] has appeared independently at least two times in birds (possibly three): one in the common ancestor of [[hummingbirds]] and another in the common antecesor of [[songbirds]] and [[parrots]]. They all have in common a number of neuronal circuits that cannot be found in non-vocal learner species. A dN/dS analysis showed conserved evolution in 227 genes, most of which are highly expressed in the regions of the brain that control singing. Furthermore, 20% of them seemed to be regulated by singing.

===Genomic Evolution of Morphological Features===
In order to [[fly]], bird ancestors had to undergo a series of changes at the molecular level that translate into changes at [[Morphology (biology)|morphological level]]. Approximately half of the genes involved in [[ossification]] are known to have been positively selected. Some relevant examples are [[AHSG]], that controls bone mineralization density, and [[P2RX7]], which is associated to bone [[homeostasis]]. Their action would be responsible for the differences observed between mammal and bird [[bones]].

Something similar occurs with the [[respiratory system]]. In mammals, the total inner volume of [[lungs]] changes during [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. However, this does not happen in birds. They make the air circulate through their lungs by contracting and expanding their [[air sacs]]. Five genes are involved in this process in mammals and birds.

[[Feathers]] are one of the most characteristic features of birds, alongside with the [[beak]]. Feathers are formed of α- and β-[[keratin]]s. Compared to reptiles and mammals, [[α-keratin]] protein family has been reduced in birds, whereas [[β-keratins]] has expanded enormously. Since every major bird lineage possess at least one protein of each of the six β-keratin groups, it can be said that their last common ancestor already possessed a large diversity of this kind of protein. 56% of β-keratins are feather-specific and can only be found in birds, whereas those that make up [[scale (anatomy)|scale]]s and [[claw]]s can also be found in reptiles. The variety and number of copies of these genes seems to correlate with the bird’s lifestyle, land birds having a larger variety, and the variety being larger still in [[domestic birds]].

Birds are also known for being toothless. This feature seems to be a consequence of several modifications and deletions which occurred in the exons of the genes implicated in the formation of [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] and [[dentine]]. It is thought that the common ancestor of birds already lacked mineralized [[teeth]], and that later genome changes pushed the situation to the current status.

Also, birds have the best [[visual system|vision system]] known in vertebrates. They have a higher number of [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], and most birds are [[tetrachromats]]. The only exception are [[penguins]], which have only three functional [[opsin]] genes (and hence are [[trichromats]]). This exception could be related to the aquatic lifestyle, since marine mammals have also lost either one or two cone opsin genes.

Birds also seem to have lost the functionality of their right [[ovary]]. There are two ovary development-related genes, [[MMP19]] and [[AKR1C3]], that have disappeared in birds. The fact that a high number of genes related to [[spermatogenesis]] are evolving fast (which does not happen in those related to ovogenensis) suggest that males undergo a stronger [[selective pressure]].

==Clarification of Early Diversification of Birds==
The abundance of genomic data available nowadays has enabled research to elucidate the early [[evolution]] and divergence of bird groups, and has produced a much more detailed [[phylogenetic tree]]. Genomic research has shown that in order to make a good phylogenetic tree it is not enough to use a single gene. This is due to [[Coalescent theory|incomplete lineage sorting]] of genes.

The main problems found in these studies are the low resolution of single-gene based phylogenetic trees and the fact that coding DNA data are scarce and, sometimes, treacherous due to [[convergent evolution]]. For example, when there is a mistake in [[base pairing]], [[DNA mismatch repair|DNA repair machinery]] has a bias favoring [[Base pair|GC pairs]].

The phylogenetic trees recently obtained by ''Jarvis et al'' support the hypothesis of an early fast radiation that would have given rise to ~36 bird lineages in a period of 10-15 Ma. This period of time is relatively short from an evolutionary point of view. Besides, that period of time includes the [[Extinction event|massive extinction event]] that took place ~[[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|65 Ma ago]]. It is coherent that both events took place close in time, since the sudden extinction of such a big number of species would have been beneficial for the survivors, since many niches would have been freed, contributing to diversification of surviving species. This estimation is also consistent with [[fossil record]] data, as well as with actual mammal evolution estimations.&lt;ref name="Jarvis 2014" /&gt;

One of the biggest differences between this tree and previous classifications is the separation between [[Accipitriformes|accipitrifomes]] and [[Falconiformes]], since, traditionally, Falconiformes used to include al the species of these two groups.

The '''Heptateuch''' (seven containers) is a name sometimes given to the first seven books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The seven books are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]]. The first four of these are sometimes called the Tetrateuch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWY8CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;vq=Tetrateuch&amp;dq=Old%20Testament%20Interpretation%20Mays%20Peterson%20Richards&amp;pg=PA36#v=snippet&amp;q=Tetrateuch&amp;f=false |title=Old Testament Interpretation: Past, Present And Future |chapter=The Formation of the Pentateuch |first=David L. |last=Petersen |editor1-first=James Luther |editor1-last=Mays |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Petersen |editor3-first=Kent H. |editor3-last=Richards |page=36 |year=1995 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first five are commonly known as the [[Torah]] or the [[Pentateuch]], the first six as the [[Hexateuch]]. With the addition of the [[Book of Ruth]], it becomes the [[Octateuch]]. The "Enneateuch" is the Heptateuch plus the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Kings]] (each pair of books counted as one, and not including the Book of Ruth).

[[Augustine of Hippo]] produced a piece called ''Questions on the Heptateuch''. [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] produced an [[Old English language|Old English]] version of the Heptateuch.

The '''historiography of science''' is the study of the history and methodology of the sub-discipline of history, known as the [[history of science]], including its disciplinary aspects and practices (methods, theories, schools) and to the study of its own historical development ("History of History of Science", i.e., the history of the discipline called History of Science).

Since historiographical debates regarding the proper method for the study of the history of science are sometimes difficult to demarcate from historical controversies regarding the very course of science, it is often (and rightly) the case that the early controversies of the latter kind are considered the inception of the sub-discipline. For example, such discussions permeate the historical writings of the great historian and philosopher of science [[William Whewell]]. He is thus often (and rightly) viewed as the grandfather of this discipline; other such distinguished grandfathers are [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Alexandre Koyré]].

As to the explicit presentation of the Historiography of Science it is usually dated in the early Sixties of the 20th century. Thus for example, in 1965 we find [[Gerd Buchdahl]] reporting "A Revolution in Historiography of Science" referring to the innovative studies of [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Joseph Agassi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Buchdahl Gerd |title= A Revolution in Historiography of Science|journal= History of Science|year= 1965 |pages=55–69|volume=4|bibcode = 1965HisSc...4...55B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that these two writers had inaugurated the sub discipline by distinguishing clearly between the history and the historiography of science, as they argued that historiographical views greatly influence the writing of the history of science.

== The origins of the discipline ==
Though scholars and scientists had been chronicling the results of scientific endeavors for centuries (such as [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' from 1837, and the popular and historical accounts which accompanied the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century), the development of the distinct [[academia|academic]] discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early 20th century, and was intimately bound to the changing role of science during the same time period. The history of science was once exclusively the domain of retired researchers &amp;mdash; former scientists whose days in the [[laboratory]] had expired but still with a hearty interest in the field &amp;mdash; and the rare specialist. However, in the decades since the end of World War II the field has evolved into a full academic discipline, with [[graduate school]]s, research institutes, public and private patronage, [[peer-review]]ed [[academic journal|journals]], and professional societies.

The study of the history of science has had great effects on the [[philosophy of science]], conceptions of the role of science in society, and [[Public policy#Science Policy|scientific policy]].

The founding figure of the discipline in the [[United States]] was [[George Sarton]], later the founding editor of the journal ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]''. Sarton and his family fled [[Belgium]] after the [[Germany|German]] invasion in World War I, and after a brief stay in [[England]], he arrived in the United States penniless and unemployed. Sarton began lecturing part-time at several academic institutions, and in 1916 began a two-year appointment at [[Harvard University]]. When his appointment did not look like it would be renewed, he appealed to [[Robert S. Woodward]], president of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], for patronage. Woodward gave Sarton a two-year position and in 1920 extended it to a permanent tenured appointment as a Research Associate in the Institution's Department of History.

Though modern scholars do not usually share Sarton's motivations &amp;mdash; Sarton saw the history of science as the only genuine example of human progress &amp;mdash; the tools he left to the field, the journal ''Isis'' and the annual volume ''[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]'' (both still in print today), provided the foundation of the discipline in the United States.

== The Hessen thesis and the birth of externalism  ==

Just as the 1930s were a seminal decade for the development of our modern understanding of science, they were a seminal decade for the history and [[historiography]] of science as well. While Sarton taught the first American doctoral students in the discipline, in Europe some of the most influential historians and philosophers of science were first coming into the picture, and the setting of the philosophical battle which is now known as "the [[Science Wars]]" was being set.

In 1931, the Second International Congress of the History of Science was convened in London. The papers delivered by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegation, led by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin|N.I. Bukharin]], quickly invigorated the discipline. [[Boris Hessen]] in particular delivered a paper entitled "The Social and Economic Roots of Newton's ''Principia''," in which he asserted that [[Isaac Newton]]'s most famous work was created to cater to the goals and desires of 17th century industry and [[Economic system|economy]]. Hessen asserted that Newton's work was inspired by his economic status and context, that the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was little more than the solution of technical problems of the [[bourgeoisie]].

Present scholarship has revealed that Hessen's motives were not completely academic. At that time in the Soviet Union, the work of [[Albert Einstein]] was under attack by [[Communist Party]] [[philosophers]]; being supposedly motivated by bourgeois values, it was "[[bourgeois science]]" {{Harvcol|Graham|1985|p=&amp;nbsp;711}},  and should henceforth be banned. (In many ways this attack was similar to the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' movement in Germany which occurred only a few years later.) Hessen's paper was a lobbying tactic: Party philosophers would not challenge the accuracy of Newton's theories, and to show them as being motivated by bourgeois concerns would, in Hessen's eyes, show that scientific validity could exist whatever the motivations were for undertaking it. However, there is little evidence that his paper had any effect in the internal Soviet philosophical battles over Einstein's work.

Despite its lack of effect in his home country, Hessen's thesis had a wide effect in Western history of science. Though Hessen’s work is now easily dismissed as "vulgar [[Marxism]]" {{Harvcol|Shaffer|1984|p=&amp;nbsp;26}}, its focus on the relationship between society and science was, in its time, seen as novel and inspiring. It was a challenge to the notion that the history of science was the history of individual [[genius]] in action, the dominant view at least since [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' in 1837.

Few contemporary Western readers of Hessen took his paper at face value. His rigid connection between economy and [[knowledge]] was not accepted by a majority of historians. However, his assertion that a connection existed between the growth of knowledge and the art of war, and that [[ballistics]] played a central part of physics and Newton's world, was viewed with keen interest. In the shadow of the first war to employ [[chemical weapons]], and as the war machines were again gearing up in preparation for another world war, the role between science, [[technology]], and warfare was becoming more interesting to scholars and scientists. Previous views of science as separate from the mundane or vulgar aspects of practical life &amp;mdash; the disembodiment of the scientific mind from its context &amp;mdash; were becoming less attractive than a view that science and scientists were increasingly embedded in the world in which they worked.

This became reflective in the scholarship of the time as well, with dissertations written on such subjects as "Science and War in the Old Regime," which examined the ways in which military engineering influenced pre-[[French Revolution|Revolution]] [[France|French]] scientists.

This method of doing the history of science became known as ''[[externalism]]'', looking at the manner in which science and scientists are affected, and guided by, their context and the world in which they exist. It is an approach which eschews the notion that the history of science is the development of pure thought over time, one idea leading to another in a contextual bubble which could exist at any place, at any time, if only given the right geniuses.

The contrast to this approach, the method of doing history of science which preceded externalism, became known as ''[[Internalism#Historiography of science|internalism]]''. Internalist histories of science often focus on the [[rational reconstruction]] of scientific ideas and consider the development of these ideas wholly within the scientific world. Although internalist histories of modern science tend to emphasize the norms of modern science, internalist histories can also consider the different systems of thought underlying the development of [[History of astronomy#Mesopotamia|Babylonian astronomy]] or Medieval [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] theory

In practice, the line between [[internalism and externalism]] can be incredibly fuzzy. Few historians then, or now, would insist that either of these approaches in their extremes paint a wholly complete picture, nor would it necessarily be possible to practice one fully over the other. However, at their heart they contain a basic question about the nature of science: what is the relationship between the producers and consumers of scientific knowledge? The answer to this question must, in some form, inform the method in which the history of science and technology is conducted; conversely, how the history of science and technology is conducted, and what it concludes, can inform the answer to the question. The question itself contains an entire host of philosophical questions: what is the nature of scientific truth? What does [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] mean in a scientific context? How does change in scientific theories occur?

The historian/sociologist of science [[Robert K. Merton]] produced many famous works following Hessen's thesis, which can be seen as reactions to and refinements of Hessen's argument. In his work on science, technology, and society in the 17th century [[England]], Merton sought to introduce an additional category &amp;mdash; [[Puritan]]ism &amp;mdash; to explain the growth of science in this period. Merton worked to split Hessen's crude category of economics into smaller subcategories of influence, including transportation, mining, and military technique. Merton also tried to develop [[empirical]], [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] approaches to showing the influence of external factors on science. Despite these changes, Merton was quick to note his indebtedness to Hessen. Even with his emphasis on external factors, though, Merton differed from Hessen in his interpretation: Merton maintained that while researchers may be inspired and interested by problems which were suggested by extra-scientific factors, ultimately the researcher's interests were driven by "the internal history of the science in question.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}" Merton attempted to delineate externalism and internalism along disciplinary boundaries, with ''context'' studied by the [[sociology of science|sociologist of science]], and ''content'' by the historian.

== Ludwik Fleck ==

Around the same period, in 1935, [[Ludwik Fleck]], a Polish medical microbiologist published his [[Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact]] which used a case study in the field of medicine (of the development of the disease concept of Syphilis) to present a thesis about the social nature of knowledge, and in particular science and scientific 'thought styles' (Denkstil) which are the epistemological, conceptual and linguistic styles of scientific (but also non-scientific) 'thought collectives' (Denkkollektiv). This work's importance was not noticed, as [Thaddeus J. Trenn] editor of the English edition published in 1979 writes, 'Fleck's pioneering monograph was published at almost the same time as [[Karl Popper]]'s [[Logik der Forschung]]. But, developed in very different cognitive styles, the books met with contrasting response. In Popper's own words, his book "was surprisingly successful, far beyond Vienna. [...]" [...] It is perhaps most diagnostic that the book received no review notice at all in [[George Sarton]]'s [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'']], by then the leading international journal of the [[history of science]].' [pp. xvii-xviii].

As evident from Fleck's book's title, it revolves around the notion that epistemologically, there is nothing stable or realistically true or false about any scientific fact. A fact has a 'genesis' which is grounded in certain theoretic grounds and many times other obscure and fuzzy notions, and it 'develops' as it is subject to dispute and additional research by other scientists. Fleck's work, unlike Hessen's work focuses more on the epistemological and linguistic factors that affect scientific discovery, innovation and progress or development, while Hessen's work focuses on socio-political factors.

Fleck's work was one of the major influences noted by [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] which led to the writing his ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. Kuhn also wrote the foreword to Fleck's English translation.

== Vannevar Bush and World War II ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

The study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of [[Big Science]] after World War II. The influential bureaucrat [[Vannevar Bush]], and the president of Harvard, [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], both encouraged the study of the history of science as a way of improving general knowledge about how science worked, and why it was essential to maintain a large scientific workforce.

== Thomas Kuhn and the 1960s ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
From the 1940s through the early 1960s, most histories of science were different forms of a "march of progress" {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, showing science as a triumphant movement towards truth. Many philosophers and historians did of course paint a more nuanced picture, but it was not until the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' that this approach became seriously suspected as being misleading {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Kuhn's argument that scientific revolutions worked by [[paradigm shift]]s seemed to imply that truth was not the ultimate criterion for science, and the book was extremely influential outside of academia as well {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Corresponding with the rise of the [[environmentalism]] movement and a general loss of optimism of the power of science and technology unfettered to solve the problems of the world, this new history encouraged many critics to pronounce the preeminence of science to be overthrown {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

== The discipline today ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The discipline today encompasses a wide variety of fields of academic study, ranging from the traditional ones of history, sociology, and philosophy, and a variety of others such as law, architecture, and literature.

The term '''human biocomputer''', coined by [[John C. Lilly]], refers to the "hardware" of the [[human anatomy]]. This would include the [[brain]], [[internal organs]], and other human organ systems such as [[cardiovascular]], [[digestion|digestive]], [[endocrine]], [[immune]], [[Integumentary system|integumentary]], [[lymphatic]], [[muscular]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], [[reproductive]], [[respiratory]], [[skeletal]], and [[urinary]] systems. The biocomputer has stored program properties, and self-metaprogramming properties, with limits determinable and to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

== General clarification ==
The levels of the human biocomputer are explained thus:
Levels from one to two are the boundaries between external reality and the body. Certain energies and materials (heat, light, sound, food, and secretions) pass through this boundary in special places. Levels two to three are the boundaries of body and brain, in which special structures such as blood vessels, nerve fibers, and cerebrospinal fluid pass. Levels four through eleven are in the brain circuitry, and is the software inside the biocomputer. Levels after ten are termed unknown. This is to allow an openeness for future scientific research, and discoveries. This is also to illustrate the unwillingness to subscribe to any dogmatic belief, to encourage creative, courageous and imaginative investigation, to emphasize the necessity for unknown factors on all levels, and to point out the [[heuristic]] nature of this schema.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
=== Mind ===
[[Mind]], which is defined as the sum total of all the programs and metaprograms (and even supraself metaprograms) of a human biocomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; This is the software and is looked at as the opposite of the hardware.
=== Brain ===
The brain is defined as the visible, palpable living set of structures to be included in the human biocomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stored programs ===
A stored program is defined as a set of instructions which are placed in memory storage of the biocomputer, and which control the biocomputer when orders are given for that program to be activated.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; These programs can be activated by the same biocomputer, another biocomputer, or a situation outside of the biocomputer.

=== Metaprogramming ===
Metaprogramming is defined as a set of instructions, descriptions, and implementations of related thoughts and actions(programs).&lt;ref name="potter"&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  Self metaprogramming involves the creation, revision, and reorganization of programs and metaprograms.&lt;ref name="potter"/&gt;

'''Integrated discrete Multiple Organ Culture (IdMOC)''' is an ''in vitro'', cell culture based experimental model for the study of [[intercellular communication]].  In conventional ''in vitro'' systems, each cell type is studied in isolation ignoring critical interactions between organs or cell types. IdMOC technology is based on the concept that multiple organs signal or communicate via the systemic circulation (i.e., blood).
[[File:IdMOC.JPG|thumb|right|Schematic representation of an IdMOC plate]]
The IdMOC plate consists of multiple inner wells within a large interconnecting chamber. Multiple cell types are first individually seeded in the inner wells and, when required, are flooded with an overlying medium to facilitate well-to-well communication. Test material can be added to the overlying medium and both media and cells can be analyzed individually. Plating of [[hepatocytes]] with other organ-specific cells allows evaluation of [[drug metabolism]] and organotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Li AP, Bode C, Sakai Y. A novel in vitro system, the integrated discrete multiple organ cell culture (IdMOC) system, for the evaluation of human drug toxicity: comparative cytotoxicity of tamoxifen towards normal human cells from five major organs and MCF-7 adenocarcinoma breast cancer cells. Chem Biol Interact. 2004 Nov 1;150(1):129-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The IdMOC system has numerous applications in [[drug development]], such as the evaluation of [[drug metabolism]] and [[toxicity]]. It can simultaneously evaluate the toxic potential of a drug on cells from multiple organs and evaluate drug stability, distribution, metabolite formation, and efficacy. By modeling multiple-organ interactions, IdMOC can examine the [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effects of a drug and its metabolites on target and off-target organs as well as evaluate [[drug interactions|drug-drug interactions]] by measuring [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) induction or inhibition in hepatocytes.

IdMOC can also be used for routine and [[high throughput screening]] of drugs with desirable [[ADME]] or [[ADME-Tox]] properties. [[In vitro toxicology|In vitro toxicity]] screening using hepatocytes in conjunction with other primary cells such as cardiomyocytes ([[cardiotoxicity]] model), kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells ([[nephrotoxicity]] model), astrocytes ([[neurotoxicity]] model), endothelial cells (vascular toxicity model), and airway epithelial cells ([[pulmonary toxicity]] model) is invaluable to the [[drug design]] and [[drug discovery|discovery]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Li, AP. In vitro evaluation of metabolic drug-drug interactions: a descriptive and critical commentary. [[Current Protocols]] in Toxicology 2007 33:4.25.1-4.25.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The IdMOC was patented by Dr. Albert P. Li in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = United States Patent: 7186548 - Cell culture tool and method|url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=7186548.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7186548&amp;RS=PN/7186548|accessdate = 2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Context|date=January 2011}}
'''Immediate mode''' rendering is a style for [[application programming interface]]s of graphics libraries, in which client calls directly cause [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] of graphics objects to the display, or in which the data to describe [[rendering primitive]]s is inserted frame by frame directly into a [[command list]] (in the case of ''{{visible anchor|immediate mode primitive rendering}}''), without the use of extensive indirection to retained resources. It does not preclude the use of [[Multiple buffering|double-buffering]]. In contrast to [[retained mode]], lists of objects to be rendered are not saved by the API library. Instead, the application must re-issue all drawing commands required to describe the entire scene each time a new frame is required, regardless of actual changes. This method provides the maximum amount of control and flexibility to the application program.

== Immediate mode primitive rendering ==


Primitive [[vertex attribute]] data may be inserted frame by frame into a [[command buffer]] by a [[rendering API]]. This involves significant bandwidth and processor time (especially if the [[graphics processing unit]] is on a separate bus), but may be advantageous for data generated dynamically by the [[CPU]]. It is less common since the advent of increasingly versatile [[shaders]], with which a [[graphics processing unit]] may generate increasingly complex effects without the need for CPU intervention.

== Immediate mode rendering with vertex buffers ==


Although drawing commands have to be re-issued for each new frame, modern systems using this method are generally able to avoid the unnecessary duplication of more memory-intensive display data by referring to that unchanging data (via [[Indirection (computing)|indirection]]) (e.g. [[texture maps|textures]] and [[vertex buffer]]s) in the drawing commands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2962">'''Induced gas flotation''' ('''IGF''') is a [[water treatment]] process that clarifies [[wastewater]]s (or other waters) by the removal of suspended matter such as oil or solids. The removal is achieved by injecting gas bubbles into the water or wastewater in a flotation tank or basin. The small bubbles adhere to the suspended matter causing the suspended matter to float to the surface of the water where it may then be removed by a skimming device.

Induced gas flotation is very widely used in treating the industrial wastewater [[effluent]]s from [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s, [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plants]] and similar industrial facilities. A very similar process known as ''[[dissolved air flotation]]'' is also used for waste water treatment. ''[[Froth flotation]]'' is commonly used in the processing of mineral ores.

IGF units in the [[oil industry]] do not use air as the flotation medium due to the explosion risk. These IGF units use [[natural gas]] or [[nitrogen]] to create the bubbles.

==Process description==
The feed water to the IGF float tank is often (but not always) dosed with a coagulant (such as ferric chloride or aluminum sulfate) to [[flocculate]] the suspended matter.

The bubbles may be generated by an impeller, eductors or a sparger. The bubbles adhere to the suspended matter, causing the suspended matter to float to the surface and form a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the IGF unit.&lt;ref name=Aqueous&gt;{{cite book

Some IGF unit designs utilize parallel plate packing material to provide more separation surface and therefore to enhance the separation efficiency of the unit.

'''Industrial deconcentration''' is the movement of industrial zones ([[Factory|factories]]) away from the center of the [[city]], and further away from each other. It is similar to [[suburb]]anization, a residential trend in which a large number of the population move away from the [[metropolis]] as the [[inner city]] becomes overcrowded.

Industrial deconcentration occurs when a previously established [[industrial district]] becomes unable to provide efficiently for its own populace due to overcrowding.  In a [[market economy]] the massive [[competition]] and overcrowding of the metropolitan area forces people and businesses to move out to less-industrial areas with less [[traffic congestion]].  Modernization in the social, economic, and technological fields of a country is a factor in accelerating industrial deconcentration.

This phenomenon is more apparent in nations that have been industrialized for a longer time.  Most countries experiencing industrial deconcentration at the beginning of the 21st century are the states that began industrializing after the end of [[World War II]].

Industrial deconcentration is a conscious goal in a comprehensive [[decentralization]] policy:  to deconcentrate population without excessive [[commuting]], jobs need to be created outside the cities.

Tribhuvan University's '''Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science''' (IAAS) is the oldest institute in [[Nepal]] which provides higher education in agriculture and [[animal science]].

=={{anchor|Background|Present scenario}}Overview==

IAAS was founded in [[Kathmandu]] in 1957 as a school of agriculture to train junior technical assistants. In 1968, the school was upgraded to a college of agriculture. Four years later it became affiliated with  Tribhuvan University (TU), and moved to [[Bharatpur, Nepal|Rampur, Chitwan]] in 1974. The institute's mission is to provide higher education in agriculture and agricultural development, focusing on teaching, research, and [[continuing education]]. The government of Nepal established the Agriculture and Forestry University (AFU) in Rampur in 2010, and AFU took over IAAS' physical plant and other assets. The IAAS dean's office moved to Kathmandu in 2011 and continues its programs and activities at satellite offices in [[Sanepa]], [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]] and [[Kirtipur]].

The institute's postgraduate program was moved to Kathmandu in 2013, and classes are conducted in TU's Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology (RECAST) building in Kirtipur and other TU classrooms. It has a Master of Science in Agriculture (M. Sc. Ag.) program in seven departments, Master of Science in Animal Science (M.Sc. An. Sc.) and Master of Veterinary Science (M. V. Sc.) programs in two, and two Ph.D. programs (Plan A and Plan B) in several departments. In Plan A, students attend theory and practical classes in relevant subjects offered by the department. In Plan B, students conduct research and submit a progress report each semester; classes and practical work are not mandatory. 

The institute has collaborated with the TU central library in Kirtipur, and student access to the library has been ensured. It has donated a number of postgraduate reference books, and the library has committed to obtain books and other publications required by IAAS students. In addition to maintaining its laboratory, the institute has signed in an agreement with the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) for student practical work and research activities. The institute has involved TU professors and researchers and other governmental and non-governmental organizations.

[[Image:Lamjung campus.jpg|thumb|alt=Narrow street with buildings on both sides|Lamjung campus]]
[[Image:Lamjung view.jpg|thumb|alt=Terraced fields, with mountains in the background|View from Lamjung]]
The Paklihawa campus is in [[Siddharthanagar]], and the Lamjung campus is in [[Sundarbazar]]. They were established as branches of the central Rampur campus in 1976 (2032 [[Vikram Samvat|B.S.]]) with the following objectives:
* To produce mid-level agricultural technicians
* To conduct relevant, problem-solving agricultural and animal-science research for farmers
* To provide technical assistance in agriculture and animal science to farmers

With the establishment of AFU at IAAS, Rampur, both satellite IAAS campuses (Lamjung and Paklihawa, which had two-year programs) were upgraded to B.Sc.Ag. programs in 2012. The Paklihawa campus began a five-year B.V.Sc. program in 2013.

==Affiliated colleges==

TU and IAAS became affiliated with agricultural colleges in [[Gokuleshwar, Baitadi]] (2010), [[Lamahi Municipality]] and [[Tulsipur, Dang]] (both 2014).

Tribhuvan University's other technical institutes are:
* [[Institute of Engineering]]
* [[Institute of Forestry]]
* [[Institute of Medicine, Nepal|Institute of Medicine]]
* [[Institute of Science and Technology, TU|Institute of Science and Technology]]

== {{anchor|Links with other institutions}}Links to other institutions ==
[[Memorandum of understanding|Memoranda of understanding]] have been signed between IAAS and national and international institutions, including the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT), Agro Enterprise Centre (AEC), [[Ministry of Agricultural and Livestock Development (Nepal)|Ministry of Agricultural and Livestock Development]], Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC), [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], [[Cornell University]], [[University of Graz]], [[Hiroshima University]], [[Writtle College]], [[Asian Institute of Technology]] and [[Tufts University]].

== {{anchor|Land holdings}}Land ==
The institute has 338 [[bigha|ropani]] (229 [[hectare]]s) of land in six plots. It has one horticulture, one [[agronomy]] and one livestock farm covering 252 ropani (171 hectares). The farms produce fruit, vegetables, cereals, animals and birds and are used for practical work. The upland farm includes a mango orchard, and about 4,200 coffee plants were planted in August 2005.

== Administration and staff ==
The campus chief is the head of the institute for general and academic administration, accounts, store, library, farms, hostels and dispensary work. There is a branch head of each section, responsible for internal management. Major decisions related to rules and regulations in each section are made by section heads and related personnel, headed by the campus chief.

There are 150 teaching staff members, and 56 in administrative support. Two teachers have Ph.D. degrees, and others hold master's degrees. Four teachers have been brought from Rampur on a contract basis each year.

== Buildings ==
The institute has two administrative buildings, a library, six classrooms and five laboratories. There are 24 dormitories and residences (one chief, nine senior staff, ten junior staff and four lower staff), a guest house, a men's hostel, a women's hostel and two mess halls. There are also a poultry house, a goat shed, two cattle-buffalo sheds, a swine shed, a farm store, an auditorium, a garage and a dispensary.

== Academic activities ==
During its early years, the institute offered a one-year I. Sc. (Basic science) Agriculture course, producing 947 mid-level agricultural technicians from 1975 to 1983. The institute began a non-academic Junior Technical Assistant training program in 1984, and 644 JTAs were trained from 1984 to 1990. It began a two-year I. Sc. (basic science) Agriculture diploma program in 1991, and produced 313 JTs by 2001. In 2002, the institute introduced an eight-semester Bachelor of Science in Agriculture program.

'''Iron-oxidizing bacteria''' are [[Chemotroph|chemotrophic]] [[bacteria]] that derive the [[energy]] they need to live and multiply by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] dissolved [[ferrous]] [[iron#Bioinorganic compounds|iron]]. They are known to grow and proliferate in waters containing iron concentrations as low as 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. However, at least 0.3 ppm of dissolved oxygen is needed to carry out oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Known species of bacteria with [[microbial metabolism]]s based on iron oxidation include ''[[Thiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]''.

==Habitat==

Iron-oxidizing bacteria colonize the transition zone where de-oxygenated water from an [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] environment flows into an aerobic environment.  Groundwater containing dissolved organic material may be de-oxygenated by [[microorganisms]] feeding on that dissolved organic material.  Where concentrations of organic material exceed the concentration of dissolved oxygen required for complete oxidation, microbial populations that contain [[Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria|iron-reducing bacteria]] can reduce insoluble ferric oxide in [[aquifer]] [[soils]] to soluble ferrous hydroxide and use the oxygen released by that change to oxidize some of the remaining organic material:&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. and McCarty, Perry L. "Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers" McGraw-Hill (1967) {{ISBN|0-07-054970-2}} pp.446-447&lt;/ref&gt;

::4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 4Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
::(water) + (Iron[III] oxide) → (Iron[II] hydroxide) + (oxygen)

When the de-oxygenated water reaches a source of oxygen, iron-oxidizing bacteria use that oxygen to convert the soluble ferrous iron back into an insoluble reddish precipitate of ferric iron:&lt;ref&gt;Snoeyink, Vernon L. and Jenkins, David "Water Chemistry" John Wiley &amp; Sons (1980) {{ISBN|0-471-05196-9}} pp.380-381&lt;/ref&gt;

::4Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
::(Iron[II] hydroxide) + (oxygen) → (water) + (Iron[III] oxide)

Since the latter reaction is the normal equilibrium in our oxygen atmosphere while the first requires biological coupling with a simultaneous oxidation of carbon, organic material dissolved in water is often the underlying cause of iron-metabolizing bacteria populations.  Groundwater may be naturally de-oxygenated by decaying vegetation in [[swamp]]s; and useful mineral deposits of [[bog iron]] ore have formed where that groundwater has historically emerged to be exposed to atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, Konrad B. "Introduction to Geochemistry" McGraw-Hill (1979) {{ISBN|0-07-035447-2}} p.213&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anthropogenic hazard|Anthropogenic]] sources like [[landfill]] [[leachate]], [[septic drain field]]s, or leakage of light [[petroleum]] fuels like [[gasoline]] are other possible sources of organic materials allowing soil [[microbes]] to de-oxygenate groundwater.

A similar reversible reaction may form black deposits of [[manganese dioxide]] from dissolved [[manganese]], but is less common because of the relative abundance of iron (5.4 percent) in comparison to manganese (0.1 percent) in average soils.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, Konrad B. "Introduction to Geochemistry" McGraw-Hill (1979) {{ISBN|0-07-035447-2}} p.544&lt;/ref&gt;  Other conditions associated with iron-oxidizing bacteria result from the anaerobic aqueous environment rather than the bacteria visibly colonizing that habitat.  [[Corrosion]] of pipes is another source of soluble iron for the first reaction above and the sulfurous smell of rot or decay results from enzymatic conversion of soil [[sulfate]]s to volatile [[hydrogen sulfide]] as an alternative source of oxygen in anaerobic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. and McCarty, Perry L. "Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers" McGraw-Hill (1967) {{ISBN|0-07-054970-2}} p.459&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on water infrastructure ==

Iron-oxidizing bacteria can pose an issue for the management of [[water supply|water-supply]] [[water well|well]]s, as they can produce insoluble [[ferric oxide]], which appears as brown gelatinous slime that will stain plumbing fixtures, and clothing or utensils washed with the water carrying it. 

===Possible indicators===


[[Image:Iron bacteria burn.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Burn (landform)|burn]] in Scotland with iron-oxidizing bacteria.]]
The dramatic effects of iron bacteria are seen in surface waters as brown slimy masses on stream bottoms and lakeshores or as an oily sheen upon the water. More serious problems occur when bacteria build up in well systems.  Iron bacteria in wells do not cause health problems, but they can reduce well yields by clogging screens and pipes.

===Control===

Treatment techniques which may be successful in removing or reducing iron bacteria include physical removal, pasteurization, and chemical treatment. Treatment of heavily infected wells may be difficult, expensive, and only partially successful.

Physical removal is typically done as a first step. Small diameter pipes are sometimes cleaned with a wire brush, while larger lines can be scrubbed and flushed clean with a [[Drain cleaner#Sewer jetters|sewer jetter]]. The pumping equipment in the well must also be removed and cleaned. 

Iron filters have been used to treat iron bacteria. Iron filters are similar in appearance and size to conventional water softeners but contain beds of media which have mild oxidizing power. As the iron-bearing water is passed through the bed, any soluble ferrous iron is converted to the insoluble ferric state and then filtered from the water. Any previously precipitated iron is removed by simple mechanical filtration. Several different filter media may be used in these iron filters, including manganese greensand, Birm, MTM, multi-media, sand, and other synthetic materials. In most cases, the higher oxides of manganese produce the desired oxidizing action. Iron filters do have limitations. Since the oxidizing action is relatively mild, it will not work well when organic matter, either combined with the iron or completely separate, is present in the water and iron bacteria will not be killed. Extremely high iron concentrations may require inconvenient frequent backwashing and/or regeneration. Finally, iron filter media requires high flow rates for proper backwashing and such water flows are not always available.

Wildfires may release iron-containing compounds from the soil into small wildland streams and cause a rapid but usually temporary proliferation of iron-oxidizing bacteria complete with orange coloration, the gelatinous mats, and sulphurous odors. Higher quality personal filters typically used in backpacking/trekking can successfully remove bacteria, odor, and restore water clarity.

From 1975 to 1985 he was  Director  of  Research  Applications  at  l'[[Institut Pasteur]]  (the  Pasteur  Institute  in Paris). 
Former  research  associate  at  the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]  (MIT) in the field of biology and computer graphics, he was successively Scientific Attaché to the French Embassy in the United States, and Scientific Director of European Enterprises Development Company (a venture capital group) from 1971 to 1975. He is famous for pioneering surfing in France in 1957&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.carrefour-du-futur.com/evasion/origines-du-surf History of surfing in France]&lt;/ref&gt; and created the Surf Club de France&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.surf-club-de-france.com/ Surf Club de France]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1964.

He is particularly interested in advanced technologies and the applications of system theory. On these subjects, he wrote : 
"Le  Macroscope" (1975),  "Les  Chemins de la Vie" (The paths of life) (1983) and "Le  Cerveau  Planétaire" (The planetary brain) (1986).  As well as several reports, namely : "Biotechnologies and Bio Industry" (1979), an annex to the report "Sciences de la vie et Société" by Professors Gros, Jacob and Royer. He was also co-responsible for the report which led to the creation of CESTA (Centre d'Etudes des Systèmes et des Technologies Avancées / Center for the study of systems and advanced technologies, 1982).

He  wrote for several years on new technologies for the economic magazine "[[L'Expansion]]". He speaks on the same subject for [[Europe1]], a radio network. He is the author of several scientific books aimed at a large public, such as "Les  origines  de  la vie", (The origins  of  life) (1966); "La  malbouffe" (the  wrong  food)(1979), "La Révolution Biologique", (the biological revolution)(1982) ; "Branchez-vous" (Plug-in!), (1984), a book on personal computers ; "L'Aventure du Vivant" (The adventure of life) (1988) ; "L'avenir en direct" (Live from the future), (1989) ; "Les rendez-vous du Futur" (Rendez-vous with the future) (1991) ; "L'Homme Symbiotique, regards sur le 3eme  millénaire" (Symbiotic Man, a look into the third millenium) (1995). "La  plus belle  histoire  du  monde", (The most beautiful history of the World) with [[Yves Coppens]], [[Hubert Reeves]] and Dominique Simonnet, Seuil, 1996. "Une vie en plus" with [[Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber]], François de Closets and Dominique Simonnet, Seuil 2005. "La révolte du Pronétariat" with the collaboration of Carlo Revelli, Fayard, 2006. "2020 : Les scénarios du futur", Fayard, 2008. "Surfer la Vie, Sur-Vivre dans la société fluide", LLL mai 2012. "Je cherche à comprendre...les codes cachés de la nature" LLL, 2016. His last book,"La Symphonie du vivant, comment l'épigénétique va changer votre vie", édité chez LLL, 2018.

Joël de Rosnay is laureate of the Prize of the Scientific Information 1990 of the Academy of Sciences and the Benjamin Constant Prize of the Arts of Communication 1994 of the Society of Encouragement of National Industry.
He was elected "Digital Personality of the Year 2012" by Acsel (Association for the Digital Economy). 
On March 12, 2018 he rose to the rank of Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean (GCSK) by the [[Republic of Mauritius]] for his contribution to the field of research and the environment.

His wife Stella is the daughter of [[Gladwyn Jebb]], 1st Baron Gladwyn. His daughter is novelist [[Tatiana de Rosnay]].

==History==
Compared to other biomedical fields, lipidology was originally less popular since the constant handling of oils, smears, and greases was unappealing and separation was difficult.{{sfn|Kates|p=275-276}} The field became more popular following the advent of [[chromatography]] which allowed lipids to be isolated and analyzed.{{sfn|Kates|p=275-276}} The field was further popularized following the [[Cell biology|cytologic]] application of the [[electron microscope]] which found that many [[metabolic pathway]]s take place on the [[cell membrane]], whose properties are strongly influenced by its lipid composition.{{sfn|Kates|p=275-276}}

==Clinical lipidology==
The [[Framingham Heart Study]] and other epidemiological studies have found a correlation between [[lipoprotein]]s and [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;Therapeutic lipidology, p. vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14474">Inspired by the terms [[genome]] and [[genomics]], other words to describe complete [[Biology|biological]] datasets, mostly sets of [[biomolecules]] originating from one [[organism]], have been coined with the suffix ''[[-ome]]'' and ''-[[omics]]''. Some of these terms are related to each other in a [[hierarchical]] fashion. For example, the genome contains the [[ORFeome]], which gives rise to the [[transcriptome]], which is translated to the [[proteome]]. Other terms are overlapping and refer to the structure and/or function of a subset of proteins (e.g. [[glycome]], [[kinome]]).

An omicist is a scientist who studies omeomics, cataloging all the “omics” subfields.&lt;ref name="Yadav 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Wholeness in Suffix -omics, -omes, and the Word Om | author=Yadav SP. | journal=J Biomol Tech | year=2007 | volume=18 | issue=5 | pages=277 | pmid= 18166670 | pmc=2392988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omics.org is a Wiki that collects and alphabetically lists all the known "omes" and "omics."&lt;ref name="Omics.org"&gt;[http://omics.org/index.php/Alphabetically_ordered_list_of_omes_and_omics]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logos.svg|Left|thumb|[[Greek alphabet|Greek spelling]] of ''logos'']]

'''''Logos''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|ɒ|s|,_|ˈ|l|ɒ|ɡ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|oʊ|s}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]]|lógos}}; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}, {{transl|grc|légō}}, {{Literal translation|'I say'|lk=on}}) is a term in [[Western philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]], and [[religion]] derived from a Greek word variously meaning "ground", "plea", "opinion", "expectation", "word", "speech", "account", "reason", "proportion", and "discourse",&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: logos, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entrys[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; but it became a technical term in [[Western philosophy]] beginning with [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa| 535| 475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Heraclitus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' is the logic behind an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html |title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos |last=Butler|first=S|website=members.tripod.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' tries to persuade an audience using [[logical argument]]s and supportive evidence. ''Logos'' is a persuasive technique often used in writing and rhetoric.

Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The [[sophist]]s used the term to mean [[discourse]]; [[Aristotle]] applied the term to refer to "reasoned discourse"&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"/&gt; or "the argument" in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] alongside ''[[ethos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/ Aristotle's Rhetoric]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers identified the term with the [[divine]] animating principle pervading the Universe. Within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], [[Philo of Alexandria]] ({{Circa| 20&amp;nbsp;BC| 50&amp;nbsp;AD}}) adopted the term into [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Philo Judaeus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] identifies the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], through which all things are made, as divine (''[[God|theos]]''),&lt;ref name = "May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and further identifies [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[incarnate]] Logos. The term is also used in [[Sufism]], and the analytical psychology of [[Carl Jung]].

Despite the conventional translation as "word", it is not used for a [[word]] in the grammatical sense; instead, the term ''lexis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέξις|λέξις]]}}, {{transl|grc|léxis}}) was used.&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: lexis, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both ''logos'' and ''lexis'' derive from the same verb {{transl|grc|légō}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}), meaning  "(I) count, tell, say, speak".&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlego"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw2 ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: legō, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a "premise". She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor's backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different "premises" that the [[rhetor]] applies via his or her chosen diction.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor's success, she argues, will come down to "certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience". "Logos is logical appeal, and the term logic is derived from it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's topic."&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle's Three Modes of Persuasion in Rhetoric|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/ESSENES/aristotles_modes_of_persuasion_in_rhetoric.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, logos is credited with appealing to the audience's sense of logic, with the definition of "logic" being concerned with the thing as it is known.&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"/&gt;
Furthermore, one can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways.  The first is through [[inductive reasoning]], providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is through [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[enthymeme]], providing the audience with general scenarios and then indicating commonalities among them.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"/&gt;

Philo distinguished between ''logos prophorikos'' ("the uttered word") and the ''logos endiathetos'' ("the word remaining within").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adam Kamesar|title=The ''Logos Endiathetos'' and the ''Logos Prophorikos'' in Allegorical Interpretation: Philo and the D-Scholia to the ''Iliad'' |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501000000*/https://web.duke.edu/classics/grbs/FTexts/44/Kamesar.pdf |journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies (GRBS)|volume=44|year=2004|pages=163–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] also spoke of the ''[[logos spermatikos]]'' (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

The [[Vulgate]] Bible usage of {{lang|la|in principio erat verbum}} was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun {{lang|la|verbum}} for "word", but later [[Romance language]] translations had the advantage of nouns such as {{lang|fr|le mot}} in French. Reformation translators took another approach. [[Martin Luther]] rejected {{lang|de|Zeitwort}} (verb) in favor of {{lang|de|Wort}} (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving ''the living word'' as felt by Jerome and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==

===Heraclitus===
{{Further|Heraclitus#Logos}}
The writing of [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa|535|475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}})&lt;!---maintain consistency throughout article re: BC vs. BCE---&gt; was the first place where the word ''logos'' was given special attention in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962, pp. 419ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heraclitus, ''logos'' provided the link between rational discourse and the world's rational structure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to ever understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.|[[Diels–Kranz]]|22B1}}

{{quote|For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the ''logos'' is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.|Diels–Kranz|22B2}}

{{quote|Listening not to me but to the ''logos'' it is wise to agree that all things are one.|Diels–Kranz|22B50&lt;ref&gt;Translations from Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Hackett, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What ''logos'' means here is not certain; it may mean "reason" or "explanation" in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than "saying" or "wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;''Handboek geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte 1'', Article by Jaap Mansveld &amp; Keimpe Algra, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, an independent existence of a universal ''logos'' was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie, ''The Greek Philosophers: From Thales to Aristotle'', Methuen, 1967, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle identifies two specific types of persuasion methods: artistic and inartistic.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering the Arguments: Artistic and Inartistic Proofs|url=http://www.classicalwriting.com/blog/2010/01/12/discovering-the-arguments-artistic-and-inartistic-proofs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines artistic proofs as arguments that the [[rhetor]] generates and creates on their own. Examples of these include  relationships, testimonies, and conjugates. He defines inartistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor quotes using information from a non-self-generated source. Examples of these include laws, contracts, and [[oath]]s.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"/&gt;

===Aristotle's rhetorical logos===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|Aristotle, 384–322 BC.]]
Following one of the other meanings of the word, [[Aristotle]] gave ''logos'' a different technical definition in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]]. The other two modes are ''[[pathos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθος|πᾰ́θος]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthos}}), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, "putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind";&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', in Patricia P. Matsen, Philip B. Rollinson, and Marion Sousa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3iLyz9zd7cC&amp;pg=PA120 Readings from Classical Rhetoric]'', SIU Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8093-1592-0}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[ethos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἦθος|ἦθος]]}}, {{transl|grc|êthos}}), persuasion through convincing listeners of one's "moral character".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt; According to Aristotle, ''logos'' relates to "the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html translation by W. Rhys Roberts], this reads "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself".&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Paul Rahe:

{{Quote|For Aristotle, ''logos'' is something more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it makes it possible for him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between what is advantageous and what is harmful, between what is just and what is unjust, and between what is good and what is evil.&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"&gt;Paul Anthony Rahe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&amp;pg=PA21 Republics Ancient and Modern: The Ancien Régime in Classical Greece]'', University of North Carolina Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-8078-4473-X}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'' can all be appropriate at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Garver, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoXnLHQ5mgwC&amp;pg=PA114 Aristotle's Rhetoric: An art of character]'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-226-28424-7}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that [[data]] are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument; and such arguments make the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing ''ethos''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through ''ethos''—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.&lt;ref&gt;Garver, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wardy]] suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of ''logos'' "is not emotional appeal [[Per se (Latin)|per se]], but rather emotional appeals that have no 'bearing on the issue', in that the ''pathē'' [{{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθη|πᾰ́θη]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthē}}] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an [[antisemitic]] audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners's reverential feelings for the politician's ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wardy, "Mighty Is the Truth and It Shall Prevail?", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QkIn37h_TMUC&amp;pg=PA64 Essays on Aristotle's Rhetoric]'', Amélie Rorty (ed), University of California Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-520-20228-7}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle comments on the three modes by stating: 
{{Quote|Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. ... Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. ... Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions. ... Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.{{whose translation}}|Aristotle|''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''|350&amp;nbsp;BC}}

===Stoics===
[[Stoic philosophy]] began with [[Zeno of Citium]] {{Circa|300&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}, in which the ''logos'' was the active [[reason]] pervading and animating the [[Universe]]. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with [[God]] or [[Nature]]. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal logos'' ("''[[logos spermatikos]]''"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos''.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics took all activity to imply a ''logos'' or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the ''logos'' was ''[[anima mundi]]'' to them, a concept which later influenced [[Philo of Alexandria]], although he derived the contents of the term from Plato.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUF15rypDscC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Anima+mundi+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jwl8TP_xI8KSjAfUm-jSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anima%20mundi%20logos&amp;f=false ''Studies in European Philosophy''], by James Lindsay, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4067-0173-4}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that "''Logos'' ... had long been one of the leading terms of [[Stoicism]], chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isocrates' logos===
Public discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle's appeals to ''logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'', while less attention has been directed to [[Isocrates]]' teachings about philosophy and ''logos'',&lt;ref name="David M 2010"&gt;David M. Timmerman and [[Edward Schiappa]], ''Classical Greek Rhetorical Theory and the Disciplining of Discourse'' (London: Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010): 43–66&lt;/ref&gt; and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful ''[[polis]]''. Isocrates does not provide a single definition of ''logos'' in his work, but Isocratean ''logos'' characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt; He was concerned with establishing the "common good" of [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of ''logos''.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt;

==In Hellenistic Judaism==
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
In the [[Septuagint]] the term ''logos'' is used for the word of God in the creation of heaven in Psalm 33:6, and in some related contexts.

===Philo of Alexandria===
[[Philo]] ({{Circa|20&amp;nbsp;BC|50&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}), a [[Hellenized Jew]], used the term Logos to mean an intermediary divine being or [[demiurge]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"/&gt; Philo followed the Platonic distinction between [[Hylic|imperfect matter]] and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"&gt;[[Frederick Copleston]], ''A History of Philosophy'', Volume 1, Continuum, 2003, pp. 458–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Logos'' was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo "the first-born of God".&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;
Philo also wrote that "the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''De Profugis'', cited in [https://archive.org/details/hellenismchristi00frieiala Gerald Friedlander, ''Hellenism and Christianity'', P. Vallentine, 1912, pp. 114–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato's Theory of Forms]] was located within the Logos, but the Logos also acted on behalf of God in the physical world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt; In particular, the [[Angel of the Lord]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Old Testament]]) was identified with the Logos by Philo, who also said that the Logos was God's instrument in the creation of the Universe.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}
[[File:Prologus Ioanni Vulgata Clementina.jpg|thumb|''In principio erat verbum'', [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for ''In the beginning was the Word'', from the [[Clementine Vulgate]], [[Gospel of John]], 1:1–18.]]
In [[Christology]], the ''Logos'' ({{lang-el|Λόγος|lit='Word", "Discourse", or "Reason'}})&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is a name or title of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], seen as the pre-existent second [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)#Christian_theology|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. The concept derives from [[John 1:1]], which in the [[Douay–Rheims]], [[King James Version|King James]], [[New International Version|New International]], and other versions of the [[Bible]], reads:
{{quote|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the translations, "Word" is used for Λόγος, although the term is often used [[transliterated]] but untranslated in theological discourse.
The Koine Greek reads, "Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν '''πρὸς τὸν θεόν''', '''καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος'''.(En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên ''pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos''.) The definite article is used with 'theos/god', making it 'God', and the second usage is indefinite (without an article), rendering it 'god'. Thus David Bentley Hart translates it as 'In the origin there was the Logos, and the Logos was present with GOD, and the Logos was god'.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart. ''The New Testament: A Translation''. Yale, 2017, ISBN 0-978-0-300-18609-3, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many ancient Greek scholars, including Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature) explains that concepts of definite articles in English and Koine Greek are not similar: "In the New World Translation the opening verse of the Gospel according to John is mistranslated as follows: “Originally the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” A footnote which is added to the first word, “Originally,” reads, “Literally, In (At) a beginning.” By using here the indefinite article “a” the translators have overlooked the well-known fact that in Greek grammar nouns may be definite for various reasons, whether or not the Greek definite article is present. A prepositional phrase, for example, where the definite article is not expressed, can be quite definite in Greek, [in Hebrew 10:31, "εις χειρας θεου ζωντος" is properly rendered (even by the New World Translation) with the definite article expressed twice, “into the hands of the living God.”] as in fact it is in John 1:1"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|date=April 1953|title=The Jehovah'S Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004057365301000110|journal=Theology Today|volume=10|pages=65-85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=729|title=WHAT GREEK SCHOLARS REALLY THINK!|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letusreason.org/jw38.htm|title=The dispute on Jn.1:1|last=|first=|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhema==
The word ''logos'' has been used in different senses along with ''[[rhema]]''. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] used the term ''logos'' along with ''rhema'' to refer to sentences and propositions.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoplatonism==
[[File:Plotinus and disciples.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Plotinus]] with his disciples.]]
[[Neoplatonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] ({{Circa|204/5|lk=on}}{{snd}}270&amp;nbsp;AD) used the term "Logos" in ways that drew on Plato and the [[Stoics]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael F.

Plotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of "The One", the "Spirit", and "Soul". The comparison with the Christian [[Trinity]] is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and "The One" was at the highest level, with the "Soul" at the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcg83ynsJEwC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=plotinus+trinity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Is18TLriMt6U4gakq5CGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=plotinus%20trinity&amp;f=false] ''Ancient philosophy'' by Anthony Kenny 2007 {{ISBN|0-19-875272-5}} p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of Logos from the higher principle, and ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' (loving) upward from the lower principle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Enneads'' by Plotinus, [[Stephen MacKenna]], John M.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Logos (Islam)}}
The concept of the ''logos'' also exists in [[Islam]], where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical [[Sunni]] [[Sufism|mystics]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], as well as by certain [[Shi'a]] thinkers, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L., "Kalām", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., "ʿAḳl", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sunni Islam]], the concept of the ''logos'' has been given many different names by the denomination's [[metaphysician]]s, mystics, and philosophers, including ''ʿaql'' ("Intellect"), ''al-insān al-kāmil'' ("Universal Man"), ''kalimat Allāh'' ("Word of God"), ''haqīqa muḥammadiyya'' ("The Muhammadan Reality"), and ''nūr muḥammadī'' ("The Muhammadan Light").

===''ʿAql''===
One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is ''ʿaql'', which is the "Arabic equivalent to the Greek {{lang|grc|[[nous|νοῦς]]}} ('intellect')."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; In the writings of the Islamic [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers, such as [[al-Farabi]] ({{Circa|872|950&amp;nbsp;AD}}) and [[Avicenna]] (d. 1037),&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; the idea of the ''ʿaql'' was presented in a manner that both resembled "the late Greek doctrine" and, likewise, "corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

The concept of Logos in Sufism is used to relate the "Uncreated" (God) to the "Created" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the Logos. The Logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is "unique" within each region. [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] are seen as the personifications of the Logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism: love &amp; wisdom'' by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 {{ISBN|0-941532-75-5}} p. 242 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVt-EvXnEC4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BMNQNOHXKOMC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false ''Sufi essays''] by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973{{ ISBN|0-87395-233-2}} p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works ''The Ringstones of Wisdom'' (''Fusus al-Hikam'') and ''The Meccan Illuminations'' (''Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya''). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a Logos ([[Kalimah]]), as an aspect of the unique Divine Being. In his view the Divine Being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with Logos providing the link between man and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 39 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the Logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Frazee, "Ibn al-'Arabī and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century", ''Numen'' '''14''' (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229–40.&lt;/ref&gt; although (writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Little |first=John T. |last2= |first2= |date=January 1987 |title=AL-INSĀN AL-KĀMIL: THE PERFECT MAN ACCORDING TO IBN AL-'ARAB? |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x/abstract |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote="Ibn al-'Arabi uses no less than twenty-two different terms to describe the various aspects under which this single Logos may be viewed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobie  |first=Robert J. |date=17 November 2009 |title=Logos and Revelation: Ibn 'Arabi, Meister Eckhart, and Mystical Hermeneutics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWVwT3UpthUC&amp;pg=PA225 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Catholic University of America Press  |page=225 |isbn= 081321677X |quote="For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Henry Whinfield]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0vHUo0wnlgC&amp;pg=PR25 Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maulána Jalálu-'d-Dín Muhammad Rúmí]'', Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), {{ISBN|0-415-24531-1}}, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī]] introduced the ''Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man''. For al-Jīlī, the "perfect man" (associated with the Logos or the Holy Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 98 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jili&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (Logos-''Kalima'') in his ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'') in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, ''Sühan'' appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Betül Avcı, "Character of ''Sühan'' in Şeyh Gâlib’s Romance, ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'')" ''Archivum Ottomanicum'', 32 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2018}}

==Jung's analytical psychology==
[[File:Carl Jung (1912).png|thumb|150px|A 37-year-old [[Carl Jung]] in 1912.]]
[[Carl Jung]] contrasted the critical and rational faculties of logos with the emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements of ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;''C.G. Jung and the psychology of symbolic forms'' by Petteri Pietikäinen 2001 {{ISBN|951-41-0857-4}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's approach, logos vs eros can be represented as "science vs mysticism", or "reason vs imagination" or "conscious activity vs the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;''Mythos and logos in the thought of Carl Jung'' by Walter A. Shelburne 1988 {{ISBN|0-88706-693-3}} p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yV-ZE8pyZjkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jung, logos represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its female counterpart, ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]'':

{{Quote|Woman’s psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung attempted to equate logos and eros, his intuitive conceptions of masculine and feminine consciousness, with the [[alchemical]] Sol and Luna. Jung commented that in a man the lunar [[Anima and animus|anima]] and in a woman the solar [[Anima and animus|animus]] has the greatest influence on consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=jung+eros+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3CR5TLn_IqiM4gbNvYSUBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=jung%20eros%20logos&amp;f=false ''Aspects of the masculine'' by Carl Gustav Jung, John Beebe p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung often proceeded to analyze situations in terms of "paired opposites", e.g. by using the analogy with the eastern [[yin and yang]]&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Gustav Jung: critical assessments'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 1992 {{ISBN|0-415-04830-3}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and was also influenced by the Neoplatonists.&lt;ref&gt;See the Neoplatonic section above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' Jung made some important final remarks about anima and animus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In so far as the spirit is also a kind of "window on eternity"... it conveys to the soul a certain influx divinus... and the knowledge of a higher system of the world, wherein consists precisely its supposed animation of the soul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in this book Jung again emphasized that the animus compensates eros, while the anima compensates logos.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of Jungian psychology: theory, practice and applications'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 2006 {{ISBN|1-58391-147-2}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt7FfLRi17kC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jung&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Multimodal interaction|Modality (human-computer interaction)}}
In [[user interface]] design, a '''mode''' is a distinct setting within a [[computer program]] or any physical machine [[Interface (computing)|interface]], in which the same [[user input]] will produce perceived results different to those that it would in other settings. The best-known '''modal''' interface components are probably the [[Caps lock]] and [[Insert key|Insert]] keys on the standard [[computer keyboard]], both of which put the user's typing into a different mode after being pressed, then return it to the regular mode after being re-pressed.

An interface that uses no modes is known as a '''modeless''' interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/term_321.txl Usability Glossary: modeless] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022205105/http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/term_321.txl |date=2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeless interfaces avoid '''mode errors'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/mode-error/ Usability Glossary: mode error]&lt;/ref&gt; by making it impossible for the user to commit them.

== Definition ==
A precise definition is given by [[Jef Raskin]] in his book ''[[The Humane Interface]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An human-machine interface is modal with respect to a given gesture
when (1) the current [[State (computer science)|state]] of the interface is not the user's [[Wiktionary:locus|locus]]&lt;!-- (sic). Do not change this to "focus"; "locus" is the word used by the source, it means "place". --&gt; of
attention and (2) the interface will execute one among several
different responses to the gesture, depending on the system's current
state." (Page 42).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Raskin's sense and according to his definition, an interface is not modal as long as the user is fully aware of its current state. Raskin refers to this as "locus of attention" (from the [[Latin]] word ''locus'' meaning "place" or "location"). Typically a user is aware of a system state if the state change was purposefully initiated by the user, or if the system gives some strong signals to notify the user of the state change in the place where interaction occurs. If the user's locus of attention changes to a different area, the state of the interface may then represent a mode since the user is no longer aware of it.

==Examples==
{{Expand section|the detailed description of typical uses of modes|date=December 2010}}
Several examples of well-known software have been described as ''modal'' and/or using interface modes:
* [[Text editor]]s – typically are in insert mode by default but can be toggled in and out of [[overtype]] mode by pressing the [[Insert key|Insert]] key.
* [[vi]] – has one mode for inserting text, and a separate mode for entering commands.  There is also an "[[Ex (editor)|ex]]" mode for issuing more complex commands (e.g. search and replace). Under normal circumstances, the editor automatically returns to the previous mode after a command has been issued; however, it is possible to permanently move into this mode using ''Shift-Q''.
* [[Emacs]] – has the concept of "prefix keys", which trigger a modal state by pressing the control key plus a letter key. Emacs then waits for additional keypresses that complete a [[keybinding]]. This differs from ''vi'' in that the mode always ends as soon as the command is called (when the sequence of key presses that activates it is completed). Emacs also has many "major and minor" modes that change the available commands, and may be automatically invoked based on file type to more easily edit files of that type. Emacs modes are not restricted to editing text files; modes exist for [[file browser|file browsing]], [[web browsing]], [[IRC]] and [[email]] and their interaction patterns are equivalent to [[application software]] within the Emacs environment. Modes are written in [[Emacs Lisp]], and all modes may not be included with all versions.
* [[Cisco IOS]] – certain commands are executed in a "command mode".
* Tools chosen from a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] in [[Photo manipulation|photo-editing]] and drawing applications are examples of a modal interface. Some advanced image editors have a feature where the same tools can be accessed nonmodally by a keypress, and remain active as long as the key is held down. Releasing the key returns the interface to the modal tool activated by the palette.
* Video games can use [[game mode]]s as a mechanic to enhance [[gameplay]].
* [[Modal window]]s block all [[workflow]] in the top-level program until the modal window is closed.&lt;ref name="java"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/modality.html|title=How to Use Modality in Dialogs|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mode errors ==
{{See also|User error}}

Modes are often frowned upon in interface design because they are likely to produce '''mode errors''' when the user forgets what state the interface is in, performs an action that is appropriate to a different mode, and gets an unexpected and undesired response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/mode-error/ Glossary: mode error]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/modal Usability Glossary: modal]&lt;/ref&gt; A mode error can be quite startling and disorienting as the user copes with the sudden violation of his or her [[user expectations]].

Problems occur if a change in the system state happens unnoticed (initiated by the system, or by another person, such as the user who was previously using the machine), or if after some time the user forgets about the state change. Another typical problem is a sudden change of state that interrupts a user's activity, such as [[focus stealing]]. In such a situation it can easily happen that the user does some operations with the old state in mind, while the brain has not yet fully processed the signals indicating the state change.

A very frustrating type of modality is created by a mode where the user does not find a way out, in other words, where they cannot find how to restore the previous system state.

===Examples of mode errors===
* The most common source of mode errors may be the [[caps lock|Caps Lock]] key. Other common modes available in [[PC keyboard]]s are [[Insert key|Insert]] and the other [[lock key]]s, [[Num lock]] and [[Scroll lock]]. [[Dead key]]s for diacritics also create a short-term mode, at least if they don't provide visual feedback that the next typed character will be modified.
* PC users whose language is not based on the [[Latin alphabet]] commonly have to interact using two different [[keyboard layout]]s: a local one and [[QWERTY]]. This gives rise to mode errors linked to the current keyboard layout: quite often, the synchronization of "current layout" mode between the human and the interface is lost, and text is typed in a layout which is not the intended one, producing meaningless text and confusion. Keyboard keys in UI elements like "(y/n)" can have opposite effect if a program is translated.
* A frequent example is the sudden appearance of a [[modal window|modal]] [[Alert dialog box|error dialog]] in an application while the user is typing, known as [[focus stealing]]; the user expects the typed text to be introduced into a text field, but the unexpected dialog may discard all the input, or may interpret some keystrokes (like "Y" for "yes" and "N" for "no") in a way that the user did not intend.
* The [[Unix]] [[text editor]] [[vi]] can be notoriously difficult for beginners precisely because it uses modes, and because earlier versions configured mode indication to be turned off by default.
* In many computer video games, the keyboard is used both for controlling the game and typing messages. A user may forget they are in "typing mode" as they attempt to react to something sudden in the game and find the controls unresponsive (and instead their text bar full of the command keys pressed).

* According to the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]], one of the factors contributing to [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] crash was ''"the complexities of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems … which increased the likelihood of mode error".''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.martindoms.com/2011/01/24/poor-ui-design-can-kill/ Poor UI design can kill]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mode confusion was part of the events that led to the loss of [[Air France Flight 447]] in 2009, and the loss of life of 228 people. The pilots reacted to a loss of altitude by pulling on the stick, which would have been an appropriate reaction with the autopilot fully enabled, which would then have  put the aircraft in a climbing configuration. However, the airplane's systems had entered a mode of lesser automation ("direct law" in Airbus terms) due to a blocked airspeed sensor, allowing the pilots to put the plane in a nose-high stall configuration, from which they did not recover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/uss-mccain-collision-ultimately-caused-by-ui-confusion/] BEA final report on the loss of Air France 447&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 17, 2015, the offshore supply vessel "Red7 Alliance" collided with a lock gate of the Kiel Canal in Germany, damaging it severely. An investigation concluded that the levers controlling the ship's [[Azimuth thruster]]s were not used in a way appropriate to the mode they were set to,  resulting in the ship accelerating instead of coming to a stop in the lock.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bsu-bund.de/SharedDocs/pdf/DE/Unfallberichte/2016/Untersuchungsbericht_16_15.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=5] M/V Red7 Alliance investigation report (German)&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 21, 2017, the US Navy destroyer [[USS John S. McCain]] collided with a commercial tanker in the Strait of Malacca, resulting in the loss of life of ten crew members. An investigation conducted by the US military concluded that immediately prior to the collision, helm and propulsion controls had been redistributed between bridge stations, and the bridge crew was not fully aware of that redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/uss-mccain-collision-ultimately-caused-by-ui-confusion/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment ==
Modes are intended to grab the user's full attention and to cause them to acknowledge the content present in them, in particular when critical confirmation from the user is required.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quince.infragistics.com/Patterns/Modal%20Panel.aspx#Context|title=Modal Panel - Context|author=[http://infragistics.com Infragistics.com]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506101851/http://quince.infragistics.com/Patterns/Modal%20Panel.aspx#Context|archivedate=2013-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later use is criticised as ineffective for its intended use (protection against errors in destructive actions) due to [[habituation]].  Actually making the action reversible (providing an "undo" option) is recommended instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aza Raskin]], A List Apart: [http://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning Never Use a Warning When you Mean Undo]&lt;/ref&gt; Though modes can be successful in particular usages to restrict dangerous or undesired operations, especially when the mode is actively maintained by a user as a ''[[Mode (computer interface)#Quasimodes|quasimode]]''.

Modes are sometimes used to represent information pertinent to the task that doesn’t fit well into the main visual flow.&lt;ref name="context"/&gt; Modes can also work as well-understood conventions, such as painting tools.&lt;ref name="glossary"/&gt;

Modal proponents{{Who|date=September 2010}} may argue that many common activities are modal and users adapt to them.  An example of modal interaction is that of driving motor vehicles.  A driver may be surprised when pressing the acceleration pedal does not accelerate the vehicle in the forward direction, most likely because the vehicle has been placed in an operating mode like park, neutral, or reverse.  Modal interfaces require training and experience to avoid mode errors like these.

Interface expert [[Jef Raskin]] came out strongly against modes, writing, "Modes are a significant source of errors, confusion, unnecessary restrictions, and complexity in interfaces." Later he notes, " 'It is no accident that swearing is denoted by #&amp;%!#$&amp;,' writes my colleague, Dr. James Winter; it is 'what a typewriter used to do when you typed numbers when the Caps Lock was engaged'." Raskin dedicated his book [[The Humane Interface]] to describe the principles of a modeless interface for computers. Those principles were implemented in the [[Canon Cat]] and [[Archy]] systems.

Some interface designers have recently taken steps to make [[modal window]]s more obvious and user friendly by darkening the background behind the window or allowing any mouse click outside of the modal window to force the window to close – a design called a [[Lightbox (JavaScript)|Lightbox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/application-design.html|title=10 Best Application UIs|author=Jakob Nielsen, Alertbox}}&lt;/ref&gt; – thus alleviating the risk of modal errors. [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] states as an advantage of modal dialogs that it improves user awareness. "When something does need fixing, it's better to make sure that the user knows about it." For this goal, the Lightbox design provides strong visual contrast of the dialog over the rest of the visuals. However, while such a method may reduce the risk of inadvertent wrong interactions, it does not solve the problem that the modal window blocks use of the application's normal features and so prevents the user from taking any action to fix the difficulty, or even from scrolling the screen to bring into view information which they need to correctly choose from the options the modal window presents, and it does nothing to alleviate the user's frustration at having blundered into a dead end from which they cannot escape without some more or less destructive consequence.

[[Larry Tesler]], of [[Xerox PARC]] and [[Apple Computer]], disliked modes sufficiently to get a personalized license plate for his car that reads: "NO MODES". He has used this plate from the early 1980s to the present, on various cars. Along with others, he has also been using the phrase "Don't Mode Me In" for years as a rally cry to eliminate or reduce modes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/lisalist@mail.maclaunch.com/msg00409.html Origins of the Apple Human Interface] by Larry Tesler, Chris Espinosa&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Wyman, the designer of a [[multi-touch]] table for a [[Denver Art Museum]] art exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2009/06/technology-for-experiences-sake-guest.html Technology for Experience's Sake: Guest Post by Bruce Wyman]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that interfaces for several simultaneous users must be modeless, in order to avoid bringing any single user into focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ixda.org/discuss.php?post=43435#43442 Bruce Wyman's post] at the ixda.org mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design recommendations==

===Avoid when possible===
[[Image:Arret.jpg|thumb|Small signs make explicit the mappings from signal to roads]]
Alternatives to modes such as the [[undo]] command and the [[Recycle bin (computing)|recycle bin]] are recommended when possible.&lt;ref name="Implementation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quince.infragistics.com/Patterns/Modal%20Panel.aspx#Implementation|title=Modal Panel - Implementation|author=[http://infragistics.com Infragistics.com]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506101851/http://quince.infragistics.com/Patterns/Modal%20Panel.aspx#Implementation|archivedate=2013-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCI researcher [[Donald Norman]] argues that the best way to avoid mode errors, in addition to clear indications of state, is helping the users to construct an accurate [[mental model]] of the system which will allow them to predict the mode accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358092|title=Design rules based on analyses of human error}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is demonstrated, for example, by some [[stop sign]]s at road intersections. A driver may be [[Operant conditioning|conditioned]] by a [[four-way stop]] [[sign]] near his or her home to assume that similar intersections will also be four way stops. If it happens to be only two way, the driver could proceed through if he or she sees no other cars. Especially if there is an obstructed view, a car could come though and hit the first car broadside. An improved design alleviates the problem by including a small diagram showing which of the directions have a stop sign and which don't, thus improving the [[situational awareness]] of drivers.

===Proper placement===
{{See also|Modal_window#Recommendations|l1=Design recommendations for modal windows}}
Modal controls are best placed where the focus is in the task flow.&lt;ref name="Implementation"/&gt;  For example, a modal window can be placed next to the [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control element]] that triggers its activation. Modal controls can be disruptive, so efforts should be made to reduce their capacity to block user work. After completing the task for which the mode was activated, or after a cancel action such as the [[Escape key]], returning to the previous state when a mode is dismissed will reduce the negative impact.

===Quasimodes===
In the book ''[[The Humane Interface]]'', Jef Raskin championed what he termed ''quasimodes'', which are modes that are kept in place only through some constant action on the part of the user; such modes are also called ''spring-loaded modes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/spring-loaded-mode/ Usability Glossary: spring-loaded mode]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''quasimode'' is a composite of the Latin prefix ''[[wiktionary:quasi-|quasi-]]'' (which means ''almost'', ''to some degree'') and the English word "[[wiktionary:Mode|mode]]".

[[Modifier key]]s on the keyboard, such as the [[Shift key]], the [[Alt key]] and the [[Control key]], are all examples of a quasimodal interface.

The application enters into that mode as long as the user is performing a conscious action, like pressing a key and keeping it pressed while invoking a command. If the sustaining action is stopped without executing a command, the application returns to a neutral status.

The purported benefit of this technique is that the user doesn't have to remember the current state of the application when invoking a command: the same action will always produce the same perceived result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.useit.com/alertbox/springload.html Spring-Loaded Modes], Jakob Nielsen.&lt;/ref&gt; An interface that uses quasimodes only and has no full modes is still modeless according to Raskin's definition.

The [[StickyKeys]] feature turns a quasimode into a mode by serializing keystrokes of modifier keys with normal keys, so that they don't have to be pressed simultaneously. In this case the increased possibility of a mode error is largely compensated for by the improved [[accessibility]] for users with physical disabilities.

'''Moshe Weinfeld'''  (also ''Weinfield'', [[Hebrew]]: משה ויינפלד) (born 1925 in [[Nowy Sącz]], [[Poland]]; died 29 April 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=823|title=Moshe Weinfeld, 1925–2009|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|first=Nili|last=Wazana|date=14 May 2009|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[Bible]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and recipient of the 1994 [[Israel Prize]] for [[Bible]].

==Biography==

In 1965, Weinfeld earned a PhD at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1969, he was appointed [[senior lecturer]] in Hebrew University's [[Bible]] department. In 1973, Weinfeld became [[associate professor]], and he was promoted to [[full professor]] in 1978.

Over the course of his career, Weinfeld held various positions in the following academic institutions: [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (1967–1969); [[Brandeis University]] (1968); [[University of California, San Diego]] (1981); [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1989).

==Awards==

* In 1993, Weinfeld was awarded the Ben-Zvi Prize for the [[History of Palestine]] for his Hebrew book ''From Joshua to Josiah: Turning Points in the History of Israel From the Conquest of the Land Until the Fall of Judah'', Jerusalem: Magnes Press (1992).
* In 1994, he was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for Bible.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1994 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/TashnagTashsab/TASNAG_TASNAT_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashnad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10428">The '''National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition''' ('''NCCDC''') is the championship event for the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition system – the largest college-level cyber defense competition in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalccdc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The event is held annually in the San Antonio area.

In an effort to help facilitate the development of a regular, national level cyber security exercise, the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security at the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] (UTSA) hosted the first Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition for the Southwestern region in May 2005.  On June 29, 2010, United States House legislature passed recognizing the National CCDC for promoting cyber security curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hr111-1244&lt;/ref&gt;

While similar to other cyber defense competitions in many aspects, the NCCDC, is unique in that it focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing network infrastructure. While other exercises examine the abilities of a group of students to design, configure, and protect a network over the course of an entire semester, this competition is focused on the more operational task of assuming administrative and protective duties for an existing commercial network. Teams are assessed based on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services such as mail servers and web servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or removal of additional services, and balance security needs against business needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://seccdc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The NCCDC is operated under the rules as published by the Center for Infrastructure and Assurance at UTSA.&lt;ref&gt;http://cias.utsa.edu/competitions.html&lt;/ref&gt; The current rules can be found at [http://www.nationalccdc.org/ Homepage].

==Regional Competitions==
Several regional groups have formed to provide qualifying events for the NCCDC annual event. Some regions share and overlap various states. Every effort is made to make each regional event consistent with the NCCDC event.

'''Package testing''' or '''packaging testing''' involves the measurement of a characteristic or property involved with [[packaging]]. This  includes packaging materials, packaging components,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Testing measures the effects and interactions of the levels of packaging, the package contents, external forces, and end-use.

It can involve controlled [[laboratory]] [[experiment]]s, subjective evaluations by people, or field testing.  Documentation is important:  formal [[test method]], test report, photographs, video, etc.

Testing can be a [[qualitative property|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] procedure.  Package testing is often a [[physical test]]. With some types of packaging such as food and pharmaceuticals, [[chemical test]]s are conducted to determine suitability of [[food contact materials]].  Testing programs range from simple tests with little [[replication (statistics)|replication]] to more thorough [[experimental design]]s.

Package testing can extend for the full life cycle.  Packages can be tested for their ability to be [[recycle]]d and their ability to degrade as surface [[litter]], in a sealed [[landfill]] or under [[compost]]ing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D6954 Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes ==
Packaging testing might have a variety of purposes, such as:
* Determine if, or verify that, the requirements of a [[specification]], [[regulation]], or [[contract]] are met
* Decide if a [[new product development]] program is on track: Demonstrate [[proof of concept]]
* Provide [[Technical standard|standard]] [[data]] for other scientific, engineering, and [[quality assurance]] functions
* Validate suitability for end-use
* Provide a basis for  [[technical communication]]
* Provide a technical means of comparison of several options
* Provide [[evidence]] in legal proceedings: [[product liability]], [[patents]], product claims, etc.
* Help solve problems with current packaging
* Help identify potential cost savings in packaging

Packaging tests can be used for:
* Subjecting packages (and contents) to stresses and dynamics found in the field
* Reproducing the types of damage to packages and contents found in actual shipments
* Controlling the uniformity of production of packages or components

== Importance of testing ==

For some types of products, package testing is mandated by regulations: [[food]]. [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[medical device]]s, [[dangerous goods]], etc.  This may cover both the design qualification, periodic retesting, and control of the packaging processes.  Processes may be controlled by a variety of [[quality management system]]s such as [[HACCP]], [[statistical process control]], validation protocols, ISO 9000, etc.

For unregulated products, testing can be required by a contract or governing specification.  The degree of package testing can often be a business decision.  [[Risk management]] may involve factors such as
* costs of packaging
* costs of package testing
* value of contents being shipped
* value of customer’s good will
* product liability exposure
* other potential costs of inadequate packaging
* etc.

With distribution packaging, one vital [[Packaging and labeling#Package development considerations|packaging development consideration]] is to determine if a packaged-product is likely to be damaged in the process of getting to the final customer. A primary purpose of a package is to ensure the safety of a product during transportation and storage. If a product is damaged during this process, then the package has failed to accomplish a primary objective and the customer will either return the product or be unlikely to purchase the product altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kiyohide |first=Hasegawa |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Recent Trend of Transport Packaging Test |journal=JPI Journal|volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=716–722 |url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200419/000020041904A0658492.php |accessdate=16 Feb 2010 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Package testing is often a formal part of [[Project management]] programs.  Packages are usually tested when there is a new packaging design, a revision to a current design, a change in packaging material, and various other reasons. Testing a new packaging design before full scale manufacturing can save  time and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medicaldesign.com/contract-manufacturing/packaging/package_testing_risk_0608/ |title=Package Testing as Risk Management |accessdate=2010-02-16 |last= Dvorak|first= Paul|date=  June 1, 2008 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory affiliation ==
Many suppliers or vendors offer limited material and package testing as a free service to customers.  It is common for packagers to partner with reputable suppliers: Many suppliers have certified quality management systems such as [[ISO 9000]] or allow customers to conduct  technical and quality audits.  Data from testing is commonly shared.  There is sometimes a risk that supplier testing may tend to be self-serving and not completely impartial.

Large companies often have their own packaging staff and a package testing and development [[laboratory]].  Corporate engineers know their products, manufacturing capabilities, logistics system, and their customers best.  Cost reduction of existing products and cost avoidance for new products have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Another option is to use a paid [[consultant]], [[Independent contractor]], and third-party [[independent testing laboratory]].  They are commonly chosen for specialized expertise, for access to certain test equipment, for surge projects, or where independent testing is otherwise required.  Many have certifications and accreditations:  ISO 9000, [[ISO/IEC 17025]], and various governing agencies.

== Procedures ==
Several [[standards organizations]] publish test methods for package testing.  Included are:
* [[International Organization for Standardization]], ISO
* [[ASTM International]]
* [[European Committee for Standardization]]. CEN
* [[TAPPI]]
* Military Standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [http://www.ista.org/ ISTA (International Safe Transit Association)]
* etc.
Governments and regulators publish some packaging test methods.  There are also many corporate test standards in use.  A review of technical literature and patents provides good options to consider for test procedures.

Researchers are not restricted to the use of published standards but can modify existing test methods or develop procedures specific to their particular needs.  If a test is conducted with a deviation from a published test method or if a new method is employed, the test report must fully disclose the procedure.

== Materials testing ==
[[File:Inspekt desk 50kN IMGP8563.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Materials and components are often evaluated on a [[universal testing machine]]]]

The basis of packaging design and performance is the component materials.  The [[physical properties]], and sometimes [[chemical properties]], of the materials need to be communicated to [[packaging engineer]]s to aid in the design process.  Suppliers publish [[data sheet]]s and other technical communications that include the typical or average relevant physical properties and the test method these are based upon.  Sometimes these are adequate.  Other times, additional material and component testing is required by the packager or supplier to better define certain characteristics.

When a final package design is complete, the specifications for the component materials needs to be communicated to suppliers.  Packaging materials testing is often needed to identify the critical material characteristics and [[engineering tolerance]]s. These are used to prepare and enforce specifications.

For example, [[shrink film]] data might include: [[tensile strength]] (MD and CD), [[elongation (materials science)|elongation]],  [[Elastic modulus]], [[surface energy]],  thickness, [[Moisture vapor transmission rate]], [[Oxygen transmission rate]], heat seal strength, heat sealing conditions, heat shrinking conditions, etc.  Average and [[process capability]] are often provided. The chemical properties related for use as  Food contact materials may be necessary.

== Testing with people ==
Some types of package testing do not use scientific instruments but use people for the evaluation.

The regulations for [[child-resistant packaging]] require a test protocol that involves children. Samples of the test packages are given to a prescribed population of children. With specified 50-child panels, a high percentage must be unable to open a test package within 5 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher = CPSC
  | url = http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/regsumpppa.pdf
  | format = PDF
  | doi =
  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adults are also tested for their ability to open a child-resistant package.

Consumer packages are often evaluated by [[focus group]]s. People evaluate the package features in a room monitored by video cameras.  The consumer responses are treated qualitatively for feedback into the new packaging process.

Some food packagers use [[organoleptic]] evaluations.  People use their senses (taste, smell, etc.) to determine if a package component has tainted the food in the package.

A new package may be evaluated in a [[test market]] that uses people to try the packages at home.  Consumers have the opportunity to buy a product, perhaps with a coupon or discount.  Return [[postcard]]s or [[Internet]] sites provide feedback to package developers.  Perhaps the most critical feedback is repeated sales items in the new package. Packaging evaluations are an important part of [[marketing research]].

Legibility of text on packaging and labels is always subjective due to the inherent variations of people. Efforts have been made to help better quantify this by people in a laboratory: still using people for the evaluation but also employing a test apparatus to help reduce variability.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D7298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some laboratory tests are conducted but still result in an [[observation]] by people.  Some test procedures call for a judgment by test engineers whether or not pre-established acceptance criteria have been met.

== Conditioning, testing atmosphere ==
[[File:Environmental chamber.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Environmental chamber]] to simulate temperatures and humidities encountered by packages]]

The environmental conditions of testing are critical.  The measured performance of many packages is affected by the conditioning and testing atmospheres.  For example, [[paper]] based products are strongly affected by their moisture content:  [[Relative humidity]] needs to be controlled.  Plastic products are often strongly affected by [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marcondes |first=Jorge |author2=Hatton |author3=Graham |author4=Schueueman |date=July 2003|title=Effect of temperature on the cushioning properties of some foamed plastic materials|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=69–76 |id=|url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions of 23&amp;nbsp;°C (73.4&amp;nbsp;°F) and 50% relative humidity are common but other standard testing conditions are also published in material and package test standards. Engineering tolerances for the conditions are also specified.  Often the package is conditioned to the specified environment and tested under those conditions.  This can be in a conditioned room or in a chamber enclosing the test.  With some testing, the package is conditioned to a specified environment, then is removed to ambient conditions and quickly tested.  The test report needs to state the actual conditions used.

Engineers have found it important to know the effects of the full range of expected conditions on package performance.  This can be through investigating published technical literature, obtaining supplier documentation, or by conducting controlled tests at diverse conditions.

== Degradation of product ==
[[File:Heat Sealing Film for Permeability Test.jpg|right|thumb|170px| [[Heat sealer]] used to prepare  bag of  lettuce for shelf life testing]]
Laboratory tests can help determine the [[shelf life]] of a package and its contents under a variety of conditions. This is particularly important for foods, pharmaceuticals, some chemicals, and a variety of products. The testing is usually product specific: the mechanisms of degradation are often different. Exposures to expected and elevated temperatures and humidities are commonly used for shelf life testing.  The ability of packaging to control product degradation is frequently a subject of laboratory and field evaluations.

=== Relevant tests ===
:ASTM E2454 Standard Guide for Sensory Evaluation Methods to Determine the Sensory Shelf -life of Consumer Products
:DoD 4140.27M Shelf Life Management Manual, 2000
:ISO 11987 Ophthalmic Optics, Contact Lenses, Determination of Shelf Life

=== Barrier Properties ===
{{Main|Moisture vapor transmission rate| Oxygen transmission rate|  Carbon dioxide transmission rate}}

Many products degrade with exposure to the atmosphere: foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, etc.   The ability of a package to control the [[permeation]] and penetration of gasses is vital for many types of products.  Tests are often conducted on the packaging materials but also on the completed packages, sometimes after being subjected to flexing, handling, vibration, or temperature.

== Degradation of Packages ==
Packages can degrade with exposure to temperature, humidity, time, sterlization (steam, radiation, gas, etc.), sunlight, and other environmental factors. For some types of packaging, it is common to test for possible [[corrosion]] of metals, [[polymer degradation]], and [[weather testing of polymers]].  Several types of [[accelerated aging]]  of packaging and materials can be accomplished in a laboratory.

Exposure to elevated temperatures accelerates some degradation mechanisms.  An [[Arrhenius equation]] is often used to correlate certain chemical reactions at different temperatures, based on the proper choice of  [[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] coefficients.

As with any laboratory testing, validating field trials are important.

:ASTM F1980– Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile Medical Device Packages
:ASTM G151 Standard Practice for Exposing Non-metallic Materials in Accelerated Test Devices that are Laboratory Light Sources

== Vacuum testing ==
[[File:Vacuum Chamber Package testing.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Vacuum chamber for testing leaks in packaging component]]
[[Vacuum chamber]]s are used to test the ability of a package to withstand low pressures.  This can be to:
# Determine the ability of packages to withstand low pressures that might be encountered.  this could be in an air shipment or high altitude truck shipment.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, P., Burgess, G., Kremer, M. and Lockhart, H. Effect of Reduced Pressure, Vibration and Orientation to Simulate High Altitude Testing of Liquid Pharmaceutical Glass and Plastic Bottles.

== Shock and impact ==
[[File:Instrumented Drop Test.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Instrumented drop test of cushioned package to measure the transmitted shock]]
Both primary (consumer) packages and shipping containers have a risk of being dropped or being [[impact (mechanics)|impacted]] by other items.  Package integrity and product protection are important packaging functions. Tests are conducted to measure the resistance of packages and products to controlled laboratory shock and impact.

Testing also determines the effectiveness of package [[cushioning]] to isolate fragile products from [[shock (mechanics)|shock]]. [[Instrumentation]] is used to measure the shock transmitted to a cushioned product.

== Package Insulation ==
Many packages are used for products that are sensitive to temperature.  The ability of [[insulated shipping container]]s to protect their contents from exposure to temperature fluctuations can be measured in a laboratory. The testing can be of empty containers or of full containers with appropriate jell or [[ice pack]]s, contents, etc.  Ovens, freezers, and environmental chambers are commonly used for this and other types of packaging.

Digital [[temperature data logger]]s are used to measure temperatures experienced in different distribution systems.  This data is sometimes used to develop unique laboratory  test methods for that distribution system.

==Thermal shock==
Some packages, particularly glass, can be sensitive to sudden changes in temperature: [[Thermal shock]].   One method of testing involves rapid movement from cold to hot water baths, and back.

===Relevant tests===
:ASTM C149  -Standard Test Method for Thermal Shock Resistance of Glass Containers
:[[MIL-STD-810]]G METHOD 503.5

==Handles==
[[Package handle]]s (and hand holes in packages) assist carrying and handling packages. Objective laboratory  procedures are frequently used to help determine performance.  [[Test fixture|Fixtured]] ‘’hands’’ of various designs are used to hold a handle (sometimes two handles for a box).  Most common are “jerk testing’’ by modified drop test procedures or use of  the constant pull rates of a [[universal testing machine]].  Other procedures use a static force by hanging a heavily loaded package for an extended time or even using a [[centrifuge]].

== Vibration ==
[[File:Vibration tester.png|thumb|right|170px|Vibration tester to simulate vibration
[[Frequency|frequencies]] at which packaged products are subjected during shipments]]

[[Vibration]] is encountered during shipping (vehicle vibration, rough roads, etc.) and movement on [[conveyor]]s.  Potential vibration damage may include:
* fractures and [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] damage
* loose wires, screw caps, etc.
* bruises on soft products (fruit, etc.)
* surface abrasion
* etc.
The ability of a package to withstand these vibrations and to protect the contents can be measured by several laboratory test procedures.  Some allow searching for the particular frequencies of vibration that have potential for damage. [[Modal testing]] methodologies are sometimes employed. Others use specified bands of random vibration to better represent complex vibrations measured in field studies of distribution environments.

== Compression ==
[[File:Army.mil-2007-02-07-153623.jpg|thumb|150 px|Compression test for steel drum]]
{{Main|Container compression test}}
Compression testing relates to stacking or crushing of packages, particularly shipping containers.  It usually measures of the force required to crush a package, stack of packages, or a unit load.  Packages can be empty or filled as for shipment.   A force-deflection curve used to obtain the peak load or other desired points.  Other tests use a constant load and measure the time to failure or to a critical deflection.

Dynamic compression is sometimes tested by shock or impact testing with an additional load to crush the test package.  Dynamic compression also takes place in stacked vibration testing.

== Large loads ==
[[File:Shipping container - rotary drop test.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Rotational corner drop test of [[wooden box]]]]

Large [[pallet]] loads, [[bulk box]]es,  [[wooden box]]es, and [[crate]]s can be evaluated by many of the other test procedures previously listed.  In addition, some special test methods are available for these larger loads.

== Test Protocols for Shipping Containers ==
Shipping containers are often subjected to sequential tests involving a combination of individual test methods.  A variety of standard  test schedules or protocols are available for evaluating transport packaging.  They are used to help determine the ability of complete and filled shipping containers to various types of [[logistics]] systems.  Some test the general ruggedness of the shipping container while others have been shown to reproduce the types of damage encountered in distribution.  Some base the type and severity of testing on formal studies of the distribution environment: [[instrumentation]], data loggers, and observation. Test cycles with these documented elements better simulate parts of certain logistics shipping environments.

=== Field trials ===
:Laboratory testing can often help identify shipping container constructions that, in general, should perform well in the field.  Of course, laboratory tests cannot fully reproduce the full range of field hazards, their magnitudes, nor their frequency.  [[Field experiment]]s are often conducted to help validate the laboratory testing.

:The advantage of laboratory testing is that it subjects replicate packages to identical sets of test sequences: a relatively small number of samples often can suffice.  Field hazards, by their nature, are highly variable: thus repeated shipments do not receive the same types or magnitudes of drops, vibrations, kicks, impacts, abrasion, etc.  Because of this uncontrolled variability, more replicate sample shipments are often necessary.

:Larger scale test markets are used to give additional assurance of performance and acceptability for a new or revised packaged-product.  Feedback is carefully obtained and evaluated.   Feedback on package performance continues when full production and distribution have been achieved.

== Product requirements ==
In addition, package testing often relates to the specific product inside the package.  Some broad categories of products and special package testing considerations follow:

=== Food packaging ===
Foods categories such as fresh [[produce]], [[frozen food]]s, [[irradiated food]]s, fresh fish, [[canned food]]s, etc. have regulatory requirements and special packaging needs.  Package testing often relates to:
:::[[Food safety]]
:::Compatibility of the package with the food
:::Migration of material from the packaging to the food
:::Shelf life
:::Barrier properties, porosity, package atmosphere, etc
:::Special quality assurance needs, [[good manufacturing practice]]s, HACCP, validation protocols, etc

=== Pharmaceutical packaging ===
Packaging for drugs and [[pharmaceutical]]s is highly regulated.  Special testing needs include:
:::Safety of drugs and pharmaceuticals
:::Barrier properties
:::Shelf life
:::Compatibility of package with the drugs
:::Sterility
:::Tamper resistance, child resistance, etc
:::Special quality assurance needs, good manufacturing practices, validation protocols, etc
{{Main|Validation (drug manufacture)}}

=== Medical Packaging ===
Packaging for medical materials, [[medical devices]], [[health care]] supplies, etc., have special user requirements and is highly regulated. Barrier properties, durability, visibility, sterility and strength need to be controlled; usually with documented test results for initial designs and for production.

Assurance of sterility and suitability for use are critical.  For example, medical devices and products are often sterilized in the package.  The sterility must be maintained throughout distribution to allow immediate use by physicians.  A series of special packaging tests is used to measure the ability of the package to maintain sterility.  [[Verification and validation]] protocols are rigidly maintained.

=== Dangerous Goods ===
Packaging of hazardous materials, or dangerous goods, are highly regulated.  There are some material and construction requirements but also performance testing is required. The testing is based on the packing group (hazard level) of the contents, the quantity of material, and the type of container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Painting conservation''' is the multidisciplinary and skilled technical practice of conserving and restoring [[paintings]] comprising the three core specialisms of [[easel painting conservation]]&lt;ref&gt;Hill Stoner, J. and Rushfield, R. (Eds.) (2012). Conservation of Easel Paintings, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[wall painting conservation]] and the [[conservation of works on paper]]. Skills, technical approach, relevant scientific knowledge and ethical considerations vary across the specialisms, which each tend to have distinct training programmes and practice groups. Painting conservators recruit knowledge and skills from fields including [[art history]], [[fine art]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[environmental science]]. The process of restoring a painting may, in some instances, return its appearance to a likely original state, as intended by the artist when it was first created. However, in reality, remediating restoration treatments and conservation techniques achieve a spectrum of possible outcomes appropriate to the nature of the damage and deterioration, the fabric and materials of the artwork, historical period and ethical factors. A broad range of treatments can be carried out on easel paintings including the structural repair of canvas that has been torn or degraded by ageing&lt;ref&gt;Bustin, M. and Caley, T. (Eds.) (2003). Alternatives to Lining: Structural Treatment of Paintings on Canvas without Lining, London: UKIC.&lt;/ref&gt; the removal of dirt, cleaning of discoloured varnishes and the infilling and in-painting (or retouching) paint losses. A [[preventive conservation]] approach may also be taken, involving secondary protective measures such as installing moisture barriers to the reverse of frames, [[UV light]] protective glazing or stretcher bar linings&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/02/paintings-on-canvas-lining-and-alternatives#footnote19_7jx14r1&lt;/ref&gt;,  to protect paintings from further deterioration.

{{distinguish|text=the '''play-out groove''' leading to the centre of a [[gramophone record]], or '''playouts''' used in [[Monte Carlo tree search]]}}
{{unreferenced|date=March 2009}}

In broadcasting, '''playout''' is a term for the transmission of radio or TV channels from the broadcaster into [[broadcast network]]s that delivers the content to the [[audience]]. Those networks can consist of terrestrial transmitters for analogue or [[Digital audio broadcasting|digital radio]] and [[Digital TV|TV]], [[Cable television|cable networks]] or [[Satellite television|satellites]] (either for direct reception, [[Direct To Home|DTH]], or intended for [[cable television headend]]s).

The playout happens in [[master control]] in a '''playout area''', which can be either situated in the [[central apparatus room]] or in purposely built '''playout centres''', which can be owned by a broadcaster or run by an independent specialist company that has been contracted to handle the playout for a number of channels from different broadcasters.

Some of the larger playout centres in [[Europe]], [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[United States]] handle well in excess of 50 radio and TV "feeds". Feeds would often consist of several different versions of a core service, often different language versions or with separately scheduled content, such as local opt outs for news or promotions.

==Playout systems==
[[Centralcasting]] is multi-channel playout that generally uses [[broadcast automation]] systems with [[broadcast programming]] applications. These systems generally work in a similar way, controlling [[video server]]s, [[video tape recorder]] (VTR) devices, Flexi[[cart]]s, audio [[mixing console]]s, [[vision mixer]]s and [[video router]]s, and other devices using a [[serial communications]] [[9-Pin Protocol]] ([[RS-232]] or [[RS-422]]).  This provides deterministic control, enabling frame accurate playback, [[Instant replay]] or video switching.  Many systems consist of a front end [[Operator (profession)|operator]] interface on a separate platform to the controllers – e.g. a Windows [[GUI]] will present a friendly easy to use method of editing a playlist, but actually control would be done on a platform with a "real time" operating system such that any large scale playlist amendments do not cause any delays to device control.

Most broadcast automation systems will have a series of common device drivers built in, for example Sony VTR control (aka Sony Serial), Louth [[Video Disk Control Protocol]] (VDCP, a [[proprietary communications protocol]]), [[General Purpose Interface (broadcasting)|General Purpose Interface]] (GPI), or Grass Valley Group M21 Master Control.  This ensures that a broadcast automation system bought "off the shelf" will at least be able to ingest and playout content, although may not be able to take advantage of more efficient methods of control.  Most server, and especially most [[digital on-screen graphic]] and [[character generator]] (CG) manufacturers will have a specific [[device driver]] for their device, with increasing degrees of complexity, and different automation companies will include these drivers to enhance their product or to fit a customers need.

This is the "traditional" method of Playout Automation, where there are multiple devices.  Modern automation systems use the Automated Playout method, which is where the broadcast server fulfills the functions of the multiple devices, and is a self-contained system (see Channel in a Box section below).

==Playout devices==
Playout will usually involve an [[airchain]] of devices which begin with content, typically stored on [[video server]], and ultimately an output, either as an ([[Asynchronous serial interface]]) (ASI) / IP or ([[Serial Digital Interface]]) (SDI) for on pass to a distribution company.

The devices in the chain depend on the service required under the contact with the Channel.  Typically a standard television channel would require a [[Master Control]] [[Video switcher]], and/or a [[Video router]] to allow switching of live sources.  This video switcher may include other functions such as [[keying (graphics)]] (also known as Down Stream Keyers), Audio Overs for mixing in [[voice over]]s (VO) or announcements, and facilitate transitions between events, such as a fade through black or [[crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfade]] (also known as mix).  
 
Other devices include:

'''Graphics inserters''' – At least one Graphics inserter, or one with several layers.  This allows for [[Station identification]]/Logo/[[Digital on-screen graphic]] (Dog or Bug) insertion, and can also be' used for [[end credits]] sequences, coming next graphics or programme information straps

'''Subtitling inserters''' –  This can be either closed or open – i.e. in vision as a graphic for all to see, or closed either as an MPEG stream item, [[Closed Captioning]] or [[World System Teletext]].

'''Audio servers''' – An audio playout system would provide scheduled voiceovers

'''Aspect Ratio Converters''' – These alter the picture shape or send an embedded signal to allow the material format to be displayed correctly on a particular feed (e.g. Widescreen on a standard non-widescreen Analogue terrestrial feed)

Some of these more advanced devices require information from the playlist, and so do not tend to use an RS422/232 driver, but a complex XML based system which allows for more complex metadata to be passed, e.g. a "Now" or "Next" Graphic can be created from a template using text information from the playlist.

In recent years there has been a move to replicate all of these functions in a single system, often called a "channel in a box" solution.  These are often cheaper to introduce and allow for a more scalable Playout system.

==Playout Centers==
Playout is one of the basic infrastructure of a playout center. Mostly called as channel in a box server, but basically composed of playout servers  with integrated graphics and IP or ASI output. Aim of playout centers is mostly to serve customers a simple file based television facility. Up-link and Channel in a box servers simply provide the facility.

==Workflow==

A common workflow is for the broadcast automation system to have a recording schedule to ingest material from a satellite or line feed source and then time-shift that material based on a playlist or schedule. 

The playout schedule will have been created in the customer's [[broadcast programming]] scheduling system and exported into a format suitable to be used in the Playout system.  There is a move to SMPTE-22, known as [[Broadcast Exchange Format]] (BXF) to try to standardise the messaging involved in this interaction.

The resulting playlist is "loaded" into the appropriate channel of the broadcast automation system in advance of the transmission time.  Various processes will take place to ensure the content is available on the correct servers for playout at the right time, typically this involves advance requests to move material from deep storage such as Tape Archives or FTP Clusters to Broadcast Video servers, often using FTP.

On playing out the material, the audio and video signals are usually transported from the playout area to the network via a [[studio/transmitter link]] (STL), which may be fibre backlink, microwave or satellite uplink.

Playout is often referred to as ''Presentation'' or ''Transmission (TX)'', and is under control of an [[automatic transmission system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68897">'''Present day Mars habitability analogue environments on Earth''' are environments that share potentially relevant [[astrobiological]] conditions with Mars. These include sites that are analogues of potential subsurface habitats, and deep subsurface habitats.&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues/&gt; For analogues more generally see [[Terrestrial Analogue Sites]].

A few places on Earth, such as the hyper-arid core of the high Atacama desert and the McMurdo dry valleys in Antarctica approach the dryness of current Mars surface conditions. In some parts of Antarctica, the only water available is in films of brine on salt / ice interfaces. There is life there, but it is rare, in low numbers, and often hidden below the surface of rocks (endoliths), making the life hard to detect. Indeed, these sites are used for testing sensitivity of future life detection instruments for Mars.

Other analogues duplicate some of the conditions that may occur in particular locations on Mars. These include ice caves, the icy fumaroles of [[Mount Erebus]], hot springs, or the sulfur rich mineral deposits of the Rio Tinto region in Spain.

These Mars analogue environments are used for furthering the study of [[astrobiology]]. For instance, they are used for testing life detection instruments to be sent to Mars, as a source for species to be tested for their ability to survive on Mars, and as a way to study how Earth life copes in conditions that resemble conditions on Mars. They may also give us some insight into adaptations that native Mars life could use to survive.

==Precision of analogues==
Mars surface conditions are not exactly reproduced anywhere on Earth&lt;!-- is it that the surface conditions "are not" reproduced or "cannot" be reproduced? and why is that? is it primarily due to differences in atmosphere? sentence should give a reason --&gt; so Earth surface analogues for Mars are necessarily partial analogues. Some Earth cave and deep subsurface analogues may be more exact analogues of Mars surface conditions (apart from the levels of gravity), if similar conditions occur on Mars. Here are some of the most significant differences between Earth and Mars surface conditions, with remarks on Mars' closest analogues on Earth:

* '''Ionizing radiation'''. Curiosity measured levels on Mars similar to the interior of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), which is far higher than surface Earth levels - however adaptations for desiccation resistance also give some Earth microbes high levels of ionizing radiation resistance - they can repair single and double breaks of their DNA within hours using the example of still intact DNA to repair breaks in the damaged DNA.&lt;ref name="DieserBattista2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dieser|first1=M.|last2=Battista|first2=J.

* '''Atmosphere'''. The Mars atmosphere is a near vacuum while Earth's is not.

Earth does however have some areas though that are highly oxidizing, such as the soda lakes, and though not direct analogues, they create conditions that may be duplicated in thin films of brines on Mars. Earth even has some perchlorates, the most oxidized state, in its deserts, with an estimated {{convert|100000|to|3000000|tonne}} "global inventory".&lt;ref&gt;

* '''Temperature'''. Nowhere on Earth reproduces the extreme changes in temperature that happen within a single day on Mars.
* '''Dry ice'''. The Mars surface consists of dry ice in many areas. Even in equatorial regions, dry ice mixed with water forms frosts for about 100 days of the year. On Earth, although temperatures on Earth briefly get cold enough for dry ice to form in the Antarctic interior at high altitudes, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere is too low for dry ice to form because the depositional temperature for dry ice on Earth under 1 bar of pressure is {{convert|-140|C|F|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="AgeeOrton2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agee|first1=Ernest|last2=Orton|first2=Andrea|last3=Rogers|first3=John|title=CO2Snow Deposition in Antarctica to Curtail Anthropogenic Global Warming|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology|volume=52|issue=2|year=2013|pages=281–288|issn=1558-8424|doi=10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0110.1|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0110.1|bibcode=2013JApMC..52..281A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lowest temperature recorded in Antarctica is {{convert|−94.7|C|F|1|abbr=on}}, recorded in 2010 by satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Antarctica records unofficial coldest temperature ever|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2013/12/10/antarctica-cold-record/3950019/|agency=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These partial analogues are still very useful, for instance for:&lt;ref name="PrestonDartnell2014"/&gt;

* Testing life detection equipment which may one day be sent to Mars

* Studying adaptations to conditions similar to those that may occur on Mars

==Atacama desert arid core==
The [[Atacama desert]] plateau lies at an altitude of 3,000 meters and lies between the Pacific and the Andes mountains. Its Mars like features include

* '''Hyper arid''' conditions
* '''Cold''' compared to most arid deserts because of the altitude

The Yungay area at the core of the Atacama desert used to be considered the driest area on Earth for more than a decade, until the discovery that [[#Maria Elena South|Maria Elena South]] is drier in results published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Azua-BustosCaro-Lara2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AstrobioMariaElenaSouth"/&gt; It can go centuries without rainfall, and parts of it have been [[hyper-arid]] for 150&amp;nbsp;million years. The older regions in this area have salts that are amongst the closest analogues of salts on Mars because these regions have nitrate deposits that contain not only the usual chlorides, but also sulfates, [[chlorate]]s, chromates, iodates, and perchlorates.&lt;ref name="Solid32011"/&gt; The infrared spectra are similar to the spectra of bright soil regions of Mars.&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues/&gt;

The Yungay area has been used for testing instruments intended for future life detection missions on Mars, such as the Sample Analysis at Mars instruments for [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]], the Mars Organic Analyzer for [[ExoMars]], and Solid3 for [[Icebreaker Life]], which in 2011, in a test of its capabilities, was able to find a new "microbial oasis" for life two meters below the surface of the Atacama desert.&lt;ref name="Solid32011"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3242637|last1=Parro|first1=Victor|last2=de Diego-Castilla|first2=Graciela|last3=Moreno-Paz|first3=Mercedes|last4=Blanco|first4=Yolanda|last5=Cruz-Gil|first5=Patricia|last6=Rodríguez-Manfredi|first6=José A.|last7=Fernández-Remolar|first7=David|last8=Gómez|first8=Felipe|last9=Gómez|first9=Manuel J.|last10=Rivas|first10=Luis A.|last11=Demergasso|first11=Cecilia|last12=Echeverría|first12=Alex|last13=Urtuvia|first13=Viviana N.|last14=Ruiz-Bermejo|first14=Marta|last15=García-Villadangos|first15=Miriam|last16=Postigo|first16=Marina|last17=Sánchez-Román|first17=Mónica|last18=Chong-Díaz|first18=Guillermo|last19=Gómez-Elvira|first19=Javier|title=A Microbial Oasis in the Hypersaline Atacama Subsurface Discovered by a Life Detector Chip: Implications for the Search for Life on Mars|journal=Astrobiology|volume=11|issue=10|year=2011|pages=969–996|issn=1531-1074|doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0654|bibcode=2011AsBio..11..969P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues2&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, The Open University|title=TN2: The Catalogue of Planetary Analogues, section 2.6.1|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/The_Catalogue_of_Planetary_Analogues.pdf|publisher=Under ESA contract: 4000104716/11/NL/AF|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AtacamaMicrobialOasis&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-02/f-sf-mod021612.php Microbial oasis discovered beneath the Atacama Desert], PUBLIC RELEASE: 16 FEB 2012, [[FECYT]] - SPANISH FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY&lt;/ref&gt; It is the current testing site for the Atacama Rover Astrobiology Drilling Studies (ARADS) project to improve technology and strategies for life detection on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars rover tests driving, drilling and detecting life in Chile's high desert|url=http://www.astrobio.net/also-in-news/mars-rover-tests-driving-drilling-detecting-life-chiles-high-desert/|website=Nasa Astrobiology Magazine|date=Mar 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Tests Life-Detection Drill in Earth’s Driest Place|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasa-tests-life-detection-drill-in-earth-s-driest-place|website=NASA Press Release|date=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments conducted on Mars have also been successfully repeated in this region. In 2003, a group led by [[Chris McKay]] repeated the [[Viking Lander]] experiments in this region and got the same results as those of the Viking landers on Mars: decomposition of the organics by non biological processes.

There was no decrease in the numbers of species as the soil depth increased down to a depth of one meter, although different microbes inhabited different soil depths. There was no colonization of Gypsum, showing the extreme dryness of the site.

No [[archaea]] was detected in this region using the same methods that detected archaea in other regions of the Atacama desert. The researchers said that if this is confirmed in studies of similarly dry sites, it could mean that "there may be adry limit for this domain of life on Earth"&lt;ref name="Azua-BustosCaro-Lara2015"/&gt;

[[File:Trek-browse.jpg|thumb|Researchers scout out field sites in Antarctica's Beacon Valley, one of the most Mars-like places on Earth. Image credit: NASA]]
These valleys lie on the edge of the Antarctic plateau. They are kept clear of ice and snow by fast [[katabatic wind]]s that blow from the plateau down through the valleys. As a result, they are amongst the coldest and driest areas in the world.

The central region of [[Beacon Valley]] is considered to be one of the best terrestrial analogues for the current conditions on Mars. There is snowdrift and limited melting around the edges and occasionally in the central region, but for the most part, moisture is only found as thin films of brine around permafrost structures. It has slightly alkaline salt rich soil.&lt;ref name="McKay2008"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/snow-recurrence-sets-the-depth-of-dry-permafrost-at-high-elevations-in-the-mcmurdo-dry-valleys-of-antarctica/CF01B0520168E3A900CD4BD360049E2F/core-reader |last1=McKay |first1=Christopher P. |title=Snow recurrence sets the depth of dry permafrost at high elevations in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica |journal=Antarctic Science |volume=21 |issue=01 |year=2008 |page=89 |issn=0954-1020 |doi=10.1017/S0954102008001508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues3&gt;{{cite web |last1=The Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, The Open University |title=TN2: The Catalogue of Planetary Analogues, section 1.6.3 |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/The_Catalogue_of_Planetary_Analogues.pdf |publisher=Under ESA contract: 4000104716/11/NL/AF |date=December 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Don Juan pond===
This small pond in Antarctica, 100 meters by 300 meters, and 10&amp;nbsp;cm deep, is of great interest for studying the limits of habitability for present day life on Mars.

Research using a time lapse camera shows that it is partly fed by deliquescing salts revealing dark tracks that resemble the Recurrent Slope Lineae on Mars. The salts absorb water by deliquescence only, at times of high humidity, then flows down the slope as salty brines. These then mix with snow melt, which feeds the lake. The first part of this process may be related to the processes that form the [[Seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes|Recurring Slope Lineae]] (RSLs) on Mars.&lt;ref name="DicksonHead2013"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130130/srep01166/full/srep01166.html#supplementary-information|last1=Dickson|first1=James L.|last2=Head|first2=James W.|last3=Levy|first3=Joseph S.|last4=Marchant|first4=David R.|title=Don Juan Pond, Antarctica: Near-surface CaCl2-brine feeding Earth's most saline lake and implications for Mars|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|year=2013|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep01166|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1166D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stacey|first1=Kevin|title=How the world’s saltiest pond gets its salt - describing the research of Jay Dickson and Jim Head|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2013/02/antarctica|date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has an exceptionally low water activity of 0.3 to 0.6. Though microbes have been cultivated from it, they have not been shown to be able to reproduce in the salty conditions present in the lake, and it is possible that they only got there through being washed in by the rare occasions of snow melt feeding the lake. If this turns out to be the case, it may possibly be the only natural water body of any size without indigenous life on the Earth.

===Blood Falls===
{{Wide image|Blood Falls by Peter Rejcek.jpg|400px|[[Blood Falls]] seeps from the end of the Taylor Glacier into Lake Bonney. The tent at left provides a sense of scale }}

[[Image:blood falls1 f Low Res nsf.gov.jpg|thumb|A schematic cross-section of Blood Falls showing how subglacial microbial communities have survived in cold, darkness, and absence of oxygen for a million years in brine water below [[Taylor Glacier]].]]

This unusual flow of melt water from below the glacier gives scientists access to an environment they could otherwise only explore by drilling (which would also risk contaminating it). The melt water source is a subglacial pool of unknown size which sometimes overflows. Biogeochemical analysis shows that the water is marine in source originally. One hypothesis is that the source may be the remains of an ancient fjord that occupied the Taylor valley in the [[tertiary period]]. The ferrous iron dissolved in the water oxidizes as the water reaches the surface, turning the water blood red.&lt;ref name="DachwaldMikucki2014"/&gt;

[[Blood Falls]] was used as the target for testing [[IceMole]] in November 2014.

At {{convert|4500|m|ft}}, [[Qaidam Basin]] is the plateau with highest average elevation on the Earth. The atmospheric pressure is 50% - 60% of sea level pressures, and as a result of the thin atmosphere it has high levels of UV radiation, and large temperature swings from day to night. Also, the Himalayas to the South block humid air from India, making it hyper arid.

In the most ancient playas (Da Langtang) at the north west corner of the plateau, the evaporate salts are magnesium sulfates (sulfates are common on Mars). This combined with the Mars like conditions make it an interesting analogue of the Martian salts and salty regolith. An expedition found eight strains of [[Haloarchaea|halobacteria]] inhabiting the salts, similar to some species of [[Virgibacillus]], [[Oceanobacillus]], [[Halobacillus]], and Ter-ribacillus.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, A., et al.

Two sites of special interest: Colour Peak and Gypsum Hill, two sets of cold saline springs on [[Axel Heiberg Island]] that flow with almost constant temperature and flow rate throughout the year. The air temperatures are comparable to the McMurdo dry valleys, range -15&amp;nbsp;°C to -20&amp;nbsp;°C (for the McMurdo dry valleys -15&amp;nbsp;°C to -40&amp;nbsp;°C). The island is an area of thick permafrost with low precipitation, leading to desert conditions. The water from the springs has a temperature of between -4&amp;nbsp;°C and 7&amp;nbsp;°C. A variety of minerals precipitate out of the springs including gypsum, and at Colour Peak crystals of the metastable mineral [[ikaite]] ({{chem|Ca|C|O|3}}·6{{chem|H|2|O}}) which decomposes rapidly when removed from freezing water.&lt;ref&gt;Impey, Chris, Jonathan Lunine, and José Funes, eds.

===Colour Lake Fen===
This is another Mars analogue habitat in [[Axel Heiberg Island]] close to Colour Peak and Gypsum Hill. The frozen soil and permafrost hosts many microbial communities that are tolerant of anoxic, acid, saline and cold conditions. Most are in survival rather than colony forming mode. Colour Lake Fen is a good terrestrial analogue of the saline acidic brines that once existed in the Meridani Planum region of Mars and may possibly still exist on the martian surface.

Much of the water on Mars is permanently frozen, mixed with the rocks. So terrestrial permafrosts are a good analogue.

As well as analogues of ice fumaroles on Mars, if they exist, they may also be useful analogues for hydrothermally heated ice caves on Mars more generally if they exist.

== Cave systems ==
There are several almost enclosed ecosystems below the surface of the Earth, in cave habitats, which are especially good analogues for Mars as similar environments might exist there. And the mines give access to deep subsurface environments which turn out to be inhabited on the Earth, and may possibly exist on Mars.&lt;ref name="AertsRöling2014"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/4/4/535/htm#322SubsurfaceEnvironments|last1=Aerts|first1=Joost|last2=Röling|first2=Wilfred|last3=Elsaesser|first3=Andreas|last4=Ehrenfreund|first4=Pascale|title=Biota and Biomolecules in Extreme Environments on Earth: Implications for Life Detection on Mars|journal=Life|volume=4|issue=4|year=2014|pages=535–565|issn=2075-1729|doi=10.3390/life4040535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basaltic lava tube caves===
The only caves found so far on Mars are lava tube caves.

The [[Snottite]]s in the toxic sulfur cave [[Cueva de Villa Luz]] flourish on Hydrogen Sulfide gas and though some are aerobes (though only needing low levels of oxygen), some of these species (e.g. Acidianus), like those that live around hydrothermal vents, are able to survive independent of a source of oxygen.

So magnesium sulfate is a likely component of cold brines on the planet, especially with the limited availability of subsurface ice. Terrestrial magnesium sulfate lakes have similar chemical and physical properties. They also have a wide range of halophilic organisms, in all the three [[Kingdom (biology)#The three domains of life|Kingdoms of life]] (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota), in the surface and near subsurface.&lt;ref name="FosterKing2010"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063309002463|last1=Foster|first1=Ian S.|last2=King|first2=Penelope L.|last3=Hyde|first3=Brendt C.|last4=Southam|first4=Gordon|title=Characterization of halophiles in natural {{chem|Mg|S|O|4}} salts and laboratory enrichment samples: Astrobiological implications for Mars|journal=Planetary and Space Science|volume=58|issue=4|year=2010|pages=599–615|issn=0032-0633|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2009.08.009|bibcode=2010P&amp;SS...58..599F}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the abundance of algae and bacteria, in alkaline hypersaline conditions, they are of astrobiological interest for both past and present life on Mars.

These lakes are most common in Western Canada, and the northern part of Washington state, USA. One of the examples, is Basque Lake 2 in Western Columbia, which is highly concentrated in magnesium sulfate. In summer it deposits epsomite ("Epsom salts"). In winter, it deposits [[meridianiite]].

Another example is [[Spotted Lake]], which shows a wide variety of minerals, most of them sulfates, with sodium, magnesium and calcium as cations.

Though many of the experiments use these lakes as an analogue for ancient Mars, some researchers also have investigated them as an analogue to explore the possibility of microbes that could inhabit cold magnesium sulfate rich brines in present-day Mars. Some of the microbes isolated have been able to survive the high concentrations of magnesium sulfates found in martian soils, also at low temperatures that may be found on Mars.&lt;ref name="KilmerEberl2014"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3989109|last1=Kilmer|first1=Brian R.|last2=Eberl|first2=Timothy C.|last3=Cunderla|first3=Brent|last4=Chen|first4=Fei|last5=Clark|first5=Benton C.|last6=Schneegurt|first6=Mark A.|title=Molecular and phenetic characterization of the bacterial assemblage of Hot Lake, WA, an environment with high concentrations of magnesium sulphate, and its relevance to Mars|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|volume=13|issue=1|year=2014|pages=69–80|issn=1473-5504|doi=10.1017/S1473550413000268|pmid=24748851|bibcode=2014IJAsB..13...69K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KilmerEberl2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CrislerNewville2012"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3277918|last1=Crisler|first1=J.D.|last2=Newville|first2=T.M.|last3=Chen|first3=F.|last4=Clark|first4=B.C.|last5=Schneegurt|first5=M.A.|title=Bacterial Growth at the High Concentrations of Magnesium Sulfate Found in Martian Soils|journal=Astrobiology|volume=12|issue=2|year=2012|pages=98–106|issn=1531-1074|doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0720|pmid=22248384|bibcode=2012AsBio..12...98C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Searching salt for answers about life on Earth, Mars|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120809151324.htm|website=Science Daily - press release from Wichita State University|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfates (for instance of sodium, magnesium and calcium) are also common in other continental evaporates (such as the salars of the Atacama desert), as distinct from salt beds associated with marine deposits which tend to consist mainly of halites (chlorides).&lt;ref name="BarbieriStivaletta2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbieri|first1=Roberto|last2=Stivaletta|first2=Nunzia|title=Continental evaporites and the search for evidence of life on Mars|journal=Geological Journal|volume=46|issue=6|year=2011|pages=513–524|issn=0072-1050|doi=10.1002/gj.1326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subglacial lakes ==
[[File:Lake Vostok drill 2011.jpg|thumb|Lake Vostok drill 2011]]
Subglacial lakes such as [[Lake Vostok]] may give analogues of Mars habitats beneath ice sheets. In 2001, Duxbury et al. suggested that processes similar to the ones that maintain Lake Vostok liquid could work on Mars.

Sub glacial lakes are kept liquid partly by the pressure of the depth of ice, but that contributes only a few degrees of temperature rise. The main effect that keeps them liquid is the insulation of the ice blocking escape of heat from the interior of the Earth, similarly to the insulating effect of deep layers of rock. As for deep rock layers, they don't require extra geothermal heating below a certain depth.

In the case of Mars, the depth needed for geothermal melting of the basal area of a sheet of ice is 4-6 kilometers. The ice layers are probably only 3.4 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;km in thickness for the north polar cap. However, Duzbury et al. showed that the situation is different if you consider a lake that is already melted. When they applied their model to Mars, they showed that a liquid layer, once melted (initially open to the surface of the ice), could remain stable at any depth over 600 meters even in absence of extra geothermal heating.&lt;ref name="DuxburyZotikov2001"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JE001254/pdf|last1=Duxbury|first1=N.

So, according to their model, if the polar regions had a subsurface lake perhaps formed originally through friction as a subglacial lake at times of favourable axial tilt, then supplied by accumulating layers of snow on top as the ice sheets thickened, they suggest that it could still be there. If so, it could be occupied by similar lifeforms to those that could survive in Lake Vostok.&lt;ref name="DuxburyZotikov2001" /&gt;

Ground penetrating radar could detect these lakes because of the high radar contrast between water and ice or rock. MARSIS, the ground penetrating radar on ESA's Mars Express is our best instrument for the job. After several searches, it hasn't found anything yet.&lt;ref name="LasueMangold2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lasue|first1=Jeremie|last2=Mangold|first2=Nicolas|last3=Hauber|first3=Ernst|last4=Clifford|first4=Steve|last5=Feldman|first5=William|last6=Gasnault|first6=Olivier|last7=Grima|first7=Cyril|last8=Maurice|first8=Sylvestre|last9=Mousis|first9=Olivier|title=Quantitative Assessments of the Martian Hydrosphere|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=174|issue=1–4|year=2012|page=191|issn=0038-6308|doi=10.1007/s11214-012-9946-5|bibcode=2013SSRv..174..155L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their resolution isn't that great, however, around a kilometer. We can say that Mars doesn't seem to have an equivalent of our Lake Vostok (250&amp;nbsp;km by 50&amp;nbsp;km by 0.43&amp;nbsp;km deep) at present. It could still have small subglacial lakes of up to a kilometer or so in diameter.

Investigations of life in deep mines, and drilling beneath the ocean depths may give an insight into possibilities for life in the Mars Hydrosphere and other deep subsurface habitats, if they exist.

== Alpine and permafrost lichens ==
In high alpine and polar regions, lichens have to cope with conditions of high UV fluxes low temperatures and arid environments. This is especially so when the two factors, polar regions and high altitudes are combined. These conditions occur in the high mountains of Antarctica, where lichens grow at altitudes up to 2,000 meters with no liquid water, just snow and ice. Researchers described this as the most Mars-like environment on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Pierre_de_Vera/publication/258227207_Adaptation_of_an_Antarctic_lichen_to_Martian_niche_conditions_can_occur_within_34_days/links/00b4952e11f3088291000000.pdf|last1=de Vera|first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Schulze-Makuch|first2=Dirk|last3=Khan|first3=Afshin|last4=Lorek|first4=Andreas|last5=Koncz|first5=Alexander|last6=Möhlmann|first6=Diedrich|last7=Spohn|first7=Tilman|title=Adaptation of an Antarctic lichen to Martian niche conditions can occur within 34 days|journal=Planetary and Space Science|volume=98|year=2014|pages=182–190|issn=0032-0633|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2013.07.014|bibcode=2014P&amp;SS...98..182D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radioresistance''' is the level of [[ionizing radiation]] that [[organisms]] are able to withstand.

Ionizing-radiation-resistant organisms (IRRO) were defined as organisms for which the dose of acute ionizing radiation (IR) required to achieve 90% reduction (D10) is greater than 1000 gray (Gy) &lt;ref&gt;Sghaier, H., Ghedira, K., Benkahla, A., and Barkallah, I. (2008) Basal DNA repair machinery is subject to positive selection in ionizing-radiation-resistant bacteria. BMC Genomics 9: 297.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Radioresistance is surprisingly high in many organisms, in contrast to previously held views. For example, the study of environment, animals and plants around the [[Chernobyl disaster]] area has revealed an unexpected survival of many species, despite the high radiation levels. A [[Brazil]]ian study in a hill in the state of [[Minas Gerais]] which has high natural radiation levels from uranium deposits, has also shown many radioresistant [[insect]]s, [[worm]]s and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4796403 |date=1973 |last1=Cordeiro |first1=AR |last2=Marques |first2=EK |last3=Veiga-Neto |first3=AJ |title=Radioresistance of a natural population of ''[[Drosophila willistoni]]'' living in a radioactive environment |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=325–9 |journal=Mutation Research |doi=10.1016/0027-5107(73)90233-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=5878261 |date=1965 |last1=Moustacchi |first1=E |title=Induction by physical and chemical agents of mutations for radioresistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=403–12 |journal=Mutation Research |doi=10.1016/0027-5107(65)90052-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[extremophiles]], such as the bacteria ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' and the [[tardigrade]]s, can withstand large doses of [[ionizing radiation]] on the order of 5,000 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]].&lt;!-- WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT, FOR PURPOSE OF ILLUSTRATION? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moseley BEB | author2 = Mattingly A | date = 1971 | title = Repair of irradiated transforming deoxyribonu- cleic acid in wild type and a radiation- sensitive mutant of Micrococcus radiodu- rans | url = | journal = [[J.

==Induced radioresistance==
[[File:Effectofselfrepair.svg|left|thumb|300px|This is a graph showing the effect of fractionation on the ability of gamma rays to cause cell death. The blue line is for cells which were not given a chance to recover while the red line is for cells which were allowed to stand for a time and recover.]]

In the graph on left, a dose/survival curve for a [[hypothetical]] group of cells has been drawn with and without a rest time for the cells to recover. Other than the recovery time partway through the irradiation, the cells would have been treated identically.

Radioresistance may be induced by exposure to small doses of ionizing radiation. Several studies have documented this effect in [[yeast]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[algae]], plants, insects, as well as in ''[[in vitro]]'' [[mammal]]ian and human cells and in [[animal model]]s. Several cellular radioprotection mechanisms may be involved, such as alterations in the levels of some [[cytoplasm]]ic and [[nucleus (cell)|nuclear]] [[protein]]s and increased [[gene expression]], [[DNA repair]] and other processes.

Many organisms have been found to possess a self-repair mechanism that can be activated by exposure to radiation in some cases. Two examples of this self-repair process in humans are described below.

Devair Alves Ferreira received a large dose (7.0 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]]) during the [[Goiânia accident]], and lived, whereas his wife, who got a dose of 5.7 Gy, died. The most likely explanation{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} is that his dose was fractionated into many smaller doses which were absorbed over a length of time while his wife stayed in the house more and was subjected to continuous irradiation without a break so giving the self repair mechanisms in her body less time to repair some of the damage done by the radiation. This resulted in her death. He also eventually died. In the same way some of the persons who worked in the basement of the wrecked [[Chernobyl]] have built up doses of 10 Gy, these workers received these doses in small fractions so the acute effects were avoided.

It has been found in [[radiation biology]] experiments that if a group of cells are irradiated then as the dose increases the number of cells which survive decrease. It has also been found that if a population of cells are given a dose before being set aside (without being irradiated) for a length of time before being irradiated again then the radiation has less of an ability to cause [[cell death]]. The human body contains many types of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} and a human can be killed by the loss of a single tissue in a vital organ{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. For many short term radiation deaths (3 days to 30 days) the loss of cells forming [[blood cells]] ([[bone marrow]]) and the cells in the digestive system (wall of the [[intestines]]) cause death.

==Inheritance of radioresistance==
There is strong evidence that radioresistance can be genetically determined and inherited, at least in some organisms. Heinrich Nöthel, a geneticist from the [[Freie Universität Berlin]] carried out the most extensive study about radioresistance [[mutation]]s using the common [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]], ''Drosophila melanogaster'', in a series of 14 publications.

==Radioresistance in radiation oncology==
'''Radioresistance''' is also a term sometimes used in medicine ([[oncology]]) for [[cancer]] cells which are difficult to treat with [[radiotherapy]]. Radioresistance of cancer cells may be intrinsic or induced by the radiation therapy itself.

==Radioresistance comparison==
The comparison in the table below is only meant to give approximate indications of radioresistance for different species and should be taken with great caution. There are generally big differences in radioresistance for one species among experiments, due to the way radiation affects living tissues and to different experimental conditions. We should for example consider that because radiation impedes cell division, immature organisms are less resistant to radiations than adults, and adults are sterilized at doses much lower than that necessary to kill them. For example, for the insect parasitoid ''[[Habrobracon hebetor]]'', the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for haploid embryo during cleavage (1–3 hours of age) is 200 [[roentgen (unit)|R]], but about 4 hours later it is of 7,000 [[roentgen (unit)|R]] (for X-ray intensity of 110 R/minute), and haploid (= male) embryos are more resistant than diploid (= female) embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=AM|last2=Mitchell|first2=CJ|year=1952|title=Effects of X-Rays upon Haploid and Diploid Embryos of ''Habrobracon'' |journal=Biological Bulletin|volume=103|issue=2|pages=170–177|doi=10.2307/1538443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mortality of adults ''H. hebetor'' exposed to a dose of 180,250 [[roentgen (unit)|R]] is the same to this of a non-irradiated control group (food was not provided to either groups) (for 6,000 R/minute).&lt;ref name="Sullivan_Grosch_1953"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sullivan | first1=R | last2=Grosch | first2=D | year=1953 | title=The radiation tolerance of an adult wasp | journal=Nucleotics | volume=11 | pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grosch_1956"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grosch|first1=DS|year=1954|title=Induced lethargy and the radiation control of insects|journal=Journal of Economic Entomology|volume=49|issue=5|pages=629–631}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a lower dose of 102,000 R (for 6,000 R/minute) is sufficient to induce a state of lethargy in ''H. hebetor'' that is manifested by a complete cessation of activity, including cessation of feeding, and these individuals eventually let themselves starve to death.&lt;ref name="Grosch_1956"/&gt; And an even lower dose of 4,858 R (for 2,650 R/minute) is sufficient to sterilize adult female ''H. hebetor'' (sterility arises 3 days post-exposure).&lt;ref name="Grosch_Sullivan_1954"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=DS | last1=Grosch | first2=RL | last2=Sullivan | year=1954 | title=The quantitative aspects of permanent and temporary sterility induced in female ''Habrobracon'' by X-Rays and β radiation | journal=Radiation Research | volume=1 | issue=3 | pages=294–320 | doi=10.2307/3570374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important factors that influence the level of radioresistance include: The length of time during which a dose of radiation is delivered—with doses delivered during longer periods, or at time intervals, being associated with greatly reduced negative effects;&lt;ref name="Grosch_Sullivan_1954"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wharton_Wharton_1959"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wharton|first1=DRA|last2=Wharton|first2=ML|year=1959|title=The effect of radiation on the longevity of the cockroach, ''Periplaneta americana'', as affected by dose, age, sex, and food intake|journal=Radiation Research|volume=11|issue=|pages=600–615|doi=10.2307/3570814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The feeding state of individuals—with pre-fed and post-fed individuals being more resistant to radiations compared to starved individuals;&lt;ref name="Grosch_Sullivan_1954"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wharton_Wharton_1959"/&gt; The type of radiation used (e.g., tardigrades ''Milnesium tardigradum'' irradiated with heavy ions have a higher survival than when irradiated with gamma rays, for a same irradiation dose);&lt;ref name="Horikawa et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Radiation tolerance in the tardigrade Milnesium tardigradum|pmid=17178624|journal=[[International Journal of Radiation Biology]]|date=2006|volume=82|pages=843–8|display-authors=4|author=Horikawa DD|author2=Sakashita T|author3=Katagiri C|author4=Watanabe M|author5=Kikawada T|author6=Nakahara Y|author7=Hamada N|author8=Wada S|author9=Funayama T|author10=Higashi S|author11=Kobayashi Y|author12=Okuda T|author13=Kuwabara M|issue=12|doi=10.1080/09553000600972956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological state of individuals (e.g., the tardigrade species ''Richtersius coronifer'' and ''Milnesium tardigradum'' are more resistant to gamma-ray radiation when in the hydrated state, and ''Macrobiotus areolatus'' is more resistant to X-ray radiation when in the anhydrobiotic state).&lt;ref name="Horikawa et al. 2006"/&gt; The way lethality is measured is also source of variation for the estimated radioresistance of a species. Irradiated specimens are not instantly killed, unless exposed to a very high dose (acute dose).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Heidenthal | first=G | year=1945 | title =The occurrence of X-ray induced dominant lethal mutations in ''Habrobracon'' | journal=Genetics | volume=30 | pages=197–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, irradiated specimens die over a certain period of time and lower irradiation doses correspond to longer survival. This means that the radiation dose LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; fluctuates with the time at which it is measured. For example, the β radiation dose that causes 50% mortality in the [[American cockroach]] at 25 days post-exposure is 5,700 R, but to reach 50% mortality at 3 days post-exposure, 45,610 R are needed.&lt;ref name="Wharton_Wharton_1959"/&gt; 25 days can represent a long survival period for short lived species, such as insects, but would represent a very short survival time for long lived species, such as mammals, so comparing survival of different species after the same amount of time post-exposure also poses some challenges of interpretation. These examples illustrate the many issues associated with comparison of radioresistance among species and the need for caution when doing so.

It was commanded by [[Richard Clement Moody]].
{{Main article|Richard Clement Moody}}

==Selection==
When news of the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] reached London, Moody was hand-picked by the [[Colonial Office]], under [[Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], to establish British order and to transform the newly established [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–66)]] into the British Empire's "bulwark in the farthest west" &lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Hauka, McGowan's War, Vancouver: 2003, New Star Books, p.146&lt;/ref&gt; and “found a second England on the shores of the Pacific”.&lt;ref name="Jean Barman p.71"&gt;Jean Barman, The West Beyond the West: A History of British Columbia, (Toronto: University of Toronto), p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Lytton desired to send to the colony 'representatives of the best of British culture, not just a police force’: he sought men who possessed ‘courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he decided to send Moody, whom the Government considered to be the 'English gentleman and British Officer’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the head of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, which was created by an Act of the British Parliament on 2 August 1858. The Engineers were believed to exemplify the qualities sought by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|pages=7–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Clement Moody (1859).JPG|thumb|right|Col. Richard Moody, commander of the Columbia detachment]]

Moody and his family arrived in [[British Columbia]] in December 1858, commanding the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment. He was sworn in as the first [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]] and appointed Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia. On the advice of Lytton, Moody hired [[Robert Burnaby]] as his personal secretary, and the two became close friends. Moody's letter to his friend Arthur Blackwood Esq. at the Colonial Office, dated February 1, 1859, contains several passages of sublime [[poetical]] description that demonstrate the qualities for which he was preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Richard Clement|title=Letter of Colonel Richard Clement Moody, R.E., to Arthur Blackwood, February 1, 1859, preserved in the British Columbia Historical Quarterly (January – April 1951), ed. Willard E. Ireland, Archives of British Columbia|publisher=British Columbia Historical Association|pages=85–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Detachment under Moody consisted of 150 sappers and officers. This was later and was later increased to 172. Moody had three Captains: [[Robert Mann Parsons]], [[John Marshall Grant]] and [[Henry Reynolds Luard]]. The contingent included two [[subalterns]], Lieutenant [[Arthur Reid Lempriere|Arthur Lempriere]] (later a Major-General) and Lieutenant [[Henry Spencer Palmer|Henry Palmer]], a surgeon, Dr [[John Vernon Seddall]], Captain [[William Driscoll Gosset]], a retired Royal Engineer, who served as civilian treasurer and commissary officer, Rev. [[John Sheepshanks (bishop)|John Sheepshanks]] served as the detachment’s chaplain, and Burnaby.

===Ned McGowan's War===
Moody had hoped to begin immediately the foundation of a capital city, but upon his arrival at Fort Langley he learned of an outbreak of violence at the settlement of Hill's Bar. This led to an incident popularly known as "[[McGowan's War|Ned McGowan's War]]", where Moody led 22 Engineers and Judge [[Matthew Baillie Begbie]] to [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]] to face down a group of rebellious American miners. Order was restored without further violence. Moody describes the incident thus:

''"The notorious Ned McGowan, of Californian celebrity at the head of a band of Yankee Rowdies defying the law! Every peaceable citizen frightened out of his wits!—Summons &amp; warrants laughed to scorn! A Magistrate seized while on the Bench, &amp; brought to the Rebel’s camp, tried, condemned, &amp; heavily fined! A man shot dead shortly before! Such a tale to welcome me at the close of a day of great enjoyment." ' '&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Richard Clement|title=Letter of Colonel Richard Clement Moody, R.E., to Arthur Blackwood, February 1, 1859, preserved in the British Columbia Historical Quarterly (January – April 1951), ed. Willard E. Ireland, Archives of British Columbia|publisher=British Columbia Historical Association|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He enjoyed a warm reception for his success that he describes thus: ''"They gave me a Salute, firing off their loaded Revolvers over my head—Pleasant—Balls whistling over one’s head! as a compliment! Suppose a hand had dropped by accident!  I stood up, &amp; raised my cap &amp; thanked them in the Queen’s name for their loyal reception of me''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Richard Clement|title=Letter of Colonel Richard Clement Moody, R.E., to Arthur Blackwood, February 1, 1859, preserved in the British Columbia Historical Quarterly (January – April 1951), ed. Willard E. Ireland, Archives of British Columbia|publisher=British Columbia Historical Association|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Foundation of New Westminster===
In British Columbia, Moody ‘wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness’ and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, ‘styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the enactment of the Pre-emption Act of 1860, Moody settled the [[Lower Mainland]]. He selected the site and founded the new capital, [[New Westminster]]. He selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also struck by the majestic beauty of the site, writing in his letter to Blackwood,

''"The entrance to the Frazer is very striking--Extending miles to the right &amp; left are low marsh lands (apparently of very rich qualities) &amp; yet [[Sic|fr]] the Background of Superb Mountains-- Swiss in outline, dark in woods, grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you. Everything is large and magnificent, worthy of the entrance to the Queen of England’s dominions on the Pacific mainland. [...] My imagination converted the silent marshes into [[Cuyp]]-like pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset. [...] The water of the deep clear Frazer was of a glassy stillness, not a ripple before us, except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Richard Clement|title=Letter of Colonel Richard Clement Moody, R.E., to Arthur Blackwood, February 1, 1859, preserved in the British Columbia Historical Quarterly (January – April 1951), ed.

However, Lord Lytton 'forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town’ and the efforts of Moody's Engineers were continuous hampered by insufficient funds, which, together with the continuous opposition of Douglas, 'made it impossible for [Moody’s] design to be fulfilled’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Feud with Governor Douglas===
Throughout his tenure in British Columbia, Moody was engaged in a bitter feud with [[James Douglas (governor)|Sir James Douglas]], [[Governor of Vancouver Island]], whose jurisdiction overlapped with his own. Moody’s position as Chief Commissioner and Lieutenant-Governor was one of ‘higher prestige [and]  lesser authority' than that of Douglas, despite Moody's vastly superior social position in the eyes of the Engineers and the British Government: Moody had been selected by Lord Lytton due to his possession of the quality of the ‘archetypal English gentleman and British Officer’, his family was ‘eminently respectable’: he was the son of [[Colonel]] [[Thomas Moody (1779-1849)]], one of the wealthiest [[mercantilists]] in the West Indies, who owned much of the land in the islands where Douglas's father owned a small amount of land and from which Douglas's mother, 'a half-breed', originated. Governor Douglas's ethnicity and made him ‘an affront to Victorian society’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Moody, the descendant of the [[Hawks family|Hawks industrial dynasty]] and the Boyd merchant banking family,&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Joseph Jackson (1893–1906).

Margaret A. Ormsby, author of the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' entry for Moody (2002), condemns Moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city. However, most other historians have exonerated Moody for the abortive development of the city and consider his achievement to be impressive, especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of Douglas, whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development. Robert Edgar Cail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cail|first=Robert Edgar|title=Land, Man, and the Law: The Disposal of Crown Lands in British Columbia, 1871 -1913, Vancouver, University of British Columbia|year=1974|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don W. Thomson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Don W.|title=Men and Meridians, Vol. 1|publisher=Ottawa, Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, Government of Canada|year=1966|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ishiguro, and Scott have praised Moody for his contribution, the latter accusing Ormsby of being ‘adamant in her dislike of Colonel Moody’ despite the evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost all biographies of Moody, including those of the Institute of Civil Engineers, the Royal Engineers, and the British Columbia Historical Association, are flattering.

===Other developments===
Moody and the Royal Engineers also built an extensive road network, including what would become [[Kingsway (Vancouver)|Kingsway]], connecting New Westminster to [[False Creek]], the North Road between [[Port Moody]] and New Westminster, and the [[Cariboo Road]] and [[Stanley Park]]. He named [[Burnaby Lake]] after his private secretary [[Robert Burnaby]] and named Port Coquitlam’s 400-foot "Mary Hill" after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated "government reserves", which included [[Stanley Park]] as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The Pre-emption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for [[land grabbing]]. [[Port Moody]] is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US.

Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment was disbanded in July, 1863. The Moody family, only 22 men and 8 wives returned to England, while the rest, 130 sappers, elected to remain in BC.&lt;ref&gt;Ormsby.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott contends that the departure of the Engineers 'doomed' the development of the settlement and the fruition of Lord Lytton's dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Laura Elaine|title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862|year=1983|publisher=Simon Fraser University|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chartres Brew]] replaced Moody as land commissioner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3166">'''SEDAT ("Space Environment DATa System")''' provides access to near-original satellite data on the [[space environment]] in order to perform analyses and queries needed for evaluation of space environment hazards. 

== History ==
The development was performed between 1999 and 2001 by the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] (RAL) and funded by the [[European Space Agency]] via its Space Environments and Effects Section.

== Description ==
The aim of the SEDAT project is to develop a new approach to the engineering analysis of the spacecraft charged-particle environments. The project assembled a database containing a large and comprehensive set of data about that environment as measured in-situ by a number of space plasma missions. The user is able to select a set of [[space environment]] data appropriate to the engineering problem under study. The project developed a set of software tools, which can operate on the data retrieved from the SEDAT database. These tools allow the user to carry out a wide range of engineering analyses. 

This approach differs from traditional space environment engineering studies. In the latter the space environment is characterised by a model that is a synthesis of previous observations. However, in SEDAT the environment is characterised directly by the observations. This approach offers several advantages to the engineering analyst: 

*The data used in the study can be tailored more precisely to the engineering problem under study. 
*The analysis is not constrained by selection effects within the model used. 
*The analyst may tailor the processing of the data to the problem under study. 
*The analysis is not constrained by binning or other processing effects that were used to generate the model. 
*New data are readily incorporated in the database and thus made available for engineering analyses. 

The traditional approach would require the production, validation and dissemination of an updated model, which is a far more time-consuming activity. 

The SEDAT concept foresees access to distributed datasets, capture of processing methods and openness in analysis tools.

== SEDAT implementation ==
The implementation of SEDAT is divided into three main parts: 
#Construction of the SEDAT database, based in the STPDF.
#Production of the analysis tools to be used in conjunction with the SEDAT database, based on IDL routines.
#Execution of four small exercises, using the SEDAT database and tools, to demonstrate that these functions operate correctly. 

Four demonstrations of the SEDAT system were performed in the original study: 
* Update of [[solar proton]] model (RAL-SED-TN-0301) 
* Radiation dose calculation for interplanetary mission (RAL-SED-TN-0302) 
* Correlation of electron fluxes with spacecraft anomalies (RAL-SED-TN-0303) 
* Electron fluorescence on XMM (RAL-SED-TN-0304)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11754">SX000i - ''International guide for the use of the S-Series of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) specifications'', is a specification developed jointly by a multinational team from the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] (ASD) and [[Aerospace Industries Association]] (AIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia-aerospace.org/national_aerospace_standards/s-series_ils_specifications/ AIA page on the S-Series ILS specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; SX000i is part of the [[S-Series of ILS specifications]].

SX000i provides information, guidance and instructions to ensure compatibility and the commonality of [[Integrated Logistics Support]] (ILS) processes among the S-Series suite of ILS specifications jointly developed by both associations.

By defining common logistics processes to be used across all S-Series ILS specifications and the interactions of the current S-Series ILS specifications with the logistics processes, the SX000i forms the basis for sharing and exchanging data securely through the life of products and services, not only within the support domain, but also with other domains such as Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ap239.org/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=358730&amp;folderId=362247&amp;name=DLFE-10795.pdf An ISO standard for Product Support data interoperability: ISO 10303-239 edition 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The SX000i also provides governance for the maintenance of current S-Series ILS specifications and the development of new S-Series ILS specifications.

== Purpose of the guide ==
SX000i provides a guide for the use of the S-series ILS specifications by ILS managers and practitioners, as well as for the management and future development of the specifications by the ILS specification Council and ILS specification Steering Committees (SC) and Working Groups (WG). 
SX000i:
* explains the vision and objectives for the suite of S-Series ILS specifications
* provides a framework that documents the global ILS process and interactions
* explains how the ASD/AIA S-Series ILS specifications interface with other standardization domains including program management, global supply chain management, engineering, manufacturing, security, safety, configuration management, quality, data exchange and integration, and life cycle cost
* describes the global governance of the S-Series ILS specifications development
* provides guidance on how to satisfy specific business requirements using an appropriate selection of defined processes and specifications

== SX000i development history ==
During the development of the S-Series ILS specifications, the different ASD/AIA Steering Committees and Working Groups identified the need for an "umbrella" specification to ensure the compatibility and commonality of ILS processes among the S-Series ILS specifications.

In 2011, the decision was made to develop, publicize and maintain an [[Integrated Logistics Support]] Guide, named SX000i, so as to provide a compatible and common ILS process to be used in the other S-Series ILS specifications.  Development of SX000i was viewed by the ILS Specifications Council as an essential step to achieve the vision for the S-Series ILS specifications.

In June 2011, the SX000i working group was formed and SX000i development started.  The current title of SX000i, International guide for the use of the S-Series of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) specifications, was approved by the ASD/AIA ILS Specifications Council in June 2012.

Following the creation of the SX000i working group, the ASD/AIA Data Model and Exchange Working Group (DMEWG) was formed under the ILS Specifications Council in October 2011.  Working in close cooperation with the SX000i team, the DMEWG coordinates the data modeling activities that are performed within the respective S-Series ILS Specification SCs and WGs so as to harmonize and consolidate data requirements into one coherent data model. 
Publication of SX000i, and continuing DMEWG coordination activities, enable the achievement of the vision for the suite of ILS specifications "to apply common logistics processes so as to share and exchange data securely through the life of products and services".

The companies and organizations that are currently participating in the development of SX000i are:
* [[Airbus]] (France)
* [[Airbus Defence and Space]] (Germany and Spain)
* [[Boeing]] Defence Systems (USA)
* [[Bundeswehr]] (Germany)
* [[Elektroniksystem- und Logistik-GmbH]] (ESG) (Germany)
* FACC AG (Austria)
* HEME GmbH (Germany)
* O’Neil (USA)
* [[Rockwell Collins]]
* Leonardo - Electronics, Defence &amp; Security Systems (former [[Selex ES]]) (Italy)
* [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]] (TAI) (Turkey)
* [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]]

SX000i issue 1.0 was published in December 2015. An Issue 1.1 was published in July 2016.

The SX000i Steering Committee is currently co-chaired by the Spanish representative of [[Airbus Defence and Space]], on behalf of ASD, and [[Boeing]], on behalf of AIA.

== Intended use ==
SX000i is intended:
* To be a starting point for any potential users or new projects that would want to use the S-Series ILS specifications.
* To be an overview and coordinating document for all members of the international ILS community, engaged in the use and development of the S-Series ILS specifications on existing projects.
In that context, SX000i was developed for three primary applications: 
* New Product development 
* Support of existing Products
* ILS specification development and maintenance

== Target audiences ==
The target audiences for SX000i are:

=== Contractors ===
SX000i can be used by prime contractors, original equipment manufacturers, and suppliers as a reference for initially establishing their Product support strategies and plans, and selecting specifications to support those plans. SX000i can also be used to evaluate existing Product support strategies and projects.

=== Customers ===
SX000i can be used by customers to determine support requirements for new Products they are acquiring, or fielded Products for which they are seeking support, and to identify ILS specifications to be cited in solicitations.

=== ILS specifications Council ===
The ILS specifications Council uses SX000i to promote a commonality and interoperability among the S-Series ILS specifications.

=== ILS specification steering committees and working groups ===
Steering committees and working groups developing specifications use SX000i as a basis for describing relationships and interfaces between the ILS element(s) that their specification covers and: 	
* the other integrated logistic support elements
* the standardization domains
Steering committees use SX000i to ensure the compatibility of their specification with the other ILS specifications.
The Data modeling and Exchange Working group (DMEWG) uses SX000i to harmonize and consolidate data requirements into one coherent data model supporting all of the ILS specifications. 
Steering committees and working groups both use SX000i to ensure compliance with ILS specification Council governance requirements.

== SX000i structure ==
SX000i consists of six chapters:
* '''Chapter 1''', (Introduction) provides background information on the S-Series ILS specifications and SX000i.
* '''Chapter 2''', (Integrated logistics support framework), documents a global ILS process and interactions at the ILS element level. This chapter establishes the foundation for the remainder of SX000i chapters and all of the S-Series ILS specifications. 
* '''Chapter 3''', (Use of the S-Series ILS specifications in an ILS project), explains how the S-Series ILS specifications relate to the global ILS process and elements, and how to use them as part of an ILS project.
* '''Chapter 4''', (ILS specification governance), describes the structure of the S-Series ILS specifications organization and the processes used to manage the development and maintenance of those specifications. The target audience for this chapter is primarily the ILS specifications Council, and the SCs and WGs of the individual specifications.
* '''Chapter 5''', (Terms, abbreviations and acronyms), provides the definition of the main terms used in this specification, as well as a list of all the abbreviations and acronyms.
* '''Chapter 6''', (Comparison of specification terminology), provides a comparison of the terms, life cycle phases and ILS elements between SX000i and other international and military specifications, to enable users to better understand the underlying concepts.

Sediments make the water appear brownish-grey; they are an indicator of increased [[Surface runoff#Effects of surface runoff|water runoff]], [[land degradation]], [[erosion]] due to intensive industrialized land use, land sealing, and poor soil management.]]

'''Sediment''' is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of [[weathering]] and [[erosion]], and is subsequently [[sediment transport|transported]] by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of [[gravity]] acting on the particles. For example, [[sand]] and [[silt]] can be carried in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in river water and on reaching the sea bed deposited by [[sedimentation]] and if buried, may eventually become [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]] ([[sedimentary rock]]s).

Sediments are most often transported by water ([[fluvial|fluvial processes]]), but also wind ([[aeolian processes]]) and [[glacier]]s. Beach sands and [[stream channel|river channel]] deposits are examples of fluvial transport and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]], though sediment also often settles out of slow-moving or standing water in lakes and oceans. Desert sand dunes and [[loess]] are examples of aeolian transport and deposition.  [[Glacial]] [[moraine]] deposits and [[till]] are ice-transported sediments.

== Classification ==
[[File:Sediment in the Gulf of Mexico.jpg|thumb|Sediment in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]
[[File:Sediment off the Yucatan Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Sediment off the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]]]

Sediment can be classified based on its [[Particle size (grain size)|grain size]] and/or its composition.

===Grain size===
{{main|Particle size (grain size)}}
{{see also|soil texture|Unified Soil Classification System}}

Sediment size is measured on a log base 2 scale, called the "Phi" scale, which classifies particles by size from "colloid" to "booulder".

===Composition===
Composition of sediment can be measured in terms of:
* parent [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[lithology]]
* [[mineral]] composition
* [[chemical]] make-up.

This leads to an ambiguity in which [[clay]] can be used as both a size-range and a composition (see [[clay mineral]]s).

== Sediment transport ==
[[File:StoneFormationInWater.jpg|thumb|Sediment builds up on human-made breakwaters because they reduce the speed of water flow, so the stream cannot carry as much sediment load.]]
[[File:Glacial Transportation and Deposition.jpg|thumb|Glacial transport of boulders. These boulders will be deposited as the glacier retreats.]]

{{main|Sediment transport}}
{{see also|Rouse number}}

Sediment is transported based on the strength of the flow that carries it and its own size, volume, density, and shape. Stronger flows will increase the lift and drag on the particle, causing it to rise, while larger or denser particles will be more likely to fall through the flow.

=== Fluvial processes: rivers, streams, and overland flow ===

====Particle motion====
Rivers and streams carry sediment in their flows. This sediment can be in a variety of locations within the flow, depending on the balance between the upwards velocity on the particle (drag and lift forces), and the [[terminal velocity|settling velocity]] of the particle. These relationships are shown in the following table for the [[Rouse number]], which is a ratio of sediment fall velocity to upwards velocity.

&lt;math&gt;\textbf{Rouse}=\frac{\text{Settling velocity}}{\text{Upwards velocity from lift and drag}}=\frac{w_s}{\kappa u_*}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;w_s&lt;/math&gt; is the fall velocity
* &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[von Kármán constant]]
* &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear velocity]]
[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|{{center|[[Hjulström curve]]: The velocities of currents required for erosion, transportation, and deposition (sedimentation) of sediment particles of different sizes.}}]]
{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#efefef;"

|-
|[[Suspended load]]: 100% Suspended
|&gt;0.8, &lt;1.2
|-
|[[Wash load]]
|&lt;0.8
|}

If the upwards velocity is approximately equal to the settling velocity, sediment will be transported downstream entirely as [[suspended load]]. If the upwards velocity is much less than the settling velocity, but still high enough for the sediment to move (see [[Sediment transport#Initiation of motion|Initiation of motion]]), it will move along the bed as [[bed load]] by rolling, sliding, and [[Saltation (geology)|saltating]] (jumping up into the flow, being transported a short distance then settling again). If the upwards velocity is higher than the settling velocity, the sediment will be transported high in the flow as [[wash load]].

As there are generally a range of different particle sizes in the flow, it is common for material of different sizes to move through all areas of the flow for given stream conditions.

==== Fluvial bedforms ====
{{main|Bedform}}
[[File:Ripples mcr1.JPG|thumb|Modern asymmetric ripples developed in sand on the floor of the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. Flow direction is from right to left.]]
[[File:Sinuous dunes mcr1.JPG|thumb|Sinuous-crested dunes exposed at low tide in the Cornwallis River near Wolfville, Nova Scotia]]
[[File:Channel-StellartonFm-CoalburnPit.JPG|thumb|Ancient channel deposit in the Stellarton Formation ([[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]]), Coalburn Pit, near Thorburn, Nova Scotia.]]

Sediment motion can create self-organized structures such as [[ripple marks|ripple]]s, [[dune]]s, or [[antidune]]s on the river or stream [[stream bed|bed]]. These bedforms are often preserved in sedimentary rocks and can be used to estimate the direction and magnitude of the flow that deposited the sediment.

==== Surface runoff ====
[[Overland flow]] can erode soil particles and transport them downslope. The erosion associated with overland flow may occur through different methods depending on meteorological and flow conditions.
* If the initial impact of rain droplets dislodges soil, the phenomenon is called rainsplash erosion.
* If overland flow is directly responsible for sediment entrainment but does not form gullies, it is called "sheet erosion".
* If the flow and the substrate permit channelization, gullies may form; this is termed "gully erosion".

==== Key fluvial depositional environments ====
The major [[fluvial]] (river and stream) environments for deposition of sediments include:
* [[River delta|Deltas]] (arguably an intermediate environment between fluvial and marine)
* [[Point bar]]s
* [[Alluvial fan]]s
* [[Braided river]]s
* [[Oxbow lake]]s
* [[Levee]]s
* [[Waterfall]]s

===Aeolian processes: wind===
{{main|Aeolian processes}}
Wind results in the transportation of fine sediment and the formation of sand dune fields and soils from airborne dust.

===Glacial processes===
[[File:GLMsed.jpg|thumb|Glacial sediments from Montana]]
Glaciers carry a wide range of sediment sizes, and deposit it in [[moraine]]s.

===Mass balance===
{{main|Exner equation}}

The overall balance between sediment in transport and sediment being deposited on the bed is given by the [[Exner equation]]. This expression states that the rate of increase in bed elevation due to deposition is proportional to the amount of sediment that falls out of the flow. This equation is important in that changes in the power of the flow change the ability of the flow to carry sediment, and this is reflected in the patterns of erosion and deposition observed throughout a stream. This can be localized, and simply due to small obstacles; examples are scour holes behind boulders, where flow accelerates, and deposition on the inside of [[meander]] bends. Erosion and deposition can also be regional; erosion can occur due to [[dam removal]] and [[base level]] fall. Deposition can occur due to dam emplacement that causes the river to pool and deposit its entire load, or due to base level rise.

== Shores and shallow seas ==
Seas, oceans, and lakes accumulate sediment over time. The sediment can consist of ''terrigenous'' material, which originates on land, but may be deposited in either terrestrial, marine, or lacustrine (lake) environments, or of sediments (often biological) originating in the body of water. Terrigenous material is often supplied by nearby rivers and streams or reworked [[marine sediment]] (e.g. [[sand]]). In the mid-ocean, the exoskeletons of dead organisms are primarily responsible for sediment accumulation.

Deposited sediments are the source of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which can contain [[fossil]]s of the inhabitants of the body of water that were, upon death, covered by accumulating sediment. Lake bed sediments that have not solidified into rock can be used to determine past [[climate|climatic]] conditions.

=== Key marine depositional environments ===
[[File:EolianiteLongIsland.JPG|thumb|right|[[Holocene]] [[eolianite]] and a carbonate beach on [[Long Island, Bahamas]].]]
The major areas for deposition of sediments in the marine environment include:
* [[Littoral]] sands (e.g. beach sands, runoff river sands, coastal bars and spits, largely [[clastic]] with little faunal content)
* The continental shelf ([[silt]]y [[clay]]s, increasing marine faunal content).
* The shelf margin (low terrigenous supply, mostly [[calcite|calcareous]] faunal skeletons)
* The shelf slope (much more fine-grained silts and clays)
* Beds of estuaries with the resultant deposits called "[[bay mud]]".

One other depositional environment which is a mixture of fluvial and marine is the [[turbidite]] system, which is a major source of sediment to the deep [[sedimentary basin|sedimentary]] and [[Abyssal plain|abyssal basins]] as well as the deep [[oceanic trench]]es.

Any depression in a marine environment where sediments accumulate over time is known as a [[Sediment trap (geology)|sediment trap]].

The null point theory explains how sediment deposition undergoes a hydrodynamic sorting process within the marine environment leading to a seaward fining of sediment grain size.

==Environmental issues==
{{see also|Sediment transport#Applications}}

===Erosion and agricultural sediment delivery to rivers===
One cause of high sediment loads is [[slash and burn]] and [[shifting cultivation]] of [[tropical]] forests. When the ground surface is stripped of vegetation and then seared of all living organisms, the upper soils are vulnerable to both wind and water erosion. In a number of regions of the earth, entire sectors of a country have become erodible. For example, on the [[Madagascar]] high central [[plateau]], which constitutes approximately ten percent of that country's land area, most of the land area is devegetated, and gullies have eroded into the underlying soil in [[furrows]] typically in excess of 50 meters deep and one kilometer wide.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This [[siltation]] results in discoloration of rivers to a dark red brown color and leads to fish kills.

Erosion is also an issue in areas of modern farming, where the removal of native vegetation for the cultivation and harvesting of a single type of crop has left the soil unsupported. Many of these regions are near rivers and drainages. Loss of soil due to erosion removes useful farmland, adds to sediment loads, and can help transport anthropogenic fertilizers into the river system, which leads to [[eutrophication]].

The Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) is fraction of gross erosion (interill, rill, gully and stream erosion) that is expected to be delivered to the outlet of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=C.|last2=Wu|first2=J.

===Coastal Development and Sedimentation near Coral Reefs===

Watershed development near coral reefs is a primary cause of sediment-related coral stress.The stripping of natural vegetation in the watershed for development exposes soil to increased wind and rainfall, and as a result, can cause exposed sediment to become more susceptible to erosion and delivery to the marine environment during rainfall events. Sediment can negatively affect corals in many ways, such as by physically smothering them, abrading their surfaces, causing corals to expend energy during sediment removal, and causing algal blooms that can ultimately lead to less space on the seafloor where juvenile corals (polyps) can settle.

When sediments are introduced into the coastal regions of the ocean, the proportion of land, marine and organic-derived sediment that characterizes the seafloor near sources of sediment output is altered.    In addition, because the source of sediment (i.e. land, ocean, or organically) is often correlated with how coarse or fine sediment grain sizes that characterize an area are on average, grain size distribution of sediment will shift according to relative input of land (typically fine), marine (typically coarse), and organically-derived (variable with age) sediment.  These alterations in marine sediment characterize the amount of sediment that is suspended in the water column at any given time and sediment-related coral stress.

'''Structural competency''' is a term used in American [[health professional education]] to describe the ability of health care providers and trainees to appreciate how [[symptoms]], clinical problems, [[diseases]] and attitudes toward patients, populations and health systems are influenced by 'upstream' [[social determinants of health]].

The creators of this term Jonathan Metzl and Helena Hansen proposed a 5-point model [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613003778].
* Recognition of "structures that shape clinical interactions"
* Development of "an extraclinical language of structure"
* Rearticulation of "'cultural' presentations in structural terms"
* Observation and imagination of "structural intervention"
* Development of "structural humility"

The concept of structural competency is framed in the language of [[competency based medical education]] and is proposed as a new iteration of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|cultural competency]] which is a defined competency in American medical, nursing and public health education.

'''Sustainable landscape architecture''' is a category of [[sustainable design]] concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space.&lt;ref name=nytimes_landscape&gt;{{cite web|last=Orr|first=Stephen|title=A Sustainability That Aims to Seduce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/garden/21sustainable.html?pagewanted=all&amp;action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=cserbias%3Aw%2C[%22RI%3A1%22%2C%22RI%3A3%22]&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2FSustainable%2Blandscape%2Barchitecture%2F|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This can include ecological, politically correct, social and economic aspects of sustainability. For example, the design of a [[Sustainable urban drainage systems|sustainable urban drainage system]] can: improve habitats for [[fauna]] and [[flora]]; improve recreational facilities, because people love to be beside water; save money, because building culverts is expensive and floods cause severe financial harm.

The design of a [[green roof]] or a [[roof garden]] can also contribute to the sustainability of a [[landscape architecture]] project. The roof will help manage surface water, provide for [[wildlife]] and provide for [[recreation]].

Sustainability appears to be a new addition to the traditional [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] objectives of the design process: a structure must be solid, useful, and beautiful (''firmitas'', ''utilitas'', ''venustas''). But it can be seen as an aspect of both solidity and usefulness: an outdoor space is likely to last longer and give more usefulness to its owners if it requires low inputs of energy, water, fertiliser etc., and if it produces fewer outputs of noise, [[pollution]], [[surface water runoff]] etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38813">'''System justification theory''' ('''SJT''') is a theory within [[social psychology]] that system-justifying beliefs serve a psychologically palliative function. It proposes that people have several underlying needs, which vary from individual to individual, that can be satisfied by the defense and justification of the status quo, even when the system may be disadvantageous to certain people. People have epistemic, existential, and relational needs that are met by and manifest as ideological support for the prevailing structure of social, economic, and political norms. Need for order and stability, and thus resistance to change or alternatives, for example, can be a motivator for individuals to see the status quo as good, legitimate, and even desirable.

According to system justification theory, people desire not only to hold favorable attitudes about themselves (ego-justification) and the groups to which they belong (group-justification), but also to hold positive attitudes about the overarching social structure in which they are entwined and find themselves obligated to (system-justification). This system-justifying motive sometimes produces the phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, an acceptance of inferiority among low-status groups and a positive image of relatively higher status groups. Thus, the notion that individuals are simultaneously supporters and victims of the system-instilled norms is a central idea in system justification theory. Additionally, the passive ease of supporting the current structure, when compared to the potential price (material, social, psychological) of acting out against the status quo, leads to a shared environment in which the existing social, economic, and political arrangements tend to be preferred. Alternatives to the status quo tend to be disparaged, and inequality tends to perpetuate.&lt;ref name="jostbanaji1994"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Origins==
Previous social psychological theories that aimed to explain intergroup behavior typically focused on the tendencies for people to have positive attitudes about themselves (ego-justification) and their self-relevant groups (group-justification).&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; In other words, people are motivated to engage in behaviors that allow for them to maintain a high self-esteem and a positive image of their group.&lt;ref name=Jost&amp;Hunyady2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Orsolya Hunyady |title=The psychology of system justification and the palliative function of ideology|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=13|pages=111–153|doi=10.1080/10463280240000046}}&lt;/ref&gt;
System Justification theory addressed the additional, prevalent phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, in which people defend the social systems (status quo) even when it does not benefit, and in the long-run may even cause more harm, to the individual or the group to which he or she belongs. Out-group favoritism can manifest as a dis-identification on the part of members of lower social status with their own categorical grouping (social, ethnic, economic, political) and instead further support for the existing structure. Prior social psychology theories lacked explanation for and attention given to popular instances of out-group favoritism; thus, SJT was developed to further explain and understand why some people tend to legitimize the prevailing social systems, despite their being against one's interests, in a way that previous social psychological theories did not.&lt;ref name=jostbanaji1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

==Theoretical influences==
While [[Social Identity Theory]], [[Cognitive Dissonance|Cognitive Dissonance Theory]], [[Just-world hypothesis|Just-World Hypothesis]], [[Social Dominance Theory]], and [[false consciousness|Marxist-Feminists Theories of Ideologies]] have heavily influenced System Justification Theory, it has also expanded on these perspectives, infusing them with the system-justification motive and behaviors.

===Cognitive dissonance theory===
One of the most popular and well-known social psychological theories, [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] explains that people have a need to maintain cognitive consistency in order to retain a positive self-image.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jostetal2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Brett W. Pelham |author3=Oliver Sheldon |author4=Bilian Sullivan |title=Social inequality and the reduction of ideological dissonance on behalf of the system: evidence of enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=33|issue=1|pages=13–36|doi=10.1002/ejsp.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; System justification theory builds off the cognitive dissonance framework, in that it posits people will justify a social system in order to retain a positive image of that social system, due to the fact that they inherently play a role (whether passive or active) in perpetuating it.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Social identity theory===
Jost and colleagues interpret [[social identity theory]] as suggesting that when people are presented with intergroup conflict that threatens their social group identities people will justify behaviors like [[stereotypes|stereotyping]] and [[discrimination]] against outgroups in order to maintain their positive group image.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; This interpretation has been rejected by social identity theorists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1348/014466601164777|title=Social Identity Theory does not maintain that identification produces bias, and Self-categorization Theory does not maintain that salience is identification: Two comments on Mummendey, Klink and Brown|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=173–176|year=2001|last1=McGarty|first1=Craig|pmid=11446223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

People with out-group favoritism will hold more positive images of other, often higher status, groups (outgroups) than the groups they belong to (ingroups). Thus, the argument is that system justification theory builds on the foundations of social identity theory in attempting to account for the out-group favoritism observed in many disadvantaged group members that social identity theory does not.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jost|first=John T.|chapter=Outgroup favoritism and the theory of system justification: A paradigm for investigating the effects of socioeconomic success on stereotype content|title=Cognitive Social Psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition|year=2001|pages=89–102 |chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907081147/http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Jost%20(2001)%20Outgroup%20favoritism%20and%20the%20theory%20of%20system%20justification1.pdf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DE-cJ8F4rSMC&amp;pg=PA89|editor-first=Gordon B. |editor-last=Moskowitz|isbn=9780805834147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social dominance theory===
This theory has widely been compared to system justification theory since they are both system justifying theories. [[Social dominance theory]] focuses on people’s motive to maintain a positive group image by generally supporting hierarchical inequality at the group level. Individuals with a high social dominance orientation (SDO) will hold myths that tend to be hierarchy enhancing, which justify an in-group's place and their relation to it. Thus, in both social dominance theory and system justification theory, there are common threads of group-based opposition to equality and justification for maintaining intergroup inequalities through systemic norms.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubin&amp;Hewstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Rubin|author2=Miles Hewstone |title=Social Identity, System Justification, and Social Dominance: Commentary on Reicher, Jost et al., and Sidanius et al.|journal=Political Psychology|year=2004|volume=25|issue=6|pages=823–844|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00400.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sidaniusetal2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sidanius|first=Jim|author2=Felicia Pratto |author3=Colette Van Laar |author4=Shana Levin |title=Social Dominance Theory: Its Agenda and Method|journal=Political Psychology|year=2004|volume=25|issue=6|pages=845–880|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00401.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief in a just world===
This [[Just-world theory|theory]] broadly explains that people are inclined to believe the world is generally fair, and that the outcomes of people’s behavior are subsequently deserved. Ideologies that relate to belief in a just world have to do with maintaining a sense of personal control and a desire to understand the world as non-random. Such ideologies include the protestant work ethic and belief in meritocracy. Essentially, belief in a just world feeds an epistemic need for predictability, order, and stability in one's environment. System justification theory, while keeping the perspective that people are inclined to believe the world is just, extracts the underlying epistemic needs of the just world ideology and uses them as support for why people are motivated to uphold the system. In other words, preference for stability, predictability, and the perception of personal control, over random chance, motivates one to see the status quo as fair and legitimate.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; This can be an issue, however, due to the fact that disadvantaged people can easily internalize their low position and blame themselves for 'shortcomings' or lack of 'successes.'

===False consciousness===
In order to account for the phenomenon of outgroup favoritism that is a main component of system justification, theorists have derived heavily from the Marxist-feminist theories on the prevailing ideologies as tools to preserve the system. In particular, the concept of [[false consciousness]], in which the dominant group in society believes their dominance to be destined, can help to inform why certain members of disadvantage groups sometimes engage in outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; Further, system justification emphasizes that those that lack means of material production (lower status) are subject to the ideas, (cultural values, legislation, and social teachings) of the dominant, controlling group.

==Aspects of system justification theory==

===Rationalization of the status quo===

One of the main aspects of [[system justification theory]] explains that people are motivated to justify the [[status quo]] and view it as stable and desirable. To this extent, theorists have provided specific [[hypotheses|hypothesis]] in which the rationalization of the status quo can manifest. One consequence of the system-justifying motivation, is the rationalization of desirability of likely versus less-likely events.

Since people will be inclined to make sure their preferences are congruent with the status quo, in situations of inevitability, people are more likely to endorse the status quo as a coping mechanism for dealing with unpleasant realities. In essence, people will judge events that are more likely as more desirable than events that are less likely.&lt;ref name=jostbanaji1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Anticipatory rationalization studies completed during presidential election in 2000 demonstrate how future candidate endorsement and desirability is dependent on the likelihood of that candidate winning.  When subjects of both the Republican and Democratic parties were told, for example, that it was probable that one candidate would win over the other, people of both parties tended to rationalize support for the more likely winner. System justification for seemingly inevitable and unavoidable outcomes serves as a stress/dissonance reducer and provides psychological and emotional consolation, as well as allowing the individual to feel a sense of control over external events.

Another way people rationalize the [[status quo]] is through the use of [[stereotypes]]. When people perceive threats to the predominant system, they are more inclined to cling to and back the existing structure, and one way of doing so is by means of endorsing [[stereotypes]] that rationalize inequality. If one considers oneself a member of a higher social status group (economic standing, race, gender) he or she will hold favorable stereotypes about their group and less positive ones toward lower status outgroups. As perceived legitimacy of the system or threat to it increases, members of both disadvantaged and advantaged groups will be more motivated to utilize [[stereotypes]] as explanatory rationalizations (no matter how weak) for unequal status differences. Those that belong to disadvantaged groups will tend to associate positive characteristics (favorable stereotypes) to high status members and lead low status group members to minimize negative feelings about their low status.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Thus, stereotype endorsement as system justification is consensual and holds a palliative function. This is true for both the ingroup and outgroup. Stereotypes also deflect blame of unfair status differences from the system and instead, attribute inequality to group traits or characteristics. Such rationalization for inequality via stereotyping is said to be what makes political conservatives happier than liberals. In a recent research study on the connection of system justification beliefs and [[ambivalent sexism]], researchers found that benevolent sexism beliefs related to higher [[life satisfaction]] through system justification. That is, both men and women may be motivated to hold benevolent sexism beliefs because such beliefs may help to promote the notion that the status quo is fair, which in turn can maintain life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0361684312456369|title = Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing? Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction|journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume = 36|issue = 4|pages = 432–443|year = 2012|last1 = Connelly|first1 = K.|last2 = Heesacker|first2 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outgroup favoritism===
In contrast to [[ingroup favoritism]], which holds that people have a motivation to regard the social groups that they belong in more positively than other groups, outgroup favoritism is when people tend to regard groups to which they do not belong more positively than the groups to which they are members.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; System justification theorists argue that this is an example or manifestation of how some people have unconsciously absorbed, processed, and attempted to cope with existing inequalities—more specifically, one's own disadvantaged position in the social hierarchy. Because people have a tendency to justify the status quo (which usually consists of inequality among groups) and believe that it is fair and legitimate, certain people from low status groups will accept, internalize, and hence perpetuate that inequality.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

Criticisms of outgroup favoritism have suggested observations of this in disadvantaged group members are simply manifestations of more general [[demand characteristics]] or [[social norms]] that encourage low status groups to evaluate other groups more positively.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; In response to this, system justification theorists introduced both implicit and explicit measures of outgroup favoritism. It was found that low status group members still exhibited outgroup favoritism (i.e. preference for other groups) on both implicit and explicit measures, and they displayed higher instances of outgroup favoritism on implicit measures than on explicit (self-reported) measures. In contrast, people from high status groups were found to display [[ingroup favoritism]] more on implicit measures.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=JostPelhamCarvallo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Brett Pelham |author3=Mauricio Carvallo |title=Non-conscious forms of system justification: Implicit and behavioral preferences for higher status groups.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=38|issue=6|pages=586–602|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(02)00505-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it is expected that when motivation to justify the system or status quo increases and it is perceived to be more legitimate, high status group members will also display increased [[ingroup favoritism]], while low status group members will display increased outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;
Researchers have also linked [[conservatism|political conservatism]] with system justification, in that conservatism is associated with upholding [[tradition]] and resistance to change, which is similar to justifying the status quo (or current state of social, political, and economic [[norm (social)|norm]]s). Along this vein, system justification theorists hold that high status group members will engage in increased [[ingroup favoritism]] the more politically conservative they are, while low status group members will display increased outgroup favoritism the more politically [[conservative]] they are.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Depressed entitlement===
Research on [[Male–female income disparity in the United States|wage disparities]] among men and women have found that women often believe they are paid less than men because they do not deserve equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hough|first=Mary|author2=Janice D. Yoder |title=The Role of Status in Producing Depressed Entitlement in Women's and Men's Pay Allocations|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=2003|volume=27|issue=4|pages=330–337|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Major|first=Brenda|author2=Mark Zanna |chapter=From social inequality to personal entitlement: The role of social comparisons, legitimacy appraisals, and group membership|year=1994|volume=26|pages=293–355|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-00371-006|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60156-2|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152261}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depressed entitlement was first thought as the manifestation of women internalizing the low status of their gender compared to men. Subsequent research has found depressed entitlement occur across contexts in which gender was not a variable. System justification theorists have suggested that depressed entitlement is another general example of how individuals of low status groups absorb their inferiority in order to justify the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; As such, system justification holds that low status group members regardless of context will be more likely to display instances of depressed entitlement than high status group members. And this will be seen more among low status group members for completed work as opposed to work not yet completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanton|first=Hart|author2=Greg George |author3=Jennifer Crocker |title=Contexts of System Justification and System Evaluation: Exploring the Social Comparison Strategies of the (Not Yet) Contented Female Worker|journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=126–137|doi=10.1177/1368430201004002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ego, group, and system justification motives===
As previously stated, people are motivated by the desire for [[self-esteem|ego-justification]] and [[social identity|group-justification]] to view themselves and their group positively (which can manifest through feelings of [[self-esteem]] and value).&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; The system-justification motive is people’s desire to view the system or status quo in a favorable light as legitimate and fair. Among high status group members, all three of these motives are congruent with one another. The need to believe the system is just and fair is easy for high status group members because they are the groups benefiting from the system and status quo. Therefore, as the advantaged groups, holding positive regard for the self and group corresponds readily with believing the status quo is legitimate.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;

In particular, as system justification motives increase for high status group members, ingroup [[ambivalence]] will decrease, levels of [[self-esteem]] will increase, and [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[neuroticism]] levels will decrease.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; For low status groups, the [[self-esteem|ego-justification]] and [[social identity|group-justification]] motives come into conflict with the system-justification motive. If low status group members have a desire to believe the status quo and prevailing system is fair and legitimate, then this would conflict with the motivation of these individuals to maintain positive self and group images. Theorists posit that this conflict of justification motives creates conflicting or [[ambivalence|mixed attitudes]] in low status groups as a result of being the disadvantaged group that does not necessarily benefit from the status quo.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost 2000 293–305"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Diana Burgess |title=Attitudinal Ambivalence and the Conflict between Group and System Justification Motives in Low Status Groups|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2000|volume=26|issue=3|pages=293–305|doi=10.1177/0146167200265003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As system justification motives increase for low status group members, ingroup [[ambivalence]] will increase and occur at stronger levels compared to high status groups, levels of [[self-esteem]] will decrease, and [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[neuroticism]] levels will increase. Moreover, researchers suggest that when ego and group justification motives are particularly decreased, system-justification motives will increase.&lt;ref name="Jost 2000 293–305"/&gt;

===Enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged===
Based on [[cognitive dissonance theory]] that holds people have a need to reduce dissonance and maintain cognitive consistency, system justification theory explains that people are motivated to rationalize and justify instances of inequality in order to preserve and defend the legitimacy of the system.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; Because people have this need to believe the current prevailing system is legitimate and the way it is for a reason, when presented with instances where this might threaten that, people will respond with more justifications to maintain the legitimacy of the system or status quo. Since high status group members regularly benefit from the prevailing system, they are expected to rarely be presented with examples that would threaten the legitimacy of the system. In contrast, it is expected that low status group members who do not benefit from the system, would be presented more regularly with threats to the legitimacy of the system and status quo. Thus, it is expected for system justification tendencies to increase in societies with more substantial group inequalities, and low status group members will be more inclined than high status group members to provide more intense justifications to rationalize and uphold the prevailing systems and status quo.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Compensatory stereotypes===
Research has found that [[stereotypes|compensatory stereotypes]] might lead to increased justification of the status quo. That is, [[stereotypes]] that have components that would offset the negative aspects of the stereotypes would allow people to more easily explain or justify the inequality of the prevailing system.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; One of the more common examples is the compensatory stereotype of “poor but happy” or “rich but miserable.”&lt;ref name=KayJost2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Aaron|author2=John Jost |title=Complementary Justice: Effects of "Poor but Happy" and "Poor but Honest" Stereotype Exemplars on System Justification and Implicit Activation of the Justice Motive|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=5|pages=823–837|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.823|pmid=14599247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stereotypes like these that incorporate a positive aspect to counterbalance the negative aspect would lead people to increase their justification of the status quo. Other findings suggested that these compensatory stereotypes are preferred by those with more left leaning [[political ideologies]], while those with more right leaning [[political ideologies]] preferred non-complimentary stereotypes that simply rationalized [[Social inequality|inequality]] rather than compensated for it.&lt;ref name="Kay Jost2009"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Left–right ideological differences in system justification following exposure to complementary versus noncomplementary stereotype exemplars|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=39|issue=2|pages=290–298|doi=10.1002/ejsp.500|last1=Kay|first1=Aaron C.|last2=Czapliński|first2=Szymon|last3=Jost|first3=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But that overall, [[conservatives]] were more likely to have increased system justification tendencies than [[Liberalism|liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Brian A. Nosek |author3=Samuel D. Gosling |title=Ideology: Its Resurgence in Social, Personality, and Political Psychology|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|year=2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=126–136|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00070.x|pmid=26158879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Jack Glaser |author3=Arie W.Kruglanski |author4=Frank Sulloway |title=Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2003|volume=129|issue=3|pages=339–375|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339|pmid=12784934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of system justification==
Consequences of people’s motivation to legitimize the status quo are wide-ranging. In needing to believe that the current or prevailing systems are fair and just, results in people justifying the existing inequalities within it.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Research on system justification theory has been applied to many different social and political contexts that have found the theory has implications for general [[social change]], social policies, and specific [[communities]].
Research has found that people with increased system justification motives are more resistant to change, and thus an implication of this would be greater difficulty to move towards [[policy|policies]], [[governments]], [[authority]] figures, and [[hierarchies]] that reflect [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Gary|author2=John Jost |title=System Justification Theory and Research: Implications for Law, Legal Advocacy, and Social Justice|journal=California Law Review|year=2006|volume=94|issue=4|pages=1119–1168|jstor=20439060|doi=10.2307/20439060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that system justification motives reduce emotional distress in people that would otherwise result in demands for amendments to perceived [[injustices]] or inequalities. Specifically, [[moral outrage]], guilt, and [[frustration]] are reduced when system justification motives increase. This has shown to result in less support for social policies that redistribute resources in the aim for [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Orsola Hunyady |title=ecedents and Consequences of System-Justifying Ideologies|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=14|issue=5|pages=260–265|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakslak|first=Cheryl|author2=John T. Jost |author3=Tom R. Tyler |author4=Emmeline S. Chen |title=Moral Outrage Mediates the Dampening Effect of System Justification on Support for Redistributive Social Policies|journal=Psychological Science|year=2007|volume=18|issue=3|pages=267–274|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01887.x|pmid=17444925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries, in which group inequalities are most evident, researchers were interested in testing the claim of system justification theory that when inequalities are more visible, this will result in greater justification of the status quo.&lt;ref name="Henry 2006 365–378"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=PJ|author2=Andrea Saul |title=The Development of System Justification in the Developing World|journal=Social Justice Research|year=2006|volume=19|issue=3|pages=365–378|doi=10.1007/s11211-006-0012-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers visited the most impoverished areas of [[Bolivia]], and found that among children (aged 10–15) who were members of low status groups, legitimized the [[Bolivian government]] as sufficiently meeting the needs of the people more than children from high status groups. Observing system-justification motives in low status groups located in one of the most impoverished countries implies there will be less support for [[social change]] in a country that arguable needs it the most.&lt;ref name="Henry 2006 365–378"/&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, there were different reactions to the devastation it brought to communities as well as the government’s [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|relief efforts]]. Researchers who have studied these reactions, found that the slow and inefficient response of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|relief efforts]] were perceived by some to expose “governmental shortcomings, call into question the legitimacy of agency leadership, and highlight [[racial inequality]] in [[United States of America|America]].”&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Jaime L.|author2=Anesu N. Mandisodza |author3=Susan M. Andersen |author4=John T. Jost |title=System Justification in Responding to the Poor and Displaced in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|year=2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=57–73|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2006.00102.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These perceptions indirectly brought a threat to the legitimacy of the U.S. government (i.e. the system). As a result of this system threat, researchers found that people tended to restore legitimacy to the system through utilizing [[stereotypes]] and [[victim blaming]].&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;  In particular, since the majority of the communities affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]] were generally low-income and composed mostly of [[minorities]], some people used [[stereotypes]] to blame the victims for their misfortune and restore legitimacy to the [[government]].&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"/&gt; Researchers explained how this could have consequences for the victims and restoring their homes and communities back to normal. Increased system justification, and increased victim blaming could be detrimental in providing the victims the resources needed to work towards repairing the damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"/&gt;

==Critiques==

===Social identity theory debate===
This debate arose from [[social identity]] theorists countering a critique to the theory by system justification theorists. The critique by system justification theorists refers to the evidence for the theoretical conception of system justification theory that derived from limitations to [[social identity theory]].&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; System justification theorists have stated that Social Identity Theory does not account for outgroup favoritism, and that the limitations of the theory only lend it to measure [[ingroup favoritism]]. Advocates for [[social identity theory]] claim that this critique is more a result of lack of research done that has focused on outgroup favoritism rather than a limitation of the theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="Rubin&amp;Hewstone"/&gt; Moreover, social identity theorists also claim this is not sufficient evidence for the need of system justification and [[Social Dominance Theory|social dominance]] theories to help account for justification motives. As such, they have claimed that research that measures outgroup favoritism from a social identity perspective is simply needed to bolster the theory. While both theories continue to produce findings, the debate continues to be discussed.&lt;ref name="Rubin&amp;Hewstone"/&gt;

===Relation to status quo bias===
Another critique is that SJT is too similar and indistinguishable to [[status quo bias]]. Given that both deal directly with upholding and legitimizing the status quo, this critique is not unfounded. But system justification theory differs from the [[status quo bias]] in that it is predominately [[motivational]] rather than [[cognitive]]. Generally, the status quo bias refers to a tendency to prefer the default or established option when making choices. In contrast, system justification posits that people need and want to see prevailing social systems as fair and just. The motivational component of system justification means that its effects are exacerbated when people are under psychological threat or when they feel their outcomes are especially dependent on the system that is being justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Current research==
Congruent with a broader trend toward [[neuroscience]], current research on system justification has tested to see how this manifests in the [[brain]]. Findings by researchers have shown that people with more [[conservative]] ideologies differed in certain [[brain]] structures, which was associated with sensitivity to threat and response conflict.&lt;ref name="Jost 2012 55–64"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=David Amodio |title=Political ideology as motivated social cognition: Behavioral and neuroscientific evidence|journal=Motivation and Emotion|year=2012|volume=36|issue=1|pages=55–64|doi=10.1007/s11031-011-9260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, those who were more [[conservative]] were “associated with greater neural sensitivity to threat and larger [[amygdala]] volume, as well as less sensitivity to response conflict and smaller [[anterior cingulate]] volume,” compared to those who were more [[liberalism|liberal]]. This research is currently exploratory and has not yet determined the direction of the relations to ideology and brain structures.&lt;ref name="Jost 2012 55–64"/&gt;

Recent findings by researchers have shown that system justification motives to legitimize the [[status quo]] was found in young children.&lt;ref name="Baron 2009 918–926"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=Andrew|author2=Mahzarin Banaji |title=Evidence of System Justification in Young Children|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|year=2009|volume=3|issue=6|pages=918–926|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00214.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through utilizing the [[developmental psychology|developmental psychological theory]] and data, children as early as age 5 were found to have basic understandings of their ingroup and the status of their ingroup. System justification motives were also observed in that children from low status groups were found display implicit outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Baron 2009 918–926"/&gt; Research on system justification in young children remains a current trend.

The '''UNC Coastal Studies Institute''' (or '''UNC-CSI''') is a campus used for research of the coastal environments and eco-systems, at 850 NC-345, [[Wanchese, North Carolina|Wanchese]], in the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]], United States. The campus serves [[East Carolina University]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina State University]], [[UNC Wilmington]] and [[Elizabeth City State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastalstudiesinstitute.org|title=UNC Coastal Studies Institute - Coastal Studies Institute|website=Coastal Studies Institute|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNC CSI is a {{convert|52000|sqft|sqm}} research facility, on a {{convert|200|acre|hectare}} site along the [[Croatan Sound]] on the Outer Banks near the town of [[Manteo, North Carolina|Manteo]]. The facility includes research labs for [[marine archaeology]], coastal processes, estuarine ecology, public policy and engineering. The building also houses classrooms and laboratories, along with marine operations, administration and research offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rmf.com/unc-coastal-studies-institute-project-wins-prestigious-international-architecture-award/|title=UNC Coastal Studies Institute Project Wins Prestigious International Architecture Award {{!}} RMF Engineering|date=2014-09-17|work=RMF Engineering|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The building plans for the UNC-CSI campus were designed considering guidelines set forth by the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] program. Designers focused heavily on low energy use and water conservation. The campus contains sustainable features, including the building itself and the landscape design throughout the campus. The UNC-CSI building is LEED Gold certified (the second highest certification possible). LEED scores on a point system, from 40 (standard certification) to 80+ points for a Platinum certification. UNC-CSI was awarded 64 points and a Gold certification in 2014. The designers achieved this by integrating sustainable building materials and sustainable technologies. There are six categories in which LEED scores on, UNC-CSI’s campus scored in all categories, the first being alternative transportation. This includes bicycle storage and preferred parking for low emission and carpool vehicles. On storm-water management and landscape design, 71% of the site is open space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coastalstudiesinstitute.org/facilities/unc-csi-campus/|title=UNC CSI Campus - Coastal Studies Institute|work=Coastal Studies Institute|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy consumption is reduced by 37%{{clarify|date=April 2018}} and portable water consumption is reduced by 75%{{clarify|date=April 2018}}. 24% of the building materials are recycled and 75% of on-site waste was also recycled. The UNC Coastal Studies Institute was also designed for 95% of occupiable space to be exposed to daylight.

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]].

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1990).''Studies in the History of the English Language''. Heidelberg: Carl Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.
