The '''1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning''', also known as '''Le Pain Maudit''', occurred on 15 August 1951, in the small town of [[Pont-Saint-Esprit]] in southern [[France]]. More than 250 people were involved, including 4 deaths. A [[foodborne illness]] was suspected, and among these it was originally believed to be a case of "cursed bread" (''pain maudit'').

Most academic sources accept [[ergotism|ergot poisoning]] as the cause of the epidemic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.930.650-a|author=Gabbai, Lisbonne and Pourquier|date=15 September 1951|title=Ergot Poisoning at Pont St. Esprit|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|volume=2|issue=4732|pages=650–651|pmc=2069953|pmid=14869677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finger2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Finger|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GMeW9E1IB4C&amp;pg=PA221|accessdate=24 February 2013|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514694-3|pages=221–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PommervilleAlcamo2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey C.

==Ergot poisoning==
Shortly after the incident, in September 1951, scientists writing in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' declared that “the outbreak of poisoning” was due to eating bread made from rye grain that was infected with the fungus.&lt;ref name="BMJ1951"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.930.650-a |last1=Gabbai|last2=Lisbonne|last3=Pourquier|date=15 September 1951|title=Ergot Poisoning at Pont St. Esprit|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|volume=2|issue=4732|pages=650–651|pmc=2069953|pmid=14869677}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims appeared to have one common connection -they had eaten bread from the bakery of Roch Briand who was subsequently blamed for using flour made from contaminated rye.

==Other theories==
Later investigations suggested [[mercury poisoning]] due to the use of [[Panogen]] or other [[fungicide]]s used to treat grains and seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Ott]], ''Pharmacotheon: Entheogenic Drugs, their Plant Sources and History'' (Kennewick, W.A.: Natural Products Co., 1993), pg. 145. See also Dr. [[Albert Hofmann]], ''LSD: My Problem Child'' (New York, N.Y.: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1980), [http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/my_problem_child/chapter1.html Chapter 1: "How LSD Originated," pg. 6.] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522103440/http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/my_problem_child/chapter1.html |date=22 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982, a French researcher suggested ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'', a [[mycotoxin|toxic fungus]] produced in [[grain silo]]s, as a potential culprit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreau|first=C.|year=1982|title=Les mycotoxines neurotropes de l'Aspergillus fumigatus; une hypothèse sur le "pain maudit" de Pont-Saint-Esprit|journal=Bulletin de la Société Mycologique de France|issue=98|pages=261–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, historian [[Steven Kaplan (historian)|Steven Kaplan]] published a book on the incident (in French), entitled ''Le Pain Maudit''.&lt;ref name=Kaplanbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Steven|title=Le Pain Maudit|editor=[[Fayard]]|year=2008|isbn=978-2-213-63648-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaplan asserts that the incident was connected neither to LSD research nor to ergot poisoning.&lt;ref name="BBC2010" /&gt; Kaplan's book argues that the poisoning might have been caused by [[nitrogen trichloride]] used to artificially (and illegally) bleach flour.&lt;ref name=Kaplanbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laviedesidees.fr/Quand-le-pain-empoisonne.html Quand le pain empoisonne], ''La Vie des idées'', 2008-09-03 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Researcher [[John Grant Fuller Jr.]]'s 1968 book, ''The Day of Saint Anthony's Fire'' concluded that a form of ergot that "logically has to be akin to LSD" was the likely culprit, but that we may never know for certain because toxicologists and doctors could not reach an agreement. Citing the opinion of toxicologists, Fuller asserts that the symptoms exhibited by victims in Pont-Saint-Esprit were not consistent with mercury poisoning.&lt;ref name="Fuller1969"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller|first=John |title=The Day of St Anthony's Fire |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |year= 1969 |isbn=0-09-095460-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC2010" /&gt;

In his 2009 book, ''A Terrible Mistake,'' writer Hank P. Albarelli Jr alleged that the Special Operations Division of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) tested the use of LSD on the population of Pont-Saint-Esprit as part of its [[MKNAOMI]] chemical behavior program in a field test dubbed [[Project SPAN]]. According to Albarelli, the ergot contamination explanation had been challenged and "ruled out".&lt;ref name="BBC2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-10996838 |title=Pont-Saint-Esprit poisoning: Did the CIA spread LSD?|last1= Thomson |first1= Mike|date=23 August 2010 |website=BBC.com |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/book-claims-cia-lsd-experiment-made-french-town/story?id=10171002 |title=Did CIA Experiment LSD on French Town? |last1=Schpolianksy |first1=Christophe |date=23 March 2010 |website=ABCnews.com |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albarelli2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article164447.html |title=CIA: What Really Happened in the quiet French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit |last1= Albarelli  |first1=Hank P.

{{Elections in California}}
'''Proposition 52''' is a [[California ballot proposition]] that passed on the November 8, 2016 ballot, regarding indefinitely extending an existing charge on hospitals to fund [[Medi-Cal]] health care services. The charge, called the "Hospital Quality Assurance Fee", has been collected since 2009 with temporary renewals and was scheduled to expire on January 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Voter Information Guide|url=http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/pdf/complete-vig.pdf|website=California Secretary of State|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;!--Likely to be archived to http://vigarchive.sos.ca.gov/2016/general--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments for the measure stated that the charge helps to secure more than $4 billion in federal [[matching funds]] annually. Additionally, the measure would help curtail the diversion of some of the funds to things other than Medi-Cal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yes on Proposition 52 to keep Medi-Cal funded|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-proposition-52-20160912-snap-story.html|accessdate=17 September 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against the measure stated that it lacks oversight and that there would still be no guarantee that funds would be spent on healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colliver|first1=Victoria|title=Prop. 52, a measure to fund Medi-Cal, is its own worst enemy|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/Prop-52-a-measure-to-fund-Medi-Cal-is-its-own-9213439.php|accessdate=17 September 2016|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Proposition 52, Voter Approval to Divert Hospital Fee Revenue Dedicated to Medi-Cal (2016)|url=https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_52,_Voter_Approval_to_Divert_Hospital_Fee_Revenue_Dedicated_to_Medi-Cal_(2016)|website=Ballotpedia|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-oppressive practice''' ('''AOP''') is an interdisciplinary approach primarily rooted within the practice of [[social work]] that focuses on ending socioeconomic [[oppression]]. It requires the practitioner to critically examine the power imbalance inherent in an organizational structure with regards to the larger [[sociocultural]] and political context in order to develop strategies for creating an egalitarian environment free from oppression, racism, and other forms of discrimination in the larger society, by engaging at the legal and political level. In general community practice it is about responding to oppression by dominant groups and individuals. In social services it regulates any possible oppressive practices and helps in delivering welfare services in an inclusive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Strier | first = Roni | title = Anti-oppressive research in social work: a preliminary definition | journal = [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 857&amp;ndash;871 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/bjsw/bcl062 | date = July 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcl062 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction== 
Anti-oppressive practice seeks to lessen ("starve the beast") the exclusion of certain social groups from social equality, rights and social justice. Social work generally is known to be a "caring" profession, but sometimes services provided that work for one person do not necessarily work for another or reflect the sensitivity required to work for another. Related to this there may be a 'care versus control' issue, because where there is care there is responsibility, and therefore control and power which can lead to exclusions (Humphries, 2004, p105). Knowingly and deliberately causing discrimination to another constitutes an oppressive practice, the behavior also matters as much as intent. The onus of the social worker is to show s/he exercised due diligence according to generally accepted practices and conducts him/herself in a manner generally accepted by society which constitutes as neutral/ordinary “[[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert P. Mullaly|title=Challenging Oppression and Confronting Privilege: A Critical Social Work Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G70gAQAAMAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-542970-1|pages=128+}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An imbalance in care and control of services may lead to oppression. Lena Dominelli (2002) defines Oppression as, "relations that divide people into dominant or superior groups and subordinate or inferior ones. These relations of domination consist of the systematic devaluing of the attributes and contributions of those deemed inferior, and their exclusion from the social resources available to those in the dominant group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dominelli|first1=Lena|last2=Campling|first2=Jo|title=Anti Oppressive Social Work Theory and Practice|date=16 September 2002|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1-4039-1400-2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exclusion (E.g. [[Xenophobia]]) that results from oppression or vice versa, can affect an individual or a system greatly. This process is often evaluative, where the individual ends up measuring him/herself in a hierarchy against the other based on the personal values s/he holds. Disposing to this, results in one's identity or trait being regarded as superior to the other, thus creating an "us-them" dynamic (othering process) resulting in division and which creates risk for oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Lena Dominelli, Jo Campling (2002). ''Anti-oppressive social work theory and practice''. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|9781403914002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The anti-oppressive model==
In social work, the anti-oppressive model aims to function and promote equal, non-oppressive social relations between various identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacsw.org/Publications/Proceedings2012/HogewoningAntioppresive.pdf |title=Anti-oppressive practice and social trinitarianism: An interconnection of faith and social work principles |website=Nacsw.org |date=2012 |author=Lydia Hogewoning |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;Dominelli (2002) defines it, "in challenging established truths about identity, anti-oppressive practice seeks to subvert the stability of universalized biological representations of social division to both validate diversity and enhance solidarity based on celebrating difference amongst peoples" (p.&amp;nbsp;39). It remains dedicated to principles of social justice, which is also upheld in NASW values, by acknowledging diversity within oppression and considering the intersection and hierarchies of the "isms" that construct people as victims or perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitner|first1=R. O.|last2=Sakamoto|first2=I.|title=The role of critical consciousness in multicultural practice: Examining how its strength becomes its weakness|journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|date=2005|volume=75|issue=4|pages=684-694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-oppressive model analyzes and advocates against macro &amp; micro levels of oppression and emphasizes on social justice and social change along more empowering and emancipatory lines.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple and Burke, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex and unequal role of "power" and "isms" are considered as an immense complication in AOP. Those who benefit as in most relationships are those who with most power.&lt;ref&gt;McNay, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson argues that there is essentially 3 stacks of barriers in AOP. They are Personal (P), Cultural (C) and Structural (S). P refers to personal and prejudice factors. C refers to culture, commonalities, consensus and conformity. S refers to Structural aspects like sociopolitical force or other social dimensions. Thompson refers as P being embedded in C and C in S, interacting with each other in continuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youthworkinit.com/thompson-pcs-model/|title=What Is The Thompson PCS Model? – Youth Workin' It|date=6 November 2012|website=Youthworkinit.com|accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Personal:''''' Evaluation of gender, through feminist empowerment models tend to construct men as threatening or useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Scourfield|title=Gender and Child Protection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVsdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|date=23 October 2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4039-1403-3|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly noted in risk assessments where domestic violence is an issue and the need to construct one person as a perpetrator. The men as threatening model ignores the reality that same-sex violence exists similar to heterosexual violence in intimate relationships and the levels of female-on-male violence.&lt;ref&gt;Renzetti, 1992; Leventhal and Lundy, 1999; Dutton and Corvo, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cultural:''''' Language has a contribution to oppression in general, language with its marking function constructs social structure and an interplay in creating cultural values. Government records categorize people who are neither white or male, as ''ethnic'' presuming white people do not have an ethnicity but are the norm, and white people are often "de-raced" in discourses.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Structural:''''' In 2006 Aldridge on the regulations of UK immigration policies, pointed out its direct proportion with structural use of power to regulate religious and ethnic diversity. Aldridge notes religion as a cultural source on which individuals and groups draw identity, motivation, mobilization and legitimacy; and that as such it is a volatile and unpredictable resource which has the capacity for increasing both social cohesion and social conflict. These effects on immigration policy in UK populations where criticized as masking of obvious hegemonic dichotomy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 2004 Humphries stated failure to critically analyse legislation's and social policy led "failure to identify the inherent racism within immigration" systems.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Clifford, Beverley Burke (2008). Anti-Oppressive Ethics and Values in Social Work. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|9781137130549}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In community practices, AOP functions to address problems that rise due to structural imbalance; [[Herbert Marcuse]] defined the state as: "Law and order are always and everywhere the law and order which protect the established hierarchy; it is nonsensical to invoke the absolute authority of this law and this order against those who suffer from it and struggle against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald N. Grob|title=Ideas in America: source readings in the intellectual history of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5knAQAAMAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Free Press|pages=532–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional practitioners are aware of the power (im)balance between service users and providers that reflects in practice, though the aim is always using this differences legitimately to empower others and reduce the experience of ''powerlessness'' and the resulting ''learned helplessness'' or the "culture of silence".&lt;ref&gt;Freire, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hubert L. Dreyfus|author2=Paul Rabinow|title=Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1PJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=6 June 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-86732-6|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lois McNay in 1992 commented on this power (im)balance as "Oppressions have always dominated on how our lives are lived, they are central to the profit base of the economy. The big three of them are gender, race and class". McNay cites exploitive division of labour as an example.

Social work solutions to the problems of oppressed groups must include policies that address all elements of oppression. But Social workers also need to be aware that these efforts may not be necessarily supported by partners in the process of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Myers, University of Salford, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
Through AOP social work practice focuses on a more emancipatory form of practice which locates the individual people and their family within their social contexts and helps them with structural patterns of the society that perpetuate inequalities through promotion of choices.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing issues in abbreviations and legal terms can be disempowering to clients and considered oppressive. Speaking plainly and clearly is considered good working practice, where the client can not only understand but can become involved in making choices and decisions about their involvement with [[social services]]. More specifically, anti-oppression deals with the negative experience of people based on their race, their gender identity, sexual identity, their physical and mental ability, their choice of religion, their class background (whether growing up poor, working poor, working, middle or upper class), their physical appearance (fat or thin), and the list goes on. It also is a way to challenge the ways people are treated based on these identities. For example, when a woman is treated in a sexist way or a person of colour experiences racism. Anti-oppressive practice is about working with the service user to include them in facilitating a user-led and user-controlled service.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Healthy professional relationships will help build the confidence of the service user to enable them to develop their own ideas about their level of involvement.

AOP is a part of professional social work development schema. They are bonded by this to develop counter-hegemonic understanding of cross-cultural and personal differences.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Social work practitioners advocate against oppression by promoting increased respect for the "inherent dignity and worth of all people", and "social justice" (NASW, 1996). Acknowledging NASW values, along with "the importance of human relationships," remains an integral part of building empowering client-practitioner relationships (NASW, 1996).

==Conclusion==
'''AOP''' is a current form of progressive social work which helps to identify psychosocial issues  through an intersectional lens and act on the same. It bridges the practice-activism divide and leads the society in a transformative angle in human relations. Its reformative call has opened eyes of both public and leading private management regimes and the principles resonates in effective and harmonic utilization of resources. Anti-oppressive practice does not compromise the established and traditional 1970s Anti-Discriminatory Practice ('''ADP''') which focuses on discrimination (e.g. towards anti-racist perspective) whereas AOP deals with processes of oppression and exclusion.

{{other uses|Blackwater (disambiguation)}}

'''Blackwater''' is used to describe [[wastewater]] from toilets, which likely contains [[pathogen]]s.  Blackwater can contain [[feces]], [[urine]], water and toilet paper from [[flush toilet]]s. Blackwater is distinguished from [[greywater]], which comes from household use other than toilets.  Greywater results from washing food, clothing, dishes, as well as from showering or bathing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd Revised |author1=Tilley, E.|author2=Ulrich, L.|author3=Lüthi, C.|author4=Reymond, Ph.|author5=Zurbrügg, C.|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwater and greywater are separated in "ecological buildings", such as [[autonomous building]]s. [[Recreational vehicle]]s often have separate holding tanks for greywater from showers and sinks, and blackwater from the toilet.

==Definition==
According to one source:

{{quote|Blackwater is the mixture of [[urine]], [[human feces|feces]] and flushwater along with [[anal cleansing]] water (if water is used for cleansing) and/or dry cleansing materials. Blackwater contains the pathogens of faeces and the nutrients of urine that are diluted in the flushwater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Water coming from domestic equipment other than toilets (e.g., bathtubs, showers, sinks, washing machines) is called greywater. In some sanitation systems, it is preferred to keep the greywater separate from blackwater to reduce the amount of water that gets heavily polluted and to simplify treatment methods for the greywater.

Blackwater is a term dating to at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT3915857&amp;id=poY7AAAAEBAJ US Patent 3915857], issued in October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment processes==
Blackwater contains pathogens that must decompose before they can be released safely into the environment.  It is difficult to process blackwater if it contains a large quantity of excess water, or if it must be processed quickly, because of the high concentrations of organic material.  

=== Composting ===
However, if blackwater does not contain excess water, or if it receives primary treatment to de-water, then it is easily processed through [[composting]].  The heat produced by naturally occurring [[thermophilic]] microorganisms will heat the compost to over {{convert|60|C|F}}, and destroy potential pathogens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Blackwater generation can be avoided by making use of [[composting toilet]]s and [[vermifilter]] toilets. In certain autonomous buildings, such as [[earthship]]s, this is almost always present and allows the water requirements of the building (which, with earthships, are self-generated) to be heavily reduced. Besides saving water, composting toilets allow the user to reuse the nutrients found therein (e.g., for growing crops/trees).

'''Body fat redistribution''' ('''BFR''') '''syndrome''', sometimes called '''fat derangement''', is a medical condition characterized by fat loss (or occasionally fat gain), often in the cheeks or face.  BFR most often occurs in [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] patients undergoing [[antiretroviral]] therapy.

==Definition==
No firm definition of [[body fat]] redistribution syndrome exists as yet.  At least four syndromes have been described that are characterized by the accumulation of fat, and one by the loss of fat; combinations of these may occur in an individual. Gender, age, and pre-therapy body weight appear to influence the severity of BFR in patients.  BFR is distinct from [[lipodystrophy]], which simply refers to fat loss.

==Symptoms==
The most common manifestations of body fat redistribution are accumulations of fat in the central body in the form of a fat pad on the back of the neck and an accumulation of visceral fat in the abdomen or belly.  This fat accumulation is accompanied by a loss of subcutaneous fat in the face, arms, legs, and buttocks.

==Adverse effects==
Cosmetic concerns may cause patients to refuse or stop treatment.  If severe enough, the fat accumulation may result in [[sleep apnea]] or other sleep disorders, [[migraines]], decreased range of motion, discomfort due to pressure on internal organs, and general loss of condition.  Fat loss may result in pain in the buttocks when seated.  Other potential complications resulting from BFR include high cholesterol, high levels of [[triglycerides]], [[insulin]] resistance, [[hyperglycemia]], [[diabetes]], [[gout]], and [[cardiovascular disease]].  BFR is also associated with certain metabolic abnormalities such as elevations of plasma sugar and fats, but the precise relationship is unknown.

==Treatment==
Treatment of symptoms may include cosmetic surgery such as [[Collagen#Medical uses|collagen implants]]; treatment of the underlying syndrome may include changing from [[protease inhibitors]] to an [[NNRTI]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6665">'''Scraping a [[chalkboard]]''' (also known as a blackboard) with the [[fingernails]] produces a sound and feeling which most people find extremely irritating. The basis of the innate reaction to the sound has been studied in the field of [[psychoacoustics]] (the branch of psychology concerned with the perception of sound and its physiological effects).

==Physiological response==
===Brain Stem Reflex===
In response to audio stimuli, the minds way of interpreting sound can be translated through a regulatory process called [[Reticular_formation|The Reticular Activating System]]. Located in the [[Brainstem|brain stem]], The Reticular Activating System continually listens, even throughout delta-wave sleep, to determine importance of sounds in relation to waking the cortex or the rest of the body from sleep. Chalkboard scraping, or noises that illicit an emotional response have been known to trigger tendencies from the [[Fight-or-flight_response|fight or flight]] response which acts as the bodies primary self-defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/the-psychology-of-sound |title=The Psychology of Sound |publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional response ==
===Distinct emotion ===
A study published in 2017, in ''[[Frontiers in Psychology]]'', found that the emotion elicited by this sound and similar sounds such as a knife scraping a plate, was similar to but distinct from  disgust. The physiological response was a very slight initial fall in heart rate followed by a sharp rise, returning to normal after about 6 seconds. This pattern differed from that elicited by disgust and was shared by speakers of Spanish (which has a word for the emotion: '''''grima'''''&lt;!-- There should be a redirect from [[Grima]]; this article is substantively about this aversive emotional reaction, rather than the sound itself--&gt;) and speakers of German and English (which have no single word for the emotion). Spanish volunteers who were asked to suppress their response to ''grima''-inducing sounds were able to do so to some extent but there was no change in response to sounds that induced disgust. Some volunteers said that ''grima'' could be induced not only by sounds but also by the feel of some objects, such as sponge rubber or cork.&lt;ref name="Wong 2017"&gt;{{Cite journal  |last1=Wong |first1=Sam  |title=The feeling you get when nails scratch a blackboard has a name  |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date= 28 February 2017 |at=Daily News  |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2123018-the-feeling-you-get-when-nails-scratch-a-blackboard-has-a-name/ |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00131 |issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallo 2017"&gt; {{Cite journal  |last1=Schweiger Gallo |first1=Inge  |last2= Fernández-Dols |first2=,José-Miguel |last3= Gollwitzer|first3= Peter M. |last4= Keil |first4= Andreas |title=Grima: A Distinct Emotion Concept?  | journal=[[Frontiers in Psychology]]  |volume=8 |date= 3 February 2017 |pages=131–153 |url= https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00131 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00131 |issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primate heritage hypothesis===
One explanation for the adverse reaction is that the awful sound is similar to the warning call of a [[primate]], back in prehistoric times. However, a study using [[Cotton-top tamarin]]s, [[New World monkey]]s, found that they react similarly to both high-pitched sounds similar to fingernails on chalkboard, and to amplitude-matched [[white noise]]. In contrast, humans are less averse to the white noise than to scraping.&lt;ref name=Highfield&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|date=2005-11-14|page=A6|author=Roger Highfield|title=Study seeks root of noises that annoy us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1986 study used a tape-recording of a three-pronged garden tool similar to a [[garden fork|fork]] being "[[wikt:gride|grided]]" across a chalkboard, which roughly reproduces the sound of fingernails on chalkboard. The recording was then manipulated, removing pitches at the extremities and the median. The results were then played back. It was determined that the median pitches are in fact the primary cause of the adverse reaction, not the highest pitches as previously thought. The authors hypothesized that it was due to predation early in human evolution; the sound bore some resemblances to the alarm call of [[macaque monkey]]s, or it may have been similar to the call of some predator.&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q854vk3k33x8nw57/|title=Psychoacoustics of a chilling sound|work=[[Perception &amp; Psychophysics]]|pages=77–80|publisher=[[Psychonomic Society]]|year=1986|author1=Lynn Halpern |author2=Randolph Blake |author3=James Hillenbrand |format=PDF |doi=10.3758/BF03211488 |volume=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research won one of the authors, Randolph Blake, an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="Ig Nobel prize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news79531741.html|title=Fingernails on a Chalkboard Garner Psychologist Ig Nobel Prize|date=2006-10-08|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent research contradicts this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Applied Acoustics]]|title=Scraping sounds and disgusting noises|author=Trevor J. Cox|year=2008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V1S-4RJ4KPP-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=ac5160ddc21306e1b5382c4ec3b41b88|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2007.11.004|volume=69|issue=12|pages=1195–1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical hypothesis===

In a 2011 study, [[musicology|musicologists]] Michael Oehler and Christoph Reuter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1121/1.3655174 | volume=130 |author1=Christoph Reuter |author2=Michael Oehler| title=Psychoacoustics of chalkboard squeaking | journal=[[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]] | pages=2545|bibcode = 2011ASAJ..130R2545R }}&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesize that the unpleasantness of the sound is caused by [[acoustic resonance]] due to the shape of the human [[ear canal]] which [[equal-loudness contour|amplifies certain frequencies]], especially those in the range of 2000 to 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz (the median pitches mentioned above), at such a level that the sound would trigger pain in human ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/162nd/Oehler_4pPP6.html |title=Acoustical Society of America - Psychoacoustics of chalkboard squeaking |publisher=acoustics.org|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
ClinicalKey was developed by Elsevier's Global Clinical Reference (GCR) team and involved consulting more than 2,000 doctors across the world over two years. The service aims to provide a source of clinical answers. ClinicalKey uses the semantic technology of the health information service [[Healthline|Healthline Networks]].&lt;ref&gt;(April 24, 2012) [http://newsblaze.com/story/2012042405030300004.bw/topstory.html Healthline's Semantic Search Platform Powers Elsevier's ClinicalKey, a Next-Generation Reference Tool for Physicians] newsblaze.com&lt;/ref&gt; The ClinicalKey website was launched in mid-April 2012 in its third iteration after alpha and beta testing versions. It is targeted at the health institutions, universities and schools, with an individual physician subscriptions launching in the third quarter of 2012.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;Davidson, Linda (16 April, 2012) [http://www.ehi.co.uk/news/EHI/7683/elsevier-launches-clinical-key Elsevier launches Clinical Key] E-Health Insider, ehi.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Two ClinicalKey applications for mobile phones are due to launch in the second half of 2012.&lt;ref name=Pogoreic&gt;Pogoreic, Deanna (June 5, 2012) [http://medcitynews.com/2012/06/google-for-docs-brings-a-new-kind-of-smart-searching-to-medical-research/ ‘Google for docs’ brings a new kind of smart searching to medical research] MedCity News, medcitynews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

ClinicalKey marks a change in Elsevier's approach to providing of clinical information through aggregated content services rather than the traditional model of journals and textbooks. The service is being marketed as a 'clinical insight engine'.&lt;ref name=Davidson /&gt; The technology harnesses user behaviour and database terminology to improve search results, rather than simply [[pattern matching]] search.&lt;ref&gt;Odjala, Marydee (April 19, 2012) [http://www.onlineinsider.net/2012/04/19/understanding-clinical-terms/ Understanding Clinical Terms] onlineinsider.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Close coupled field technology''' (CCFT) is an air [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] process that kills 99.999% of [[microbe]]s, [[bacteria]] (including bacterial [[endospore]]s), [[virus]]es, [[pathogen|germs]], [[mold]] spores, [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), [[fungal]] air contaminants and [[chemical agent]]s and their associated [[odor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pelekani, Liggie. “Equipment News - Airmanager: the new revolutionary air cleaning system”, {{cite web |url=http://www.synfo.com/news/allnews.asp?news=eqpt&amp;id=14742 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219105758/http://www.synfo.com/news/allnews.asp?news=eqpt&amp;id=14742 |archivedate=2010-02-19 |df= }} synfo.com, January 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

CCFT utilizes small high-[[voltage]] coils within a [[Faraday cage]] to generate a non-thermal [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] field to destabilize [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] and [[organic compound]]s at the [[molecular]] level.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Siobhan. “AirManager cleans cabin air”, ''[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]]'', September 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As air is passed through this [[electrostatic field]] it is converted to [[ozone]] which [[oxidize]]s airborne [[contaminant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/69653.php “New Weapons In The Fight Against Superbugs”], ''[[Medical News Today]]'', May 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Enclosing the ozone retains its ability to remove contaminants quickly while making it safe for populated environments.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by the Laboratorytalk editorial team. “Kill 99.7% of airborne bacteria and viruses”, {{cite web |url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/que/que100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905195911/http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/que/que100.html |archivedate=2009-09-05 |df= }} August 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CCFT was originally invented by David Hallam to remove unpleasant odors from a [[nursing home]] where an ailing uncle was a resident.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by the Laboratorytalk editorial team. “Kill 99.7% of airborne bacteria and viruses”, {{cite web |url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/que/que100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905195911/http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/que/que100.html |archivedate=2009-09-05 |df= }} August 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; When the nursing staff noticed a dramatic decrease in the spread of [[infection]]s, this led Hallam to further investigate CCFT. Hallam went on to develop the AirManager system, which uses a combination of CCFT and high airflow filtration (HAF), which [[air filter|filters]] any [[dust]], [[pollen]], airborne contaminants and resultant debris from the CCFT process down to 0.1 micrometres.&lt;ref&gt;Pelekani, Liggie. “Equipment News - Airmanager: the new revolutionary air cleaning system”, {{cite web |url=http://www.synfo.com/news/allnews.asp?news=eqpt&amp;id=14742 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219105758/http://www.synfo.com/news/allnews.asp?news=eqpt&amp;id=14742 |archivedate=2010-02-19 |df= }} synfo.com, January 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

CCFT technology is a variation of a class of technologies called non-thermal plasma, which are based on the discharge of high voltage static electricity.  Using a variety of configurations, two electrodes are separated by various dielectric insulating materials. A voltage is increasingly applied to one electrode until it exceeds the dielectric capacity of the insulators, whereupon  electric discharge occurs.  When the electricity is discharged in the presence of air, high energy electrons are formed which react with the chemicals and pathogens in air through a complex series of free radical reactions. As molecular oxygen is always present in air, ozone is always formed as well. The use of small high voltage coils distinguishes this method from other approaches that use different configurations of dual electrodes, such as a wire insulated by glass beads passing through the center of a metal pipe, which serves as the second electrode.  &lt;EPA (Using Non Thermal Plasma to Control Air Pollutants, E143-03, Feb. 2005, Clean Air Technology Center, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.&lt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4173">A '''consecutive controlled case series (CCCS)''' is a [[Clinical study design|clinical study]] that involves aggregating multiple cases consecutively encountered wherein an experimentally controlled [[Single-subject design|single-case experimental design]]  was employed with each case. The CCCS design differs from the [[consecutive case series]], because the latter reports on multiple cases where experimental control was not demonstrated, usually because a pre-post non experimental design was used. In contrast, a CCCS includes only cases where the intervention was evaluated using single-case experimental designs, such as a reversal design, where experimental control is demonstrated through the replication of treatment effects for each individual participant. Thus, the CCCS design has better [[internal validity]] than a consecutive case series. The CCCS design also address some concerns about the [[external validity]] or generality of findings of small-''n'' single-case experimental design studies because it explicitly includes all cases encountered, regardless of outcome. By including all cases, any bias favoring a particular outcome in controlled for, resulting in stronger external validity relative to studies describing fewer cases that were not consecutively encountered.  Moreover, when a large number of individuals are included in the series, this provides opportunities to identify variables that may predict treatment outcomes. Consecutive controlled case-series studies examining behavior analytic interventions of late have examined functional communication training.&lt;ref&gt;Rooker, G.W., Jessel, J., Kurtz, P.F. and Hagopian, L.P.

As with any experimental design, the CCCS design has limitations.  When the sample in the series is drawn from a particular clinic, there is the potential that that sample may not be representative of the broader population because of [[Verification bias|referral bias]].  One additional limitation of reporting on a series of cases receiving clinical treatment (as opposed to participants enrolled in a formal research protocol) is that there tend to be variations in how the treatment is applied across participants. This is particularly the case with behavioral interventions which are individualized, and continuously evaluated, and altered based on the individual’s response. An ideal middle ground would involve the use of treatment algorithms to structure how treatment components are sequenced while still preserving the response-guided approach that is the hallmark of good clinical practice in applied behavior.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Cornelius Packard "Dusty" Rhoads''' (June 9, 1898 – August 13, 1959) was an American [[pathologist]], [[oncologist]], and hospital administrator. Beginning in 1940, he served as director of Memorial Hospital for Cancer Research in New York, from 1945 was the first director of Sloan-Kettering Institute, and the first director of the combined [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center]]. For his contributions to cancer research, Rhoads was featured on the cover of the June 27, 1949 issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] under the title "Cancer Fighter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800477,00.html "Medicine: Frontal Attack"], ''Time.'' 27 June 1949, accessed 21 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During his early years with the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] in the 1930s, Rhoads specialized in [[anemia]] and [[leukemia]], working for six months in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1932 as part of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] [[International Health Board]] contingent. During World War II, he worked for the United States Army helping to develop [[chemical weapons]] and set up research centers. Research on [[mustard gas]] led to developments for its use in [[chemotherapy]] at Sloan Kettering.

In early 1932, a letter Rhoads had written in November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and intentionally injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to [[Puerto Rican nationalist]] leader [[Pedro Albizu Campos]]. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, which led to a scandal, an official investigation,&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574-5"/&gt; and a US [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]] campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2003/09100/The_Rhoads_Not_Given__The_Tainting_of_the.7.aspx ''The Rhoads Not Given: The Tainting of the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award.''] Rosenthal, Eric T. ''Oncology Times''. 10 September 2003. Volume 25. Issue 17. pp. 19-20. Retrieved 8 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lederer | first1 = Susan E. | year = 2002 | title = 'Porto Ricochet': Joking about Germs, Cancer, and Race Extermination in the 1930s | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/53156735/%E2%80%9CPorto-Ricochet%E2%80%9D-Joking-about-Germs-Cancer-and-Race-Extermination-in-the-1930s | journal = American Literary History | volume = 14 | issue = 4| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.&lt;ref name="clear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt;

In 2002, the controversy was revived. Alerted to the incident, [[American Association for Cancer Research]] (AACR), which had established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award in 1979,&lt;ref name="Packard"/&gt; commissioned a new investigation.&lt;ref name="LWW"&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2003/09100/The_Rhoads_Not_Given__The_Tainting_of_the.7.aspx Rosenthal, Eric T.

Retrieved 17 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was led by [[Jay Katz]], emeritus professor at [[Yale Law School]] and a specialist in medical ethics. He concluded there was no evidence of [[Unethical human experimentation in the United States|unethical human experimentation]], but the letter was so offensive that the prize should be renamed. AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his [[racism]].&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Douglas | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting a 1930s Scandal: AACR to Rename a Prize. | doi = 10.1126/science.300.5619.573 | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5619| pages = 573–4 | pmid=12714721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Rhoads was born June 20, 1898, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], as the son of an ophthalmologist, Dr. George H. Rhoads, and his wife.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;Stephen Hunter &amp; John Bainbridge; ''American Gunfight: The Plot to Kill Harry Truman,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=5b2dnzu54ZEC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=%22cornelius+rhoads%22+1898&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g3Y9rtYUvY&amp;sig=xjUuqIKK75rmk7pplrJFboQkPh0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ANT4VOy7L4fEgwTSloSYBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cornelius%20rhoads%22%201898&amp;f=false pp. 194-195]; Simon &amp; Schuster pub., 2005; {{ISBN|978-0-7432-6068-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his early education in Springfield, later attending [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Maine]], where he graduated in 1920. He entered [[Harvard Medical School]], where he became class president, and in 1924, he received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], ''[[cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt; Rhoads became an intern at [[Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]], and contracted pulmonary [[tuberculosis]]. During his treatment and recovery, he developed a lifelong interest in disease research.

==Early career==
After recovering from TB, Rhoads published a paper on the [[tuberculin]] reaction with [[Fred W. Stewart]], who became his longtime colleague. Rhoads taught as a [[pathologist]] at Harvard and conducted research on disease processes.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cornelius Packard Rhoads 1898–1959 |journal=CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians |date=2008-12-31 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.28.5.304 |volume=28 |issue = 5|pages=304–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 Rhoads joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, now [[Rockefeller University]], where he worked for [[Simon Flexner]]. He was also staff pathologist at Rockefeller Hospital.&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt; His early research interests included [[hematology]] and [[poliomyelitis]]. He worked at Rockefeller until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jem.rupress.org/content/50/3/273.abstract THE EFFECT OF CATAPHORESIS ON POLIOMYELITIS VIRUS, P. K. Olitsky, C. P. Rhoads, and P. H. Long,  September 1, 1929 // ''JEM'' vol. 50 no. 3 273-277 The Rockefeller University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2131593 | pmid=19869595 | volume=49 | issue=6 | title=INTRADERMAL VERSUS SUBCUTANEOUS IMMUNIZATION OF MONKEYS AGAINST POLIOMYELITIS | journal=J Exp Med | pages=959–73 | last1 = Stewart | first1 = FW | last2 = Rhoads | first2 = CP | doi=10.1084/jem.49.6.959| year=1929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puerto Rico==
While working for the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by [[hematologist]] [[William Bosworth Castle|William B. Castle]] to join his Rockefeller [[Anemia]] Commission, to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt; This was part of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s sanitary commission on the island through the [[International Health Division]].&lt;ref name="Castle"&gt;[http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/castle-wb.pdf "William B. Castle"], National Academy of Sciences, Biographical Memoirs&lt;/ref&gt; Castle's research interest was [[pernicious anemia|pernicious]] [[iron deficiency anemia]], specifically as caused by the parasitic [[hookworm]], which was [[endemic]] on the island at rates of 80%, and [[tropical sprue]].&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt; An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure.&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt; As recently as 2010, medical journal ''Nieto Editores'' reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nietoeditores.com.mx/download/hematologia/abril-junio2010/x/hematologia%203.7%20CHANGING.pdf Norman Maldonado. "The Changing Clinical Picture of Tropical Sprue" (''Revista de Hematologia'')], ''Hematología'' 2010;11(2): 95-98 April&amp;nbsp;— June 2010. Retrieved 17 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with [[folic acid]] and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.&lt;ref name="pmid9135537"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cook GC |title= Tropical sprue: some early investigators favoured an infective cause, but was a coccidian protozoan involved? |journal=Gut |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=428–9 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9135537 |pmc=1027098 |doi= 10.1136/gut.40.3.428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhoads was to assist Castle, and they established a base in San Juan at the Presbyterian Hospital. Rhoads corresponded often with Simon Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute in New York regarding his research and career interests. In Puerto Rico, the Rockefeller group had more than 200 patients; historian and ethicist Susan E. Lederer notes that, while referred to as patients, they were primarily clinical subjects whose conditions were studied to advance medical research. Because of the effects of anemia and the suspicion that tropical sprue was related to diet, Rhoads experimentally controlled patients' diets.&lt;ref name="Lederer" /&gt; Lederer notes that in letters from this time, Rhoads referred to his patients as "experimental 'animals'." &lt;ref name="Lederer" /&gt; He wrote: "If they don’t develop something they certainly have the constitutions of oxen." Rhoads sought to experimentally induce the conditions he was studying in his patients rather than simply treat them. If they did develop tropical sprue, he could treat it with liver extract.&lt;ref name="Lederer" /&gt;

Castle wanted to perform a similar study in [[Cidra, Puerto Rico|Cidra]], in conjunction with the [[School of Tropical Medicine (Puerto Rico)|School of Tropical Medicine]], which was doing related research, but this was not approved. Rhoads also collected polio serum samples for his boss Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute, for which he was assisted by contacts at the university.

===Scandal===
On 10 November 1931, Rhoads was at a party at a Puerto Rican co-worker's house in [[Cidra, Puerto Rico|Cidra]]. After having some drinks, he left, and found that his car had been vandalized and several items stolen. He went to his office, where he wrote and signed a letter addressed to "Ferdie" (Fred W. Stewart, a colleague from Boston, by then working at the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital|Memorial Hospital for Cancer Research]] in New York).&lt;ref name="Lederer"&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/american_literary_history/v014/14.4lederer.html Susan E. Lederer, "Porto Ricochet": Joking about Germs, Cancer, and Race Extermination in the 1930s"], ''American Literary History'', Volume 14, Number 4, Winter 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;720–746&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote the following:
{{blockquote|Dear Ferdie:

The more I think about the Larry Smith appointment the more disgusted I get. Have you heard any reason advanced for it? It certainly is odd that a man out with the entire Boston group, fired by Wallach, and as far as I know, absolutely devoid of any scientific reputation should be given the place. There is something wrong somewhere with our point of view.
   
The situation is settled in Boston. Parker and Nye are to run the laboratory together and either Kenneth or MacMahon to be assistant; the chief to stay on. As far as I can see, the chances of my getting a job in the next ten years are absolutely nil. One is certainly not encouraged to make scientific advances, when it is a handicap rather than an aid to advancement. I can get a damn fine job here and am tempted to take it. It would be ideal except for the Porto Ricans. They are beyond doubt the dirtiest, laziest, most degenerate and thievish race of men ever inhabiting this sphere. It makes you sick to inhabit the same island with them. They are even lower than Italians. What the island needs is not public health work but a tidal wave or something to totally exterminate the population. It might then be livable. I have done my best to further the process of extermination by killing off 8 and transplanting cancer into several more. The latter has not resulted in any fatalities so far... The matter of consideration for the patients' welfare plays no role here&amp;nbsp;— in fact all physicians take delight in the abuse and torture of the unfortunate subjects.
    
Do let me know if you hear any more news.

Sincerely, "Dusty"&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt;
}}

His unmailed letter was found by one of his staff and circulated among workers at the Anemia Commission. When Rhoads learned of this, he quickly made a public apology at a meeting of all staff and doctors.&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt; A while later, he was dismayed to hear that the letter was going to be discussed at a meeting of the Puerto Rico Medical Association. With relations having deteriorated locally, he returned to New York in December 1931.&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt;

===Publicity and investigations===
[[File:Pedro Albizu Campos raising his hat to a crowd, 1936.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Pedro Albizu Campos]] 
At the end of December, Rhoads' former lab technician Luis Baldoni resigned; he later testified that he feared for his safety. In January 1932 he gave the Rhoads letter to [[Pedro Albizu Campos]], president of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]].&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt; Albizu Campos sought publicity about the incident, sending copies of the letter to the [[League of Nations]], the [[Pan American Union]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], newspapers, embassies, and [[Holy See|the Vatican]].&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574-5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Douglas | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting a 1930s Scandal: AACR to Rename a Prize. | doi = 10.1126/science.300.5619.573 | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5619| pages = 574–5 | pmid=12714721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to distributing the letter to the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted [[birth control]], which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt;

A photograph of the Rhoads' letter was published on January 27, 1932 in ''La Democracia,'' the Unionist newspaper of [[Antonio Rafael Barceló]], with a translation in Spanish of the entire letter. It did not support Albizu Campos' theory of a US conspiracy against Puerto Rico. On February 13, ''El Mundo'' published the entire letter, in both Spanish and English.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDZtGZoFSGYC&amp;pg=PA141 Truman R. Clark. 1975. ''Puerto Rico and the United States, 1917-1933''], University of Pittsburgh Press, pp. 151-154&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhoads' letter created one of the first crises for [[James Beverley]], newly appointed as the acting [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. He said the letter was a "confession of murder" and "a libel against the people of Puerto Rico", and ordered an investigation, one of his first acts.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; Beverley said of Rhoads that "he was just a damned fool, ... a good doctor, but not very strong mentally on anything else."&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; Rhoads, already back in New York, released an official response to the media and the governor. He insisted that he was joking in his letter, which was intended to be confidential, calling it a "fantastic and playful composition written entirely for my own diversion and intended as a parody on supposed attitudes of some American minds in Porto Rico," explaining that nothing "was ever intended to mean other than the opposite of what was stated."&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574-5"/&gt; Rhoads offered to return to clear things up, but never did. The governor's inquiry concluded that Rhoads did not commit the acts included in his letter, nor any other crimes.&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574-5"/&gt;

Rhoads and his work were investigated by the Puerto Rican Attorney General Ramon Quinones, with review of medical aspects by Dr. P. Morales Otero, representative of the Puerto Rico Medical Association, and Dr. E, Garrido Morales, representing the Commissioner of Health. Sworn testimony was taken from several of Rhoads' patients as well as his colleagues, including Castle, [[William Galbreath]], and George C. Payne. They reviewed the case files for the 257 patients treated by Rhoads and the Rockefeller Commission, including the 13 patients who died during this period. They found no evidence of the crimes described in Rhoads' unmailed letter. The Attorney General and medical community joined in absolving Rhoads of the Nationalist charges that he was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name="clear"/&gt; Rhoads was subject to separate investigations ordered by the acting American governor of Puerto Rico [[James R. Beverley]] and the Rockefeller Institute, and "neither...was able to uncover any evidence that Dr. Rhoads had exterminated any Puerto Ricans."&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt;

Confirmed in Lederer's 21st century account, "records at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where Rhoads had performed his research, revealed no patients in the young [[pathologist]]'s care had died under suspicious circumstances."&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt;  Additionally, the investigators were "unable to confirm Rhoads's other claim (omitted in ''Time'' 's account) that he had 'transplanted cancer into several patients.'"&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Lederer. " 'Porto Ricochet': Joking about Germs, Cancer, and Race Extermination in the 1930s," ''American Literary History.'' Volume 14. Number 4. Winter 2002. p. 720.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigations, [[Ivy Lee]], who handled public relations for the Rockefeller family, and a team at the Institute began a campaign to defend Rhoads' reputation. He was seen as a promising researcher. The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] also wanted to protect its working relationship with medical organizations in Puerto Rico&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt; and avoid problems with critics of human experimentation in the US. During the early 1930s, there was a revival of the anti-[[vivisection]]ist movement in the US, which also was concerned about the use of vulnerable populations as human subjects of experimentation: children (especially orphans), prisoners, and soldiers. As Lederer observed, "some members of the medical community...monitored the popular and medical press."&lt;ref name="subject"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6F2lmCfiy8gC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Susan E. Lederer, ''Subjected to Science: Human Experimentation in America Before the Second World War''], Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997 paperback, pp. 103-104, 109&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Peyton Rous]] of the Rockefeller Institute was editor of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Medicine]]'' through the 1930s and 1940s. Although it accepted few articles on clinical research, he was careful about their wording in an effort to avoid criticism by the anti-vivisectionists.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer (1997), ''Subjected to Science,'' p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee was given access to pre-published versions of the articles on the controversy by both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]].'' He persuaded ''Time'' to eliminate the words "and transplanting cancer into several more," from its published version of the letter.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"/&gt; Also, based on the positive testimony of some patients, ''The New York Times'' headlined its article as "Patients Say Rhoads Saved Their Lives" and reported on this aspect as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1932/02/02/archives/patients-say-rhoads-saved-their-lives-testify-in-porto-rican.html "Patients Say Rhoads Saved Their Lives." New York Times 2 Feb. 1932:19.]&lt;/ref&gt; Rhoads had returned to New York before the scandal broke in Puerto Rico. After the Attorney General's report&lt;ref name="clear"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1932/02/15/archives/dr-rhoads-cleared-of-porto-rico-plot-letter-telling-of-giving.html "DR. RHOADS CLEARED OF PORTO RICO PLOT"], ''New York Times,'' 15 February 1932&lt;/ref&gt; and that of the Rockefeller Institute in 1932, the controversy quickly faded in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lederer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Douglas | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting a 1930s Scandal: AACR to Rename a Prize. | doi = 10.1126/science.300.5619.573 | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5619| page = 574 | pmid=12714721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to the Rhoads scandal and controversy was mixed in the United States, in part due to the Rockefeller campaign. Starr says (in his 2003 article on the scandal) that Rhoads' colleagues did not believe the researcher's attempt to cast his letter as a "fantastic and playful composition...intended as a parody."&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574-5"/&gt; Some were worried about Rhoads' mental health at the time. A superior dismissed the incident as a case of local ingratitude. ''Time'' magazine headlined the incident as "Porto Ricochet"; Starr suggests they meant that Rhoads's humanitarian work in Puerto Rico had come back to bite him.&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574-5"/&gt;

In Puerto Rico, Albizu Campos used the Rhoads scandal as part of his anti-colonial campaign, attracting followers to the Nationalist Party. In 1950, longtime Puerto Rican [[Independence movement in Puerto Rico|pro-independence]] activists [[Oscar Collazo]] and [[Griselio Torresola]] [[Truman assassination attempt|tried to assassinate President Truman]] to bring their cause to the world stage. When later interviewed, Collazo said that as a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the [[Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico|Nationalist]] movement.&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574"/&gt;

==Hematology==
Following his study in Puerto Rico, in 1933 Rhoads was chosen to lead a special service at the Rockefeller Institute in clinical hematology, to study diseases of the blood-forming organs. He built on his research on anemia and tropical sprue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=XmZtUvSkIaHhygGF6IHoCw&amp;id=TjVrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Rockefeller+Institute&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Cornelius+Rhoads+ George Washington Corner, ''A History of the Rockefeller Institute, 1901-1953''], Rockefeller Institute Press, 1965, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 Rhoads and another researcher published results of the success in using liver extract therapy to treat tropical sprue (and relieve anemia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = C.P. | last2 = Miller | first2 = D.K. | year = 1934 | title = Intensive liver extract therapy of sprue | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=252502 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 103 | issue = 6| pages = 387–391 | doi=10.1001/jama.1934.02750320005003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work was recognized as contributing benefit in treatment of the disease by others in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Philip | first1 = CORR | year = 1936 | title = Intensive Liver Therapy in Sprue | url = http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=671006 | journal = Ann.

==Memorial Hospital and World War II==
In 1940, Rhoads was selected as director of [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center|Memorial Hospital]], which was devoted to cancer care and research, and had recently moved into a new building. Rhoads was selected for his interest in clinical investigation in addition to laboratory research, as the hospital did research as well as treatment.&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt; He succeeded [[James Ewing (pathologist)|James Ewing]], a noted [[oncologist]]. Ewing had written about cancer transplantation in 1931, a subject which Rhoads had referred to in his scandalous letter written in November of that year.&lt;ref name="Lederer" /&gt; In 1941 Rhoads was studying the use of radiation to treat [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/1/10/771.short "Postirradiation Changes in the Levels of Organic Phosphorus in the Blood of Patients with Leukemia"], ''Cancer Research''&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Rhoads was commissioned as a colonel and assigned as chief of medicine in the Chemical Weapons Division of the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt; He established the U.S. Army [[chemical weapon]]s laboratories in [[Utah]], [[Maryland]], and [[Panama]]. For this work, he won the [[Legion of Merit]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Packard"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packard |first1=Gabriel |title=RIGHTS: Group Strips Racist Scientist's Name from Award |date=29 April 2003 |publisher=''[[Inter Press Service]]'' |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2003/04/rights-group-strips-racist-scientists-name-from-award/ |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his casualty studies on [[mustard gas]] from an [[Air raid on Bari|accident during the war in Italy]], Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing [[chemotherapy]] for cancer treatment,&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt; but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called [[mechlorethamine]] or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis for the development of the field of anti-cancer chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gilman A. | title = The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard | journal = Am J Surg | year = 1963 | volume = 105 | pages = 574–578 | pmid = 13947966 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9610(63)90232-0 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhoads also became interested in [[total body irradiation]], which led to early work on chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Goozner, Merrill. 2004. ''The $800 Million Pill: The Truth Behind the Cost of New Drugs.'' p.172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
In 1945 [[Sloan-Kettering Institute]] was founded as a cancer research center, in the hopes that an industrial approach to research would yield a cure.&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt; It opened in 1948. While still director of Memorial, from 1945 until 1953 Rhoads also served as the first director of the Sloan-Kettering Institute.&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;[http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/18863/2/Rhoads_Cornelius_Packard_1959.pdf "Cornelius P. Rhoads"], ECommons, Cornell University Library&lt;/ref&gt; He was "praised by Memorial for his 'essential role in the evolution of the hospital into a modern medical center.'"&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt; As director of Sloan-Kettering, he had oversight as well over research related to Department of Defense radiation experiments through 1954. For instance, that year, a Sloan-Kettering team began a multi-year study of "Post-Irradiation Syndrome in Humans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/pubs/dodhre/Append1.pdf Appendix 1: Contract DA-49-007, in "Report on Search for Records of Human Radiation Experiments"], US Department of Defense, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Rhoads stepped back slightly, becoming scientific director of the newly merged [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center]].&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt; He also continued as the scientific director of Sloan-Kettering operations.&lt;ref name="select.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1959/09/21/archives/service-for-dr-rhoads-memorial-for-sloankettering-director-here.html "SERVICE FOR DR. RHOADS; Memorial for Sloan-Kettering Director Here Tomorrow"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; He also was an adviser to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] regarding [[nuclear medicine]]. Some AEC funding supported Sloan-Kettering research into the use of iodine to transport radiation to cancer tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uXYoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KsgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6440,1335022 "New Hope is Held Out for Cancer Cure"], ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal,'' 16 June 1948, Retrieved 17 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhoads continued to serve as scientific director of the [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center]] until his death.&lt;ref name="select.nytimes.com"/&gt; He died of a [[coronary occlusion]] on August 13, 1959, in [[Stonington, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; In 1979, on the 20th anniversary of his death, the [[American Association of Cancer Research]] established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Prize in his honor, as an annual award to a promising young researcher.&lt;ref name="Packard"/&gt;

==Honors==
*[[Legion of Merit]] in 1945 for Rhoads' work for the US Army during WWII.&lt;ref name="Packard"/&gt;
*Trustee of the Charles Kettering Foundation.&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt;
*Awarded three honorary doctorates, two for science and one for law.&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt;
*Posthumously awarded the Katherine Berkin Judd Award for outstanding contributions to [[oncology]] research.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;
*The [[American Association for Cancer Research]] (AACR) established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award posthumously in his honor in 1979.&lt;ref name="Packard"/&gt;(In 2002, it renamed the award due to Rhoads' racism expressed in his 1932 letter.)&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt;

==Revival of controversy==
In 1982, Puerto Rican social scientist and writer Pedro Aponte-Vázquez discovered new information at various archives which raised questions about the investigations conducted on Rhoads and Rockefeller Project. Most prominent among his findings was a 1932 letter written by Governor Beverly to the associate director of the Rockefeller Foundation, stating that Rhoads had written a second letter "even worse than the first" and which, according to Beverley, the [Puerto Rican] government had suppressed and destroyed.&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574"/&gt; In 1932 the Puerto Rican Attorney General, aided by top-ranking Puerto Rican doctors, had investigated all of the work of Rhoads and the Rockefeller Project, including 13 deaths that occurred among nearly 300 patients treated. They found no evidence of wrongdoing or crimes.&lt;ref name="clear"/&gt; In addition, Rhoads' superior at the Rockefeller Project had conducted a close investigation of the 13 patients who died under Rhoads' tenure, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. But in 1982 Aponte-Vázquez urged the [[Puerto Rico Department of Justice]] to reopen the case. It refused as Rhoads had been dead for so long.&lt;ref name="Starr, Douglas 2003. p. 574"/&gt;

In 2002, Edwin Vazquez, a biology professor at the [[University of Puerto Rico]], came across Rhoads' 1932 letter and contacted the [[American Association for Cancer Research]] (AACR) about it. Given the letter's offensive nature, he demanded that Rhoads' name be removed from the AACR award. Others also contacted the AACR, including [[Secretary of State of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico's Secretary of State]] [[Ferdinand Mercado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Douglas | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting a 1930s Scandal: AACR to Rename a Prize. | doi = 10.1126/science.300.5619.573 | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5619| pages = 573–574 | pmid=12714721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revival of the issue generated a fresh wave of publicity. The AACR, which said it had not known of the 1932 controversy,&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt; commissioned an investigation led by [[Jay Katz]], a [[bioethicist]] from [[Yale University]]. Katz said although "there was no evidence of Dr. Rhoads' killing patients or transplanting cancer cells, the letter itself was reprehensible enough to remove his name from the award." The AACR agreed with his conclusion.&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt;

Eric Rosenthal of ''Oncology Times'' in 2003 characterized the case as the AACR having to "deal with the embarrassment of having history catch up to modern-day sensibilities."&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt; He wrote,  
&lt;blockquote&gt;The complicated legacy of Cornelius "Dusty" Rhoads, who died in 1959, should not cause society to promote nor deny his existence but should provide a perspective that neither condones what he wrote or thought—or the whitewashing of the incident by institutions and media of the 1930s—but that does give him due appropriate credit for his accomplishments as well as acknowledgement of his faults and sins."&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003 the AACR renamed the award, stripping the honor from Rhoads posthumously. The AACR indicated that the new name would be retroactive and past awardees would receive updated plaques.&lt;ref name="LWW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ips"&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/2002/12/health-cancer-body-to-probe-claims-that-scientist-killed-subjects/ "Cancer Body to Probe Claims that Scientist Killed Subjects"], IPS News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in other media==
* Aponte-Vázquez self-published a book in 2005 entitled ''The Unsolved Case of Dr. Cornelius P. Rhoads: An Indictment''; he writes on this topic via his [http://pedroapontevazquez.com/ blog and personal website].
* During the 1980s, the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] political satire comedy group, [[Los Rayos Gamma]], performed parodies of Rhoads with [[Jacobo Morales]] portraying a ''Cornelio Rodas'' as an insane, [[Frankenstein]]-like scientist bent on the elimination of Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vozdelcentro.org/?p=167 Collado-Schwartz, Ángel, editor; "El humor como expresión cultural"], ''La Voz del Centro II,'' Fundación La Voz del Centro, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Roberto Busó-García wrote and directed the dramatic film, ''The Condemned'' (2013), which he said was loosely based on the Rhoads' controversy in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/movies/the-condemned-directed-by-roberto-buso-garcia.html?_r=0 Manohla Dargis, "Disgraced Life Conjures Mysterious Forces"], ''New York Times'', February 2013, accessed 21 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Cuca shop''' is a Southern African term for a "[[Shebeen]]"&amp;mdash;an unlicensed house selling alcoholic liquor.&lt;ref name="Dobler Bibliographien 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Page44"/&gt;

The term is used in [[Namibia]]&lt;ref name="Langfield Logan Craith 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akuupa 2015 p. 43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="van Wolputte Fumanti 2010"/&gt; and [[Angola]], and is derived from a Portuguese make of [[Cuca beer]], which was available in Angola (a Portuguese colony)&lt;ref name="Dobler Bibliographien 2014"/&gt; during the 1960s and the 1970s. [[South African Defence Force]] troops, who patrolled the northern area during the bush war, frequently purchased mahango beer and Owambo liquor at these tin shack shebeens.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==In popular culture==
The term "Cuca shop" featured prominently in the launch edition of [[Hai Ti!]], a Creative-Commons released comic strip that spread the word about the ways that computers and the internet can transform learners' and teachers' lives. [[Hai Ti!]] was created by [[School Net Namibia]], a nonprofit provider of internet service, hardware and training to the schools of Namibia.

'''Cuffitis''' is inflammation at the anal transition zone or “cuff” created as a result of [[Ileo-anal pouch|ileal pouch-anal anastomosis]] (IPAA).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/digestive_diseases/diseases-conditions/hic-pouchitis|title=Pouchitis: Causes, Symptoms &amp; Treatment {{!}} Cleveland Clinic|website=my.clevelandclinic.org|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a variant form of [[ulcerative colitis]] that occurs in the rectal cuff.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Bo|date=2016-12-12|title=Diagnosis and Management of Postoperative Ileal Pouch Disorders|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|volume=23|issue=4|pages=259–268|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1268252|issn=1531-0043|pmc=3134805|pmid=22131896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuffitis is a common complication of IPAA, particularly when a stapled [[Surgical anastomosis|anastomosis]] without [[mucosectomy]] procedure has been used.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of cuffitis mimic those of [[pouchitis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, patients with cuffitis often present with small volume bloody bowel movements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often, cuffitis can produce the appearance of bright red blood on tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
=== Complications ===
Surgery-associated [[ischemia]] may contribute inflammation at the anal transitional zone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Patients whose cuffitis is refractory to mesalamine and/or corticosteroids should be evaluated for other disease in the cuff area, such as [[Anal fistula|fistula]] or anastomotic leaks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cuffitis that is refractory to medication can also be a sign of [[Crohn's disease]] of the pouch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Chronic cuffitis can also contribute to the development of anastomotic [[Stricture (medicine)|stricture]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Cuffitis that is refractory, Crohn's-related, or is associated with surgical complications can contribute to pouch failure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Definitive diagnose of cuffitis is obtained by [[endoscopy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Cuffitis is treated with [[Mesalazine|mesalamine]] suppositories or topical application of [[lidocaine]] or [[corticosteroid]] medications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Systemic administration|Systemic medications]] are rarely used.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dahlia is the [[main character]] in a computer game and in a growing number of non-Sookie-related&amp;mdash;though set in [[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Sookie Stackhouse Novels' universe|the same]] [[fictional universe]]&amp;mdash;short stories. &lt;br&gt;
She is a [[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Vampires|vampire]] and lives in the city of [[Rhodes, Iowa|Rhodes]], Iowa.

It is mentioned in ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Bacon]]'' that her original name was too difficult to spell and pronounce for people of the twentieth century so around 1925 she changed it to 'Dahlia' for her own convenience.
In 1940, staying in London during [[the Blitz]], Dahlia adopted a [[surname]] to get new papers. Since that time her full name has been '''Dahlia Lynley-Chivers'''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|A Very Vampire Christmas]]'' by Charlaine Harris in ''[[Glamour Magazine]]'', Dec.2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Dahlia Underground]]'' she tells humans that she ''"perhaps"'' has been a vampire for 900 years, but it is repeatedly said that she is very old, even ancient.

There are a few more hints about her actual age. For example, she considers her knowledge of some no-longer-spoken languages to be really advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Bacon]]'' by Charlaine Harris in the ''Strange Brew'' anthology: [[St. Martin's Griffin]]. {{ISBN|0-312-38336-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said (in the same short story) that her friend [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Thalia|Thalia]], who is also originally from Greece and even older than Dahlia, is so ancient that she came across [[Odysseus]] "a time or two".

==Human life==
Dahlia is Greek, and that is almost the only thing known about her origins.
As a little girl she shared a tutor with her brother, but that stopped after it was decided that a girl didn't need any more education.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Tacky]]'' by Charlaine Harris in the ''My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding'' anthology: [[St. Martin's Griffin]]. {{ISBN|0-7394-7369-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
She was brought over (made a vampire) at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Dahlia Underground]]'' by Charlaine Harris in the ''Crimes by Moonlight'' anthology: [[Berkley Hardcover]]. {{ISBN|0-425-23563-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==
Dahlia is petite and beautiful.  Sookie thinks that the vampire has got "the straightest back and longest rippling black hair" she has ever seen'' ([[All Together Dead]])''.

Dahlia has large green eyes ''([[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Tacky]])''
and her face is described either as round or as heart-shaped.
Dahlia is quite small: 4 feet 9&amp;nbsp;inches tall ''([[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|A Very Vampire Christmas]])''.

She wears stilettos whenever possible and is very particular about her clothes.

She possesses the rare ability to fly&amp;mdash;an ability shared by her nestmate Glenda ''([[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Tacky]])'' and Sookie's vampire husband [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Eric Northman|Eric]], Sheriff of Area Five in [[Louisiana]].

==Personality and traits==
Sookie sees Dahlia as very "direct in her judgement". She also mentions that Dahlia behaves "regally" in the company of the [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Sophie-Anne Leclerq|Queen Sophie-Anne]].
Dahlia is supremely confident in her strength, wits and lethality. She is usually very composed and has a violent, vengeful nature. Dahlia is seen smiling only rarely (usually before a good battle), but she has got a dark sense of humor. Immediately after her husband's death she experiences difficulties with controlling her temper.

==Relationships==
In [[The Sookie Stackhouse Companion]]
,&lt;ref&gt;''"A Guide"'' by Victoria Koski ''(Dahlia Lynley-Chivers)'', [[The Sookie Stackhouse Companion]]: [[Ace Books|ACE]]. {{ISBN|0-441-01971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
it is said that Dahlia "loves her men and her high-heels".
Readers always witness Dahlia either involved in a romantic relationship or eager to get involved. In spite of her pronounced disgust with the non-vampiric, she is equally ready to notice strength, courage and physical beauty in all males:
[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Vampires|vamps]], [[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Humans|"breathers"]] and [[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Weres and shapeshifters|Weres]].

In ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Tacky]]'', she meets her future husband, Todd,
a [[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Weres and shapeshifters|werewolf]], a [[second-in-command]] in the Swift-Foot pack. After about two years of happiness Todd is murdered and avenged by Dahlia.

In ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|A Very Vampire Christmas]]'', a reader sees her dating Matsudo Katamori, a vampire.

Dahlia has got a vampire best friend, Taffy, married to Don Swiftfoot, a werewolf packleader. It is said in ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Tacky]]'' that Taffy and Dahlia have been friends for about two centuries and share a lot of memories.
Dahlia is the maid of honour at Taffy and Don's wedding and is responsible for security on the bride's side.

After mutually saving each other's lives in ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Dahlia Underground]]'' Dahlia sort of befriends firefighters of Thirty-four Company.

==Position within the vampire hierarchy==
The nature of her occupation is not mentioned, but she tells her husband-to-be, Todd, that she does her nest leader's bidding and contributes to his wealth.
The nest leader and vampire sheriff of Rhodes is Cedric Deeming.

By the time readers first meet Dahlia in ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Tacky]]''
she has lived under his rule for about 20 years and plays the role of the nest reinforcer.

Dahlia is respected enough among vampires to be on a judges' panel (that also includes [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Bill Compton|Bill Compton]] and an unidentified blond vampire) at the vampire summit in Rhodes in ''[[All Together Dead]]''. After the explosions at the 'Pyramid of Gizeh' hotel (''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Dahlia Underground]]''), Dahlia and her friend Taffy are appointed by Cedric to conduct the investigation.

In the ''[[Dahlia Lynley-Chivers#Dying For Daylight computer game|Dying for Daylight]]'' game, Dahlia once again performs as an investigator. Later, in ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries#The Southern Vampire Mysteries (short stories and novellas)|Death by Dahlia]]'', she and former policeman Matsuda Katamori are chosen by Joaquin, the new sheriff, for yet another investigation.

'''Plot'''
:A vampire has been noticed in public during the daytime. Dahlia is given (by her sheriff Cedric Deeming) a special task to find a legendary potion which allows vampires to day-walk without being burnt into ashes. Dahlia herself is interested in solving the mystery because the fashion conscious ancient vampire dreams of shopping at ''[[Tiffany's]]'' during the day. To fulfill the task she has to go to the Vampire Quarter in [[New Orleans]] and investigate the strange events happening there. It appears that all hell has broken loose and a lot of vampires have ended up "finally dead".

'''Dental avulsion''' is the complete displacement of a [[Tooth (human)|tooth]] from its socket in [[alveolar bone]] owing to [[dental trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref name=pmid19208020&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zadik Y, Levin L | title = Oral and facial trauma among paratroopers in the Israel Defense Forces | journal = Dental Traumatology | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 100–2 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19208020 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00719.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment for permanent teeth consists of replantation, immediately if possible. [[Deciduous teeth]] should not be replanted due to the risk of damaging the permanent tooth germ. Immediate replantation ensures the best possible prognosis but is not always possible since more serious injuries may be present. Studies have shown that teeth that are protected in a physiologically ideal media can be replanted within 15 minutes to one hour after the accident with good prognosis. The success of delayed replantation depends on the vitality of the cells remaining on the root surface. In normal conditions, a tooth is connected to the socket by means of the [[periodontal ligament]]. When a tooth is knocked out, that ligament stretches and splits in half.&lt;ref name=pmid7600227&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krasner P, Rankow HJ | title = New philosophy for the treatment of avulsed teeth | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontics | volume = 79 | issue = 5 | pages = 616–23 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7600227 | doi = 10.1016/S1079-2104(05)80105-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining the vitality of the cells that remain attached to the root surface is the key to success following replantation. Years ago, it was thought that the key to maintaining root cell vitality was keeping the knocked-out tooth wet,&lt;ref name="Andreasen JO 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreasen JO | title = Etiology and pathogenesis of traumatic dental injuries. A clinical study of 1,298 cases | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Dental Research | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–42 | year = 1970 | pmid = 4394635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus giving rise to storage media recommendations such as water, the mouth and milk. Recent research has shown that one of the key elements for maintaining vitality is storing the tooth in an environment that closely resembles the original socket environment. This environment is one that has the proper  [[osmolality]] ([[Cell (biology)|cell]] pressure), pH, nutritional metabolites and [[glucose]]. There are scientifically designed storage media that provide this environment. These storage media are now available in retail products. Use of devices that incorporate the ideal storage media and protective apparatuses have increased the success rate of replanted knocked-out teeth to over 90% when used within sixty minutes of the accident.

==Prevention==
{{Main|Mouthguard}}
The best method for the prevention of knocked-out teeth is the use of helmets and mouth protectors.&lt;ref name="Andreasen JO 1981"/&gt; Mouth protectors can be very inexpensive, however, the compliance rate for their use is poor.&lt;ref name=pmid19208013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zadik Y, Levin L | title = Does a free-of-charge distribution of boil-and-bite mouthguards to young adult amateur sportsmen affect oral and facial trauma? | journal = Dental Traumatology | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–72 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19208013 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00708.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid21265309&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zadik Y, Jeffet U, Levin L | title = Prevention of dental trauma in a high-risk military population: the discrepancy between knowledge and willingness to comply | journal = Military Medicine | volume = 175 | issue = 12 | pages = 1000–3 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21265309 | doi = 10.7205/MILMED-D-10-00150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that, even when mandated, athletes and other high risk individuals often will not use them.&lt;ref name=pmid19149336&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zadik Y, Levin L | title = Orofacial injuries and mouth guard use in elite commando fighters | journal = Military Medicine | volume = 173 | issue = 12 | pages = 1185–7 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19149336 | doi = 10.7205/milmed.173.12.1185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, even with their use, mouth guards can be knocked-out, leaving the user unprotected.

==Management==
{{Advert section|date=January 2018}}
Dental avulsion is a real [[dental emergency]] in which prompt management (within 20–40 minutes of injury) affects the [[prognosis]] of the tooth.&lt;ref name=pmid19021668&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zadik Y | title = Algorithm of first-aid management of dental trauma for medics and corpsmen | journal = Dental Traumatology | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 698–701 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19021668 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00649.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The avulsed [[permanent tooth]] should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage the surface of the root which may have living [[periodontal fiber]] and cells. Once the tooth and mouth are clean an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the [[alveolar bone]] and later [[dental splint|splinted]] by a [[dentist]] for several weeks.&lt;ref name=pmid17511833&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores MT, Andersson L, Andreasen JO, Bakland LK, Malmgren B, Barnett F, Bourguignon C, DiAngelis A, Hicks L, Sigurdsson A, Trope M, Tsukiboshi M, von Arx T | title = Guidelines for the management of traumatic dental injuries. II. Avulsion of permanent teeth | journal = Dental Traumatology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 130–6 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17511833 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2007.00605.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth.&lt;ref name=pmid17511833/&gt; If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva and take it to an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of [[tetanus]] [[immunization]] if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured [[primary tooth|primary teeth]] differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent [[dental crypt]]).&lt;ref name=pmid17635351&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores MT, Malmgren B, Andersson L, Andreasen JO, Bakland LK, Barnett F, Bourguignon C, DiAngelis A, Hicks L, Sigurdsson A, Trope M, Tsukiboshi M, von Arx T | title = Guidelines for the management of traumatic dental injuries. III. Primary teeth | journal = Dental Traumatology | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 196–202 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17635351 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2007.00627.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some [[dentist]]s advise that the best treatment for an avulsed tooth is immediate replantation,&lt;ref name="Endodontists 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trope et al 2002"/&gt; for a variety of reasons this can be difficult for the non-professional person. The teeth are often covered with debris. This debris must be washed off with a physiological solution and not scrubbed. Often multiple teeth are knocked-out and the person will not know which socket an individual tooth belongs to. The injured victim may have other more serious injuries that require more immediate attention or injuries such as a severely lacerated bleeding [[lip]] or gum that prevent easy visualization of the socket. Pain may be severe and the person may resist replantation of the teeth. People may, in light of [[infectious disease]]s (e.g. [[HIV]]), fear handling the teeth or touching the [[blood]] associated with them. If immediate replantation is not possible, the teeth should be placed in an appropriate storage solution and brought to a dentist who can then replant them. The dentist will clean the socket, wash the teeth if necessary, and replant them into their sockets. He will splint them to non-knocked-out teeth for a maximum of two weeks for teeth with normal [[alveolar process]] and bone support. Properly handled, even replantation of periodontally compromised permanent teeth in older patients under good maintenance have been reported, with splinting extending for over 4 weeks due to the reduced support structure for the root due to [[periodontal disease]].&lt;ref name=pmid10530158&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casterline AC | title = Replantation of avulsed central incisor with advanced periodontal disease: a case report | journal = Endodontics &amp; Dental Traumatology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 135–7 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10530158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One week to ten days after the replantation, the dental pulps of the replanted teeth should be removed and a [[root canal]] treatment completed within two months.

In addition, as recommended in all [[dental trauma]]s good [[oral hygiene]] with 0.12% [[chlorhexidine gluconate]] [[mouthwash]], a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of [[smoking]] for several days may provide a favorable condition for periodontal ligaments regeneration.&lt;ref name=pmid19021668/&gt;

===Biologic basis for success of replantation following avulsion===
Every tooth is connected to its surrounding bone by the periodontal ligament. The tooth receives its nourishment through this ligament. When a tooth is knocked-out, this ligament is stretched and splits in half; half stays on the tooth root and half stays on the socket wall. If these two halves can be kept alive, the tooth can be replanted and the halves of the ligament will reattach and the tooth will remain vital. The half that stays on the socket wall, since it remains connected to the bone blood supply, is naturally kept alive. However, the ligament cells that remain on the tooth root lose their blood and nutrition supply and must be artificially maintained. They must be protected from two potentially destructive processes: cell crushing and loss of normal [[cell metabolism]].&lt;ref name=pmid7600227/&gt; All treatment between the time of the accident and the ultimate replantation must be focused on preventing these two possibilities.

===Prevention of cell crushing===
When teeth are knocked-out, they end up on an artificial surface: the floor, the ground or material such as carpeting. If the surface is hard, the tooth root cells will be traumatized. Since the cells remaining on the tooth root are very delicate, additional trauma to the tooth root cells must be avoided so as to avoid more tooth root cell crushing. This damage can occur while picking the tooth up and/or during transportation to the dentist.

When a tooth is picked up, it should always be grasped by the enamel on the crown.&lt;ref name="Endodontists 2008"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=American Association of Endodontists |title=Recommended guidelines for the treatment of the avulsed permanent tooth |location=Chicago |year=2008 }}{{pn|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trope et al 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pathways of the Pulp |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Cohen |editor2-first=Richard C. |editor2-last=Burns |first1=Martin |last1=Trope |first2=Noah |last2=Chivian |first3=Asgeir |last3=Sigurdsson |first4=William F. |last4=Vann | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Traumatic Injuries |pages=603–37 |edition=8th |publisher=Mosby |year=2002 |location=St. Louis |isbn=978-0-323-01162-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid2390966/&gt; Finger pressure on the tooth root cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even with the use of a physiologic saline, the “scrubbing” of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided.&lt;ref name=pmid7600227/&gt; When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided.&lt;ref name=pmid7600227/&gt; For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected.&lt;ref name=pmid7600227/&gt; Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a physiologic environment.

===Maintenance of normal cell metabolism===

This is called “root resorption” It is a slow, but non-painful, process that is sometimes not observed by [[x-ray]]s for years. Once this process starts, it is irreversible and the tooth will eventually fall out. In growing children, this can cause bone development problems because the replacement resorption (also termed [[tooth ankylosis|ankylosis]]) attaches the tooth firmly to the [[Human jawbone|jaw bone]] and stops normal tooth eruption and impedes normal jaw growth.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Research has shown that the critical factor for reduction of the death of the tooth root cells and the subsequent root replacement resorption following reimplantation of knocked-out teeth is maintenance of normal [[cell physiology]] and [[metabolism]] of the cells left on the tooth root while the tooth is out of the socket.&lt;ref name=pmid7600227/&gt; In order to maintain this normalcy, the environment in which the teeth are stored must supply the optimum internal cell pressure, cell nutrients and pH.&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt;

===Storage media===
There are many storage media available for knocked-out tooth storage. The most often recommended are: [[saliva]], [[physiologic saline]], [[cow milk|milk]]&lt;ref&gt;Young C, Wong KY, Cheung LK. PLoS One. 2014 Aug 5;9(8):e101972. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0101972. eCollection 2014. http://www.h2osteamwatericeforum.com/effectiveness-of-educational-poster-on-knowledge-of-emergency-management-of-dental-trauma-part-2-rct/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young C, Wong KY, Cheung LK.

Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 2.4 (2018). https://actascientific.com/ASMS/pdf/ASMS-02-0071.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dental Trauma and Awareness. Cecilia Young* and CYYJ Yeung Oral Health and Dentistry 3.4 (2018): 683-686. http://www.h2osteamwatericeforum.com/dental-trauma-and-awareness/&lt;/ref&gt; and pH balanced cell preserving fluids. Water and ice have been shown to damage the tooth root cells, and as such, avulsed teeth should never be stored in them.&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt; The osmolality and pH of water and ice is very low (7-17mOs) compared to normal cell pressure (280 mOs). When a knocked-out tooth is placed in water, the cells attempt to equalize with the surrounding environment, the cell fluid tries to move to the outside pressure environment and burst. Water with [[Edible salt|table salt]] in it is damaging to the knocked out teeth.

Saliva, that is placing the tooth under the accident victim’s tongue or in the cheek, has been recommended. Saliva, as a storage media, causes twice damage as water. Its osmolality is very low, causing bursting of the tooth root cells, but additionally, because saliva is filled with its [[Bacteria in the human body|normal flora]] of microorganisms, it will severely infect the tooth root cells. When the tooth is replanted, not only will the cells be necrotic but they will also infect the bone socket.&lt;ref name=pmid7600227/&gt;
Physiologic saline has a fairly compatible osmolality and will not cause cell [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|swelling]] but it lacks the metabolites and glucose necessary for maintenance of normal cell metabolism.&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt;

Milk has been also recommended as a storage medium for avulsed teeth.&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt; Its advantage is the high availability of fresh whole milk. Only whole milk can be used for tooth preservation. Skim milk and heavy cream do not have the correct fluid pressure and will cause damage to the root cells. Milk has no observed regenerative properties for cells on knocked out teeth.

It was discovered 30 years ago that milk was less damaging to knocked out teeth than water or saliva. It was recommended because it has a compatible osmolality (fluid pressure) to tooth root cells and it is thought to be readily available. However, like physiologic saline, milk lacks the necessary metabolites and glucose necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism of the tooth root cells.&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt; The cells on knocked-out tooth roots in milk do not die immediately but are unable to replicate ([[mitosis]]) and so are less able to reform new cells when replanted.

The most optimum storage media that are available have been shown to be pH balanced cell preserving solutions.&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid1302677&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trope M, Friedman S | title = Periodontal healing of replanted dog teeth stored in Viaspan, milk and Hank's balanced salt solution | journal = Endodontics &amp; Dental Traumatology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 183–8 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1302677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid1469209&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krasner P, Person P | title = Preserving avulsed teeth for replantation | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 123 | issue = 11 | pages = 80–8 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1469209 | doi = 10.14219/jada.archive.1992.0300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known and most extensively tested is called [[Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution]] (HBSS).&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid1302677/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matsson et al 1982"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matsson |first1=Lars |last2=Andreasen |first2=Jens |last3=Cvek |first3=Miomir |last4=Granath |first4=Lars | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ankylosis of experimentally reimplanted teeth related to extra-alveolar period and storage environment |journal=Pediatric Dentistry |year=1982 |volume=4 |pages=327–9 |url=http://www.aapd.org/assets/1/25/Matsson-04-04.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid6943665&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blomlöf L, Otteskog P, Hammarström L | title = Effect of storage in media with different ion strengths and osmolalities on human periodontal ligament cells | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Dental Research | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–7 | date = April 1981 | pmid = 6943665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid1782897&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiltz J, Trope M | title = Vitality of human lip fibroblasts in milk, Hanks balanced salt solution and Viaspan storage media | journal = Endodontics &amp; Dental Traumatology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 69–72 | date = April 1991 | pmid = 1782897 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-9657.1991.tb00187.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has all of the metabolites such as Ca, phosphate ions, K+ and glucose that are necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt; HBSS has been extensively tested in dental and [[medical research]] for the past twenty years. This research has shown that 90% of cells stored in HBSS for 24 hours maintain their normal viability and after four days, still have 70%viable.&lt;ref name=pmid1302677/&gt; In research studies, extracted dog’s teeth that have been placed in HBSS for four days can still be replanted with little signs of resorption.&lt;ref name=pmid1302677/&gt; Hank's Balanced Salt Solution is found in a [http://saveatooth.com Save-A-Tooth], a storage device for the storage, preservation, and regeneration of tooth root cells.

HBSS also has been shown to be capable of replacing lost cell metabolites.&lt;ref name="Matsson et al 1982"/&gt; Since a cell that has been cut off from its blood supply depletes its stored metabolites after fifteen minutes, a tooth that has been extra-oral for one hour has less vital cells to reconnect with the bone ligament cells.

Some studies in dental research have shown that knocked out teeth that have been dry for up to one hour will have less resorption if they are soaked in a HBSS for 30 minutes prior to replantation. In these studies, dog’s teeth were extracted and left dry for 30, 45 and 60 minutes and then soaked in HBSS for 30 minutes and then reimplanted.&lt;ref name="Matsson et al 1982"/&gt; These teeth showed 50% less replacement resorption following reimplantation. It has also been shown that keeping the teeth cold while in the HBSS does not affect success.

Many other types of storage liquids have been tested such as [[powdered milk]], Enfamil, Gatorade, and contact lens solution. All of them have been shown to either be ineffective or damaging to avulsed tooth.

==Prognosis==
The long-term prognosis of replanted knocked out teeth is very variable. The treatment for knocked-out teeth has progressed from a success rate of 10% to over 90%.&lt;ref name=pmid7600227/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenstrup &amp; Skieller 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/00016355908993937 |title=A Follow-up Study of Teeth Replanted After Accidental Loss |journal=Acta Odontologica Scandinavica |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=503–509 |year=2009 |last1=Lenstrup |first1=Karen |last2=Skieller |first2=Vibeke | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravn JJ, Helbo M | title = [Replantation of accidentally lost teeth.

In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do can mean the difference between a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed.&lt;ref name="Andreasen JO 1981"/&gt; This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis.&lt;ref name=pmid2390966/&gt; However, 3 year follow-up for delayed replantation (after 15 hours) of avulsed tooth has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sardana D, Goyal A, Gauba K | title = Delayed replantation of avulsed tooth with 15-hours extra-oral time: 3-year follow-up | journal = Singapore Dental Journal | volume = 35 | pages = 71–6 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25496589 | doi = 10.1016/j.sdj.2014.04.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis.

==Epidemiology==
Research has shown that there are five million teeth knocked-out each year in the [[United States of America|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[American Association of Endodontists]] |title=Knocked Out Teeth |url=https://www.aae.org/patients/dental-symptoms/knocked-out-teeth/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 25% of school-aged children and military trainees and fighters experience some kind of [[dental trauma]] each year.&lt;ref name=pmid19208020/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid7600227/&gt; The incidence of dental avulsion in school aged children ranges from 0.5 to 16% of all dental trauma. Many of these teeth are knocked-out during [[Extracurricular activity|school activities]] or [[sport]]ing events such as [[contact sport]]s, [[football]], [[basketball]], and [[hockey]]. It is important for anyone whom is related, working, or witnessing sports that they be educated on this subject matter. Being educated could aid in minimizing injuries that could do further harm to the victim. Being informed and spreading awareness of dental avulsion in the state of knowledge, treatment, and prevention could make an impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Emerich K, Kaczmarek J | title = First aid for dental trauma caused by sports activities: state of knowledge, treatment and prevention | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 361–6 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20433209 | doi = 10.2165/11530750-000000000-00000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first reported cases of knocked-out teeth being replanted was by Pare in 1593. In 1706, [[Pierre Fauchard]] also reported replanting knocked out teeth. Wigoper in 1933 used a cast gold splint to hold reimplanted teeth in place. In 1959, Lenstrup and Skieller&lt;ref name="Lenstrup &amp; Skieller 2009"/&gt; declared that the success rate of replanted knocked out teeth should be considered a temporary procedure because the success rate of less than 10% was so poor. In 1966&lt;ref name=pmid5225449/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid5225450&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreasen JO, Hjorting-Hansen E | title = Replantation of teeth. II.

In 1974, Cvek&lt;ref name=pmid4522422/&gt; showed that storage of knocked out teeth in saline could improve the success of replanted teeth. In 1977, Lindskog et al.&lt;ref name=pmid3860382&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindskog S, Pierce AM, Blomlof L, Hammarstrom L | title = The role of the necrotic periodontal membrane in cementum resorption and ankylosis | journal = Endodontics &amp; Dental Traumatology | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 96–101 | date = June 1985 | pmid = 3860382 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the key to retention of the knocked-out teeth was to maintain the vitality of the periodontal ligament. In 1980, Blomlof&lt;ref name=pmid6942523/&gt; showed the storing the periodontal ligament cells in a biocompatible medium could extend the extra oral time to four hours or more. He found that the best storage medium was a medical research fluid called Hank’s Balanced Solution. In this study, it was serendipitously discovered that milk could also maintain cell viability for two hours. In 1981, Andreasen&lt;ref name=pmid6943904/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid6933704/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andreasen1981/&gt; showed that crushing of cells on the tooth root could cause death of the cells and lead to resorption and reduction in prognosis. In 1983, Matsson et al.&lt;ref name="Matsson et al 1982"/&gt; showed that soaking in Hank’s Balanced Solution for thirty minutes prior to reimplantation could revitalize extracted dog’s teeth that were dry for 60 minutes. In 1989,&lt;ref name=pmid2605601&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krasner PR, Rankow HJ, Ehrenreich A | title = Apparatus for storing and transporting traumatically avulsed teeth | journal = Compendium (Newtown, Pa.) | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 232–4, 237-8 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2605601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a systematic storage device was developed to optimally store and preserve knocked out teeth. In 1992, Trope et al.&lt;ref name=pmid1302677/&gt; showed that extracted dog’s teeth could be stored in Hank’s Balanced Solution for up to 96 hours and still maintain significant vitality. In this study, milk was only able to maintain vitality for two hours.

'''Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V''' (dHMN V) is a particular type of neuropathic disorder.  In general, [[distal hereditary motor neuropathies]] affect the axons of distal motor neurons and are characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of muscles of the extremities.&lt;ref name="SeoPark2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seo|first1=Ah Jung|last2=Park|first2=Byung Sun|last3=Jeong|first3=Na Young|last4=Kim|first4=Doyen|last5=Kim|first5=Sunghoon|last6=Park|first6=Chan|last7=Jung|first7=Junyang|last8=Huh|first8=Youngbuhm|title=Adenoviral-mediated mouse model of motor impairment in distal spinal muscular atrophy type V|journal=Animal Cells and Systems|volume=18|issue=5|year=2014|pages=311–317|issn=1976-8354|doi=10.1080/19768354.2014.950330}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for them to be called "spinal forms of [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]] (CMT)", because the diseases are closely related in symptoms and genetic cause.

== Genetics ==
dHMN V has a pattern of [[Genetic dominance|autosomal dominance]], meaning that only one copy of the gene is needed for the development of the disease. However, there is [[incomplete penetrance]] of this disorder, meaning that some individuals with the disease-causing mutations will not display any symptoms.&lt;ref name="Rakočević-StojanovićMilić-Rašić2010"/&gt;  Mutations on [[chromosome 7]] have been linked to this disease. It is [[allelic]] (i.e., caused by mutations on the same gene) with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease and with Silver’s Syndrome, a disorder also characterized by small muscle atrophy in the hands.&lt;ref name="SeoPark2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dubourg|first1=O.|last2=Azzedine|first2=H.|last3=Yaou|first3=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40885">'''Epoxygenases''' are a set of membrane-bound, [[heme]]-containing [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP P450 or just CYP) enzymes that metabolize [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] to [[epoxide]] products that have a range of biological activities.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  The most thoroughly studied substrate of the CYP epoxylgenases is [[arachidonic acid]].  This [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] is metabolized by [[cyclooxygenase]]s to various [[prostaglandin]], [[thromboxane]], and [[prostacyclin]] metabolites in what has been termed the first pathway of [[eicosanoid]] production; it is also metabolized by various [[lipoxygenases]] to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (e.g. [[5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]], [[12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]], [[15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid]]) and [[leukotrienes]] (e.g. [[leukotriene B4]], [[leukotriene C4]]) in what has been termed the second pathway of eicosanoid production. The metabolism of arachidonic acid to [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s by the CYP epoxygenases has been termed the third pathway of eicosanoid metabolism.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt;  Like the first two pathways of eicosanoid production, this third pathway acts as a signaling pathway wherein a set of enzymes (the epoxygenases) metabolize arachidonic acid to a set of products (the eicosatrienoic acid [[epoxide]]s, abbreviated as EETs, which are classified as [[nonclassic eicosanoid]]s) that act as secondary signals to work in activating their parent or nearby cells and thereby orchestrate functional responses. However, none of these three pathways is limited to metabolizing arachidonic acid to eicosanoids.  Rather, they also metabolize other polyunsaturated fatty acids to products that are structurally analogous to the eicosanoids but often have different bioactivity profiles.  This is particularly true for the CYP epoxygenases which in general act on a broader range of polyunsaturated fatty acids to form a broader range of metabolites than the first and second pathways of eicosanoid production. Furthermore, the latter pathways form metabolites many of which act on cells by binding with and thereby activating specific and well-characterized [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] proteins; no such receptors have been fully characterized for the epoxide metabolites. Finally, there are relatively few metabolite-forming lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases in the first and second pathways and these oxygenase enzymes share similarity between humans and other mammalian animal models.  The third pathway consists of a large number of metabolite-forming CYP epoxygenases and the human epoxygenases have important differences from those of animal models. Partly because of these differences, it has been difficult to define clear roles for the epoxygenase-epoxide pathways in human physiology and pathology.

==CYP epoxygenases==
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of membrane-bound (typically [[endoplasmic reticulum]]-bound) enzymes contain a [[heme]] cofactor and therefore are [[hemoprotein]]s. The superfamily comprises more than 11,000 genes categorized into 1,000 families that are distributed broadly throughout bacteria, [[archaea]], fungi, plants, animals, and even viruses (see [[Cytochrome P450]]). The CYP enzymes metabolize an enormously large variety of small and large molecules including foreign chemical substances, i.e. [[xenobiotic]]s and pharmaceuticals, as well as a diversity of endogenously formed substances such as various [[steroids]], [[vitamin D]], [[bilirubin]], [[cholesterol]], and fatty acids.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24882266 | year = 2014 | author1 = Shahabi | first1 = P | title = Human cytochrome P450 epoxygenases: Variability in expression and role in inflammation-related disorders | journal = Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 144 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–61 | last2 = Siest | first2 = G | last3 = Meyer | first3 = U. A. | last4 = Visvikis-Siest | first4 = S | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.05.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have 57 putatively active CYP genes and 58 CYP [[pseudogenes]] of which only a few are [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] (PUFA) epoxygenases, i.e. enzymes with the capacity to attach atomic oxygen (see [[Allotropes of oxygen#Atomic oxygen]]) to the carbon-carbon double bonds of long chain PUFA to form their corresponding epoxides.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt; These CYP epoxygenases represent a family of enzymes that consists of several members of the CYP1 and CYP2 subfamilies.  The metabolism of the straight chain 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty [[eicosatetraenoic acid]], [[arachidonic acid]], by certain CYP epoxygenases is a good example of their action. Arachidonic acid has 4 cis-configured double bonds (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]]) located between carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15 [[Double bond]]s. (The cis configuration is  termed ''Z'' in the IUPAC [[Chemical nomenclature]] used here.). It is therefore 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.  Certain CYP epoxygenases attack these double bounds to form their respective eicosatrienoic acid epoxide regioisomers (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism [regioisomerism]). The products are therefore 5,6-EET (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetrienoic acid), 8,9-EET (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetrienoic acid), 11,12-EET (i.e. 11,12-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetrienoic acid), and/or 14,15-EET (i.e. 14,15-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z''-eicosatetrainoic acid, the structure of which is illustrated in the attached figure).  Note that the eicosatetraenoate substrate loses one double bound to become an eicosatrienoic acid with three double bonds and that the epoxygenases typically form a mixture of ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] at the attacked double bound position.  Thus, the CYP epoxygenases which attack arachidonic acid's double bound between carbon 14 and 15 form a mixture of 14''R'',15''S''-ETE and 14''S'',15''R''-ETE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25093613 | pmc = 4314516 | year = 2015 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A.

Y. | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.07.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, each CYP epoxygenase often shows preferences in the position of the double bound on which they act, partial selectivity in the ''R''/''S'' enantiomer ratios that they make at each double bound position, and different double bond position preferences and ''R''/''S'' selectivity ratios with different PUFA substrates.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15766564 | year = 2005 | author1 = Barbosa-Sicard | first1 = E | title = Eicosapentaenoic acid metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes of the CYP2C subfamily | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 329 | issue = 4 | pages = 1275–81 | last2 = Markovic | first2 = M | last3 = Honeck | first3 = H | last4 = Christ | first4 = B | last5 = Muller | first5 = D.

The catalytic activity of endoplasmic reticulum-bound cytochrome P450 enzymes, including the epoxygenases, depends upon [[Cytochrome P450 reductase]] (POR); it transfers [[electron]]s to, and thereby regenerates the activity of, the CYPs.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt;  The human gene that expresses POR is highly polymorphic (see [[Gene polymorphism]]); many of the polymorphic variant PORs cause significantly decreases or increases in the activity of the CYPs, including the epoxygenases.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18433346 | year = 2008 | author1 = Hart | first1 = S.

Scores of drugs have been shown to either inhibit or induce one or more of the CYP epoxygenases;&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt;

==CYP epoxygenase substrates and products==
The most studied substrate of the CYP epoxygenases is the [[omega-6 fatty acid]], arachidonic acid.  However, the CYP epoxygenases also metabolize other omega-6 fatty acids such as [[linoleic acid]] and the [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s, [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]].  The distinction between the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid substrates is important because omega-3 fatty acids metabolites can have lesser or different activities than omega-6 fatty acid metabolites; furthermore, they compete with the omega-6 fatty acids for the CYP epoxygenases thereby reducing the production of omega-6 fatty acid metabolites.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arch Biochem Biophys 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18206980 | year = 2008 | author1 = Fer | first1 = M | title = Metabolism of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids by recombinant human cytochromes P450 | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 471 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–25 | last2 = Dréano | first2 = Y | last3 = Lucas | first3 = D | last4 = Corcos | first4 = L | last5 = Salaün | first5 = J.

In humans, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, [[CYP2J2]], and CYP2S1 [[isoforms]] metabolize arachidonic acid to [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s (i.e., EETs) as defined using  recombinient CYPs in an ''[[In vitro]]'' [[microsome]] assay.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arch Biochem Biophys 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25244930"/&gt; CYP2C9, and CYP2J2 appear to be the main produces of the EETs in humans with CYPP2C9 being the main unsaturated fatty acid epoxide producer in vascular endothelial cells and CYP2J2 being highly expressed (although less catalytically active than CYP2C9) particularly in heart muscle but also in kidneys, pancreas, lung, and brain; CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2J2 are also implicated in converting arachidonic acid to epoxides in humans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Most of these CYPs preferentially form 14,15-ETE, somewhat lower levels of 11,12-EET, and far lower, trace, or undetectable levels of 8,9-ETE and 4,5-ETE. There are exceptions to this rule with, for example, CYPE1 forming 14,15-EET almost exclusively, CYP2C19 forming 8,9-EET at slightly higher levels than 14,15-EET, and CYP3A4 forming 11,12-EET at slightly higher levels than 14,15-ETE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  14,15-EET and 11,12-EET are the major EETs produced by mammalian, including human, tissues.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  CYP2C9, CYP2JP, and possibly the more recently characterized CYP2S1 appear to be the main produces of the EETs in humans with CYPP2C9 being the main EET producer in vascular endothelial cells and CYP2JP being highly expressed (although less catalytically active than CYP2C) in heart muscle, kidneys, pancreas, lung, and brain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25655310 | pmc = 4500322 | year = 2015 | author1 = Yang | first1 = L | title = The role of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the cardiovascular system | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–44 | last2 = Mäki-Petäjä | first2 = K | last3 = Cheriyan | first3 = J | last4 = McEniery | first4 = C | last5 = Wilkinson | first5 = I.

CYP2S1 is expressed in [[macrophages]], liver, lung, intestine, and spleen; is abundant in human and mouse [[atherosclerosis]] (i.e. [[Atheroma]]) plaques as well as inflamed tonsils; and, in addition to forming epoxides of arachidonic acid (and other polyunsaturated fatty acids), CYP2S1 metabolizes [[prostaglandin G2]] and [[Prostaglandin H2]] to [[12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid]]. Possibly because of metabolizing and thereby inactivating the prostaglandins and/or because forming the bioactive metabolite, 12-hyddroxyheptadecatrienoic acid, rather than EETs, CYP2S1 may act to inhibit the function of [[monocytes]] and thereby limit [[inflammation]] as well as other [[immune response]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25244930"/&gt;  The activities and clinical significance of the EETs are given on the [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]] page.

===Linoleic acid===
CYP2C9 and CYP2S1 are known to, and many or all of the other CYPs that act on arachidonic acid are thought to, metabolize the 18 carbon [[essential fatty acid]], 9(''Z''),12(''Z'')-octadecadienoic acid, i.e. [[linoleic acid]], at is 12,13 carbon-carbon double bout to form (+) and (-) epoxy [[optical isomers]] viz., the 9''S'',10''R''-epoxy-12(''Z'')-octadecaenoic and 9''R'',10''S''-epoxy-12(''Z'')-octadecaenoic acids; this set of optical isomers is also termed [[vernolic acid]], linoleic acid 9:10-oxide, and leukotoxin.

Furthermore, CYP4A11, CYP4F8, and CYP4F12, which are CYP monooxygenase rather than CYP epoxygeanse in that they metablize arachidonic acid to monohydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid products (see [[20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]), i.e. 19-hydroxy- and/or 18-hydroxy-eicosatetranoic acids, takes on epoxygease activity in converting EPA primarily to its 17,18-epoxy metabolite (see [[epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]).&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2011. p 16"/&gt;

==[[Genetic polymorphism]] in CYP epoxygenases==
Human CYP epoxygenase genes come in many [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) variants some of which code for epoxygenase products with altered activity.  Investigation into the impact of these variants on the bearers' health (i.e. [[phenotype]]) is an invaluable area of research which offers the opportunity to define the function of the epoxygenases and their polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites in humans.  However, SNP variants that cause altered polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism may also cause altered metabolism of their other substrates, i.e. diverse [[xenobiotic]] (e.g. [[NSAID]]) and endotiotic (e.g. the primary female sex hormone, [[estradiol]]) compounds: the latter effects may lead to clinical manifestations that overshadow any manifestations resulting from changes in polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism.

The most common SNP epoxygenase variants are as follows.

==Genetic polymorphism in Cytochrome P450 reductase==
As indicated above, Cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is responsible for regenerating the activity of CYPs including the epoxygenases. Several genetic variants of the human POR gene impact epoxygenase activity. For example, POR [[Missense mutation]]s A287P&lt;ref&gt;http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/mutation/overview?id=215444&lt;/ref&gt; and R457H&lt;ref&gt;http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/mutation/overview?id=1581970&lt;/ref&gt; lead to reductions in the activity of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, respectively, whereas A503V&lt;ref&gt;https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1057868&lt;/ref&gt; and Q153R&lt;ref&gt;http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/mutation/overview?id=1075652&lt;/ref&gt; missense mutations lead to small increases in the activity of CYP2C9.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt; While these and other POR genetic variants have not yet been associated with epoxygenase-related disease, they contribute to the marked variability in the activity of the epoxygenases between individuals.

'''Exercise prescription software''' is a branch of [[computer software]] designed to aid in the construction of exercise programmes or regimes for patients who require some kind of ongoing rehabilitation.

Exercise prescription is common in [[physiotherapy]] practices where traditionally patients would be given a printed handout with diagrams and instructions describing any rehabilitation exercises. As [[high speed internet]] becomes prevalent in the home, and paperless offices are more desirable, prescribed exercises are often e-mailed to patients instead of given on handouts and diagrams replaced by instructional videos.

An '''eye examination''' is a series of tests performed by an [[ophthalmologist]] (medical doctor), [[optometrist]], or [[orthoptist]] assessing [[Visual acuity|vision]] and ability to [[Focus (optics)|focus]] on and discern objects, as well as other tests and examinations pertaining to the [[human eye|eye]]s.
Health care professionals often recommend that all people should have periodic and thorough eye examinations as part of routine primary care, especially since many [[List of eye diseases and disorders|eye disease]]s are  [[symptom#Types|asymptomatic]].

Eye examinations may detect potentially treatable [[blindness|blinding]] eye diseases, [[ocular manifestation of systemic disease|ocular manifestations of systemic disease]], or signs of [[tumour]]s or other anomalies of the [[brain]].

Ideally, the eye examination consists of an external examination, followed by specific tests for [[visual acuity]], [[pupil]] function, [[extraocular muscles|extraocular muscle]] motility, [[visual field]]s, [[intraocular pressure]] and [[ophthalmoscopy]] through a dilated pupil.

A minimal eye examination consists of tests for visual acuity, pupil function, and extraocular muscle motility, as well as direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Basic examination==

===Visual acuity===
{{main|Visual acuity}}
Visual acuity is the eye's ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye's ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance.
The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc.  The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a "person of normal vision" at the specified distance.  For example, if one can see at a distance of 20&amp;nbsp;ft an object that normally can be seen at 20&amp;nbsp;ft, then one has 20/20 vision.  If one can see at 20&amp;nbsp;ft what a normal person can see at 40&amp;nbsp;ft, then one has 20/40 vision.  Put another way, suppose you have trouble seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20&amp;nbsp;ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision.  The 6/6 terminology is more commonly used in Europe and Australia, and represents the distance in metres.

This is often measured with a [[Snellen chart]] or with a logMAR base [[Www.oculab.org|Velorum Visual Acuity System]].

===Refraction===

In physics, "[[refraction]]" is the mechanism that bends the path of light through the eye.  In an eye exam, the term refraction is the determination of the ideal correction of refractive error.  [[Refractive error]] is an optical abnormality in which the shape of the eye fails to bring light into sharp focus on the retina, resulting in blurred or distorted vision. Examples of refractive error are [[myopia]], [[hyperopia]], and [[astigmatism]].  A refraction procedure consists of two parts: objective and subjective.

====Objective refraction====
An objective refraction is a refraction obtained without receiving any feedback from the patient, using a [[retinoscope]] or [[auto-refractor]].

To perform a retinoscopy, the doctor projects a streak of light into a pupil. A series of lenses are flashed in front of the eye. By looking through the retinoscope, the doctor can study the light reflex of the pupil. Based on the movement and orientation of this retinal reflection, the refractive state of the eye is measured.

An auto-refractor is a computerized instrument that shines light into an eye. The light travels through the front of the eye, to the back and then forward through the front again.  The information bounced back to the instrument gives an objective measurement of refractive error without asking the patients any questions.

====Subjective refraction====

A [[subjective refraction]] requires responses from the patient. Typically, the patient will sit behind a [[phoropter]] or wear a [[trial frame]] and look at an eye chart. The eye care professional will change lenses and other settings while asking the patient for feedback on which set of lenses give the best vision.

====Cycloplegic refraction====

Sometimes, eye care professionals prefer to obtain a [[cycloplegic]] refraction, especially when trying to obtain an accurate refraction in young children who may skew refraction measurements by adjusting their eyes with accommodation. Cycloplegic eye drops are applied to the eye to temporarily paralyze the ciliary muscle of the eye.

===Pupil function===
{{main|Pupil}}
[[File:CCMDonation11.JPG|thumb|Medical student giving eye exam at [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City|ITESM-Campus Ciudad de México]].]]
An examination of pupilary function includes inspecting the pupils for equal size (1&amp;nbsp;mm or less of difference may be normal), regular shape, reactivity to light, and direct and consensual accommodation.
These steps can be easily remembered with the [[mnemonic]] ''PERRLA (D+C)'': '''P'''upils '''E'''qual and '''R'''ound; '''R'''eactive to '''L'''ight and '''A'''ccommodation ('''D'''irect and '''C'''onsensual).

A [[swinging-flashlight test]] may also be desirable if [[neurology|neurologic]] damage is suspected.
The swinging-flashlight test is the most useful clinical test available to a [[general physician]] for the assessment of [[optic nerve]] anomalies.
This test detects the [[Marcus Gunn pupil|afferent pupil defect]], also referred to as the Marcus Gunn pupil. It is conducted in a semidarkened room.
In a normal reaction to the swinging-flashlight test, both pupils constrict when one is exposed to [[light]].
As the light is being moved from one eye to another, both eyes begin to dilate, but constrict again when light has reached the other eye.

If there is an [[efferent nerve|efferent]] defect in the left eye, the left pupil will remain dilated regardless of where the light is shining, while the right pupil will respond normally.
If there is an [[afferent nerve|afferent]] defect in the left eye, both pupils will dilate when the light is shining on the left eye, but both will constrict when it is shining on the right eye. This is because the left eye will not respond to external stimulus (afferent pathway), but can still receive neural signals from the brain (efferent pathway) to constrict.

If there is a unilateral small pupil with normal reactivity to light, it is unlikely that a [[neuropathy]] is present.
However, if accompanied by [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] of the upper [[eyelid]], this may indicate [[Horner's syndrome]].

If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]], this is an [[Argyll Robertson pupil]].

===Ocular motility===
{{main|Extraocular muscles}}
Ocular motility should always be tested, especially when patients complain of double vision or physicians suspect neurologic disease.
First, the doctor should visually assess the eyes for deviations that could result from [[strabismus]], extraocular muscle dysfunction, or [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]] of the cranial nerves innervating the extraocular muscles.
[[Saccade]]s are assessed by having the patient move his or her eye quickly to a target at the far right, left, top and bottom. This tests for saccadic dysfunction whereupon poor ability of the eyes to "jump" from one place to another may impinge on reading ability and other skills, whereby the eyes are required to fixate and follow a desired object.

The patient is asked to follow a target with both eyes as it is moved in each of the nine cardinal directions of gaze. The examiner notes the speed, smoothness, range and symmetry of movements and observes for unsteadiness of fixation. These nine fields of gaze test the extraocular muscles: [[inferior rectus muscle|inferior]], [[superior rectus muscle|superior]], [[lateral rectus muscle|lateral]] and [[medial rectus muscle|medial]] rectus [[muscle]]s, as well as the [[superior oblique muscle|superior]] and [[inferior oblique muscle|inferior]] oblique muscles.

===Visual field (confrontation) testing===
{{main|Visual field|Visual field test}}
Testing the visual fields consists of confrontation field testing in which each eye is tested separately to assess the extent of the peripheral field.

To perform the test, the individual occludes one eye while fixated on the examiner's eye with the non-occluded eye.
The patient is then asked to count the number of fingers that are briefly flashed in each of the four quadrants.
This method is preferred to the ''wiggly finger test'' that was historically used because it represents a rapid and efficient way of answering the same question: is the peripheral visual field affected?

Common problems of the visual field include [[scotoma]] (area of reduced vision), [[hemianopia]] (half of visual field lost), [[homonymous hemianopsia]] and [[bitemporal hemianopia]].

===External examination===

External examination of eyes consists of inspection of the [[eyelid]]s, surrounding tissues and [[palpebral fissure]].
Palpation of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] rim may also be desirable, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms.
The [[conjunctiva]] and [[sclera]] can be inspected by having the individual look up, and shining a light while retracting the upper or lower eyelid. The position of the eyelids are checked for abnormalities such as [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] which is an asymmetry between eyelid positions.

===Slit-lamp===
[[Image:Slit lamp Eye examination by Ophthalmologist.jpg|thumb|Slit lamp examination of the eyes in an ophthalmology clinic]]
Close inspection of the anterior eye structures and ocular adnexa are often done with a [[slit lamp]] which is a table mounted microscope with a special adjustable illumination source attached. A small beam of light that can be varied in width, height, incident angle, orientation and colour, is passed over the eye. Often, this light beam is narrowed into a vertical "slit", during slit-lamp examination. The examiner views the illuminated ocular structures, through an optical system that magnifies the image of the eye and the patient is seated while being examined, and the head stabilized by an adjustable chin rest.

This allows inspection of all the ocular media, from cornea to vitreous, plus magnified view of eyelids, and other external ocular related structures. [[Fluorescein]] staining before slit lamp examination may reveal [[corneal abrasion]]s or [[herpes simplex]] infection.

The binocular slit-lamp examination provides stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in striking detail, enabling exact anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions.

Also [[ophthalmoscopy]] and [[gonioscopy]] examinations can also be performed through the slit lamp when combined with special lenses. These lenses include the Goldmann 3-mirror lens, gonioscopy single-mirror/ Zeiss 4-mirror lens for (ocular) anterior chamber angle structures and +90D lens, +78D lens, +66D lens &amp; Hruby (-56D) lens, the examination of retinal structures is accomplished.

===Intraocular pressure===
Intraocular pressure (IOP) can be measured by [[Tonometry]] devices. The eye can be thought of as an enclosed compartment through which there is a constant circulation of fluid that maintains its shape and internal pressure. Tonometry is a method of measuring this pressure using various instruments. The normal range is 10-21 mmHg.

===Retinal examination===
[[File:Fully dilated eye during eye exam.jpg|thumb|right|Fully dilated pupil prior to ophthalmoscopic examination]]
Examination of retina (fundus examination) is an important part of the general eye examination. Dilating the pupil using special eye drops greatly enhances the view and permits an extensive examination of peripheral retina. A limited view can be obtained through an undilated pupil, in which case best results are obtained with the room darkened and the patient looking towards the far corner. The appearance of the [[optic disc]] and retinal vasculature are also recorded during fundus examination.

A [[red reflex]] can be seen when looking at a patient's pupil through a direct [[ophthalmoscope]].  This part of the examination is done from a distance of about 50&amp;nbsp;cm and is usually symmetrical between the two eyes.  An opacity may indicate a cataract.

== Eye exams for children ==
{{see also|pediatric ophthalmology}}
Children should have their first eye exam at 6 months old.  If a parent suspects something is wrong an ophthalmologist can check even earlier.

Early eye exams are important because children need the following basic visual skills for learning:
* Near vision
* Distance vision: Tumbling E chart, Landolt C chart
* Eye teaming ([[binocularity]])
* Eye movement
* Accommodation (focusing skills)
* Peripheral vision
* [[Eye–hand coordination]]

'''''Gauche caviar''''' ("Caviar left") is a pejorative [[French language|French]] term to describe someone who claims to be a [[socialist]] while living in a way that contradicts socialist values. The expression is a political [[neologism]] dating from the 1980s and implies a degree of [[hypocrisy]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The dictionary ''[[Petit Larousse]]'' defines ''left caviar'' as a pejorative expression for a "[[Progressivism]] combined with a taste for [[Socialite|society life]] and its accoutrements".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larousse.fr : under Caviar: ''Gauche caviar, gauche dont le progressisme s'allie au goût des mondanités et des situations acquises''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} One description referred to it as "the free-thinking, authority-hating, individualistic, tolerant, socialist position... which shaded into a bohemian, existential, communitarian, fairly depressed" worldview espoused by people with money and good clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Price of Illusion: A Memoir|last=Buck|first=Joan Juliet|publisher=Atria Books|year=2017|isbn=9781476762944|location=New York|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is broadly similar to the English ''[[Champagne socialist]]'', the American ''[[Limousine liberal]]'' or ''latte liberal'', the German ''Salonkommunist'', the Italian ''[[Radical chic]]'', the Brazilian Portuguese ''esquerda caviar'', the Chilean Spanish ''red set'', and the Danish ''Kystbanesocialist'', referring to well-off coastal neighborhoods north of Copenhagen. Other similar terms in English include ''[[Hampstead#Politics|Hampstead liberal]], [[liberal elite]], [[chardonnay socialist]]'' and ''Bollinger Bolshevik''.

== Usage ==
The term was once prevalent in Parisian circles, applied deprecatingly to those who professed allegiance to the Socialist Party, but who maintained a far from proletarian lifestyle that distinguished them from the working-class base of the French Socialist Party. A more explicit reference identified this group as left-wingers who speak great passion about the plight of the poor while eating caviar in their spectacular Parisian duplex apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dirty French: Everyday Slang from|last=Clautrier|first=Adrien|last2=Rowe|first2=Henry|publisher=Ulysses Press|year=2008|isbn=9781569756584|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The label was also employed by detractors to describe [[François Mitterrand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jrCe45fazTQC|title = HIV Stories: The Archaeology of AIDS Writing in France, 1985-1988|page = 20|last = Boulé|first = Jean-Pierre|publisher = Liverpool University Press|date = 2002|isbn = 0-85323-568-6|accessdate = 2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DUePwcXikocC&amp;dq|title = Blackening Europe: The African American Presence| first = Heike|last =  Raphael-Hernandez|author2=Paul Gilroy|publisher = Routledge|date = 2004 |isbn = 0-415-94399-X |page = 158|accessdate = 2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was further reinforced by the fact that several members of his administration were identified as part of the gauche caviar such as [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], who was the culture minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blackening Europe: The African American Presence|last=Raphael-Hernandez|first=Heike|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0415943981|location=London|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, [[Ségolène Royal]] was identified with the ''gauche caviar'' when it was revealed that she had been avoiding paying taxes. The description damaged her campaign for the French presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nysun.com/foreign/french-socialist-is-accused-of-failing-to-pay-her/46935/|title = French Socialist Is Accused Of Failing To Pay Her Taxes|last = Allen|first = Peter|publisher = The Daily Telegraph - republished by The New York Sun | date = January 18, 2007|accessdate = 2008-09-11|quote = Segolene Royal, the doyenne of the French left, suffered an embarrassing blow to her image as a presidential candidate yesterday when she was accused of tax dodging. Faced with taunts about being a gauche caviar, the Gallic equivalent of a champagne socialist, she denied being rich, instead claiming that she was just "well-off."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly French politician  [[Bernard Kouchner]] and his wife [[Christine Ockrent]] have been labelled with the term. However, his appointment as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] was not hampered by the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/world/europe/18cnd-kouchner.html?pagewanted=all|title = A Surprising Choice for France's Foreign Minister |last = Sciolino|first = Elaine|date = May 18, 2007|accessdate = 2008-09-12|publisher = The New York Times|quote = Elegant and dapper, with movie-star looks despite his age, Mr. Kouchner is half of one of France’s leading power couples. His longtime partner, Christine Ockrent, is probably France’s best-known television journalist. They entertain regularly from their grand duplex apartment overlooking the Luxembourg Gardens; they always get the best restaurant tables. They have been tarred with the label "gauche caviar," champagne-and-caviar socialism at its worst. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other supposed members of this ''gauche caviar'' include [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], the former [[IMF]] managing director, and his wife, the journalist [[Anne Sinclair]], heiress to much of the fortune of her maternal grandfather, the art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. It is said that around 2015, the ''gauche caviar'' supported also the Greek government of [[Syriza|SYRIZA]] and PM [[Alexis Tsipras|Tsipras]], "desperate for a new 'anti-imperialist hero' after Hugo Chavez's death".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=0smADQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=caviar&amp;f=false Cas Mudde, "SYRIZA: The Failure of the Populist Promise", Springer, 2016, p. 16, 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Emmanuel Macron]] has been accused by opposants to be the archetype of the label, claiming a [[socialist]] background all while making [[right wing]] policies. Since the beginning of his term, these accusations have participated largely in a growth in his unpopularity. 

The weekly news magazine, ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', has been described as the "quasi-official organ of France's 'gauche caviar'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://select.nytimes.com/iht/2006/06/20/world/IHT-20politicus.html|title = Chirac's Potential Heirs Keeping Change Hidden |publisher = International Herald Tribune, republished by The New york Times|date = June 20, 2006|accessdate = 2008-09-12|last = Vinocur|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of whether ''gauche caviar'' is accepted by those given such label, politicians who fit this classification wield power in the French polity. For instance, during the administration of Mitterrand, a number of policies were adopted to avoid offending this group, which included the ''Gais pour la liberte'' (Gays for freedom).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=HIV Stories: The Archaeology of AIDS Writing in France, 1985-1988|last=Boule|first=Jean Pierre|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2002|isbn=0853235686|location=Cambridge|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish law]] today prescribes several kinds of '''hand washing''' ({{lang-he|'''נטילת ידיים'''}}, {{transl|he|''netilat yadayim''}}):

* Washing of hands when one wakes from his sleep (known in [[Yiddish]] as {{lang|yi|נעגל וואַסער}}, {{transl|yi|''negel vasser''}}), poured out from a vessel three times, intermittently, over each hand. This washing is said to remove an evil spirit from one's fingers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (''[[Orach Chaim]]'' 4:2; 4:18), based on the [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Shabbat'' 108b (end) — 109a. Others say that this hand washing is required before reciting the ''Shema'' in the morning, or praying, or even studying the words of Israel's Sages, such as is alluded to in the [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Berakhot'' 11b. "R. Hiyya, the son of Ashi has said: 'Many times I would rise up [in the morning] to go before [[Abba Arika|Rab]] in order to recite our readings in the ''Sifra'' of Rab's Beit Midrash. [[Abba Arika|Rab]] would first proceed by washing his hands and blessing [over them], and only then would he recite for us the readings'." Compare [[Maimonides]], Code of Jewish Law ([[Mishne Torah]], ''Hil. Berakhot'' 6:2). Others prescribe the washing of hands, not only for the Morning Prayer ([[Shacharit]]), but for every prayer. (See: the Yemenite Jewish Prayer Book, ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'', with a commentary by Rabbi [[Yihya Saleh]], and ''Tiklāl Qadmonim'' of Rabbi Yiḥya al-Bashiri).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washing of hands before prayer.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (''[[Orach Chaim]]'' 92:4–5; 233:2), based on the [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Berakhot'' 15a. This hand washing is unique, insofar that it does not require the use of a vessel.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washing of hands when one touches his privy parts, or the sweat from his body (excluding his face), or when one crops his fingernails&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Shulhan Arukh'' (''Orach Chaim'' 4:18)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washing of hands when one leaves the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Washing of hands when one leaves a cemetery&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Washing of hands before breaking bread served in one's supper, and only bread made from one of the five chief grains (wheat, cultivated barley, spelt, wild barley,{{efn|''wild barley and oats'': The Hebrew words used here are ''shippon'' and ''shibboleth shu'al'', which [[Rashi|RASHI]] translates in this order, "rye (''[[Secale cereale]]'') and oats (''[[Avena sterilis]]'')". The same Hebrew words are interpreted differently by [[Maimonides]], who calls ''shippon'' "a kind of wild barley," later called by him in Arabic ''al-dawsar'' (''[[Aegilops]]''), and calls ''shibboleth shu'al'' in [[Mishnah]] ''Pesahim'' 2:5 "wild barley" (''[[Hordeum spontaneum]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Amar|first=Zohar|title=Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings|volume=|publisher =Kfar Darom|date=2015|location=Israel|pages=157–159|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Zohar |last=Amar|title=Five Types of Grain: Historical, Halachic, and Conceptual Aspects|publisher=Machon Har Beracha |date=2011|page=62; 113–116|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and oats)&lt;ref&gt;''Shulhan Arukh'' (''Orach Chaim'' 158:1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washing of hands after eating a meal where the salt of Sodom was served at that table&lt;ref&gt;''Shulhan Arukh'' (''Orach Chaim'' 181:1), based on the Babylonian Talmud, ''Berakhot'' 53b and ''Hullin'' 105a—b. The salt of Sodom was said to be so potent that if hands were not washed after touching it, those hands with the salt residue could blind one's eyes (''Hullin'' 105b). Some communities no longer practice this washing at the conclusion of their meals, claiming that, today, the salt of Sodom is no longer served at the dinner table. Their practice in this regard seems to be based on a teaching in the Tosafot, on ''Eruvin'' 17b, s.v. '''מים אחרונים חובה'''. Other communities persist in the old practice, since there is a teaching that states that although the underlying reason behind a certain ruling has been cancelled, their enactment has not been cancelled. Another reason given is that in every ''kor'' ([[Homer (unit)]]) of salt there is to be found a ''qurtov'' of salt of Sodom, which amounts to approximately 5.4 milliliters – 9.3 milliliters, a quantity still capable of blinding an individual (see ''HaRif on Tractate Hullin'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), Jerusalem 1960, p. 83).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washing of hands (practised by the [[Cohanim]], or priests, of some communities) prior to going up to bless the people, as prescribed in the [[Birkat Kohanim|Sacerdotal Blessing]] (Heb. ברכת כהנים).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (''[[Orach Chaim]]'' 128:6). Cf. Rabbi Yaakov Castro's commentary, ''Arakh Leḥem'' (ibid.). The reason for the disparity in Jewish custom in this case is owing to the ambiguity of the teaching, which simply states that a Cohen (priest of Aaron's lineage) is not permitted to stand and bless the people with unwashed hands. Some hold this to mean the washing of hands in the morning, while others hold this to mean the washing of hands immediately prior to blessing the people.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Washing of hands when, prior to eating, one dips a morsel of food within a liquid (e.g. water, honey, oil, etc.) which then clings to that morsel, with the one exception of fruits, seeing that they do not require hand washing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Pesahim'' 115a. While the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (''[[Orach Chaim]]'' 158:4) requires the washing of hands prior to eating fruits that are merely damp with one of the seven liquids, Maimonides does not mention this stringency in his [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Berakhot'' 6:1). Rabbi Hayim Kessar, in his commentary ''"Baal Shem Tov"'' (ibid.), says that the enactment only applied to ''dipping'' fruits or vegetables in a liquid, but not when wetness merely clung to those fruits or vegetables.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In two of these hand washings, water is poured out over one's hands with the aid of a vessel, ''viz''., 1) whenever one wakes from his sleep, and 2) before eating bread.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishne Torah (''Hil. Miqwaot'' 11:1)&lt;/ref&gt; These hand washings are nearly always accompanied with a special blessing prior to concluding the actual act of washing (see ''infra''). Although the minimal quantity of water needed to fulfill one's religious duty is 1/4 of a ''[[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Volume and capacity|log]]'' (a liquid measure of capacity equal to the bulk or volume of one and half medium-sized eggs),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tosefta]]'' ''[[Yadayim]]'' 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; and must be sufficient to cover at least the middle joints of one's fingers,&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Abraham ben Nathan|Avraham b. Nathan Hayarḥi]], ''Sefer Hamanhig'' (the Guide), chapter "Halachot Se'udah", Jerusalem 1970, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; water poured out in excess of this amount is considered praiseworthy in Jewish law. The hand washing made when one leaves the lavatory or latrine, or when one touches his privy parts, or sweat, may be done simply with running tap water (faucet).

The most developed and, perhaps, important of these washings is the washing of hands before eating bread. Such washing of hands is called in Hebrew, ''netilat yadayim'', meaning "the lifting up of the hands."  It is looked upon with such rigidity, that those who willfully neglect its practice are said to make themselves liable to excommunication,&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Berakhot'' 19a&lt;/ref&gt; and bring upon themselves a state of scarcity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Shabbat'' 62b&lt;/ref&gt; and are quickly taken out of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Sotah'' 4b&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of Jewish Ritual ==
[[File:Fjellstedt Tvättkaret.jpg|thumb|1890 illustration of laver in the Temple]]

Ten brazen lavers are said to have served the priests in the [[Temple of Solomon]] in Jerusalem, their function being merely for cleansing the hands and feet before they commenced their service.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 30:17-19; I Kings 7:38&lt;/ref&gt; A teaching preserved in the compendium of Jewish oral law, the [[Mishnah]], informs its reader that any priest who relieved himself by urinating required the washing of the hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Yoma'' 3:2; the word "urinating" is written with a euphemism, lit. "anyone who pours water." See: [http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.3.2 Mishnah Yoma, chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these lavers did not pertain to the general public, nor to their eating foods with washed hands.

The Mishnah (Tractate ''[[Yadayim]]'') is the first to describe the ritual of hand washing outside of the Temple.

The [[Babylonian Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;''Eruvin'' 21b and ''Shabbat'' 14b – 15a&lt;/ref&gt; explains that [[King Solomon]] enacted hand washing as a safeguard, before one eats of any of the animal sacrifices in the Temple. This enactment was restricted only to washing of hands immediately prior to eating those meat offerings of sacrificial animals (hallowed things) offered in the Temple.

=== Enactment Concerning the Priests ===
In subsequent years, [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]] followed in the footsteps of [[King Solomon]] and, in the year ''circa'' 32 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Based on the date given in the Talmud when Hillel emigrated from Babylon and came to Israel, being one-hundred years before the destruction of the Temple in 68 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; these two sages made a decree concerning the [[Cohenim|priests of Aaron's lineage]], ''viz''., that their hands suffer a mandatory state of uncleanness which would disqualify their eating foods separated unto them as an offering (Heb. ''[[terumah]]'') until those very same hands were first washed. The [[Jerusalem Talmud|Talmud Yerushalmi]]&lt;ref&gt;''Shabbat'' 11a and ''Ketubbot'' 45a&lt;/ref&gt; says they had actually renewed what was formerly practised since the time of Moses,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Palestinian Talmud]] (''Ketubbot'' 45a). Meaning to say, it was an oral tradition to do so, since the time of Moses.&lt;/ref&gt; but which had been forgotten by the people. That is to say, they made it a renewed enactment that the priests (i.e. all descendants of [[Aaron]], the first High Priest of God) should be required henceforth, by an edict, to wash their hands before touching bread or other foods which were given unto them as a "heave-offering" (''terumah''). This enactment was made in order to instruct priests (Heb. ''[[Cohenim]]'') about the necessity of washing their hands after immersing their bodies in a ritual bath or ablution, since the Law of Moses enjoins the priests to eat their consecrated foods in a state of [[ritual purity]]. Bodily purity can only be attained by, both, immersing themselves in a ritual bath (Heb. ''[[mikveh]]'') as well as by washing their hands before consuming of such foods. According to the Talmud, the [[Chazal|Sages of Israel]] have based this teaching upon a verse in Leviticus 15:11: "And anyone who is touched by a man suffering from a running issue (Heb. ''[[zav]]''), while he (the man suffering from the running issue) ''has not rinsed his hands in water'', […shall be unclean]." The same verse is explained by [[Rava (amora)|Rava]]:&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud (''Hullin'' 106a)&lt;/ref&gt; "What is the meaning of that which is written, 'while he ''has not rinsed his hands in water''?' Behold! Had he rinsed [his hands], would he be ritually clean?! Behold! He [still] requires an immersion [in a ritual bath]!! Rather, this is its meaning. After [he had immersed himself], so long as he has not yet rinsed [his hands], he is [still] unclean!"

=== Delinquent Priests ===
The Jewish priests of Aaron's lineage (Heb. ''[[Cohanim]]'') during the days of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]] were delinquent about washing their hands after coming up from a ritual bath or ablution, and therefore, their bodies were still considered defiled. They would then go off and eat their bread-offerings (Heb. ''[[terumah]]'') while thinking they were ritually clean, when in actuality they were not. Therefore, it became an edict that all priests, before touching any bread-offering, must first wash their hands. This was done so as to instruct them in the proper laws of [[Ritual washing in Judaism|ritual cleanness]].&lt;ref&gt;Jewish philosopher and scholar, Maimonides, brings down a different explanation in Mishnah ''Zavim'' 5:12, namely, because of some unsuspected, defiled liquid on the priest's hand, which would render the priest's bread-offering defiled when the priest comes to eat his bread and touches it.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Torah'' (Law of Moses) prescribes the penalty of death for priests who eat their bread-offering in a state of uncleanness.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 18:32; cf. Mishnah ''Bikkurim'', ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the enactment renewed by Hillel and Shammai was to prevent their inadvertently being made liable to death by a likely defilement which clings to their hands, and that same defilement being conveyed to foods eaten by them.

=== Pharisaic Traditions ===
It is unclear what sort of regulations were already in place during the late Second Temple period. A reference to hand washing is made in the Christian [[New Testament]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 15:2; Mark 7:2&lt;/ref&gt; 
when Jesus was asked by the [[Pharisees]] why his disciples do not wash their hands prior to their eating bread. Any man who proclaimed to have been Israel's Messiah would have been expected to follow the strictest laws of the Jewish nation, one of which was to eat his common food in a state of ritual purity, and to associate himself with only those who did likewise.&lt;ref&gt;''Tosefta'' ''Demai'' 2:2&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, since there were two Pharisaic schools of thought prevalent in Judaea at that time, the [[School of Shammai]] and the [[School of Hillel]], while the followers of Shammai were generally seen as the more stringent in their practices, it can be assumed that they had made additional regulations related to hand washing before touching unconsecrated bread, because of a suspected uncleanness clinging to those hands and the likelihood of such bread being prepared alongside consecrated foods which require [[ritual purity]]. Moreover, it may have only been a stringent practice observed by the more zealous at the time, or else the very necessity of having to wash hands for common bread was a matter held in dispute by the [[Chazal|Sages of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Tosefta]] (''Berakhot'' 6:3), where the School of Hillel disagrees with the School of Shammai and says that if there was a doubtful case of defiled liquids on the hands, the hands are still clean.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others have explained hand washing as being merely for the sake of bodily cleanliness which, in turn, leads to ritual purity. [[Hiyya the Great|Rabbi Hiyya the Great]] had commanded [[Abba Arika|Rav]] (Abba Aricha) by saying: "If you are able to eat all throughout the year non-consecrated foods in a state of ritual purity, then eat! But if not, at least eat seven days out of the year [in such a state of ritual purity]." On account of these words, Rabbi [[Pinchas ben-Yair|Pinchas ben Yair]] would say: "...Bodily cleanliness leads to ritual purity."&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud, ''Shabbat'' 1:3 (8b)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defilement Decreed Over Hands ===
In subsequent years, according to the [[Babylonian Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;''Shabbat'' 14b – 15a&lt;/ref&gt; additional measures were necessary in order to ensure that all priests would comply by the old enactment made by [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]] (i.e. to wash their hands prior to touching bread-offerings, and to burn all bread-offerings touched by unwashed hands) – for many of the priests simply did not adhere to the enactment made by Hillel and Shammai. During the latter part of the 1st century CE, when disputes grew between the [[School of Shammai|schools of Shammai]] and [[School of Hillel|Hillel]], the disciples of both schools gathered themselves together in the upper storeyed room of Hananiah's house (i.e. Hananiah, the son of Hizkiah, the son of Guron, and party – a man contemporary with Rabbi [[Yehoshua ben Hananiah]] who survived the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE), and voted upon measures to ensure that the priests throughout Israel would adhere to that old enactment, seeing that many priests would continue to eat their bread-offering (Heb. ''[[terumah]]'') without washing their hands. Wherefore, in order to ensure that all priests (Heb. ''Cohanim'') will comply and wash their hands, the Rabbis and scholars who were gathered together in that upper-storeyed room (on the day when they made eighteen new enactments) cleverly devised a method, whereby, they would adhere to the practice. They enacted a law and ordinance for all times, that all Jews — regardless of whether or not they were of the sacerdotal family (priests of Aaron's lineage), or Levites, or Israelites, or proselytes — be required to wash their hands before eating bread, even if that bread to be eaten was only ordinary and common bread. According to the Babylonian Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;Shabbath 14a&lt;/ref&gt; the underlying motive for this new enactment was because hands were considered "fidgety," and apt to touch things. "Hence, unless their owner has taken care that they should not touch a ritually unclean object after he washed them, they are treated as unclean."&lt;ref&gt;''Hebrew-English Edition of Babylonian Talmud - Shabbath'', (ed. Rabbi Dr. H. Freedman), The Soncino Press London 1987, s.v. Shabbath 14a, note 7&lt;/ref&gt; The same Rabbis and scholars also ascribed a mandatory grade of uncleanness to all men's hands,&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Code of Jewish Law'' (''[[Mishne Torah]]''), ''Hil. Avot Ha-Tuma'ot'' 8:2&lt;/ref&gt; capableof rendering the "heave-offering" (''terumah'') invalid for consumption. Whence it is, today, Jews have this rule of practice amongst them. By virtue of the fact that all Jewish men and women are required to wash their hands directly before eating bread, so too, the delinquent priests will now follow suit and wash their hands before eating bread-offerings, and be guarded thereby from culpability resulting from his or their defilement. The [[Palestinian Talmud|Talmud Yerushalmi]],&lt;ref&gt;''Hagigah'' 13a (2:5)&lt;/ref&gt; speaking more candidly about this subject, says explicitly: "Did they not decree [defilement] over the hands in order that he (i.e. the priest) might separate himself from the ''terumah''? By saying to a man that his hands suffer a second-grade uncleanness, even so does he (the priest) separate himself from the ''terumah''." Unwashed hands which suffer a second-grade uncleanness were capable of rendering invalid the bread-offering given to the priests.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Neusner, ''Eliezer Ben Hyrcanus: The Tradition and the Man'', vol. 1, E.J. Brill/Leiden 1973, p. 316 (s.v. Comment)&lt;/ref&gt; The Sages of Israel have coined a name for this hand washing which is customarily made by all religious Jews today before eating bread at a table. It is called in the Hebrew language, ''serakh terumah'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''סרך תרומה'''}}),  meaning, "washing introduced for the sake of uniformity with ''terumah''."&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud (''Hullin'' 106a)&lt;/ref&gt;

The one exception to this rule is when a man or a party of men are encamped while on a journey, and there is no water to be found in the vicinity of their camp, in which case the Sages of Israel have exempted them from washing their hands prior to breaking bread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]], Tractate ''Eruvin'' (end of chapter 1); cf. Maimonides' commentary there.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grades of Uncleanness ===
The [[Torah|Pentateuch]]&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 11:29-40&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to different grades of uncleanness, or [[Tumah and taharah|defilement]], to persons who come in contact with certain impurities (e.g. one of the eight dead vermin mentioned in Leviticus 11:29-30; seminal discharge; blood of menstruate women; carrion &amp;c.). The Sages of Israel have described the aforementioned sources of uncleanness as “fathers of uncleanness,”&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah ''Kelim'' 1:1-4&lt;/ref&gt; capable of conveying a first-grade uncleanness to people, or to vessels, or to foods and liquids that touch them or that carry them.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Code of Jewish Law'' (''Mishne Torah''), ''Hil. Avot Ha-Tuma’ot'' 6:12&lt;/ref&gt; They, in turn, convey uncleanness at a further remove to foods or to clothing touched by them. In the case of foods and clothing, they become second-grade uncleanness. By a rabbinic decree, all hands automatically suffer a second-grade uncleanness until washed.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Code of Jewish Law'' (''Mishne Torah''), ''Hil. Avot Ha-Tuma’ot'' 8:2. Compare [[Mishnah]] ''Shabbat'' 1:4, Commentary of Rabbi Ovadiah da Bertinoro, ''ibid''., s.v. the Seventh Decree.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, hands that were not kept in readiness after washing and which touched a first-grade uncleanness, those hands alone become defiled unto the "pereq" (wrist), while the rest of his body remains ritually clean.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Code of Jewish Law'' (''Mishne Torah''), ''Hil. Avot Ha-Tuma’ot'' 8:1. Cf. Babylonian Talmud, ''Hullin'' 106a-b: "Our Rabbis have taught: 'The sanctification of the hands in the Temple precincts is unto the wrist, [but] for non-consecrated foods unto the joints [of the fingers]; for heave-offering, unto the wrist.'"&lt;/ref&gt; All that is needed, therefore, is for him to wash his hands in water, and he removes thereby all uncleanness.

== Benediction Said Before Washing ==
A [[Berakhah|blessing]] is prescribed over hand washing before eating bread and when one wakes up from his sleep in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;''Shulhan Arukh'' (''Orach Chaim'' 4:1 and 158:1); Questions &amp; Responsa of [[Rashba (rabbi)|RASHBA]] (Rabbi Shelomo ben Avraham Aderet), vol. 1, ''responsum'' # 191&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maimonides prescribes saying the blessing ''before'' one actually pours water over his hands,&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Code of Jewish Law (Mishne Torah, ''Hil. Berakhot'' 6:2), in accordance with a teaching that says: "All of the commandments, entirely, one is to [first] make the blessing [over them prior to performing the act], and then he proceeds into their actual performance" (''Sukkah'' 49a; ''Pesaḥim'' 7b). The author of ''[[Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne|Sefer Ha-Eshkol]]'' also made it a prerequisite, that prior to pouring water over one's hands one is first to bless over the hand washing, saying that any uncleanness which would not hinder one's prayer does not hinder the blessing said over hand washing (q.v. ''Sefer Ha-Eshkol'', Berlin 1910, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49351&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=51&amp;hilite= page 50] [Hebrew]).&lt;/ref&gt;  the custom has developed to recite the blessing only after he has poured water over his hands and has rubbed them together, while they are raised in the air to the height of his chin, prior to his drying them with a towel.&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''responsum'' of Rabbi Hai Gaon in ''Sefer Shaarei Teshuvah'' – 353 Geonic Responsa, Leipzig 1858; External link: [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/30774 ''Sefer Shaarei Teshuvah''], ''responsum'' 196 ({{nbsp}}קצו), p. 54 in PDF (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing is cited in the following manner: "Blessed are you, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us through your commandments and has commanded us concerning the washing of hands" ({{Lang-he-n|'''בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה הָ׳ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו וְצִוָּנוּ עַל נְטִילַת יָדַיִם '''}}). Immediately following the recital of the blessing, it is incumbent to dry those hands with a towel &amp;c.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Sotah'' 4b&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods have developed concerning over which hand one is to begin when pouring water over them. The general custom in the morning (based on a [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] teaching) is to take-up the vessel in one's right hand, pass the vessel into his left hand, and only then begin to pour out water from that vessel over his right hand.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (''[[Orach Chaim]]'' 4:10), based on the [[Zohar]] (P. Miqetz). See also ''Bayt Yosef'' commentary on the Tur (section 4). Had one not followed the set order, it does not render his hand washing invalid.&lt;/ref&gt; Then he reverses the order by taking-up the vessel in his right hand and pouring out water from that vessel over his left hand. This process is repeated altogether three times for each hand, with intermittent changing of hands after each pouring. When this is accomplished, he then takes the vessel and pours out water over both hands, simultaneously, after which he rubs his hands together and then lifts them to make the blessing over his hands, before he wipes them dry.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ|Yahya Ṣāliḥ]], ''Tiklal ‘Eṣ Ḥayyim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 39a (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hand washing made for eating bread, the custom differs insofar that one takes-up the vessel in his right hand and begins by pouring out water in abundance over his left hand. He then takes-up the vessel in his left hand and pours out water in abundance over his right hand. In this case (for eating bread), it is not necessary to wash the hands three times, intermittently, as is customarily done in the morning. Rather, one or two pours for each hand are sufficient.

===Rigid application===
The rabbinic ordinance of washing hands prior to eating bread requires of people travelling the roads to go as far as 4 [[biblical mile]]s if there is a known water source that can be used for washing. This applies only to when the water source lies in one's general direction of travel. However, had he already passed the water source, he is not obligated to backtrack unless the distance is within 1 biblical mile.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishne Torah'' (''Hil. Bikkurim'' 8:11); Jerusalem Talmud, ''Hallah'' 2:2; Babylonian Talmud, ''Pesahim'' 34a; ''ibid''. 46a&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="930">'''Hassall–Henle bodies''' are small transparent growths on the posterior surface of [[Descemet's membrane]] at the periphery of the [[cornea]]. These bodies contain collagenous matter in which numerous cracks and fissures are filled with extrusions of the corneal [[endothelium]]. The condition is usually associated with the aging process.

Hassall–Henle bodies are named after British physician [[Arthur Hill Hassall]] (1817–1894) and German anatomist [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle]] (1809–1885). They are sometimes referred to as '''Hassall–Henle warts''' or '''Henle's warts'''.

'''Health issues in American football''' comprise a large number of health risks associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in [[American football]], due to its nature as a [[Contact sport#Full-contact|full-contact]] game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include [[strain (injury)|strains]], [[sprain]]s, [[bone fracture|fractures]], [[joint dislocation|dislocations]], and [[concussion]]s. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like [[dementia]] and [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE). In individual leagues like the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.

[[Catastrophic injury|Catastrophic injuries]]—defined as serious injury to the [[Vertebral column|spine]], [[spinal cord]], or [[brain]]—and fatalities are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although a small number of them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by [[helmet-to-helmet collision]]s as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of [[artificial turf]].

In many cases, injuries sustained while playing can cause long-term damage. In addition to neurological damage caused by hits to the head, injuries to the mid and lower body can force players to retire or lead to nagging ailments in later life.  Various methods have been used to reduce injuries in football, including rule changes such as the abolition of large wedge formations; a sharp decline in [[cervical spine injury|cervical spine injuries]] since the 1970s has been attributed to rule changes that altered blocking and tackling techniques. More recently, rule changes to protect players from head injuries have been instituted. Equipment like the [[football helmet]] and pads are used to give players a level of protection from injuries, while other factors such as [[cleat (shoe)|cleat]] size are used to minimize the risk of injuries due to field condition.

Because American football is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at [[Seton Medical Center]] in [[Daly City, California]], up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, and there are an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.&lt;ref name="Sports Medicine" /&gt;

The most common types of injuries are [[strain (injury)|strains]], [[sprain]]s, [[bruise]]s, [[bone fracture|fractures]], [[Joint dislocation|dislocations]], and [[concussions]].&lt;ref name="Sports Medicine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saal|first=JA|title=Common American football injuries|journal=Sports Medicine|date=August 12, 1991|volume=12|pages=132–147|pmid=1947533|publisher=San Francisco Spine Institute at [[Seton Medical Center]]|location=[[Daly City, California]]|issue=2|doi=10.2165/00007256-199112020-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NFL Physicians Society, the most common injuries in football are "concussions, blunt injuries to the chest such as [[Myocardial contusion|cardiac contusions]], [[pulmonary contusion]]s, [[rib fracture|broken ribs]], [[abdominal trauma|abdominal injuries]], [[Blunt splenic trauma|splenic lacerations]] and kidney injuries."&lt;ref name="NFLPS" /&gt; Orthopedic injuries to the knee, foot, ankle, shoulder, neck and back are also common, as are muscle strains to the hamstrings, quads, calves and the abdomen.&lt;ref name=NFLPS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nflps.org/faqs/what-are-the-most-common-injuries-and-medical-problems-among-football-players/ |title=FAQ |work=nflps.org |publisher=National Football League Physicians Society |accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An injury report section is common in the sports sections of American [[newspaper]]s, detailing injuries for each team and the amount of time each injured player is expected to be out. The injury report was created to prevent [[sports betting|gamblers]] from gaining inside information about injuries from players, and as a result, NFL teams must report on the status of injured players on a set schedule during the season. The standard severity descriptions are "out" (will not play in the upcoming game); "doubtful" (25% chance of playing); "questionable" (50% chance of playing); or "probable" (75% chance of playing). Teams have been known to downplay, exaggerate or overly detail their teams' injuries in an attempt to confuse or mislead upcoming opponents.&lt;ref name=Boeck07&gt;{{cite news |title=Analysis: Injury report is game within the game |author=Scott Boeck |author2=Skip Wood |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-11-22-injury-report-cover_N.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=25 November 2007 |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injured players may be placed on one of several injured lists, including the [[Physically Unable to Perform]] (PUP) list.

In 1994, the NFL established the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later replaced by the Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating that there is not enough research to determine if [[concussion]]s lead to permanent [[brain injury]].&lt;ref name=Fainaru13&gt;{{cite news |title=New questions about NFL doctor |author1=Steve Fainaru |author2=John Barr |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9561661/central-figure-nfl-concussion-crisis-appointed-years-ago-league-position-commissioner-paul-tagliabue-patient|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=August 18, 2012|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/sports/football/05concussions.html?_r=0|title=Congress Examines N.F.L.

The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone.&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weir|first1=DR|last2=Jackson|first2=JS |last3=Sonnega|first3=A|year=2009|title=Study of Retired NFL Players|publisher =[[Institute for Social Research (University of Michigan)|Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan]] |url=http://www.umich.edu/news/Releases/2009/Sep09/FinalReport.pdf |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dementia Risk Seen in Players in NFL Study|author=Alan Schwarz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/sports/football/30dementia.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 29, 2013 |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries.&lt;ref name=Keating12&gt;{{cite news|title=Head Cases|author=Peter Keating |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7548177/nfl-roger-goodell-concussion-crisis-continues-espn-magazine|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the [[National Football League Players Association]] (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.&lt;ref name=Neale09&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL Institutes New Concussion Policy |author=Todd Neale |date=December 5, 2009 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/nfl-institutes-concussion-policy/story?id=9251126 |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] addressed the issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]]. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the [[National Institutes of Health]] to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues.&lt;ref name = nyt2&gt;{{cite news|title=Roger Goodell, N.F.L.

Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together.&lt;ref name=Keating12/&gt; In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes.

Concussions are also an issue outside of professional football. In a 2010 study by [[Purdue University]] and [[Indiana University]], an estimated 43,000 to 67,000 football players suffer a concussion every season. However, because many injuries go unreported, the true number may exceed 100,000. The study, "{{sic|hide=y|Functionally|-}}Detected Cognitive Impairment in High School Football Players Without Clinically Diagnosed Concussion", was published in 2013 in the ''Journal of Neurotrauma'' and observed 21 high school players throughout a season;  it determined that even players who would not be diagnosed with a concussion based on their symptoms can display notable impairments via MRIs and verbal or cognitive testing, indicating that the current tests used on the sideline to assess concussions may not be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/high-school-football-concussions/ |title=Brain Injury Risks for High School Football Players |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org |date=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talavage |first=Thomas |author2=Eric A.

The study found that, as reported by athletic trainers, college football players sustain 6.3 concussions for every 10,000 athletic exposures (meaning an individual practice or game), and the rate for high school football players is 11.2. The high school concussion figure is nearly double that of the next-highest sport, [[lacrosse]]. The study, funded by a $75,000 donation from the NFL to the Centers for Disease Control Foundation, also found that there is no evidence that newer helmet technology decreases the risk for concussions.&lt;ref name="Preps at greater concussion risk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Farrey|first=Tom|title=Preps at greater concussion risk|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/9902116/report-details-concussion-risks-high-school-athletes|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 6, 2013|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catastrophic injury|Catastrophic injuries]] are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent neurological damage across all high school sports in the United States from 1982 to 2011.&lt;ref name="Special report: Some Texas schools fail to provide catastrophic care for injuries"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Corbett|title=Special report: Some Texas schools fail to provide catastrophic care for injuries|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20131109-not-all-student-athletes-covered-for-catastrophic-injuries.ece|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|accessdate=November 28, 2013|date=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In football, catastrophic injuries are rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since the introduction of the modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher at the high school level than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-Six percent of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.&lt;ref name="Catastrophic Head Injuries in High School and College Football Players"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Catastrophic Head Injuries in High School and College Football Players|last1=Boden|first1=Barry P.|last2=Tacchetti|first2=Robin L.|last3=Cantu|first3=Robert C.|last4=Knowles|first4=Sarah B.|last5=Mueller|first5=Frederick O.|journal=[[American Journal of Sports Medicine]]|date=July 2007|volume=25|issue=7|pages=1,075–1,081|url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/content/35/7/1075.abstract|accessdate=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical costs for catastrophic injuries can be extremely high—a 2011 estimate from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center notes that first-year costs of someone who has high tetraplegia, an injury that causes partial or full loss of use in all limbs, is [[United States dollar|USD]] $1,044,097, with subsequent years costing $181,328. Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that [[Booster club|boosters]] help families pay for these policies.&lt;ref name="Special report: Some Texas schools fail to provide catastrophic care for injuries" /&gt;

Catastrophic injuries have been on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as [[spearing (gridiron football)|spearing]], face tackling and butt blocking.&lt;ref name="'Catastrophic' Head Injuries to High School Football Players Rising" /&gt; However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground.&lt;ref name="Belson14" /&gt; Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.&lt;ref name="'Catastrophic' Head Injuries to High School Football Players Rising"&gt;{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=Lisa|title='Catastrophic' Head Injuries to High School Football Players Rising|url=http://consumer.healthday.com/cognitive-and-neurological-health-information-26/brain-health-news-80/catastrophic-head-injuries-to-high-school-football-players-rising-663944.html|publisher=[[HealthDay]]|accessdate=November 28, 2013|date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatalities in football are rare. A 2013 study of high school and college football players split fatalities into two types: direct fatalities, defined as those caused by "trauma from participation in a sport resulting in a brain injury, cervical fracture, or intra-abdominal injury" and indirect fatalities, defined as those resulting from external factors such as "[[cardiac failure]], [[heat illness]], [[sickle cell trait]] [SCT], [[asthma]], or [[pulmonary embolism]]". The study found that, on average, there are 4 direct fatalities and 8.2 indirect fatalities among high school and college players per year, making indirect fatalities more than twice as common as direct fatalities.&lt;ref name=Boden13&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boden |first=Barry |last2=Breit |first2=Ilan |last3=Beachler |first3=Jason |last4=Williams |first4=Aaron |last5=Mueller |first5=Frederick |date=11 March 2013 |title=Fatalities in High School and College Football Players |url=http://www.theorthocentermd.com/articles/fatalities_in_hiigh_school_and_college_2013.pdf |journal=AJSM PreView |doi=10.1177/0363546513478572 |accessdate=13 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213203715/http://www.theorthocentermd.com/articles/fatalities_in_hiigh_school_and_college_2013.pdf |archivedate=13 December 2013 |volume=41 |pages=1108–1116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on post-career life==
[[Image:Reggie Nelson Reggie Wayne MNF.jpg|thumb|right|Speed players, such as the wide receiver and defensive backs in this picture, can be prone to high momentum collisions, which can put them at greater risk for neurodegenerative disorders in later life.]]

In addition to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A [[cohort study|cohort mortality study]] by researchers at the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988.&lt;ref name=Lehman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehman |first1=EJ |last2=Hein |first2=MJ |last3=Baron |first3=SL |last4=Gersic |first4=CM |year=2012 |title=Neurodegenerative causes of death among retired National Football League players |journal=[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]] |publisher=American Academy of Neurology |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e31826daf50 |url=http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2012/09/05/WNL.0b013e31826daf50.full.pdf+html |accessdate=25 November 2013 |pmid=22955124 |volume=79 |issue=19 |pages=1970–4 |pmc=4098841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disorders]]. In particular, the risk of death from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male.&lt;ref name = Lehman/&gt; The study also compared mortality risks from speed players ([[quarterback]]s, [[halfback (American football)|running backs]], [[fullback (American football)|fullbacks]], [[wide receiver]]s, [[tight end]]s, [[linebacker]]s, [[cornerback]]s, and [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safeties]]) and nonspeed players ([[lineman (American football)|offensive and defensive linemen]]), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This may be due to the increased momentum of collisions from speed players.&lt;ref name=Lehman/&gt;

Outside of neurodegenerative disorders, physical injuries sustained during a career can have an adverse effect on post-career life. A 1990 survey conducted jointly between the NFLPA and [[Ball State University]] found that 65% of surveyed players had suffered a major injury (defined as one that caused them to miss at least eight games): among players that played before 1959 this number was 42%, but it jumps to 72% among those who played in the 1980s. Additionally, roughly 50% of players who had played in the 1970s and 1980s reported that they retired due to injury, compared to only 32% among those who played prior to 1959. Two-thirds of players reported that injuries they had sustained limited their ability to engage in recreational activity and sports in retirement, while half said their injuries decreased their ability to perform manual labor. A follow-up survey in 1994 found that 47% of recipients reported having [[arthritis]]. These reports have been attributed to several factors, including the increase in the use of [[artificial turf]] as well as the increasing size and speed of players. Dr. [[James Andrews (physician)|James Andrews]], a noted orthopedic surgeon, said that "athletes are bigger, stronger and running faster, and they're tearing up knees from cutting, changing direction on a dime". Andrews also noted the increase in the number of non-contact [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) injuries, which he attributed to the size of modern players.&lt;ref name="The Wrecking Yard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nack|first=William|title=The Wrecking Yard|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2001/05/07/303033/the-wrecking-yard-as-they-limp-into-the-sunset-retired-nfl-players-struggle-with-the-games-grim-legacy-a-lifetime-of-disability-and-pain|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=November 26, 2013|date=May 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:Leather football helmet (circa 1930's).JPG|200px|right|thumb|Leather helmets, the predecessor of modern football helmets, were designed to protect players from head injuries.]]

Injuries have always been an extremely big part of American Football, and various methods have been used historically and in modern times to prevent them. One method that has been used to prevent injuries is changing the rules of the sport. An early example of this is the elimination of mass formations like the [[flying wedge]] in the early 1900s, due to the large number of severe injuries the formations caused.&lt;ref name="Football History 101: Weapons of Mass Formation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=David J.|title=Football History 101: Weapons of Mass Formation|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2006/09/30/football-history-101-weapons-of-mass-formation/|publisher=[[AOL Inc.|AOL News]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=September 30, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109044412/http://www.aolnews.com/2006/09/30/football-history-101-weapons-of-mass-formation/|archivedate=November 9, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller wedges consisting of three, four, or five players were frequently used on kickoff returns before wedges were limited to two or fewer players in 2009 by the NFL;&lt;ref name="Mindful of Violence, the N.F.L. Rules Out the Wedge Formation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Battista|first=Judy|title=Mindful of Violence, the N.F.L. Rules Out the Wedge Formation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/sports/football/24nfl.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar rule was adopted by the NCAA a year later.&lt;ref name="NCAA rules changes for 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adelson|first=Andrea|title=NCAA rules changes for 2010|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/24738/ncaa-rule-changes-for-2010|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharp decrease in the number of catastrophic cervical spine injuries since the mid-1970s has been partially credited to rule changes that modified tackling and blocking techniques.&lt;ref name="Sports Medicine" /&gt; With the increasing awareness of the long-term effects of concussions, the NFL has passed rules prohibiting the targeting of "defenseless" players over-the-shoulder, requiring plays to be blown dead when the runner loses his helmet, and placing more stringent limits to the ability of players who have sustained a concussion to return to play.&lt;ref name="New NFL rules designed to limit head injuries"&gt;{{cite web|title=New NFL rules designed to limit head injuries|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81990bdf/article/new-nfl-rules-designed-to-limit-head-injuries|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL.com]]|accessdate=November 10, 2013|date=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, modern equipment was developed to reduce injuries. The [[football helmet]], although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like [[skull fractures]].&lt;ref name="Can Football Finally Tackle Its Injury Problem?"/&gt; The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s to protect themselves from head injuries.&lt;ref name="Did the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, also invent the football helmet?f"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Did the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, also invent the football helmet?|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/12/sports-legend-revealed-did-the-inventor-of-basketball-james-naismith-also-invent-the-football-helmet.html|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries.&lt;ref name="Face of the NFL is gone: An ode to the single-bar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Tim|title=Face of the NFL is gone: An ode to the single-bar|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/2102/face-of-the-nfl-is-gone-an-ode-to-the-single-bar|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many players also wear [[mouthguard]]s to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues;&lt;ref name="The American Football Player's Uniform"&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Football Player's Uniform|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-american-football-players-uniform.html|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=November 11, 2013|author=Long, Howie|authorlink=Howie Long|author2=John Czarnecki}}&lt;/ref&gt; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory.&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 22"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – [[shoulder pad]]s are the most important pads, protecting the [[shoulder]] and [[sternum]], but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their [[ribcage]]. [[Cleat (shoe)|Cleats]] come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on [[artificial turf]], for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction.&lt;ref name="The American Football Player's Uniform" /&gt; [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|Athletic cups]] are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the [[groin]] area.&lt;ref name="Helmet? Check. Shoulder Pads? Check. Cup? No Thanks."&gt;{{cite web|last=Borden|first=Sam|title=Helmet? Check. Shoulder Pads? Check. Cup?

==Shootings==
The shootings began at around 4:57 p.m. at a street intersection in Newton, where Ford shot at two vehicles in a drive-by shooting. The first motorist suffered a non-fatal gunshot wound to the shoulder, while the second motorist escaped unscathed after a bullet pierced the car's windshield. He then drove down Old [[U.S. Route 81]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hesstonrecord.com/current-news/update-9-pm-press-conference-on-hesston-shooting/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302180140/http://www.hesstonrecord.com/current-news/update-9-pm-press-conference-on-hesston-shooting/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 2, 2016 |title=Update: 9 PM Press Conference On Hesston Shooting |work=The Hesston Record |date=February 25, 2016 |accessdate=February 26, 2016 |first=Blake |last=Spurney }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fired at oncoming traffic.

Ford then arrived at Excel Industries, a manufacturer of lawnmowers, in Hesston, injured an elderly woman in the parking lot, went inside the building, and fired randomly at the assembly lines, shooting several employees. According to one person who was shot but survived, Ford seemed to hesitate before firing. He then shot at Chief Doug Schroeder, the first officer to respond to the scene, and Schroeder fired back. Ford was struck by bullets and died at 5:23 p.m. Ford was armed with a [[Zastava Arms]] [[AK-47#Variants|AK-47-style]] [[semi-automatic rifle]] and a [[Glock 22]] [[semi-automatic pistol]].&lt;ref name=KWCH/&gt;&lt;ref name="hopkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Woman-charged-with-transferring-firearms-to-Hesston-gunman-370325291.html?ref=291|title=Woman charged with transferring firearms to Hesston gunman|work=KAKE|date=February 25, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HaxelBermanMarkon&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kansas-rampage-deviated-from-general-pattern-of-recent-tragedies/2016/02/26/2c37642a-dcc7-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d_story.html|title=Kansas shooting rampage deviated from pattern of recent tragedies|work=The Washington Post|date=February 26, 2016|accessdate=February 26, 2016|first=Christopher|last=Haxel|first2=Mark|last2=Berman|first3=Jerry|last3=Markon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/kansas-shooting-victim-coworker-hesitated-firing/story?id=37256128|title=Kansas Shooting Victim Says Coworker Hesitated Before Firing|work=ABC News|date=February 28, 2016|accessdate=February 28, 2016|first=David|last=Chiu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/brave-killed-kansas-shooter-cedric-ford-speaks-article-1.2557134|title=Brave cop who killed Kansas shooter Cedric Ford during workplace rampage says, 'I am not a hero'|date=March 8, 2016|accessdate=March 9, 2016|publisher=The New York Daily News|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 150 people were inside the plant at the time of the shooting there.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

Cedric Larry Ford ({{circa}} 1978 – February 25, 2016), a painter for Excel, was identified as the shooter.

Ford had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was arrested for carrying a concealed firearm at the age of 18.&lt;ref name=JohnsonCalabrese/&gt; In [[Harvey County, Kansas]], Ford was arrested for drug possession, theft, and parole violation.&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt; Ford also had a misdemeanor conviction in relation to a brawl that occurred in 2008, as well as several traffic violations in 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref name=PotterRyanLeikerHorwath&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article62530532.html|title=Four dead, including gunman, in Kansas workplace shooting|work=The Wichita Eagle|date=February 25, 2016|accessdate=February 26, 2016|first=Tim|last=Potter|first2=Kelsey|last2=Ryan|first3=Amy Renee|last3=Leiker|first4=Bryan|last4=Horwath}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also arrested in [[Broward County, Florida]] for resisting arrest, battery, and grand theft.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas shooting rampage: 4 dead, 14 injured, shooter ID'd|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/333662-kansas-shooting-hesston-ak/#.Vs-o-5n7tZE.twitter|publisher=Russia Today|date=February 25, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MortonShooting&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/25/hesston-kansas-shooting-multiple-people-reportedly/|title=Four dead, including gunman, in Kansas workplace shooting|work=The Washington Times|date=February 25, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2016|first=Victor|last=Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, an autopsy on Ford's body indicated high levels of [[methamphetamine]] and alcohol in his system. He had "more than 135 times the standard dose" of meth at the time of his death. According to an expert, "[t]he combination of meth and alcohol can produce psychosis, delusions and an increased likelihood of acting on one's impulses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutchnews.com/news/courts_and_cops/hesston-shooter-s-body-tests-positive-for-meth-alcohol/article_db89e515-397d-5063-8c4b-acda9e72217d.html|title=Hesston shooter’s body tests positive for meth, alcohol|work=The Hutchinson News|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016|first=Oliver|last=Morrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwch.com/content/news/Coroner-Hesston-mass-shooter--382313761.html|title=AP: Excel Industries shooter had high dose of meth in his system|work=KWCH|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iskar-reservoir-imagesfrombulgaria.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The Iskar Reservoir is a popular weekend destination for the residents of Sofia and the area]]
The '''Iskar Reservoir''' (язовир „Искър“) is the largest [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] in [[Bulgaria]]. It is situated on the [[Iskar River]] and provides 2/3 of the water for the capital [[Sofia]], also being used for producing [[hydroelectricity]].

The reservoir has a total volume of 673 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 580 million are in use and the rest is reserve. The reservoir has a [[drainage basin]] of 1,046&amp;nbsp;km² and is 25&amp;nbsp;km long. It is situated at 820 m above sea level, its dam being 204 m long and 76 m high.

==History==
The initial plans for the construction of a dam on the Iskar date to as early as 1900-1901, immediately after the building of the Pancharevo Hydroelectric Power Plant. In 1921, the idea was once again brought up, but its accomplishment failed due to the municipality's inability to indemnify the residents of the neighbouring villages of [[Gorni Pasarel]], [[Shishmanovo]] and [[Kalkovo]]. [[Topographic]] photographs and a [[geological]] assessment regarding the dam were made and observations of the Iskar's water level at [[Pasarel]] were conducted in 1932-1941 in order to build what was initially called the ''St Peter's Reservoir'' (named after the monastery in [[Dolni Pasarel]] which was supposed to be near the reservoir).

New geological research related to the reservoir's construction began in 1947 at four places between Gorni Pasarel and [[Pancharevo]]. The place at the Iskar's 37th kilometre was chosen as the most suitable in terms of geology, topography and economics. The waters of the river were further studied between 1947 and 1948.

Work on the projects for an Iskar water power system commenced in early 1948 in the newly established [[Energohidroproekt]]. The design and the first draft were created by a team under the engineer Moiseev with the assistance of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] specialists. The project was approved by the expert council of the Ministry of Electrification and Melioration, and it was planned that the reservoir had a working volume of 520 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a reserve volume of 60 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The preparative works began in 1949, the main construction was carried out in the end of 1950, the water power system being officially opened on 6 September 1954.

'''Jane Thornthwaite''' (born 1958 or 1959) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician and activist who was elected as a Member of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] in the [[British Columbia general election, 2009|2009 provincial election]]. In 2017 she was re-elected to a third term as member of the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal Party]] in the riding of [[North Vancouver-Seymour]]. Thornthwaite currently serves as the Official Opposition's critic role on Mental Health and Addictions and has been appointed to the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leg.bc.ca/learn-about-us/members/41st-Parliament/Thornthwaite-Jane Jane Thornthwaite], ''BC Legislative Assembly''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Thornthwaite was raised in [[West Vancouver]], attending Hillside Secondary School and also in [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]], attending [[Windsor Secondary School]]. She graduated from the [[University of British Columbia]] with a degree in health education. Prior to her election to the legislature, Thornthwaite worked as a registered dietitian and nutritionist for her own consulting business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All-candidates meetings |newspaper= North Shore News |location=[[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]] |date=November 6, 2005 |page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thornthwaite, working in that field fostered a sense of advocacy for [[organic food]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New documentary reveals the perils of processed foods |newspaper= WestEnder |location= [[Vancouver]] |date=May 26, 2005 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a desire for [[Mandatory labelling|labelling]] of food products containing [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified ingredients]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What's in that spud? Genetically altered food concerns nutritionist |last= Gillett |first= Leslie |newspaper= [[The Province]] |location= [[Vancouver]] |date=February 10, 1997 |page= B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time she raised three children of her own.

===Local Politics===
In 2005, Thornthwaite stood as an independent&lt;ref name=SD44&gt;{{cite news |title=NV school board gets three new trustees |last= Seyd |first=Jane |newspaper= North Shore News |location=[[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]] |date=November 23, 2005 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[School District 44 North Vancouver|North Vancouver School District]] election. She received the most votes, making her one of four candidates elected from the [[North Vancouver, British Columbia (district municipality)|District of North Vancouver]].&lt;ref name=SD44/&gt; The school board, facing declining enrollments, had to close schools, though there was resistance from the community. [[Balmoral Junior Secondary School]] was specifically identified as a school that ought to be closed, though the board refused and kept it open (until 2009) due to public pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trustees advised to close schools; Report says Balmoral junior secondary should be first to close its doors due to declining enrollment |last= Steffenhagen |first=Janet |newspaper= [[The Vancouver Sun]] |location=[[Vancouver]] |date=December 7, 2007 |page= B5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornthwaite, along with another board member, issued a public statement criticizing the board's decision to enter into a public-private partnership to deliver courses specializing in dance, figure skating and other related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two NV trustees object to Pro-Merita program lease |last= Weldon |first=James |newspaper=  North Shore News |location=[[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]] |date=May 20, 2007 |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 2008 election, Thornthwaite was the only board member seeking re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Profile: District of North Vancouver school board candidates |last= Neufeld |first=Scott |newspaper= The North Shore Outlook |location=[[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]] |date=October 31, 2008 |page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering her second term, Thornthwaite was elected chairperson of the board.

==Provincial politics==
===First Term (2009-2013)===
In March 2009, long-time Member of the Legislative Assembly [[Dan Jarvis]] suddenly announced his retirement and endorsed Thornthwaite to replace him as a candidate in the [[British Columbia general election, 2009|upcoming provincial election]], a recommendation later supported by the party's election readiness committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retired Liberal MLA Dan Jarvis endorses Thornthwaite as his successor |newspaper= The North Shore Outlook |location=[[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]] |date=March 26, 2009 |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thornthwaite to run as Liberal candidate in North Vancouver-Seymour |newspaper= The North Shore Outlook |location=[[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]] |date=April 7, 2009 |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seymour&gt;{{cite news |title=Liberals pick Thornthwaite for Seymour |last=Seyd |first=Jane |newspaper= North Shore News |location=[[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]] |date=April 8, 2009 |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electoral district was considered one of the safest BC Liberal ridings in the province&lt;ref name=Seymour/&gt; and the 50-year-old Thornthwaite easily won, with her BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.

On February 22, during the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Thornthwaite was driving home after attending receptions at the [[Canada's Northern House|Northern House]] and Sochi House when at 1 am she was stopped at a road block near the [[Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing]]. She twice registered a [[blood alcohol content]] of 0.11 in road-side [[breathalyzer]] tests and was arrested for [[Drunk driving (Canada)|drunk driving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=B.C.

====Animal welfare====
In 2012, Thornthwaite introduced legislation banning puppy mills in British Columbia, Bill M-214, known as the "Standards of Care for Breeders of Companion Animals Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MLA wants law to target puppy mills |newspaper= [[Times-Colonist]] |date=Jan 13, 2012 |url= http://www.timescolonist.com/life/wants+target+puppy+mills/5990390/story.html |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.bc.ca/39th4th/votes/progress-of-bills.htm |title=Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |author= |work= |publisher=Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill did not pass initially, but Thornthwaite re-introduced it in 2016 after a government raid rescued 66 mistreated dogs from a puppy mill.&lt;ref name="The Province 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Smyth: Victoria moving on tough new rules for commercial dog and cat breeders | website=The Province | date=November 16, 2017 | url=http://theprovince.com/life/smyth-victoria-moving-on-tough-new-rules-for-commercial-dog-and-cat-breeders | accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC News 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=New puppy mill law would give SPCA the 'teeth' to go after bad breeders | website=CBC News | date=February 18, 2016 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-puppy-mill-law-would-give-spca-the-teeth-to-go-after-bad-breeders-1.3453786 | accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed that April.&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt;{{cite web | title=B.C. adopts national standards for kennel and cattery operations, licensing could come next | website=CBC News | date=April 24, 2016 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-order-in-council-to-protect-cats-and-dogs-1.3551099 | access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''legal aspects of ritual slaughter''' include the regulation of [[slaughterhouse]]s, [[butcher]]s, and religious personnel involved with traditional [[shechita]] (Jewish) and [[dhabiha]] (Islamic). Regulations also may extend to [[meat|butchery products]] sold in accordance with [[kashrut]] and [[halal]] religious law. Governments regulate ritual slaughter, primarily through [[legislation]] and [[administrative law]]. In addition, compliance with oversight of ritual slaughter is monitored by governmental agencies and, on occasion, contested in [[litigation]].

The most controversial aspect of ritual slaughter is the legality of [[stunning|unstunned]] slaughter, where [[animal welfare]] concerns regularly clash with religious concerns, and split public opinion.&lt;ref name="Rawlinson"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Rawlinson |first1=Mary |last2=Ward |first2=Caleb |date=2016 |title=The Routledge Handbook of Food Ethics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUyTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA306 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=305–306 |isbn=9781317595502 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope of regulations ==
In Western countries, law reaches into every stage of ritual slaughter, from the slaughtering of livestock to the sale of kosher or halal meat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2017/05/kill-and-let-kill The Economist: ''The debate surrounding religious rules for slaughtering animals'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jones v. Butz, the action involved "a challenge, under the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the [[First Amendment]], to the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] and in particular to the provisions relating to ritual slaughter as defined in the Act and which plaintiffs suggested involved the Government in the dietary preferences of a particular religious (e.g., Orthodox Jews) group.  The court held that there is no violation of Establishment Clause because no excessive governmental entanglement and by making it possible for those who wish to eat ritually acceptable meat to slaughter the animal in accordance with the tenets of their faith, Congress neither established the tenets of that faith nor interfered with the exercise of any other."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.animallaw.info/case/jones-v-butz Michigan State University College of Law ''Animal Legal and Historical Center'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States religious slaughter is not practiced under any exemption, as is the case in several European legal codes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/dr-isaac-lewin-and-the-fight-for-kosher-slaughter Nathan Lewin ''Dr. Isaac Lewin And The Fight For Kosher Slaughter'']&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] defines religious slaughter by Jews and Muslims as one of two humane methods for killing animals for food: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;by slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the Islamic and Jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter whereby the animal suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument and handling in connection with such slaughtering. the other being using stunning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The kosher food industry has challenged regulations as an infringement on religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;"Kosher Food Regulation and the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment" by Gerald F. Masoudi, ''The University of Chicago Law Review'', Vol. 60, No. 2. (Spring, 1993), pp. 667–696 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1600082 JSTOR link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/halal-shechita-politics-animal-slaughter Sam Jones ''Halal, Shechita and the politics of animal slaughter'' The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular governments also have sought to restrict ritual slaughter not intended for food consumption. In the U.S., the most prominent such case is [[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]. In this case, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled unconstitutional a local Florida ban on [[Santería]] ritual [[animal sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.animallaw.info/article/free-exercise-does-not-protect-animal-sacrifice-misconception-church-lukumi-babalu-aye-v ''Free Exercise Does Not Protect Animal Sacrifice: The Misconception of Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah and Constitutional Solutions for Stopping Animal Sacrifice'' Shannon L. Doheny]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is complicated by allegations of [[antisemitism]] and [[xenophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4599/like-it-or-not-the-ritual-slaughter-debate-is-about-much-more-than-animal-rights Paul Sims ''Like it or not, the ritual slaughter debate is about much more than animal rights'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencenordic.com/butchery-law-anti-semitic-roots ScienceNordic ''Butchery law with anti-Semitic roots'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Regulating slaughter: Animal Protection and Antisemitism in Scandinavia, 1880-1941'' Michael Metcalf. Patterns of Prejudice, vol 23 no.3, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, recent debate in [[Switzerland]] has been contentious, in part, because of comparisons by a prominent activist between kosher slaughter and the methods used by [[Nazis]] in [[concentration camps]]. The [[metaphor]] was borrowed from the [[vegetarian]] and [[Nobel Prize]] [[laureate]] [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] who said "I am not a vegetarian for my own health, but for the health of the chickens" and has one of his fictional characters say,  "every day is [[Treblinka]] for the animals." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/14444.Isaac_Bashevis_Singer Quoted on this site in French: “En pensée, Herman fit l'oraison funèbre de la souris qui avait partagé une partie de sa vie et qui, à cause de lui, avait quitté cette terre. "Tous ces érudits, tous ces philosophes, les dirigeants de la planète, que savent-ils de quelqu'un comme toi? Ils se sont persuadé que l'homme, espèce pécheresse entre toutes, domine la création. Toutes les autres créatures n'auraient été créées que pour lui procurer de la nourritures, des fourrures, pour être martyrisées, exterminées. Pour ces créatures, tous les humains sont nazis; pour les animaux, c'est un éternel Treblinka.”]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|ritual slaughter}}
{{see also|shechita|dhabiha|comparison of Islamic and Jewish dietary laws}}
Some claim that, according to Jewish law and Muslim law, "slaughter is carried out with a single cut to the throat, rather than the more widespread method of stunning with a bolt into the head before slaughter."&lt;ref name="FAWC"/&gt; However, other Jewish and Islamic authorities have stated that stunning is compatible with religious law.&lt;ref name="Menuge"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Menuge |first=Angus J.L. |date=2016 |title=Legitimizing Human Rights: Secular and Religious Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=318GDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=39–49 |isbn=9781317105763 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of post-cut stunning, meaning that stunning is applied after the animal gets the throat cut, is regarded as a "middle ground".&lt;ref name="Today2014"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsNXRk1NjYI |title=John Blackwell (BVA Head) - End Religious Slaughter Without Pre-Stunning (2014) |author=Mishal Husain |work=[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|The Today Programme]] |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=22 June 2018}} The [[British Veterinary Association]]'s head John Blackwell and vice-president Jonathan Arkush of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] outline two sides of the public debate on the ritual slaughter of animals.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic jurisprudence ===
A 1935 fatwa by the Mufti of Dehli declared that stunning does not kill the animal and thus is 'reversible' and allowed under Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Menuge"/&gt; [[List of Presidents of Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar rector]] Muhammad el-Tayyeb el-Naggar confirmed in 1982 that stunning would not make the practice un-Islamic.&lt;ref name="Menuge"/&gt; Many Muslim authorities accept reversible stunning prior to the cut, such as electrostunning, or concussion with a roundheaded (mushroom-shaped) hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://halalcertification.ie/islamic-method-of-slaughtering/ |title=Islamic Method Of Slaughtering |work=Department of Halal Certification Europe (DHCE) |publisher=Al-Mustafa Islamic Centre Ireland |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dialrel"/&gt; In 2014, about 85% of halal meat produced by the Muslim community in the [[United Kingdom]] was pre-stunned.&lt;ref name="Today2014"/&gt;{{rp|at=3:38}}

=== Jewish jurisprudence ===
According to rabbi [[Norman Solomon (rabbi)|Norman Solomon]] (2000), some [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]] regard ethics as more important than diet, and reject the very notion of kosher meat.&lt;ref name="Menuge"/&gt; Within the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] (Masorti) denomination of Judaism, there is a broad consensus of accepting meat from animals stunned before slaughter as kosher.&lt;ref name="humanesociety.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/faith/conservative_judaism_pdf.pdf |title=Conservative Judaism |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With some exceptions, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish communities]] uphold the prohibition on stunning before slaughter.&lt;ref name="Dialrel"/&gt;

In practice, a requirement for a shohet (Jewish ritual slaughterer) is that the shohet adheres to a high level of religiosity,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QH3BHQulNpsC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=requirement+for+shohet+religiosity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T0rKyskFfR&amp;sig=2ZlLDp5rw4fbn8S5p1DQ_7dCuSU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjehvDkuu_VAhWidpoKHYspB-cQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=requirement%20for%20shohet%20religiosity&amp;f=false ''A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza'' S.

In practice, kosher slaughtering is carried out by orthodox shochtim (authorized slaughterers) because the meat produced by Conservative slaughters from the Conservative denomination would not be acceptable to orthodox practising Jews and the limited market that would accept such meat is not commercially viable.&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DB0GsYw6dhAC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=conservative+jews+accept+stunning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pniGcpqMt4&amp;sig=2kVzbRffutLSAr4w241fkiFoCWk&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_-Yaexu_VAhUhEJoKHbJaAQQQ6AEIUjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=conservative%20jews%20accept%20stunning&amp;f=false ''Contested Rituals: Circumcision, Kosher Butchering, and Jewish Political ...''

== Historic bans (until 1945) ==

=== Asia ===
Some rulers [[Ahimsa#Laws|banned all killing]] on their land for some period each year, including ritual slaughter. [[Beop of Baekje]] banned all kinds of killing.&lt;ref&gt;百濟第二十九主法王諱宣。或云孝順。開皇十年己未即位。是年冬。下詔禁殺生。放民家所養鷹鸇之類。焚漁獵之具。一切禁止。三國遺事 卷3&lt;/ref&gt;[[Emperor Tenmu]]、[[Empress Genshō]]、[[Emperor Shōmu]] banned eating meat in Japan, in 675.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soci.fju.edu.tw/attachments/115_%E9%BB%83%E9%9D%96%E5%B5%90-You%20are%20what%20you%20eat.pdf  2010 社會學研究生論文發表會2010 年3 月19 日]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]] who was Fifth General Shōgun of Edo (Japan) made animal protection laws and when he died, about 8000 criminals (including 3800 in [[Edo]]) who had been convicted of violating the law, were released (see [[:ja:生類憐れみの令]]).&lt;ref&gt;[鳥銃濫発禁止令」「犬猫を繋ぐことの禁止令」「鳥魚貝等の憐れみ令」「犬猫憐れみ令」「馬匹憐れみ令」「猪鹿狼憐れ

According to the ''White History of the Tenfold Virtuous Dharma'' (Arban Buyantu Nom-un Caġan Teüke), [[Altan Khan]] ordered the religious code Arban Buyantu Nom-un Cagaja prohibited human and animal sacrifice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Europe ===
In the 1880s, [[anti-Semites]] joined forces with Animal Protection Societies to campaign for anti-shechita legislation to be passed in Switzerland, Germany and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name="Metcalf 1989 pp.32"&gt;Metcalf, "Regulating Slaughter: Animal Protection and Antisemitism in Scandinavia, 1880–1941", Patterns of Prejudice 23 (1989): pp.32–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Switzerland]] shechitah was forbidden throughout the whole country in 1893 after having been banned in the [[cantons]] of [[Aargau]] and [[St. Gallen]] in 1867 after [[plebiscites]], and later a ban was introduced in the whole of Switzerland after a plebiscite at Federal level. The system of voting on individual policies using referendums (plebiscites) had only recently been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1201&amp;letter=S |title=Switzerland |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/swiss.html |title=Switzerland: Virtual Jewish History Tour |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first plebiscite in Swiss history was on the subject of banning shechita. The government and all the political parties were against the ban, but the popular sentiment won the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcpa.org/article/muslims-and-jews-in-switzerland/ Dr. Simon Erlanger ''Muslims and Jews in Switzerland'' note 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norway]] banned religious slaughter without pre-stunning in 1929.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Maduro, G.A., 2015. ''Ritual Slaughter and (in) equality''. p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosher slaughter was banned in [[Poland]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=My Brother's Keeper {{ndash}} A History of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 1929-1939 |publisher=The Jewish Publication Society of America |location=Philadelphia |year=1974 |first=Yehuda |last=Bauer |chapter=Prelude of the Holocaust |quote=[...] Polish laws against ritual slaughter (shehita) enacted in April 1936 and, in a final and drastic form, in March 1939.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweden]] banned shechita (Jewish ritual slaughter) of cattle in 1937, and of poultry in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bechollashon.org/heart/index.php/articles/1591 Ron Journard ''Jerusalem Post'' Feb 10, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Germany]] banned shechita nationwide three months after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933. There had been a prior ban in the German state of [[Saxony]], and the [[League of Nations]] had supported the Jewish Community of [[Upper Silesia]] against Hitler in rejecting the attempts by German officials to confiscate shehitah knives and ban Jewish slaughter there as had been done in the German Reich. Bans were introduced in all the countries which the [[Nazis]] occupied, as well as in the countries of the Axis allies: [[Italy]] and [[Hungary]].  Bans introduced by the German [[Third Reich]] and by [[Benito Mussolini]] were removed by Allied Command when the Allies liberated Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Right to Practise Shehitah'' Berman et al&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Religious Freedom: The Right to Practice Shehitah'', Munk, Munk and Berman documented every ban introduced in every country in Europe up to 1946, and made an analysis that claims that until the rise of Hitler in 1933, the international campaign to introduce ritual slaughter / shehitah bans had failed because the vast majority of countries where legislation had been proposed rejected the legislation realising the involvement of anti-Semites in the campaign and enacted legislation to stave off bans on Jewish and Muslim slaughter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== European Union ==
=== European Convention on Human Rights ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2012}}

Article 9 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is headed  – Freedom of thought, conscience and religion.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.

2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In those countries that have signed the convention, and, at the same time have enacted laws that effectively ban ritual slaughter have a conflict between the Convention and the law. In international law two principles apply: one being which law was enacted first, the other being the intentions of the lawmakers. (This principle was challenged in [[Pepper v Hart]] in the context of the UK.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The preparatory discussions for Article 9 of the European Convention dealt specifically with Shehitah as the matter was raised by a Jewish pressure group &lt;ref&gt;Svanberg, Ingvar ''Religös slakt'' in ''Religionsfrihet i Sverige: rätten att leva som troende ''Religious slaughter'' in ''Freedom of Religion in Sweden: the Right to Follow One's Conscience as a believer''&lt;/ref&gt; dealt specifically with effective bans on religious slaughter imposed by the Nazi Reich on countries in occupied Europe raised by a Jewish pressure group,  and it has been pointed out that in disputed legislation the proper procedure is to refer back to the debates and discussions at the time of drafting the legislation, in order to see clearly what was intended. (''reference later'').  Those countries that are signatories to the Convention and retain effective bans today are not abiding by the convention.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], adopted in 1953, included sections on religious freedom that in the preliminary discussions, referred specifically to religious ritual slaughter bans.&lt;ref name=inra&gt;[http://www.inra.fr/internet/Departements/ESR/publications/cahiers/pdf/bergeaud.pdf New challenges for Islamic ritual slaughtering: a European perspective, F. Bergeaud-Blackler]&lt;br /&gt;pages 9–10 "Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland as well as six Austrian provinces allow no exemption to pre-mortem stunning of the animal. Conversely, this exemption is granted in France, UK, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Conditions for exemption are not always the same in all countries. For instance, in Spain exemptions only apply to sheep and goats but not to cattle."&lt;br /&gt;page 14 "Eventually, in 2002, the German constitutional court granted to a Muslim butcher the right to slaughter without stunning similarly to Jewish butchers"{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (1953) provides for a right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion which includes the freedom to manifest a religion or belief in, ''inter alia'', practice and observance, subject only to such restrictions as are "in accordance with law"{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and "necessary in a democratic society."&lt;ref&gt;Renucci, Jean-François. "Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights." ''Freedom of Thought, Conscience and Religion. Council of Europe'' (2005). p.5&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Further EU legislation ===
The [[European Union]] directive, "European Convention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter" (1998), generally requires stunning before slaughter, but allows member states to allow exemptions for religious slaughter: "Each Contracting Party may authorize derogations from the provisions concerning prior stunning in the following cases: – slaughtering in accordance with religious rituals...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/references/slaughter/jour137_en.pdf Official Journal of the European Union L 137, 02/06/1988 p. 0027 – 0038] "European Convention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter"&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, some member states have banned unstunned ritual slaughter, while others have not. Meat from unstunned animals can be freely exported and imported between member states. There is no EU legal requirement for meat from unstunned animals to be labelled as such, and EU-wide proposals for mandatory labelling have been strongly resisted. This leads to confusion amongst consumers, who often cannot know whether certain products are the result of unstunned ritual slaughter.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2012/120375/LDM_BRI(2012)120375_REV2_EN.pdf |title=Religious slaughter of animals in the EU |author=Christopher Needham |work=Library Briefing |publisher=European Parliament |date=15 November 2012 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) recommended in 2004 that "due to the serious animal welfare concerns associated with slaughter without stunning, pre-cut stunning should always be performed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blokhuis |first=et al. |date=15 June 2004 |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare on a request from the Commission related to welfare aspects of the main systems of stunning and killing the main commercial species of animals |url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2004.45 |journal=The EFSA Journal |publisher=[[European Food Safety Authority]] |volume=45 |issue= |pages=2 |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 22 June 2009 EU Slaughter Regulation, approved by the EU Agriculture Council, allowed religious slaughter without stunning to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/2009/07/new-hit-and-miss-eu-slaughter-regulation |title=New hit-and-miss EU Slaughter Regulation |publisher=[[Compassion in World Farming]] |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===
In February 2014, [[Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries (Denmark)|Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries]] [[Dan Jørgensen]] signed a regulation which banned ritual slaughter of animals without prior stunning.&lt;ref name="Denmark"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/english/Animal/AnimalWelfare/Slaughter_of_animals/Pages/default.aspx |title=Welfare at slaughter |date=February 19, 2014 |publisher=Danish Veterinary and Food Administration|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, religious groups could file for an exemption to the law that required stunning if they wanted to slaughter without prior stunning, although no groups had applied for such exemption. At the time, all halal slaughter in Denmark was performed with prior stunning, while kosher slaughter (which does not allow stunning) had not been practiced in Denmark since around 2004, all kosher meat being imported. In spite of this, the Muslim and Jewish Communities in Denmark strongly opposed the decree, arguing that it constituted an infringement upon religious freedom.&lt;ref name = HuffPost&gt;Nelson, Sarah C.

=== Finland ===
Finland's law on slaughter dates from the 1930s and allows post-stunning thereby permitting kosher slaughter and providing certain legislative protection for some forms of Muslim slaughter. Dhabhiha (halal slaughter) is practised in Finland, but there are not sufficient resources for Jewish slaughter, and all kosher meat is imported.&lt;ref&gt;Berman ''Shehitah'' 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Åland]] the law prohibits bleeding to death unless animals have been previously stunned or directly killed.&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt;

Paragraph 4 of the 1934 Act (enacted April 14, 1934), reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is forbidden to slaughter a domestic animal in any other way, except to render the animal insensible immediately before bleeding. ''Whenever religious reasons so demand'', let it be allowed by the Ministry of Agriculture, in such a way, that the animal is rendered insensible immediately after the arteries have been swiftly cut, but in such a case the veterinarian of the institution must be present personally to supervise the slaughtering&lt;ref name="Finland1934"&gt;No 163. Statute for the Protection of Domestic  Animals,'' Par. 4, "Suomen Asetuskokoelma," 1934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During 1996, the debate over the practice of shechita (Jewish religious slaughter of animals) in Finland continued. Although a motion to pass a law prohibiting shechita (on animal rights grounds) was defeated in December 1995, thereby allowing the practice to continue in Finland (on the condition that the slaughtering takes place simultaneously with a stunning blow), parties opposed to shehitah were not satisfied. The debate has spanned several years, became an election issue during the 1995 general election and often took on an unpleasant tone, as the proponents of the ban (some of whom were politicians) equated shehitah with female circumcision and mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive1/finland/index.htm |title=Antisemitism and Xenophobia Today |access-date=3 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027082047/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive1/finland/index.htm |archive-date=27 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Ritual slaughter is permitted, with some restrictions.&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt;

In ''Jewish Liturgical Association Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France'', 27 June 2000,&lt;ref name=JewishLiturgical&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=696615&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Jewish Liturgical Association Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France], [[European Court of Human Rights]], No. 27417/95, 27 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; (App No. 27417/95) the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] interpreted Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in a case involving a lawsuit by [[Glatt kosher]] slaughterers against a French law recognizing a non-Glatt association (the ACIP) as having the exclusive right to conduct Jewish ritual slaughter in France.
The Court stated that ritual slaughter is a practice covered by the Article 9's guarantee of the right to manifest religious observance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not contested that ritual slaughter, as indeed its name indicates, constitutes a rite or "rite"...whose purpose is to provide Jews with meat from animals slaughtered in accordance with religious prescriptions, which is an essential aspect of practice of the Jewish religion...It follows that the applicant association can rely on Article 9 of the Convention with regard to the French authorities' refusal to approve it, since ritual slaughter must be considered to be covered by a right guaranteed by the Convention, namely the right to manifest one's religion in observance, within the meaning of Article 9.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court then clarified the scope of Article 9, holding that it applies only to restrictions which would prevent consumers from being able to obtain ritually slaughtered meat:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Court's opinion, there would be interference with the freedom to manifest one's religion only if the illegality of performing ritual slaughter made it impossible for ultra-orthodox Jews to eat meat from animals slaughtered in accordance with the religious prescriptions they considered applicable. But that is not the case. It is not contested that the applicant association can easily obtain supplies of "glatt" meat in Belgium. Furthermore, it is apparent from the written depositions and bailiffs' official reports produced by the interveners that a number of butcher's shops operating under the control of the ACIP make meat certified "glatt" by the Beth Din available to Jews.&lt;ref name="JewishLiturgical"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, under the Court of Human Rights' interpretation (not unanimous) of the European Convention on Human Rights in the Cha'are Shalom case, restrictions on ritual slaughter are permissible, but only if they do not prevent religious adherents from obtaining religiously slaughtered meat.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Germany ===
On January 15, 2002 the [[German Federal Constitutional Court]] held that the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides a broader guarantee of human rights in the area of religious freedom than the European Convention on Human Rights. In an appeal by a Turkish citizen who practiced Islamic ritual slaughter, the German court struck down Germany's former ban on ritual slaughter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1761846.stm BBC News Tuesday, 15 January, 2002 ''German court ends Muslim slaughter ban'']&lt;/ref&gt; holding that the German Basic Law's guarantee of religious freedom prohibited the German government from applying a law requiring stunning prior to slaughter to observant Muslims who practice ritual slaughter for religious reasons, and that the Basic Law's guarantee of religious freedom applies to slaughterers as well as consumers of meat.&lt;ref name=GermanCourt&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/decisions/rs20020115_1bvr178399en.html 1 BvR 1783/99 of 01/15/2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612114942/https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/decisions/rs20020115_1bvr178399en.html |date=12 June 2007 }}, [[German Federal Constitutional Court]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GermanVets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3474409,00.html |title=Halal, Kosher Slaughter Unacceptable, say German Vets &amp;#124; Germany &amp;#124; DW.DE &amp;#124; 10.07.2008 |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=10 July 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The German court held that under Article 2.1 of the German Basic Law, religious slaughterers have a distinct fundamental right to practice a religiously-recognized vocation. It also explained that merely permitting importation of ritually slaughtered meat is inadequate to protect the religious rights of individuals under Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the German Basic Law (Constitution) because personal contact is important to ensuring compliance with religious requirements. It held that an exemption from laws that conflicted with this was therefore mandated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that the consumption of imported meat makes such renunciation [of meat-eating] dispensable; however, due to the fact that in this case, personal contact with the butcher and the confidence that goes with such contact do not exist, the consumption of imported meat is fraught with the insecurity whether the meat really complies with the commandments of Islam....Under these circumstances, an exemption from the mandatory stunning of warm-blooded animals before their blood is drained cannot be precluded if the intention connected with this exemption is to facilitate, on the one hand, the practice of a profession with a religious character, which is protected by fundamental rights, and, on the other hand, the observation of religious dietary laws by the customers of the person practicing the occupation in question. Without such exemptions, the fundamental rights of those who want to perform slaughter without stunning as their occupation would be unreasonably restricted, and the interests of the protection of animals would, without a sufficient constitutional justification, be given priority in a one-sided manner.&lt;ref name="GermanCourt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Latvia ===
[[Latvia]] legalised ritual slaughter in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alhalal.eu/ Al Halal.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; Halal meat products are exported to Sweden and animals are slaughtered using post-cut stunning.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

Ritual slaughter is permitted, and regulated by a special convention concerning ritual slaughter.&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt;
The [[Party for the Animals]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Partij voor de Dieren''; PvdD)  was voted into the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Dutch Parliament's Lower House]] with two MPs in 2006, increased to 6 MPs in 2017. Their election program had been to introduce an effective ban on ritual slaughter: Jewish shechita and Muslim dhabiha. The bill was passed in the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament with 116 votes to 30. Debate over the matter swiftly became a focus of animosity towards the [[Netherlands]]' 1.2 million-strong Muslim community.{{verification needed|date=March 2014}} The country's Jewish population is comparatively small at 50,000.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Following months of debate a last-minute concession was offered - the Muslim and Jewish communities would have a year to provide evidence that animals slaughtered by traditional methods do not experience greater pain than those that are stunned before they are killed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13947163 BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Sacks|Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks]] visited the Netherlands in May 2011 to lobby against the ban, arguing that pre-stunning failed in up to 10 percent of cases and that caused more pain than the swift cutting of the throat by a razor-sharp knife. He blamed the vote on "a mischievous campaign by the animal rights lobby, based on emotive images and questionable science."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Only the [[Party for Freedom|Freedom Party]] of [[Geert Wilders]], the Socialist Party, and the Animal Party wanted to forbid ritual slaughter in The Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Since 1 January 2018, a new regulation has been implemented that animals must lose consciousness within 40 seconds, otherwise stunning is required. Rumours spread that some Islamic abbatoirs had started to stun animals before the cut, prompting conservative Muslims in July to raise concerns whether the meat would still be halal. The Utrecht Mosques Partnership called for a boycott of all Dutch meat during [[Eid al-Adha]] in August, forsaking the traditional sacrifice. They recommended having an animal sacrificed abroad and the meat imported until the availability of what they consider 'halal' meat within the Netherlands can be guaranteed. However, the Associations of Imams in the Netherlands (VIN) criticised the move, stressing the importance of ritual sacrifice in Islam, and saying the boycott 'violated divine law'.&lt;ref name="Rubio"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/deel-nederlandse-moslims-wil-offerfeest-boycotten~ab42e859/ |title=Deel Nederlandse moslims wil offerfeest boycotten |author=Abdel Ilah Rubio |work=Algemeen Dagblad |date=13 July 2018 |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
[[Poland]] banned slaughter of non-stunned animals in January, 2013, thus losing to neighbouring countries, such as [[Lithuania]], an annual half-a-billion [[euro]] export trade to [[Israel]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]] and other Muslim-majority nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krakowpost.com/article/6918''Ritual Slaughter Continues in Krakow Despite Ban'' Krakow Post, August 16, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was made by animal rights activists that kosher slaughter represented cruelty to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kosher Slaughter Ban Kills $1.3B Poland Industry - Breaking News|url = http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/181010/kosher-slaughter-ban-kills-13b-poland-industry/|website = The Forward|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal developments were complex, involving a government amendment to a law requiring all animals to be stunned prior to slaughter. The amendment allowed an exception to protect the religious freedoms of Poland's tiny Jewish and Muslim communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

After pressure from animal rights groups, the [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Court]] quashed the amendment on the grounds that it is not permissible to amend a law so that the original intention of the law is contradicted. In December 2014, the Polish Constitutional Court overturned the ban on kosher and halal slaughter since the protection of animals "does not take priority over constitutional guarantees of religious freedom," with Judge [[:pl:Maria Gintowt-Jankowicz|Maria Gintowt-Jankowicz]] stating in her final verdict that "the constitution guarantees the freedom of religion which includes the carrying out of all activities, practices, rites and rituals which have a religious character."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/213527-polish-ban-kosher-halal-slaughter/ ''Polish ban on kosher and halal slaughter overturned'' RT December 11, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PolandBBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30412551 ''Polish ban on kosher slaughter of animals is overturned'' BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovenia ===
In 2012, Slovenia amended its Animal Welfare Act to ban all forms of ritual slaughter.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; A group of Muslims requested the Constitutional Court to review the law, arguing unstunned ritual slaughter was a key part of the Islamic religion and therefore protected by the freedom of religion. However, the Court unanimously upheld the Act in 2018, stating that 'the Constitution did not allow easily preventable suffering to be inflicted on animals without a justified cause', and that this provision did 'not disproportionally interfere' with religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.total-slovenia-news.com/news/1303-slovenia-s-constitutional-court-rules-ban-on-halal-slaughter-legal |title=Slovenia's Constitutional Court Rules Ban on Halal Slaughter Legal |work=Total Slovenia News |date=24 May 2018 |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
Animal welfare is controlled under the provisions of the ''Animal Welfare Act 32/2007, of November 7th''. Article 6 of the act concerns slaughter of animals, including ritual slaughter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the slaughter of animals is carried out according to the rites of Churches, religious denominations or communities registered in the Register of Religious Entities,&lt;ref&gt;Organic Law 7/1980 of July 5, Liberty Religious, Art. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the stunning requirements are inconsistent with the rules of the respective religious rite, the competent authorities will not demand the compliance with such requirements provided that the procedure is carried out within the limits referred to in Article 3 of the ''Organic Law no. 7 of 5 July 1980 on Religious Freedom''. In any case, the slaughter according to whatever religious rite shall be carried out under the supervision and according to the instructions of the official veterinarian. The slaughterhouse shall notify the competent authority that it will carry out this kind of slaughter in order to have it registered for this purpose, without prejudice to the authorisation provided for in the European Community legislation.&lt;ref name="Spain2007"&gt;{{es icon}} {{Cite web |url=http://www.animallaw.info/nonus/statutes/stesawl2007.htm |title=Ley 32/2007, de 7 de noviembre, para el cuidado de los animales, en su explotación, transporte, experimentación y sacrificio |publisher=Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center |accessdate=22 June 2018 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Unstunned religious slaughter is legal in the UK. However, its legality is hotly debated by various religious and political groups and individuals. Both Muslims and non-Muslims, Jews and non-Jews are divided over the question whether meat from stunned animals is to be considered halal or kosher, and thus whether a ban on unstunned slaughter would or would not constitute a violation of the religious freedom of those Jews and Muslims who claim to have a right to consume meat from unstunned animals. Meanwhile, some animal welfare activists and groups argue that slaughter should be banned entirely, regardless of alleged justification.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31411219 |title=Should religious slaughter be banned in the UK? |author=Caroline Wyatt |work=BBC News |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC), which advises the British government on how to avoid cruelty to livestock, stated the way Jewish Kosher and Muslim Halal meat is produced causes severe suffering to animals, and recommend the British government to ban Jewish and Muslim ritual slaughter (shechita and dhabihah).&lt;ref name="FAWC"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2977086.stm |title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end' |work=BBC News |date=10 June 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government rejected FAWC's advice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} This elicited responses from shechita uk, and from Dr S.

He claimed that cutting an animal's throat "instantly" renders an animal "insensible to pain and unconscious", while on the other hand "pre-stunning fails to stun in between 9 and 31% of cases, depending on which animal welfare charity you go to", attributing the 9% figure to the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]].&lt;ref name="Today2014"/&gt;{{rp|at=4:13}} Blackwell retorted that there is strong scientific evidence that, depending on the species, the animal remains conscious after the throat cut for an average of 7 seconds in [[sheep]] to up to 2 minutes in [[cattle]], which is "unacceptable from a welfare point of  view".&lt;ref name="Today2014"/&gt;{{rp|at=5:02}} Some Muslim and Jewish commentators accused Blackwell and his supporters of anti-Muslim or anti-Semitic prejudice, but Blackwell insisted that he respected religious beliefs and that "the Danish unilateral banning [was done] purely for animal welfare reasons, which is right". Numerous animal welfare societies backed Blackwell's position. [[National Secular Society]] campaigner Stephen Evans argued that the scientific consensus was clear that stunning was better for animal welfare, and that it was "therefore both reasonable and appropriate to suggest that, unless religious communities can agree on more humane slaughter methods, their right to religious freedom should, in this instance, be limited in the interests of animal welfare."&lt;ref name="NSS2014"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2014/03/leading-vet-calls-for-an-end-to-religious-slaughter |title=Leading vet calls for an end to religious slaughter |publisher=National Secular Socety |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day the controversy began on 6 April 2014, it was reported that about 80 to 85% of halal meat produced by the Muslim community in the United Kingdom was pre-stunned.&lt;ref name="NSS2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Today2014"/&gt;{{rp|at=3:38}} However, the percentage of unstunned slaughtered animals within the British halal meat industry grew by around 60% in the ten months after this controversy began, following a Muslim campaign to change the practice.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11378667/Sharp-rise-in-halal-abattoirs-slaughtering-animals-without-stunning-them-first.html |title=Sharp rise in halal abattoirs slaughtering animals without stunning them first |author=Bill Gardner |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=29 January 2015 |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The debate on Jewish religious slaughter in Norway first evolved in the animal protection movement in the late 1890s, but did not become a public matter until the Jews of Norway's capital Kristiania (now Oslo) were forced by the city authorities to abandon the practice of kosher slaughter (shehitah) within the city borders in 1913. From that moment and until the law prohibiting the practice on a national level was adopted by the Norwegian parliament on the 12th of June 1929, the debate made the headlines on several occasions in Norwegian newspapers in the interwar years. Hundreds of articles, letters and editorials discussed the case which was known as the «Schächtning-affair».1 The issue received especially much attention from the nationalist right-wing of the Agrarian movement, and the Jewish slaughter practice became subject to a massive campaign from the Agrarian press and from Agrarian party members of parliament. In its final phase during the 1920s, many of the critics were also heavily influenced by the modern anti-Semitic ideology that had evolved in Germany since the late 1870s. One of the most quoted statements from the debate was made by the Agrarian MP, and later prime minister Jens Hunseid (1883-1965) during the conclusive parliamentary session on June 12, 1929: «We have no obligation to deliver our domestic animals to the cruelties of the Jews, we have not invited the Jews to this country, and we have no obligation to provide the Jews animals to their religious orgies»."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Snildal ''Anti-Semitism without Hatred? The Animal Protection Movement and the Semantics of Kosher Slaughter in Norway 1895-1913''&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway copied the Swiss campaign to ban ritual slaughter. The same arguments were presented as in the Swiss campaign and an appeal was made by the Jewish community to the Norwegian parliament not to introduce the legislation. After the ban was introduced, Norwegian Jews imported kosher meat from Sweden until it was banned there too.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the 1890s, protests were raised in the Norwegian press against the practice of shechita. The Jewish community responded to these objections by assuring the public that the method was in fact humane. Efforts to ban shechita put sincere humane society activists in league with [[Antisemitism in Norway|antisemitic]] individuals. Those opposing the ban included [[Fridtjof Nansen]], but the division on the issue crossed party lines in all mainstream parties, except [[Senterpartiet|the Farmer's Party]], which was principled in its opposition to schechita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Per Ola|authorlink=|coauthors=|editor=|others=|title=Oss selv nærmest|year=1984|month=|url=http://www.jus.uio.no/ikrs/tjenester/kunnskap/kriminalpolitikk/aktuelt/Tema/jodeforfolgelse/ossselvnaermest_hele.pdf|accessdate=|edition=|series=|volume=|date=|publisher=Gyldendal Norsk Forlag|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=8205150621|oclc=|doi=|id=|pages=64–68|chapter=Korstoget mot schächtningen|chapterurl=|quote=}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Food Health regulations were controversial, especially the stunning requirement, as they would lead to a fundamental change in the meat producing market. A committee was commissioned on February 11, 1927 that consulted numerous experts and visited a slaughterhouse in Copenhagen. Its majority favored the changes and found support in the Department of Agriculture and the parliamentary agriculture committee. Those who opposed a ban spoke of religious tolerance, and also claimed that schechita was no more inhumane than other slaughter methods. [[Carl Joachim Hambro (politician)|C J Hambro]] was one of those most appalled by the discussion, claiming that "where animal rights are protected to an exaggerated extent, it usually is done with the help of human sacrifice"&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=September 2012|didn't he say: let's not make the statement true that...}}

=== Switzerland ===
{{Further information|Animal welfare and rights in Switzerland}}
The Swiss banned unstunned slaughter in [[Swiss animal protection referendum, 1893|1893 after a plebiscite]] so that a law requiring stunning prior to blood letting (exsanguination) was included in the Swiss Constitution. This required every abbatoir to stun animals before slaughter, including Jewish and Islamic ones. The plebiscite had been preceded by a long anti-Semitic campaign, in which Jews were supported by Catholics, who had suffered under [[Otto von Bismarck]] in his anti-Catholic ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Catholic priests gave sermons encouraging their parishioners to vote against the effective ban, and the results of the referendum showed that French-speaking Cantons had voted against the ban, but German-speaking Protestant cantons that had voted for the ban.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Switzerland, a ban on kosher slaughter has been enforced since 1897, when the people supported this measure through a referendum with clear anti-Semitic undertones. At the time, Jews had recently been granted full civil rights and some Swiss citizens feared an invasion of Jewish migrants from Eastern Europe, who they considered to be unassimilable, foreign, and unreliable. By banning the performance of a core Jewish ritual, the Swiss people found a disguised way to limit the immigration of Jews into Switzerland.&lt;ref name=Modiya&gt;[http://modiya.nyu.edu/handle/1964/489 Anti-Shechita], Modiya, 2004?, accessed September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour "Ritual slaughter (the bleeding to death of animals that have not first been stunned) was made illegal in the country in 1893; however, a 1978 Law on the Protection of Animals explicitly allows for the importation of kosher and halal meat. Imported from France and Germany, this meat is available in the country at comparable prices. In 2003, a popular initiative to protect animal rights and prohibit the import of meat from animals bled without stunning was filed; in December 2005, however, the sponsors withdrew their initiative before it had been submitted to a national vote after Parliament adopted a revision of the Law on the Protection of Animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SwitzerlandInternational Religious Freedom Report 2006|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71411.htm|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss Federation of Jewish Communities (SIG), founded in 1904, regards the 1893 ban on unstunned slaughter as antisemitic.&lt;ref name="Aebischer"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.jta.org/2017/08/16/news-opinion/world/swiss-lawmakers-to-vote-on-banning-import-of-kosher-halal-meat |title=Swiss lawmakers to vote on banning import of kosher, halal meat |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=16 August 2017 |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a backlash against a proposal to lift the ban in 2002. "In 2002, when the Swiss government attempted to lift the century-old ban, animal rights activists, political groups (on the left and the right), and unaffiliated citizens expressed strong opposition. They called shechita practice a "barbaric" and "sanguinary", an "archaic tradition from the time of the ghettos", and asked Jews to either become vegetarian or leave the country."&lt;ref name=Modiya/&gt;

In June 2017, MP Matthias Aebischer ([[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]]) proposed a bill to ban the import of meat from animals that have undergone ritual slaughter. The bill also included a ban on [[foie gras]], which is [[Foie gras controversy|controversial]] because it is produced by forcefeeding geese which is widely considered cruel, despite being popular amongst especially French-speaking Swiss.&lt;ref name="Aebischer"/&gt;

The United States is one of the countries that has legislation for protection of shechita (Jewish) and dhabihah (Muslim) ritual slaughter.
The [[Humane Slaughter Act]] defines ritual slaughter as one of two humane methods of slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd7usca1901.htm] 7 U.S.C.A. § 1902. Humane methods&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1958 the United States has prohibited the shackling and hoisting of cattle without stunning them first.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In [[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]] 508 U.S. 520 (1993), the [[United States Supreme Court]] struck down a ban imposed by the City of [[Hialeah, Florida]], on [[Santería]] religious animal sacrifices practiced by the Church as contravening the religious freedoms guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[Constitution of the United States]]. While the City of Hialeah claimed that its ban on ritual slaughter "not for the primary purpose of food consumption" was motivated by concerns for animal welfare and public health, the Supreme Court held that ample evidence showed that it was in fact motivated by animosity to the Santería religion and a desire to suppress it:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the ordinances were enacted "'because of,' not merely 'in spite of'", their suppression of Santería religious practice is revealed by the events preceding enactment of the ordinances. The minutes and taped excerpts of the June 9 session, both of which are in the record, evidence significant hostility exhibited by residents, members of the city council, and other city officials toward the Santería religion and its practice of animal sacrifice. The public crowd that attended the June 9 meetings interrupted statements by council members critical of Santería with cheers and the brief comments of Pichardo with taunts. When Councilman Martinez, a supporter of the ordinances, stated that in pre-revolution Cuba "people were put in jail for practicing this religion", the audience applauded. Other statements by members of the city council were in a similar vein. For example, Councilman Martinez, after noting his belief that Santería was outlawed in Cuba, questioned, "if we could not practice this [religion] in our homeland [Cuba], why bring it to this country?" Councilman Cardoso said that Santería devotees at the Church "are in violation of everything this country stands for." Various Hialeah city officials made comparable comments. The chaplain of the Hialeah Police Department told the city council that Santería was a sin, "foolishness", "an abomination to the Lord", and the worship of "demons." He advised the city council that "We need to be helping people and sharing with them the truth that is found in Jesus Christ." He concluded: "I would exhort you . . . not to permit this Church to exist." The city attorney commented that Resolution 87-66 indicated that "This community will not tolerate religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens...." Similar comments were made by the deputy city attorney. This history discloses the object of the ordinances to target animal sacrifice by Santería worshippers because of its religious motivation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In sum, the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion. The pattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santería adherents and their religious practices; the ordinances by their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of the ordinances were gerrymandered with care to proscribe religious killings of animals but to exclude almost all secular killings; and the ordinances suppress much more religious conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimate ends asserted in their defense. These ordinances are not neutral, and the court below committed clear error in failing to reach this conclusion{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court also found that the city's proffered reasons for its ban simply did not explain or justify it.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Respondent claims that [the ordinances] advance two interests: protecting the public health and preventing cruelty to animals. The ordinances are underinclusive for those ends. They fail to prohibit non religious conduct that endangers these interests in a similar or greater degree than Santería sacrifice does. The underinclusion is substantial, not inconsequential. Despite the city's proffered interest in preventing cruelty to animals, the ordinances are drafted with care to forbid few killings but those occasioned by religious sacrifice. Many types of animal deaths or kills for nonreligious reasons are either not prohibited or approved by express provision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Temple Grandin]], who is both an animal welfare activist and the leading American designer of commercial slaughterhouses, has outlined techniques for humane ritual slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/ritual/rec.ritual.slaughter.html Temple Grandin, "Recommended Ritual Slaughter Practices"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/137318/maximizing-animal-welfare-in-kosher-slaughter/ Maximizing animal welfare in kosher slaughter. Temple Grandin]&lt;/ref&gt; She considers shackling and hoisting of animals for slaughter to be inhumane, and has developed alternative approaches usable in production plants. Grandin has coordinated this with the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of the [[Conservative movement in the United States]], and in 2000 the Committee voted to accept her approach, ruling that "Now that kosher, humane slaughter using upright pens is both possible and widespread, we find shackling and hoisting to be a violation of Jewish laws forbidding cruelty to animals and requiring that we avoid unnecessary dangers to human life. As the CJLS, then, we rule that shackling and hoisting should be stopped."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/ritual/conservative.jewish.law.html "Shackling and Hoisting", The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative movement. The Rabbinical Assembly, New York, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an investigation by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], undercover video was obtained of kosher slaughtering practices at a major kosher slaughterhouse run by [[Agriprocessors]] in [[Postville, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goveg.com/feat/agriprocessors PETA investigation of Agriprocessors, with video]&lt;/ref&gt; The methods used there involved clamping the animals into a box which is then inverted for slaughter, followed by partial dismemberment of the animal before it was dead. Those methods have been condemned as unnecessarily cruel by PETA and others, including Grandin and the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, but are endorsed by the [[Orthodox Union]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.org/other/5765/shechita2-65.htm "Orthodox Union Statement of Rabbis and Certifying Agencies on Recent Publicity on Kosher Slaughter"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20041214171347/http://www.ou.org/other/5765/shechita2-65.htm |date=2004-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which supervises the slaughterhouse. An investigation by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] resulted in some minor operational changes. A lawsuit under Iowa law is pending. Grandin's comment was "I thought it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, and I had never ever seen that kind of procedure done before. ...
I've seen kosher slaughter really done right, so the problem here is not kosher slaughter. The problem here is a plant that is doing everything wrong they can do wrong".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goveg.com/feat/agriprocessors/experts-Grandin.asp "Statement of Dr. Temple Grandin, Consultant to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the American Meat Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the Orthodox Union, Temple Grandin and Agriprocessors had reportedly resolved their problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.org/news/article/prof_grandin_is_satisfied_with_agriprocessors_slaughter_practices Prof. Grandin is Satisfied With AgriProcessors Slaughter Practices]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, though, Grandin reported that Agriprocessors had again become "sloppy" in their slaughter operation and was "in the bottom 10%" of slaughterhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Agriprocessors faced accusations of mistreatment of cattle, pollution, and a series of alleged violations of labor law. In May 2008, the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) staged a [[Postville Raid|raid]] of the plant, and arrested nearly 400 illegal immigrant workers. Agriprocessors plants stopped operating in October 2008, and the firm filed for bankruptcy on November 5 of the same year. Sholom Rubashkin as the highest ranking day-to-day [[corporate officer]] was charged with federal [[financial crimes|financial fraud]] and sentenced to 27 years in prison in June 2010.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The Agriprocessors plant was bought at auction in July 2009 by SHF Industries and has resumed production under the new name ''Agri Star''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Image:Laszlo Harasztosi with Laszlo Fekete.jpg|thumb|László Harasztosi at breaking the Guinness record]]
'''László Harasztosi''', also known as '''Lazlo Hypnotist''', is a [[psychic]], [[bioenergy|bioenergeticist]], and [[alternative medicine|alternative medicine practitioner]]. His speciality is attaching metal objects on human bodies. When breaking the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness record]] in 1998, he placed two disks weighing altogether 57,64&amp;nbsp;kg (127&amp;nbsp;lbs) on [[László Fekete (strongman)|László Fekete]]’s chest (the strongest man of Hungary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feketelaszlo.hu/en/home.htm László Fekete’s website (English version)]&lt;/ref&gt;). 

His activity consists of healing, performances in shows, and preparation of sportspeople. Cosmos Church of Universal Love was founded with his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{hu}} [[:hu:Kozmosz Univerzális Szeretet Egyház|Cosmos Church of Universal Love]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hu}} [http://www.shp.hu/hpc/web.php?a=druidikusz&amp;o=1097677988 Tamás Szabó votive pastor on Cosmos Church of Universal Love]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hu}} [http://www.bemerterapia.net/egyhazak_abc.html Alphabetical list of churches in Hungary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626093429/http://www.bemerterapia.net/egyhazak_abc.html |date=26 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book titled ''Cosmic energy – how autotherapy works and how to use the healing coin'' was published in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;László Harasztosi (1996).

==Life==
[[Image:Laszlo Harasztosi3.jpg|thumb|Harasztosi László at healing]]
He was born on 28 June 1963, in the Eastern Hungarian village of [[Berettyóújfalu]]. As he stated, his ability was discovered at the age of seven, when they noticed that his touch stops pain and his presence calms down children who have gone wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harasztosi.com/page.php?3 László Harasztosi’s website: Beginning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205042857/http://harasztosi.com/page.php?3 |date=5 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[People's Republic of Hungary|change of regime of 1989]] in Hungary, he had to conceal his abilities for political reasons.

==Activity==
===Improving athletes' achievement===
He claims to regularly charge up chosen athletes with focused cosmic energy, which creates further resources for them, enabling them to achieve better results, increase endurance, make their [[muscle]]s more flexible, shorten [[reaction time]] and recovery time.&lt;ref name="sport"&gt;[http://www.harasztosi.com/page.php?5 László Harasztosi’s website: Sport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205042924/http://harasztosi.com/page.php?5 |date=5 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harasztosi.com/page.php?23 A special kind of preparation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194932/http://www.harasztosi.com/page.php?23 |date=4 October 2011 }} – article by Eurosport on László Harasztosi's way to recharge sportspeople ([http://www.hu.eurosport.com/eurosport/sport_sto1501646.shtml original Hungarian version])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychic shows===
[[Image:Laszlo Harasztosi show.jpg|thumb|László Harasztosi attaching objects]]
* Attachment of tools: attaching cutlery or domestic appliances (e.g. an iron) on volunteers’ bare torsos.
* [[Folie à deux|Mass psychosis]] and [[hypnosis]]: with his "mental energy", he sticks chosen people to their seats or makes them stand up despite their will, or he makes them fall from a standing position even if they are not present in the room. On his command, the participants will imitate various sounds, they will sing, or speak about a topic specified by him.

He appeared in Hungary in the programme ''Esti Showder'' by [[RTL Klub]], among other programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{hu}} [http://www.showder.hu/n/cikk.php?157&amp;2&amp;2 Report about his appearance in Esti Showder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721112655/http://www.showder.hu/n/cikk.php?157&amp;2&amp;2 |date=21 July 2011 }} (showder.hu)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hu}} [http://www.harasztosi.hu/page.php?10 Video recording of Fábry Show] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011112032/http://www.harasztosi.hu/page.php?10 |date=11 October 2008 }}, [http://www.harasztosi.com/page.php?9 pictures of Fábry Show in the Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205042933/http://harasztosi.com/page.php?9 |date=5 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Skeletal muscle.png|thumb|250px|[[Muscle]] fibres may be "microtorn" during microtrauma]]

Microtrauma can include the microtearing of muscle fibres, the sheath around the [[muscle]] and the [[connective tissue]]. It can also include stress to the [[tendon]]s, and to the [[bone]]s (see [[Wolff's law]]). It is unknown whether or not the [[ligament]]s adapt like this. Microtrauma to the skin (compression, impact, abrasion) can also cause increases in a skin's thickness, as seen from the [[callus]]es formed from running barefoot or the hand calluses that result from rock climbing. This might be due to increased skin cell replication at sites under stress where cells rapidly slough off or undergo compression or abrasion.

Most microtrauma cause a low level of [[inflammation]] that cannot be seen or felt. These injuries can arise in muscle, ligament, vertebrae, and discs, either singly or in combination. Repetitive microtrauma which are not allowed time to heal can result in the development of more serious conditions.

== Negative effects ==
[[Back pain]] can develop gradually as a result of microtrauma brought about by repetitive activity over time. Because of the slow and progressive onset of this internal injury, the condition is often ignored until the [[symptoms]] become [[Acute (medical)|acute]], often resulting in disabling [[injury]]. Acute back injuries can arise from stressful lifting techniques done without adequate recovery, especially when experimenting with more ballistic work, or work where the extensor spinae are stressed during spinal flexion when much of the load is commonly taken up by the slower to heal ligaments which may not adapt progressively to the stress. While the acute injury may seem to be caused by a single well-defined incident, it may have been preventable or lessened if not for the years of injury to the musculoskeletal support mechanism by repetitive microtrauma.

== Positive effects ==
After microtrauma from stress (such as lifting weights) to muscles, they can be rebuilt and overcompensate to reduce the likeliness of re-injury.

The '''Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959''' were agreed between the polluting [[Chisso]] company and representative groups of fishermen and Minamata disease patients who had been affected by mercury pollution. The agreements and their formation shared a number of common characteristics. They were formulated outside the legal system, by ad-hoc mediation committees specially established for the purpose. Members of the committees and the final agreements were weighted in favour of Chisso and all included punitive clauses that the groups could make no future claims for compensation against the company.

== Compensation of fishermen ==

Ever since 1908 when Chisso opened the factory in Minamata wastewater had been dumped into the seas around Minamata, particularly into [[Minamata Bay]] via the waste canal outlet in [[Hyakken Harbour]]. Damage to fisheries was inevitable and the Minamata Fishing Cooperative had demanded compensation from the company on two occasions previous to the outbreak of Minamata disease. After direct negotiations in 1926 the company agreed to pay "sympathy money" to the cooperative of [[JPY]]1,500 ([[USD]]704). By using the term {{nihongo|"sympathy money"|見舞い金|mimaikin}} the company avoided accepting responsibility for the damage and sought to prevent further claims by including a clause in the agreement that the cooperative would "never again lodge complaints" against Chisso. This pattern of denial of responsibility and the inclusion of punitive clauses repeated itself again and again in Chisso's dealings with complainants. The pollution continued unabated and another agreement was signed in 1943. This time the cooperative was paid [[JPY]]152,500 in compensation for future and past damage to fishing. The cooperative was also forced to acknowledge Chisso's "importance to the prosperity of Minamata" and "the need to cooperate so as not to harm its operations", indicating the unequal nature of the agreement.

===The Minamata Fishing Cooperative===

By the time of the outbreak of Minamata disease the fishing situation had become critical. From 1953 to 1957 the fish catch in Minamata had declined by a staggering 91%.&lt;ref&gt;George, p. 72 - Table 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, the Kumamoto prefectural government had attempted to limit the spread of the disease by banning the ''sale'' of fish caught from Minamata Bay, but did not issue and all-out ban. This left fishermen with fish they could not sell, but no financial assistance to compensate their losses. In September 1958 the '''Minamata Fishing Cooperative''' petitioned the prefecture to ban fishing completely so that their members might be properly compensated under the [[Fisheries Law]] and [[Food Sanitation Act]]. The government did not respond and only advised the fishermen against consumption of the fish and shellfish they caught from the bay. However, with no source of income, many fishermen were left with no choice but to eat the suspect fish they caught. In fact, throughout the history of the Minamata disease problem, the catching of fish from Minamata Bay has never been legally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;George, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the ban on the sale of contaminated fish, there was still widespread suspicion amongst local people that fish caught in the Minamata area was unsafe and by June 1959 several fish shops had gone out of business from plummeting demand. Desperate, and with no assistance from government, the cooperative was forced into direct negotiations with the company. On 6 August 400 members of the cooperative marched on the factory and in a hostile atmosphere met with factory manager [[Eiichi Nishida]]. The fishermen's demand for the cleanup of Minamata Bay, the installation of wastewater treatment facilities and [[JPY]]100 million ([[USD]]278,000) was met with an offer of "emergency sympathy money" to the value of [[JPY]]500,000 ([[USD]]1,390) and a promise to consult with the company's head office in [[Tokyo]].

Fishermen from the cooperative again forced their way into the factory on 12 August to continue negotiations. No agreement could be reached but the two sides did manage to agree to a joint inspection of fishing conditions in Minamata Bay, followed by further talks on 17 August. After this inspection Chisso admitted that fishing was impossible in some areas and made a final offer of [[JPY]]13 million ([[USD]]36,100). This paltry sum incensed the fishermen. Violence broke out, riot police were called and Nishida and other company employees were effectively held hostage in the factory building. Only after Mayor [[Todomu Nakamura]] agreed to mediate between the two sides did the fishermen leave the factory grounds. The mediation committee formed by Mayor Nakamura was stacked heavily in Chisso's favour and presented a decision on 26 August. The company would pay [[JPY]]20 million ([[USD]]55,600) directly to the cooperative and set up a [[JPY]]15 million ([[USD]]41,700) fund to promote the recovery of fishing. The proposal was qualified with the ultimatum that if either side rejected, the committee would stop mediation completely. On 29 August the fishing cooperative delivered its response: "In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept". The company also agreed and the first compensation agreement between Chisso and fisherman was complete.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp. 76–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives===

To the company's disappointment, this first agreement did not bring an end to problems with fishermen. Since Chisso had switched the wastewater output from Minamata Bay to the mouth of Minamata River in September 1958 the environmental damage had spread even further up and down the [[Shiranui Sea]]. Cats had started to die in [[Ashikita, Kumamoto|Ashikita]] to the north and in [[Izumi, Kagoshima|Izumi]] to the south of Minamata and new Minamata disease patients were also appearing. The pollution was having a widespread effect on fishing catches and fish sales as people's confidence in the safety of their food evaporated. This drove the '''Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives''' to take action of a similar pattern to that taken by the Minamata Fishing Alliance earlier in the year, but on a larger scale. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory demanding direct negotiations with Chisso. When company officials refused, the fishermen forced their way into the factory and attacked the security office, breaking windows and injuring seven guards. Alliance president [[Ushita Murakami]] delivered their demands to company manager [[Eiichi Nishida|Nishida]], who promised a prompt reply. When the response came, the company said that since the factory's waste had still not been proven as the cause of Minamata disease, and it could offer the fishermen nothing.

Unsatisfied, Murakami and followers travelled to Tokyo and met with officials of numerous government departments to outline their plight. He managed to secure a promise from members of the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] that they would visit Minamata to investigate the situation. When the Diet party arrived in Minamata on 2 November they were met by a crowd of 4,000 demonstrators (including fishermen and disease victims groups alike) outside the Municipal Hospital. The crowd was extremely respectful to the Diet members and pleaded with them for help. The members thanked the demonstrators for bringing the issue to the attention of the national government and promised they would do all they could.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Minamata protesters.jpg|thumb|right|Protestors at the gates of the Chisso factory (''[[W. E. Smith]]'')]] --&gt;

Emboldened after their demonstration at the hospital, the alliance fishermen marched on the factory to again demand negotiations. The company refused and the fishermen forced their way in and rioted, attacking many buildings and significantly damaging company property. Riot police arrived and serious fighting continued sporadically for the rest of the day until the fishermen dispersed around 9 pm. Injuries included 30-40 fishermen, two company employees, factory manager Nishida himself, 64 policemen and the chief of police. Damages to company property amounted to [[JPY]]10 million ([[USD]]27,800).&lt;ref&gt;George, pp. 81–101&lt;/ref&gt; Before the riot the Minamata disease issue had been skirted by the national media and had been chiefly a local issue. The violent riot however was covered widely in the national media and for the first time since the discovery of the disease in 1956 the issue of Minamata disease had nationwide coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Ui, Chapter 4 - section V&lt;/ref&gt;

A mediation committee headed by [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] Governor [[Hirosaku Teramoto]] was formed to hammer out a solution. At a meeting on 2 December the prefectural fishing alliance outlined their demands: compensation of [[JPY]]2.5 billion ([[USD]]6.9 million) for damage to fishing since 1953, the temporary closure of the factory and removal of toxic sludge. The committee then met company executives, including Chisso president [[Kiichi Yoshioka]], who responded with an offer that amounted to "nearly zero". After weeks of wrangling the fishing alliance reduced its demands to [[JPY]]980 million ([[USD]]2.7 million) and Chisso, under increasing pressure from all sides, relaxed its position. The proposed agreement (presented with the ultimatum of no further mediation from the committee should it be rejected, as previously) called for the immediate installation of wastewater treatment facilities, [[JPY]]35 million compensation to be paid to the alliance ([[JPY]]10 million of which would be deducted to cover the damage caused in the 2 November riots) and a [[JPY]]65 million fund for the recovery of the fishing industry. The agreement also included a clause that the alliance could never demand further compensation, even if the factory's waste was proven to be the cause of the damage. The agreement was accepted by both sides on 17 December.

== Compensation of victims ==

In 1959, the victims of Minamata disease and their families were in a much weaker position than the fisherman who had extracted at least some "sympathy money" from Chisso. The only patients' organisation present at the time of the fishermen's agreements was the '''Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society''', which had only been established in August 1957. They were much fewer in number (in November 1959 the society only represented the 58 families of 78 patients) and the membership of the society was more divided than the relatively united fishermen. One factor driving the division of the patients was the [[discrimination]] and [[ostracism]] some families were experiencing in the Minamata community. Local people, who were naturally averse to uncleanliness and disease, felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin under the pressure of the various groups making demands of it. Even fishermen, who were fellow victims of the company's pollution, discriminated against disease victims because they were stoking fears that prevented the sale of their fish. To some patients this ostracisim from the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself.

In a similar fashion to the fishermen's associations, the Mutual Aid Society began by petitioning the city and prefectural governments and visited [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]] city on 21 November. When their petitions produced no results, the society approached Chisso directly and demanded compensation of [[JPY]]234 million ([[USD]]650,000) – [[JPY]]3 million ([[USD]]8,300) per person. On 28 November the company replied that the link between the factory's wastewater and Minamata disease had not been proven and could, therefore, offer them nothing but an expression of sympathy. The society began a [[sit-in]] at the company gates, which was to last a whole month.

Around 50 members of the society travelled to Kumamoto on 1 December and made a request to Governor [[Hirosaku Teramoto|Teramoto]] to include the patients' request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. He agreed to consult with the company and when the mediation committee presented its deal to the fishing alliance on 16 December, it also presented a proposal for "sympathy" payments to the Mutual Aid Society, even though no representatives had been present on the mediation committee. The proposal amounted to a total compensation package of [[JPY]]74 million. The money would be allocated to patients certified by a committee to be established by the [[Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] as follows: adult patients would receive [[JPY]]100,000 ([[USD]]278) and children [[JPY]]10,000 ([[USD]]28) per year; families of dead patients would receive a [[JPY]]320,000 ([[USD]]889) payment. Society leader [[Eizō Watanabe]] agreed that the overall level of compensation was acceptable but rejected the plan over the staggered schedule of payments and the very small sum being offered for child victims.

The mediation committee reconvened on 25 December and agreed to increase the child payments to [[JPY]]30,000 ([[USD]]83) per child. The Mutual Aid Society held a vote of its members but the agreement was rejected by a single vote. Society leader Watanabe offered his resignation in protest but when another vote was held on 27 December members accepted the agreement and his resignation was withdrawn. As usual, the agreement did not admit responsibility for Minamata disease. The payments were "sympathy money" and the agreement included a clause that, "Even if in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease ''is'' the factory's wastewater, [the patients] will make absolutely no further demands for compensation", along with an extra clause that, "If in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease is ''not'' the factory's wastewater, the company shall end payments at the end of that month." The final agreement was accepted by both sides on 29 December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Hiroki|date=2018|title=The relation between law and technology in Japan: liability for technology-related mass damage in the cases of Minamata disease, asbestos, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/ref/10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459?scroll=top|journal=Contemporary Japan|volume=30 |issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nhlangano AIDS Training Information and Counseling Center (NATICC)''' is a [[Faith-based organization|faith-based]], non-profit [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] that provides information, training and counseling on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in [[Nhlangano]], [[Swaziland]]. The formation of the organization in 2002 was prompted by the fact that the [[Shiselweni]] region has continued to have high infection rates (42.5% in 2004) as compared to other regions in [[Swaziland]].

NATICC is affiliated to the Free Evangelical Christian Fellowship of Swaziland. It is funded by [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]], and [[Norwegian Church Aid]]. NATICC comprises a team of well-trained HIV/AIDS educators and counselors. The center is based at the Bethesda Mission Station in Nhlangano, but reaches out to the whole of the Shiselweni Region. NATICC is the Voluntary Counseling &amp; Testing (VCT) Center for Nhlangano Town.

Since 2008, the Minister of Health in Swaziland has come from NATICC: first Benedict Xaba (2008-2013) and most recently Sibongile Ndlela-Simelane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mkhonta|first=Starsky|title=Ex-Minister Xaba Graceful in Defeat|url=http://www.dfef.no/files/dfef.no/Documents/Swaziland%20minister.jpg|accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=Swazi Observer|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overnutrition''' or '''hyperalimentation''' is a form of [[malnutrition]] in which the intake of nutrients is oversupplied. The amount of nutrients exceeds the amount required for normal growth, development, and [[metabolism]]. 

The term can also refer to:
* [[Obesity]], which occurs by eating more calories than one burns, as well as:
* Oversupplying a ''specific'' nutrient, such as [[dietary minerals]] or [[vitamin poisoning]]. This is  due to an excessive intake or a nutritional imbalance caused by [[fad diet]]s.

For mineral excess, see:
* [[Iron poisoning]], and
* [[Low sodium diet]] (a response to excess sodium).

Overnutrition may also refer to greater [[food]] consumption than appropriate,&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000050758|hyperalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other feeding procedures such as [[parenteral nutrition]].

==Psychosocial issues on-orbit==
Researchers have conducted two [[NASA]]-funded [[research|international studies]] of [[psychological]] and [[interpersonal]] issues during on-orbit missions to the [[Mir]] and the [[International Space Station]].  Both [[astronaut|crew members]] and [[Mission control center|mission control]] personnel were studied.  The Mir sample involved 13 astronauts and cosmonauts and 58 [[United States|American]] and [[Russia]]n mission control personnel.  The corresponding numbers in the ISS study were 17 space travelers and 128 people on Earth.  Subjects completed a weekly questionnaire that included items from a number of valid and reliable measures that assessed mood and group dynamics. Both studies had similar findings. There was significant evidence for the displacement of tension and negative emotions from the crew members to mission control personnel. The support role of the commander was significantly and positively related to group cohesion among crew members, and both the task and support roles of the team leader were significantly related to cohesion among people in mission control. Crew members scored higher in cultural sophistication than mission control personnel.  Russians reported greater language flexibility than Americans. Americans scored higher on a measure of work pressure than Russians, but Russians reported higher levels of tension on the ISS than Americans. There were no significant changes in levels of emotion and group interpersonal climate over time. Specifically, there was no evidence for a general worsening of mood and cohesion after the halfway point of the missions,&lt;ref name="ASEM-200009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kanas, N. |author2=Salnitskiy, V. |author3=Grund, E.M. |author4=Gushin, V. |author5=Weiss, D.S. |author6=Kozerenko, O. |author7=Sled, A. |author8=Marmar, C.R. |title=Interpersonal and cultural issues involving crews and ground personnel during Shuttle/Mir space missions. |date=September 2000 |work=[[Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine]] |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=A11-6 |pmid=10993303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASEM-200105"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kanas, N. |author2=Salnitskiy, V. |author3=Weiss, D.S. |author4=Grund, E.M. |author5=Gushin, V. |author6=Kozerenko, O. |author7=Sled, A. |author8=Bostrom, A. |author9=Marmar, C.R. |title=Crew member and ground personnel interactions over time during Shuttle/Mir space missions. |date=May 2001 |work=[[Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine]] |volume=72 |pages=453–461 |pmid=11346012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASEM-200706"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kanas, N.A.; Salnitskiy, V.P.; Boyd, J.E.; Gushin, V.I.; Weiss, D.S.; Saylor, S.A.; Kozerenko, O.P.; Marmar, C.R.

[[File:STS132 undocking iss2.jpg|thumb|right|Much has been learned from experiences on the International Space Station about important psychological, interpersonal and psychiatric issues that affect people working on-orbit.  This information should be incorporated in the planning for future expeditionary missions to a near-Earth asteroid or to Mars.]]
Other psychosocial studies involving astronauts and cosmonauts have been conducted.  In one, an analysis of speech patterns as well as [[Subjectivity|subjective]] attitudes and [[Personal value system|personal values]] were measured in both on-orbit space crews and people working in space analog environments.  The researchers found that, over time, these isolated groups showed decreases in the scope and content of their communications and a filtering in what they said to outside personnel, which was termed psychological closing. Crew members interacted less with some mission control personnel than others, perceiving them as opponents.  This tendency of some crew members to become more [[egocentric]] was called autonomization.&lt;ref&gt;Gushin, V.I., Zaprisa, N.S., Kolinitchenko, T.B., Efimov, V.A., Smirnova, T.M., Vinokhodova, A.G., Kanas, N. (1997).  Content analysis of the crew communication with external communicants under prolonged isolation. Aviat., Space, Environ. Med., 68, 1093-1098.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gushin, V.I. (2003).  Problems of distant communication of isolated small groups. Human Physiol., 29, 548-555.&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that crew members became more cohesive by spending time together (for example, joint birthday celebrations),&lt;ref&gt;Gushin. V.I., Pustynnikova, J.M., Smirnova, T.M. (2001).  Interrelations between the small isolated groups with homogeneous and heterogeneous composition. Human Perf. in Extreme Environ., 6, 26-33.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the presence of subgroups and outliers (e.g., scapegoats) negatively affected group cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;Gushin, V.I., Efimov, V.A., Smirnova, T.M., Vinokhodova, A.G, Kanas, N. (1998).  Subject's perception of the crew interaction dynamics under prolonged isolation. Aviat., Space, Environ. Med., 69, 556-561.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of 12 ISS cosmonauts, researchers reported that personal values generally remained stable, with those related to the fulfillment of professional activities and good social relationships being rated most highly.&lt;ref&gt;Vinokhodova, A.G., Gushin, V.I. (2012). Study of values and interpersonal perception in cosmonauts on board of International Space Station.  Paper # IAC-12-A1.1.8.  International Astronautical Federation.  Proceedings, 63rd International Astronautical Congress, Naples, Italy, 1–5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study examined potentially disruptive cultural issues affecting space missions in a survey of 75 astronauts and cosmonauts and 106 mission control personnel.  The subjects rated coordination difficulties between the different [[National space agencies|space organizations]] involved with the missions as the biggest problem.  Other problems included [[communication]] misunderstandings and differences in work management styles.&lt;ref&gt;Tomi, L., Kealey, D., Lange, M., Stefanowska, P., Doyle, V. (2007).  Cross-cultural training requirements for long-duration space missions: Results of a survey of International Space Station astronauts and ground support personnel. Paper delivered at the Human Interactions in Space Symposium, 21 May 2007, Beijing, China.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 11 cosmonauts regarding their opinions of possible psychological and interpersonal problems that might occur during a Mars expedition, researchers found several factors to be rated highly: isolation and monotony, distance-related communication delays with the Earth, leadership issues, differences in space agency management styles, and cultural misunderstandings within international crews.&lt;ref&gt;Nechaev, A.P., Polyakov, V.V., Morukov, B.V. (2007).  Martian manned mission: What cosmonauts think about this. Acta Astronaut., 60, 351-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of 576 employees of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), a link was found between cultural diversity and the ability of people to interact with one another.  Especially important were factors related to leadership and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Sandal, G.M., Manzey, D. (2009).  Cross-cultural issues in space operations: A survey study among ground personnel of the European Space Agency. Acta Astronaut., 65, 1520-1529.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study looked at content analysis of personal journals from ten ISS astronauts that were oriented around a number of issues that had behavioral implications.  Findings included that 88% of the entries dealt with the following categories: Work, Outside Communications, Adjustment, Group Interaction, Recreation/Leisure, Equipment, Events, Organization/Management, Sleep, and Food.  In general, the crew members reported that their life in space was not as difficult as they expected prior to launch, despite a 20% increase in interpersonal problems during the second half of the missions. It was recommended that future crew members be allowed to control their individual schedules as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Stuster, J. (2010).  Behavioral Issues Associated with Long-Duration Space Expeditions: Review and Analysis of Astronaut Journals.  Experiment 01-E104 (Journals): Final Report. NASA/TM-2010-216130.  Houston, Texas: NASA/Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-orbit and post-spaceflight psychiatric issues==
A number of [[psychiatric]] problems have been reported during on-orbit space missions.&lt;ref name=kanas2008/&gt;  Most common are adjustment reactions to the novelty of being in space, with symptoms generally including transient [[anxiety]] or [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. [[Psychosomatic]] reactions also have occurred, where anxiety and other emotional states are experienced physically as somatic symptoms.  Problems related to major mood and thought disorders (e.g., [[manic-depression]], [[schizophrenia]]) have not been reported during space missions.  This likely is due to the fact that crew members have been screened psychiatrically for constitutional predispositions to these conditions before launch, so the likelihood of these illnesses developing on-orbit is low.

Post-mission personality changes and emotional problems have affected some returning space travelers.  These have included anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, and marital readjustment difficulties that in some cases have necessitated the use of [[psychotherapy]] and [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive medications]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldrin, E.E. (1973).  Return to Earth.  New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Some astronauts have had difficulties adjusting to the resultant fame and media demands that followed their missions, and similar problems are likely to occur in the future following high-profile expeditions, such as a trip to Mars.

[[Asthenization]], a syndrome that includes [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[irritability]], [[emotional lability]], [[Attentional control|attention and concentration difficulties]], and [[Appetite loss|appetite]] and [[sleep problems]], has been reported to commonly occur in cosmonauts by Russian flight surgeons.&lt;ref name=myasnikov1986&gt;Myasnikov, V.I., Zamaletdinov, I.S. (1996).  Psychological states and group interactions of crew members in flight.  In: A.E. Nicogossian, S.R. Mohler, O.G. Gazenko, A.I. Grigoriev, eds.  Space Biology and Medicine III: Humans in Spaceflght.  Book 2.  Reston, VA: AIAA.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed to evolve in clearly defined stages.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandrovskiy, Y.A. (1976).  States of Psychic Deadaptation and their Compensation.  Moscow: Nauka Press (In Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; It is conceptualized as an adjustment reaction to being in space that is different from [[neurasthenia]], a related neurotic condition seen on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Myasnikov, V.I., Stepanova, S.I., Salnitskiy, V.P., Kozerenko, O.P., and Nechaev, A.P.  (2000).  Problems of Psychic Asthenization in Prolonged Space Flight.  Moscow: Slovo Press (In Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of asthenization has been questioned by some in the West, in part because classical neurasthenia is not currently{{when|date=March 2013}} recognized in the American psychiatric nomenclature, whereas the illness is accepted in Russia and China.  Retrospective analysis of the data from the Soviet ''Space Biology and Medicine III'' Mir Space Station study (see &lt;ref name=myasnikov1986/&gt;) has shown that the findings did not support the presence of the asthenization syndrome when crew member on-orbit scores were compared with those from a prototype of asthenization developed by Russian space experts.&lt;ref&gt;Kanas, N., Salnitskiy, V., Gushin, V., Weiss, D.S., Grund, E.M., Flynn, C., Kozerenko, O., Sled, A., Marmar, C.R. (2001).  Asthenia&amp;nbsp;– Does it exist in space? Psychosom. Med., 63, 874-880.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive outcomes===
Isolated and confined environments may also produce positive experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Palinkas, L.A. (1991).  Group adaptation and individual adjustment in Antarctica: A summary of recent research.  In: A.A. Harrison, Y.A. Clearwater, C.P., McKay, eds.  From Antarctica to Outer Space.  New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;
A survey of 39 astronauts and cosmonauts found that all of the respondents reported positive changes as a result of flying in space. One particular measure stood out: Perceptions of Earth in general were highly positive, while gaining a stronger appreciation of the Earth’s beauty had the highest mean change score.&lt;ref name="Ihle"&gt;Ihle, E.C., Ritsher, J.B., Kanas, N. (2006). Positive psychological outcomes of space flight: An empirical study. Aviat. Space, Environ. Med., 77, 93-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1990s, research began on the [[Salutogenesis|salutogenic]] (or growth-enhancing) aspects of space travel. One study analyzed the published memoirs of 125 space travelers.&lt;ref name=suedfeld2010/&gt;  After returning from space, the subjects reported higher levels on categories of Universalism (i.e., greater appreciation for other people and nature), Spirituality, and Power. Russian space travelers scored higher in Achievement and Universalism and lower in Enjoyment than Americans.  Overall, these results suggest that traveling in space is a positive and growth-enhancing experience for many of its individual participants.&lt;ref name=suedfeld2010&gt;Suedfeld, P., Legkaia, K., Brcic, J. (2010). Changes in the hierarchy of value references associated with flying in space. J. Personality, 78(5), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==From low-Earth orbit to expeditions across the inner Solar System==
Research to date into human psychological and sociological effects based on [[low-Earth orbit|on-orbit near-Earth]] experiences may have limited generalizability to a long-distance, multi-year space expedition, such as a mission to a [[near-Earth asteroid]] (which currently is being considered by NASA) or to [[Mars]]. In the case of Mars, new stressors will be introduced due to the great distances involved in journeying to the Red Planet. For example, the crew members will be relatively [[autonomous]] from [[mission control|terrestrial mission control]] and will need to plan their work and deal with problems on their own.
They are expected to experience significant isolation as the Earth becomes an insignificant bluish-green dot in the heavens, the so-called Earth-out-of-view phenomenon.&lt;ref name=kanas2008/&gt;
From the surface of Mars, there will be two-way [[Latency (engineering)#Communication latency|communication delays]] with family and friends back home of up to 44 minutes, as well as [[Antenna (radio)#Bandwidth|low-bandwidth]] [[Channel (communications)|communication channels]], adding to the sense of isolation.

===The Mars 500 Program===
From June 2010 to November 2011, a unique ground-based space analog study took place that was called the [[MARS-500|Mars 500 Program]].&lt;ref name=urbina2012/&gt; Mars 500 was designed to simulate a 520-day round-trip expedition to Mars, including periods of time where the crew functioned under high [[autonomy]] conditions and experienced communication delays with outside monitoring personnel in mission control.  Six men were confined in a simulator that was located at the [[Institute for Biomedical Problems]] in [[Moscow]].  The lower floor consisted of living and laboratory modules for the international crew, and the upper floor contained a mock-up of the Mars surface on which the crew conducted simulated [[geology|geological]] and other [[planet]]ary activities.&lt;ref name=urbina2012&gt;Urbina, D., Charles, R. (2012).  Enduring the isolation of interplanetary travel: A personal account of the Mars 500 mission.  Paper # IAC-12-A1.1.1.  International Astronautical Federation.  Proceedings, 63rd [[International Astronautical Congress]], Naples, Italy, 1–5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
                                                              
During a 105-day pilot study in 2009 that preceded this mission, the mood and group interactions of a six-man Russian-European crew, as well as the relationships of this crew with outside mission control personnel, were studied. The study found that high [[work autonomy]] (where the crew members planned their own schedules) was well received by the crews, mission goals were accomplished, and there were no adverse effects,&lt;ref name=kanas2010&gt;Kanas, N., Saylor, S., Harris, M., Neylan, T., Boyd, J., Weiss, D.S., Baskin, P., Cook, C., Marmar, C. (2010).  High vs. low crew member autonomy in space simulation environments.

High vs. low crew member autonomy during a 105-day Mars simulation mission.  Acta Astronaut., 69, 240-244.&lt;/ref&gt;
which echoed positive autonomy findings in other space analog settings.&lt;ref&gt;Roma, P.C., Hursh, S.R., Hienz, R.D., Brinson, Z.S., Gasior, E.D., Brady, J.V. (2012).  Interactive effects of autonomous operations and circadian factors on crew performance, behavior, and stress physiology.  Paper # IAC-12-A1.1.11.  International Astronautical Federation.  Proceedings, 63rd International Astronautical Congress, Naples, Italy, 1–5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During the high autonomy period, crew member mood and self-direction were reported as being improved, but mission control personnel reported more anxiety and work role confusion. Despite scoring lower in work pressure overall, the Russian crew members reported a greater rise in work pressure from low to high autonomy than the European participants.&lt;ref name=kanas2010/&gt;

Several psychosocial studies were conducted during the actual 520-day mission. There were changes in crew member time perception, evidence for the displacement of crew tension to mission control, and decreases in crew member needs and requests during high autonomy, which suggested that they had adapted to this condition.&lt;ref&gt;Gushin, V., Shved, D., Ehmann, B., Balazss, L., Komarevtsev, S.  (2012).  Crew-MC interactions during communication delay in Mars-500.  Paper # IAC-12-A1.1.2.  International Astronautical Federation.  Proceedings, 63rd International Astronautical Congress, Naples, Italy, 1–5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The crew exhibited increased homogeneity in values and more reluctance to express negative interpersonal feelings over time, which suggested a tendency toward "[[groupthink]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sandal, G.M. (2012).  "Groupthink" on a mission to Mars: Results from a 520 days space simulation study.  Paper # IAC-12-A1.1.3.  International Astronautical Federation.  Proceedings, 63rd International Astronautical Congress, Naples, Italy, 1–5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the crew members experienced increased feelings of loneliness and perceived lower support from colleagues over time, which had a negative effect on [[cognition|cognitive]] [[Adaptive behavior|adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Baarsen, B., Ferlazzo, F., Ferravante, D., Smit, J., van der Pligt, J., van Duijn, M, (2012).

International Astronautical Federation.  Proceedings, 63rd International Astronautical Congress, Naples, Italy, 1–5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of individual differences in terms of sleep pattern, mood, and conflicts with mission control were found and reported using techniques such as wrist [[actigraphy]], the [[Psychomotor vigilance task|psychomotor vigilance test]], and various subjective measures.&lt;ref&gt;Basner, M., Dinges, D., Mollicone, D., Savelev, I., Ecker, A., Di Antonio, A., Jones, C., Hyder, E., Kan, K., Morukov, B., Sutton, J.

Proceedings, 63rd International Astronautical Congress, Naples, Italy, 1–5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
A general decrease in group collective time from the outbound phase to the return phase of the simulated flight to Mars was identified.  This was accomplished by the evaluation of fixed video recordings of crew behavior during breakfasts through variations in personal actions, visual interactions, and facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Tafforin, C.

==Psychosocial and psychiatric issues during an expedition to Mars==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
There are a number of [[psychosocial]] and [[psychiatric]] issues that may affect crew members&lt;ref name=kanas2008/&gt; during an expeditionary mission to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Kanas, N. (2010).  Expedition to Mars: Psychological, interpersonal, and psychiatric issues.  J. Cosmology, 12:3741-2747 (JournalofCosmology.com, Oct.-Nov., 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanas, N. (2011). From Earth’s orbit to the outer planets and beyond: Psychological issues in space. Acta Astronaut., 68, 576-581.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Selection effect|selection]], only a subset of all astronaut candidates will be willing to be away from family and friends for the two- to three-year mission, so the pool of possible crew members will be restricted and possibly skewed psychologically in ways that cannot be foreseen.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Little is known about the physical and psychological effect of long-duration microgravity and the high radiation that occurs in deep space.  In addition, on Mars the crew members will be subjected to a gravity field that is only 38 percent of Earth gravity, and the effect of this situation on their physical and emotional well-being is unknown.  Given the long distances involved, the crew must function autonomously and develop their own work schedules and solve operational emergencies themselves. They must also be able to deal with medical and psychiatric emergencies, such as physical trauma due to accidents as well as [[suicide|suicidal]] or [[psychotic]] thinking due to [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  Basic life support and staples such as water and fuel will need to be provided from resources on Mars and its atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;!-- this is pnly one method of supply; others have also been proposed including recurring Earth-outbound resupply missions or pre-human-mission caching of resources on Mars from Earth-outbound missions --&gt;  There will be a great deal of leisure time (especially during the outbound and return phases of the mission), and occupying it meaningfully and flexibly may be a challenge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Furthermore, Kanas points out that during on-orbit or lunar missions a number of interventions have been implemented successfully to support crew member psychological well-being.{{undue weight inline|date=March 2013}}&lt;!-- this section seems rather too heavily weighted to a single source for most of it's content --&gt;  These have included family conferences in real time (i.e., with no appreciable delays), frequent consultations with mission control, and the sending of gifts and favorite foods on resupply ships to enhance morale. Such actions have helped to provide stimulation and counter the effects of isolation, loneliness, asthenization, and limited social contact.  But with the delays in crew-ground communication and the inability to send needed resupplies in a timely manner due to the vast distances between the habitats on Mars and Earth, the currently used Earth-based support strategies will be seriously constrained, and new strategies will be needed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Finally, since gazing at the Earth’s beauty has been rated as the major positive factor of being in space,&lt;ref name="Ihle" /&gt; the experience of seeing the Earth as an insignificant dot in the heavens may enhance the sense of isolation and produce increased feelings of homesickness, depression and irritability.  This may be ameliorated by having a telescope on board with which to view the Earth, thus helping the crew feel more connected with home.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The '''Public Health Foundation of India''' (PHFI), is an autonomous [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] located in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. The foundation was created as a public-private initiative and launched in 2006 with the aim of enhancing the capacity of [[public health]] professionals in the country over five to seven years. The PHFI initiative was collaboratively developed over two years under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Prof. [[K. Srinath Reddy]] (President, PHFI and former Head of the Department of Cardiology, [[AIIMS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PM launches Public Health Foundation |url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pm-launches-public-health-foundation/1359/|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |date=29 Mar 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PM launches Public Health Foundation  |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2006/03/29/stories/2006032902700900.htm |newspaper=[[Business Line]] |date=29 Mar 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From the PM's doctor to a hero |url=http://inhome.rediff.com/news/2009/feb/07from-the-pms-doctor-to-a-hero.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India faces a severe shortfall of public health professionals, and capacity building efforts are urgently required to address its emerging public health challenges.

Public health has evolved as a multi-disciplinary science which deals with the determinants and defence of health at the population level so as to impact upon and improve the health of individuals in that population.  It aims to focus on and influence the multiple determinants of health (economic, social, behavioural and biological) and to undertake and evaluate multi-sectoral interventions to positively influence those determinants.  It also involves the study of [[health system]]s, their structure and management practices as channels for delivery of health services for all sections of the population.

As India experiences a rapid health transition, it is confronted both by an unfinished agenda of eliminating infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies, unsafe pregnancies and the challenge of escalating epidemics of [[non-communicable disease]]s.  This composite threat to the nation’s health and development needs a concerted public health response that can ensure delivery of cost-effective interventions for health promotion, disease prevention and affordable diagnostic and the therapeutic health care.

This broad ambit makes it essential that education and training in public health is multi-disciplinary in content and that the pathways of public health action are multi-sectoral.  Public health education must include subject areas like epidemiology, biostatistics, behavioural sciences, health economics, health services management, environmental health, health inequities and human rights, gender and health, health promotion and communication, ethics of health care and research.  These diverse disciplines need to establish synergistic links in designing and delivering [[health care]] in prioritized sectors.  It is also essential to advance a trans-disciplinary research agenda which informs policy and empowers programs.  There is a constant need for surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.  The interventions proposed need to be evidence based, context specific and resource sensitive.  Thus public health should emphasize health promotion, disease prevention and cost effective as well as equitable health care through collective actions at various levels (viz. macro, public and private) to address the underlying causes of diseases, and foster conditions in which communities or population groups may lead healthy lives.

==The Genesis of PHFI==
The Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) was conceptualised as a response to growing concern over the emerging public health challenges in India.  It recognizes the fact that meeting the [[Health Human Resources|shortfall of health professionals]] is imperative for a sustained and holistic response to the public health concerns in the country, which in turn requires health care to be addressed not only from the scientific perspective of what works, but also from the social perspective of who needs it the most. The PHFI concept was developed over two years and was collaboratively evolved through consultation with multiple constituencies including Indian and international academia, State and Central Governments in India, multi &amp; bi-lateral agencies, civil society groups in India.

== The Public Health Foundation of India ==
The Public Health Foundation of India is an autonomously governed public private partnership launched by the Honourable Prime Minister of India, [[Dr. Manmohan Singh]], on 28 March 2006 at [[New Delhi]]. The Foundation is managed by a fully empowered, independent, governing board that is represented by multiple constituencies.

'''Mandate'''

The PHFI is working towards building public health capacity by:
* Establishing a network of new institutes of public health in India
* Establishing strong national networks and international partnerships for research
* Generating policy recommendations and developing vigorous advocacy platform
* Facilitating the establishment of an independent accreditation body for degrees in public health which are awarded by training institutions across India
* Assisting the growth of existing public health training institutions

The Board includes senior government officials, eminent Indian and International academic and scientific leaders, civil society representatives and industry leaders. The chairman of the board is [[N.R. Narayana Murthy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Narayana Murthyto chair PHFI|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article2219732.ece|accessdate=19 July 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Board members include: [[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]] (Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission of India), [[Amartya Sen]] (Nobel Laureate) and others. The President of the Foundation is Prof. [[K. Srinath Reddy]], a cardiologist and epidemiologist who brings in a broad range of public health experience at national and global levels.

Currently PHFI financially supported by national and international agencies namely [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]], Government of India, [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], The [[Deshpande Foundation]], The Nand and Jeet Khemka Foundation, [[Vinod Khosla|Vinod]] and [[Neeru Khosla]], AKM Systems Private Ltd, HCL Corporation Ltd, Rohini Nilekeni, The Ranbaxy Promoter Group and [[Reliance Industries]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHFI financial supporters|url=http://phfi.org/about-us/our-supporters|publisher=Public Health Foundation of India|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHFI and IIPHs collaborate with range of institutions to improve public health in India and influence global public health. In India almost 12 state governments, including Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Science and Technology and Planning Commission.  International, with [[AusAID]], [[USAID]], European Commission, [[DFID]] and UN agencies ([[WHO]], [[World Bank]], UN [[World Food Programme]] and [[UNICEF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHFI Partnerships|url=http://phfi.org/partnerships/our-partners-|publisher=Public Health Foundation of India|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept enjoys wide support nationally and internationally. PHFI has academic and research institute linkages of more than 30 international schools of Public Health from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academics linkages of PHFI|url=http://phfi.org/partnerships/our-partners-|publisher=Public Health Foundation of India|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHFI in the last five years grown in length and breath and has set up five Centres of Excellence(CoE) to raise awareness and strengthen research, training and education in the high priority area of public health in India.

In addition to areas mentioned above, PHFI plans to launch CoEs in the areas of Emerging and other Communicable Diseases, Public Health Nutrition, Health Systems and Policy, Maternal and Child Health and Tribal Health.

==Indian Institutes of Public Health==
PHFI has established five Indian Institutes of Public Health (IIPHs) in [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Delhi]], [[Gandhinagar]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Shillong]]. The institutes are aimed at being research and education institutes focusing on [[public health]]. Other than IIPH Shillong, which does not offer academic programmes yet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Institute of Public Health, Shillong (IIPH Shillong)|url=https://www.phfi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1559&amp;Itemid=607|website=www.phfi.org|accessdate=17 September 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; the institutes offer one-year Post Graduate Diploma in Public Health Management (PGDPHM). Some of the institutes offer other [[postgraduate]] programmes, affiliated to various local institutes. They also offer [[distance learning]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Campus Courses|url=https://www.phfi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=957&amp;Itemid=452|website=www.phfi.org|accessdate=17 September 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar]] was the first IIPH to be granted autonomous university status through ''The Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar Act, 2015''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iiphg.edu.in/v2/images/pdfs/IIPHG_University_GOG_Gazette.pdf|date=11 March 2015|title=The Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar Act, 2015|accessdate=1 September 2017|publisher=[[Government of Gujarat]]|work=Gujarat Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Race-based traumatic stress''' is the traumatic response to stress following a [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] encounter. Robert T. Carter’s (2007) theory of race-based [[traumatic stress]] implies that there are individuals of color who experience racially charged [[discrimination]] as traumatic, and often generate responses similar to [[post-traumatic stress]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=Robert T.|date=2016-06-30|title=Racism and Psychological and Emotional Injury|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=13–105|doi=10.1177/0011000006292033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race-based traumatic stress combines theories of stress, trauma and race-based discrimination to describe a particular response to negative racial encounters. 

Despite the limited research that examines race-based traumatic stress specifically, trauma research suggests that an individual’s response to a stressor is highly dependent on that person’s perception of the stressor; what one person may experience as traumatic, another person may not experience as such.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=Robert T.|last2=Muchow|first2=Carrie|title=Construct validity of the Race-Based Traumatic Stress Symptom Scale and tests of measurement equivalence|journal=Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=688–695|doi=10.1037/tra0000256|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differing responses have been found to be strongly associated with each individual’s ability to cope with the said stressor. According to Carter, a professor at [[Columbia University]], race-based traumatic stress is an individual’s response to [[racial discrimination]] as traumatic or outside of their ability to cope.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Race-based traumatic stress can be experienced both directly and indirectly and can occur on an interpersonal level, institutional level, or cultural level.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racial trauma recovery: A race-informed therapeutic approach to racial wounds.|last=Comas-Díaz|first=Lillian|pages=249–272|doi=10.1037/14852-012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, research indicates that race-based traumatic stress can be demonstrated as a number of negative outcomes, including psychopathological symptoms, social inequities, and internalized racial oppression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A theoretical overview of the impact of racism on people of color.|last=Pieterse|first=Alex|last2=Powell|first2=Shantel|pages=11–30|language=en|doi=10.1037/14852-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has indicated that children, as well as adults, can experience and be impacted by the reaches of race-based traumatic stress. Through direct experience from peers and/or authority figures, as well as indirectly through media exposure and/or bearing witness to the racial discrimination of their parents, research suggests children of color are particularly vulnerable to race-based traumatic stress.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Christia Spears|last2=Alabi|first2=Basirat O.|last3=Huynh|first3=Virginia W.|last4=Masten|first4=Carrie L.|title=Ethnicity and gender in late childhood and early adolescence: Group identity and awareness of bias|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=2|pages=463–471|doi=10.1037/a0021819|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Despite the popular understanding that race is a socially-based construct, research indicates that it has critical social implications and plays a role in the way individuals navigate society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Race-based traumatic stress is viewed as a consequence of racially motivated discrimination, exclusion, and unjust treatment. Racial discrimination can be interpersonal, institutional/structural, and/or cultural.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the interpersonal level, race-based traumatic stress occurs when an individual directly experiences race-based prejudice from another person. Institutional racial discrimination occurs at the hands of trusted or imperative social structures of power in society that for example, may withhold services or resources from people of color. Lastly, on a cultural level, racial discrimination occurs when non-Eurocentric cultures are devalued or viewed as inferior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additionally, research indicates that racial discrimination can be experienced both overtly and covertly. On an overt level, people of color are targeted in an intentionally blatant manner due to their racial identities. In contrast, covert racial discrimination, often termed [[microaggressions]], often come in the form of subtle messages, whether intentional or not, and demonstrate malicious, invalidating, or disparaging meaning for people of color. With the frequency at which race-based discrimination is found to occur, on both overt and covert levels, some individuals may experience re-traumatization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Models ==
The Race-Based Traumatic Stress Model (RBTSM) is a model which outlines the different emotional responses individuals have following race-based encounters. Despite being linked to a variety of outcomes including psychopathology, Carter (2007) believes this response is more of an emotional injury than a pathological one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The model emphasizes Carter’s distinction between two forms of racism: discrimination and harassment. It follows that discrimination-based racism is linked to hyperarousal and hypervigilance while consequences of harassment-based racism, such as complex emotional reactions, tend to have a long-lasting impact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Outcomes ===
Research indicates that different forms of racial discrimination, such as interpersonal, institutional, and cultural are often associated with specific types of outcomes in people of color.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Interpersonal racial discrimination, for example, has been found to have more of an effect at the individual level, often demonstrated in mental health symptoms such as [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], and even physiological symptoms such as hypertension. Racial discrimination at the institutional level has been found to result in social inequities for people of color such as higher rates of incarceration, health disparities, and educational difficulties. Cultural racial discrimination has been found to be associated with [[internalized racism]], often resulting in individuals devaluing their own culture in ways such as denouncing their cultural heritage and values and/or internalizing negative stereotypical beliefs associated with their own racial group. Additionally, research indicates that the internalization of racial oppression can lead to feelings of shame and malice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the experience of racial discrimination is complex and its various forms often overlap and lead to a number of psychological, social, and physiological outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Children ==
Children are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of race-based traumatic stress, as research indicates that oftentimes they lack the coping strategies needed to overcome these experiences. Research indicates that children can be affected by these stressors both indirectly and directly, through experiences with racially charged interactions or through intergenerational transmission. Racial victimization can result in cross-generational trauma; where children can witness their caregivers either experience race-based discrimination or children can experience the effects of the race-based discrimination for their caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychological perspectives on culture, violence, and intergroup animus: Evolving traditions in the bonds that tie and hate.|last=Dunbar|first=Edward|last2=Blanco|first2=Amalio|pages=377–399|doi=10.1037/14187-022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caregiver’s experience of race-based traumatic stress can be displayed in actions such as increased substance use, an increase in delinquency or violence which can lead to incarceration, and mental health difficulties which can impair [[Attachment theory|attachment]] and parenting strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=Robert T.|last2=Lau|first2=Michael Y.|last3=Johnson|first3=Veronica|last4=Kirkinis|first4=Katherine|date=2017-10-01|title=Racial Discrimination and Health Outcomes Among Racial/Ethnic Minorities: A Meta-Analytic Review|journal=Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=232–259|doi=10.1002/jmcd.12076|issn=2161-1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the stressors associated with racial discrimination are chronic and impact multiple areas of development for children such as cognitive, biological and psychosocial.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spears Brown|first=Christia|last2=Bigler|first2=Rebecca S.|title=Children's Perceptions of Discrimination: A Developmental Model|journal=Child Development|volume=76|issue=3|pages=533–553|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00862.x|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research implies that children can experience race-based stressors in the form of [[bullying]] through verbal comments about their racial identity, physically in the form of violence, or interpersonally, through acts against them such as being excluded from activities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Children can experience verbal attacks that can include teasing concerning distinct aspects of their identity such as physical appearance, beliefs, cultural aspects, accents, language barriers, and acculturation levels. In addition to experiences with peers, children can be targeted by negative interactions with authority figures such as teachers or school staff questioning their capabilities or making verbalizations discouraging their goals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Outcomes ===
Given that children have limited coping strategies and cognitive resources to deal with race-based discrimination, research suggests that these experiences can be internalized as traumatic and associated with the development of mental health disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flores|first=Elena|last2=Tschann|first2=Jeanne M.|last3=Dimas|first3=Juanita M.|last4=Pasch|first4=Lauri A.|last5=Groat|first5=Cynthia L. de|title=Perceived racial/ethnic discrimination, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and health risk behaviors among Mexican American adolescents|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|volume=57|issue=3|pages=264–273|doi=10.1037/a0020026|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is indicated that discrimination experienced in childhood may lead to low self-esteem, difficulties with academic performance, and increased externalizing behaviors such as acting out, defiance, anger, mistrust, and internalizing behaviors such as depression or anxiety.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Furthermore, recent findings suggest that children who experience race-based discrimination from peers have increased difficulty with establishing a confident personality, as social interactions and social categories affect their self-esteem and overall self-view.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Peer interactions and establishing a social self is an aspect of development that is significant during childhood, therefore experiences with peers can have a significant impact. Getting negative verbalization from either peers or authority figures can lead to internalization of the [[stereotypes]] and beliefs about their own race and can lead to difficulties with accepting oneself and adopting beliefs that they are not capable of accomplishing goals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Research suggests that these experiences can impact their self-esteem and overall worldview.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Assessment ==
The lack of research on race-based traumatic stress is in part due to the fact that it is difficult to recognize or assess because there is no clear link associated with experiencing racial discrimination and the development of psychological difficulties in response to the racial encounter. Currently, no diagnoses account for trauma associated with race-based interactions and experiences, and limited assessments accurately assess for experiences of racial discrimination. The Race-Based Traumatic Stress Symptom Scale (RBTSSS) is an assessment that has been developed in order to address this lack of appropriate assessments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The RBTSSS utilizes open-ended questions related to 3 experiences of racism that each individual has encountered. Individuals are then prompted to identify whether the experience was emotionally painful, sudden, and not in their control. Individuals choose one of these experiences and address questions related to feelings after the event, which fall within the following subscales; Anger, Depression, Intrusion, Hypervigilance, Physical, Low self-esteem, Avoidance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Use of tools such as the RBTSSS is recommended in order to address distress associated with race-based traumatic stress.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
The little research on race-based traumatic stress suggests that treatment can focus on the symptoms associated with the experiences such as hyperarousal, low self-esteem, hyper vigilance, substance use, and engagement in risky-behavior.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Furthermore, highlighting protective factors, such as support from friends and family, positive outlook, and engagement in extracurricular activities can increase feelings of being included in the community. Research suggests that future goals for improved treatment of race-based traumatic stress can include specialized training for mental health professionals to increase the professional’s capabilities of having discussions about race and discrimination and exploring the impact on each individual’s life. Furthermore, research indicates that in addition to addressing the common symptoms associated with mental health disorders, clinicians can focus on exploring and addressing the direct impact of race-based traumatic stress.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Ultraviolet's position on the electromagnetic spectrum is on the boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing [[radio frequency]] radiation from [[mobile phone]]s, [[electric power transmission]], and other similar sources have been described as a [[possible carcinogen]] by the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], but the link remains unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] is known to increase the future incidence of cancer, particularly [[leukemia]]. The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial. The most widely accepted model posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with [[effective radiation dose]] at a rate of 5.5% per [[sievert]].&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt; If the linear model is correct, then natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second.

==Causes==
According to the prevalent model, any radiation exposure can increase the risk of cancer. Typical contributors to such risk include natural background radiation, medical procedures, occupational exposures, nuclear accidents, and many others. Some major contributors are discussed below.

===Radon===
[[Health effects of radon|Radon]] is responsible for the worldwide majority of the mean public exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual's background radiation dose, and is the most variable from location to location. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as attics, and basements. It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about Radon|publisher=Facts about|url=http://www.facts-about.org.uk/science-element-radon.htm|accessdate=2008-09-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222004131/http://www.facts-about.org.uk/science-element-radon.htm|archivedate=2005-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiological evidence shows a clear link between lung cancer and high concentrations of radon, with 21,000 radon-induced U.S. lung cancer deaths per year&amp;mdash;second only to cigarette smoking&amp;mdash;according to the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Citizen's Guide to Radon|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|date=2007-11-26|url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in geographic areas where radon is present in heightened concentrations, radon is considered a significant [[indoor air quality|indoor air]] contaminant.

Residential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt;

===Medical===
In industrialized countries, [[Medical imaging]] contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. Collective dose to Americans from medical imaging grew by a factor of six from 1990 to 2006, mostly due to growing use of 3D scans that impart much more dose per procedure than traditional [[radiograph]]s.&lt;ref name="NCRP160"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ionizing radiation exposure of the population of the United States : recommendations of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements.|year=2009|publisher=National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements|location=Bethesda, Md.|id=NCRP report 160|isbn=978-0-929600-98-7|url=http://www.ncrppublications.org/Reports/160}}&lt;/ref&gt; CT scans alone, which account for half the medical imaging dose to the public, are estimated to be responsible for 0.4% of current cancers in the United States, and this may increase to as high as 1.5-2% with 2007 rates of CT usage;&lt;ref name="pmid18046031"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brenner DJ, Hall EJ |title=Computed tomography--an increasing source of radiation exposure |journal=N.

It has been estimated that CT scans performed in the US in 2007 alone will result in 29,000 new cancer cases in future years.&lt;ref name="pmid20008689"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berrington de González A, Mahesh M, Kim KP, Bhargavan M, Lewis R, Mettler F, Land C | title = Projected cancer risks from computed tomographic scans performed in the United States in 2007 | journal = Arch.

===Occupational===
In accordance with ICRP recommendations, most regulators permit nuclear energy workers to receive up to 20 times more radiation dose than is permitted for the general public.&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt; Higher doses are usually permitted when responding to an emergency. The majority of workers are routinely kept well within regulatory limits, while a few essential technicians will routinely approach their maximum each year. Accidental overexposures beyond regulatory limits happen globally several times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turai|first=István|author2=Veress, Katalin |title=Radiation Accidents: Occurrence, Types, Consequences, Medical Management, and the Lessons to be Learned|journal=Central European Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|year=2001|volume=7|issue=1|pages=3–14|url=http://www.omfi.hu/cejoem/Volume7/Vol7No1/CE01_1-01.html|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronauts on long missions are at higher risk of cancer, see [[cancer and spaceflight]].

Some occupations are exposed to radiation without being classed as nuclear energy workers. Airline crews receive occupational exposures from [[cosmic radiation]] because of reduced atmospheric shielding at altitude. Mine workers receive occupational exposures to radon, especially in uranium mines. Anyone working in a granite building, such as the [[US Capitol]], is likely to receive a dose from natural uranium in the granite.&lt;ref name=FUSRAP /&gt;

===Accidental===
[[File:Chernobyl radiation map 1996.svg|thumb|right|Chernobyl radiation map from 1996]]
Nuclear accidents can have dramatic consequences to their surroundings, but their global impact on cancer is less than that of natural and medical exposures.

The most severe nuclear accident is probably the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. In addition to conventional fatalities and acute radiation syndrome fatalities, nine children died of [[thyroid cancer]], and it is estimated that there may be up to 4,000 excess cancer deaths among the approximately 600,000 most highly exposed people.&lt;ref name="iaea"&gt;{{cite web|title=IAEA Report|work=In Focus: Chernobyl|accessdate = 2008-05-31 |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/Chernobyl/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611102751/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/Chernobyl/| archivedate= 11 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=WHO Expert Group |title=Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident and Special Health Care Programmes: Report of the UN Chernobyl Forum Health Expert Group |editors=Burton Bennett, Michael Repacholi, Zhanat Carr |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |date=July 2006 |isbn=978-92-4-159417-2 |url=http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/WHO%20Report%20on%20Chernobyl%20Health%20Effects%20July%2006.pdf |page=106 |quote=...This total, about 4000 deaths projected over the lifetimes of the some 600,000 persons most affected by the accident, is a small proportion of the total cancer deaths from all causes that can be expected to occur in this population.

Due to their short half-lives of 5 and 8 days they have now&lt;!-- ({{CURRENTYEAR}}) --&gt; decayed, leaving the more long-lived [[caesium-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] (with a half-life of 30.07 years) and [[strontium-90|&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]] (with a half-life of 28.78 years) as main dangers.

In March 2011, an earthquake and  tsunami caused damage that led to [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|explosions and partial meltdowns]] at the [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] in Japan. Significant release of radioactive material took place following hydrogen explosions at three reactors, as technicians  tried to pump in seawater to keep the uranium fuel rods cool, and bled radioactive gas from the reactors in order to make room for the seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/world/asia/13japan.html?_r=1 |title=Japanese Officials on Defensive as Nuclear Alert Level Rises |author=Keith Bradsher|date=April 12, 2011  |work=New York Times |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in 20&amp;nbsp;km exclusion zone being set up around the power plant and people within the 20–30&amp;nbsp;km zone being advised to stay indoors. On March 24, 2011, Japanese officials announced that "radioactive iodine-131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 water-purification plants in Tokyo and five other prefectures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/03/report-radioactive-emissions-from-japan-plant-approach-chernobyl-levels/1 |title=Report: Emissions from Japan plant approach Chernobyl levels  |author=Michael Winter |date=March 24, 2011 |work=USA Today |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[John Gofman]] claimed it increased the rate of lung cancer worldwide.

==Mechanism==
Cancer is a [[stochastic]] effect of radiation, meaning that the probability of occurrence increases with [[effective radiation dose]], but the severity of the cancer is independent of dose. The speed at which cancer advances, the [[prognosis]], the degree of pain, and every other feature of the disease are not functions of the radiation dose to which the person is exposed. This contrasts with the deterministic effects of [[acute radiation syndrome]] which increase in severity with dose above a threshold. Cancer starts with a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] whose operation is disrupted. Normal cell operation is controlled by the chemical structure of [[DNA]] molecules, also called [[chromosome]]s.

When radiation deposits enough energy in organic tissue to cause [[ionization]], this tends to break molecular bonds, and thus alter the molecular structure of the irradiated molecules. Less energetic radiation, such as visible light, only causes [[Excited state|excitation]], not ionization, which is usually dissipated as heat with relatively little chemical damage. Ultraviolet light is usually categorized as non-ionizing, but it is actually in an intermediate range that produces some ionization and chemical damage. Hence the carcinogenic mechanism of ultraviolet radiation is similar to that of ionizing radiation.

Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, penetrating radiation hits molecules within cells randomly.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the case of [[internal contamination]] with [[alpha emitter]]s, the distribution may not be so random. [[Transuranic]] elements are believed to have a chemical affinity for DNA, and any radioactive element could be part of a chemical compound that targets certain molecules.&lt;/ref&gt; Molecules broken by radiation can become highly reactive [[free radicals]] that cause further chemical damage. Some of this direct and indirect damage will eventually impact [[chromosome]]s and [[epigenetic]] factors that control the expression of genes. Cellular mechanisms will repair some of this damage, but some repairs will be incorrect and some [[chromosome abnormalities]] will turn out to be irreversible.

DNA [[double-strand break]]s (DSBs) are generally accepted to be the most biologically significant lesion by which ionizing radiation causes cancer.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; In vitro experiments show that [[ionizing radiation]] cause DSBs at a rate of 35 DSBs per cell per [[Gray (unit)|Gray]],&lt;ref name=5057.full&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/100/9/5057.full.pdf  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0830918100 | volume=100 | title=Evidence for a lack of DNA double-strand break repair in human cells exposed to very low x-ray doses | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pages=5057–5062 | pmid=12679524 | pmc=154297 | date=April 2003 | author=Rothkamm K, Löbrich M}} "The line is a linear fit to the data points with a slope of 35 DSBs per cell per Gy." e.g. 35[DSB/Gy]*65[mGy]=2.27[DSB]&lt;/ref&gt; and removes a portion of the [[epigenetic]] markers of the DNA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/3/10/553.full   Fractionated Low-Dose Radiation Exposure Leads to Accumulation of DNA Damage and Profound Alterations in DNA and Histone Methylation in the Murine Thymus] "fractionated low-dose radiation exposure resulted in even more substantial decrease in global DNA methylation than acute irradiation, causing 2.5- and 6.1-fold (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in global DNA methylation&lt;/ref&gt; which regulate the gene expression.

Major damage normally results in the [[apoptosis|cell dying]] or being unable to reproduce. This effect is responsible for acute radiation syndrome, but these heavily damaged cells cannot become cancerous. Lighter damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and eventually developing into cancer, especially if [[tumor suppressor gene]]s are damaged.&lt;ref name=Little&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Kufe DW, Pollock RE, Weichselbaum RR, Bast RC, Gansler TS, Holland JF, Frei E | title = Cancer medicine | author = Little JB | chapter = Chapter 14: Ionizing Radiation | edition = 6th  | publisher = B.C.

Instead, surviving cells appear to have acquired a genomic instability which causes an increased rate of mutations in future generations. The cell will then progress through multiple stages of [[neoplastic transformation]] that may culminate into a tumor after years of incubation. The neoplastic transformation can be divided into three major independent stages: morphological changes to the cell, acquisition of [[cellular immortality]] (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt;

In some cases, a small radiation dose reduces the impact of a subsequent, larger radiation dose. This has been termed an 'adaptive response' and is related to hypothetical mechanisms of [[Radiation hormesis|hormesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.groenerekenkamer.com/grkfiles/images/parsons.pdf|title=Radiation Hormesis Challenging LNT Theory Via Ecologial and Evolutionary Considerations|work=Publication date 2002|publisher=Health Physics Society|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Incubation period|latent period]] of decades may elapse between radiation exposure and the detection of cancer. Those cancers that may develop as a result of radiation exposure are indistinguishable from those that occur naturally or as a result of exposure to other [[carcinogen]]s. Furthermore, [[National Cancer Institute]] literature indicates that chemical and physical hazards and lifestyle factors, such as smoking, [[alcohol]] consumption, and diet, significantly contribute to many of these same diseases. Evidence from uranium miners suggests that smoking may have a multiplicative, rather than additive, interaction with radiation.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; Evaluations of radiation's contribution to cancer incidence can only be done through large epidemiological studies with thorough data about all other confounding risk factors.

==Skin cancer==
Prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]] can lead to [[melanoma]] and other skin malignancies.&lt;ref name=Cleaver&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Cleaver JE, Mitchell DL |veditors=Bast RC, Kufe DW, Pollock RE, etal | title = Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition = 5th | publisher = B.C.

== Epidemiology ==
Cancer is a stochastic effect of radiation, meaning that it only has a probability of occurrence, as opposed to deterministic effects which always happen over a certain dose threshold. The consensus of the nuclear industry, nuclear regulators, and governments, is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with [[effective radiation dose]] at a rate of 5.5% per [[sievert]].&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt; Individual studies, alternate models, and earlier versions of the industry consensus have produced other risk estimates scattered around this consensus model. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peck|first=Donald J.|title=How to Understand and Communicate Radiation Risk|url=http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx|publisher=Image Wisely|accessdate=18 May 2012|author2= Samei, Ehsan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="”UNSCEAR"&gt;{{cite book |authors=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|title=Effects of ionizing radiation : UNSCEAR 2006 report to the General Assembly, with scientific annexes|year=2008|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=978-92-1-142263-4|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model is widely accepted for external radiation, but its application to internal contamination is disputed. For example, the model fails to account for the low rates of cancer in early workers at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] who were exposed to plutonium dust, and the high rates of thyroid cancer in children following the [[Chernobyl accident]], both of which were internal exposure events. The European Committee on Radiation Risk calls the ICRP model "fatally flawed" when it comes to internal exposure.&lt;ref name="ECRR2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=European Committee on Radiation Risk|title=2010 recommendations of the ECRR : the health effects of exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation|year=2010|publisher=Green Audit|location=Aberystwyth|isbn=978-1-897761-16-8|url=http://www.euradcom.org/2011/ecrr2010.pdf|edition=Regulators'|editor=Busby, Chris|accessdate=18 May 2012|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced [[leukemia]]s typically require 2–10 years to appear.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"&gt;Coggle, J.E., Lindop, Patricia J. "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." The Aftermath (1983): 60-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, such as those with [[nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]] or [[retinoblastoma]], are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt;

Radiation exposure can cause cancer in any living tissue, but high-dose whole-body external exposure is most closely associated with [[leukemia]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-104/ A Nested Case-Control Study of Leukemia and Ionizing Radiation at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]", NIOSH Publication No. 2005-104. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the high [[radiosensitivity]] of bone marrow. Internal exposures tend to cause cancer in the organs where the radioactive material concentrates, so that [[radon]] predominantly causes [[lung cancer]], [[iodine-131]] is most likely to cause [[thyroid cancer]], etc.

===Data sources===
[[File:Increased risk with dose.svg|thumb|right|Increased Risk of Solid Cancer with Dose for A-bomb survivors]]
The associations between ionizing radiation exposure and the development of [[cancer]] are based primarily on the "[[LSS cohort]]" of Japanese [[atomic bomb survivors]], the largest human population ever exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation. However this cohort was also exposed to high heat, both from the initial nuclear ''flash'' of infrared light and following the blast due their exposure to the [[firestorm]] and general fires that developed in both cities respectively, so the survivors also underwent [[Hyperthermia therapy]] to various degrees. Hyperthermia, or heat exposure following irradiation is well known in the field of radiation therapy to markedly increase the severity of free-radical insults to cells following irradiation. Presently however no attempts have been made to cater for this [[confounding]] factor, it is not included or corrected for in the dose-response curves for this group.

Additional data has been collected from recipients of selected medical procedures and the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. There is a clear link (see the [http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications/2000_2.html UNSCEAR 2000 Report, Volume 2: Effects]) between the Chernobyl accident and the unusually large number, approximately 1,800, of thyroid cancers reported in contaminated areas, mostly in children.

For low levels of radiation, the biological effects are so small they may not be detected in epidemiological studies. Although radiation may cause cancer at high doses and high dose rates, [[public health]] data regarding lower levels of exposure, below about 10 mSv (1,000 mrem), are harder to interpret. To assess the health impacts of lower [[radiation dose]]s, researchers rely on models of the process by which radiation causes cancer; several models that predict differing levels of risk have emerged.

Studies of occupational workers exposed to chronic low levels of radiation, above normal background, have provided mixed evidence regarding cancer and transgenerational effects. Cancer results, although uncertain, are consistent with estimates of risk based on atomic bomb survivors and suggest that these workers do face a small increase in the probability of developing leukemia and other cancers. One of the most recent and extensive studies of workers was published by Cardis, ''et al.'' in 2005 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cardis E, Vrijheid M, Blettner M|title=Risk of cancer after low doses of ionising radiation: retrospective cohort study in 15 countries|journal=BMJ|volume=331|issue=7508|page=77|date=July 2005|pmid=15987704|pmc=558612|doi= 10.1136/bmj.38499.599861.E0|author2=and others|displayauthors=1|last3=Blettner|last4=Gilbert|last5=Hakama|last6=Hill|last7=Howe|last8=Kaldor|last9=Muirhead|last10=Schubauer-Berigan|last11=Yoshimura|last12=Bermann|last13=Cowper|last14=Fix|last15=Hacker|last16=Heinmiller|last17=Marshall|last18=Thierry-Chef|last19=Utterback|last20=Ahn|last21=Amoros|last22=Ashmore|last23=Auvinen|last24=Bae|last25=Solano|last26=Biau|last27=Combalot|last28=Deboodt|last29=Diez Sacristan|last30=Eklof}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that low level, brief radiation exposures are not harmful.&lt;ref name="Olipitz2012"&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=120|issue=8|pages=1130–6|author=Werner Olipitz|title=Integrated Molecular Analysis Indicates Undetectable DNA Damage in Mice after Continuous Irradiation at ~400-fold Natural Background Radiation|doi=10.1289/ehp.1104294|pmid=22538203|date=April 2012|url=http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.1104294|last2=Wiktor-Brown|last3=Shuga|last4=Pang|last5=McFaline|last6=Lonkar|last7=Thomas|last8=Mutamba|last9=Greenberger|last10=Samson|last11=Dedon|last12=Yanch|last13=Engelward|display-authors=etal|pmc=3440074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modelling===
[[File:Radiations at low doses.gif|294px|thumb|right|Alternative assumptions for the extrapolation of the cancer risk vs. radiation dose to low-dose levels, given a known risk at a high dose: supra-linearity (A), linear (B), linear-quadratic (C) and [[hormesis]] (D).]]
The linear dose-response model suggests that any increase in dose, no matter how small, results in an incremental increase in risk. The [[linear no-threshold model]] (LNT) hypothesis is accepted by the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) and regulators around the world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070703191939/http://www.nap.edu/execsumm_pdf/11340.pdf  Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII – Phase 2]. Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, National Research Council (2006) Free Executive Summary&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, about 1% of the global population develop cancer as a result of natural [[background radiation]] at some point in their lifetime. For comparison, 13% of deaths in 2008 are attributed to cancer, so background radiation could plausibly be a small contributor.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web | last =WHO | authorlink =World Health Organization | title =Cancer | publisher =World Health Organization |date=Oct 2010 | url =http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/ | accessdate =2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many parties have criticized the ICRP's adoption of the linear no-threshold model for exaggerating the effects of low radiation doses. The most frequently cited alternatives are the “linear quadratic” model and the “hormesis” model. The linear quadratic model is widely viewed in [[radiotherapy]] as the best model of cellular survival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radiation Oncology Physics:  A Handbook for Teachers and Students|year=2005|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|location=Vienna|isbn=92-0-107304-6|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub1196_web.pdf|editor=Podgorsak, E.B.|accessdate=1 June 2012|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the best fit to leukemia data from the LSS cohort.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt;

|-
| Linear no-threshold || F(D)=α⋅D
|-
| Linear quadratic || F(D)=α⋅D+β⋅D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-

|}

In all three cases, the values of alpha and beta must be determined by regression from human exposure data. Laboratory experiments on animals and tissue samples is of limited value. Most of the high quality human data available is from high dose individuals, above 0.1 Sv, so any use of the models at low doses is an extrapolation that might be under-conservative or over-conservative. There is not enough human data available to settle decisively which of these model might be most accurate at low doses. The consensus has been to assume linear no-threshold because it the simplest and most conservative of the three.

[[Radiation hormesis]] is the conjecture that a low level of ionizing radiation (i.e., near the level of Earth's natural background radiation) helps "immunize" cells against DNA damage from other causes (such as free radicals or larger doses of ionizing radiation), and decreases the risk of cancer. The theory proposes that such low levels activate the body's DNA repair mechanisms, causing higher levels of cellular DNA-repair proteins to be present in the body, improving the body's ability to repair DNA damage. This assertion is very difficult to prove in humans (using, for example, statistical cancer studies) because the effects of very low ionizing radiation levels are too small to be statistically measured amid the "noise" of normal cancer rates.

The idea of radiation hormesis is considered unproven by regulatory bodies. If the hormesis model turns out to be accurate, it is conceivable that current regulations based on the LNT model will prevent or limit the hormetic effect, and thus have a negative impact on health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Charles L.|title=Radiation Hormesis and the Linear-No-Threshold Assumption|publisher=Springer|location=Heidelberg, Germany|year=2010|page=3|chapter=The LNT assumption|isbn=978-3-642-03719-1|quote=...a large number of experimental and epidemiological studies challenge the validity of the LNT assumption, strongly suggesting the presence of a threshold and/or benefits from low doses of ionizing radiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other non-linear effects have been observed, particularly for [[internal dose]]s. For example, [[iodine-131]] is notable in that high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous than low doses, since they tend to kill [[thyroid]] tissues that would otherwise become cancerous as a result of the radiation. Most studies of very-high-dose I-131 for treatment of [[Graves disease]] have failed to find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is linear increase in thyroid cancer risk with I-131 absorption at moderate doses.&lt;ref name="Rivkees"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.83.11.3767 |title=The Management of Graves' Disease in Children, with Special Emphasis on Radioiodine Treatment |year=1998 |last1=Rivkees |first1=Scott A. |first2=Charles |last2=Sklar |first3=Michael |last3=Freemark |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=83 |issue=11 |pmid=9814445 |pages=3767–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public safety==
Low-dose exposures, such as living near a [[nuclear power plant]] or a [[coal-fired power plant]], which has higher emissions than nuclear plants, are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development, barring accidents.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; Greater concerns include radon in buildings and overuse of medical imaging.

The [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) recommends limiting artificial irradiation of the public to an average of 1 mSv (0.001 Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.&lt;ref name="ICRP103"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=2007|volume=37|series=ICRP publication 103|issue=2–4|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103|accessdate=17 May 2012|isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, radiation levels inside the US capitol building are 0.85 mSv/yr, close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the granite structure.&lt;ref name="FUSRAP" &gt;{{cite web|last=Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program|title=Radiation in the Environment|url=http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/fusrap/docs/fusrap-fs-radenvironment-2008-09.pdf|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk. (20 yr X 0.85 mSv/yr X 0.001 Sv/mSv X 5.5%/Sv = ~0.1%) That "existing risk" is much higher; an average American would have a one in ten chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation.

Internal contamination due to ingestion, inhalation, injection, or absorption is a particular concern because the radioactive material may stay in the body for an extended period of time, "committing" the subject to accumulating dose long after the initial exposure has ceased, albeit at low dose rates. Over a hundred people, including [[Eben Byers]] and the [[radium girls]], have received [[committed dose]]s in excess of 10 Gy and went on to die of cancer or natural causes, whereas the same amount of acute external dose would invariably cause an earlier death by [[acute radiation syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=R.E.|title=Radium in Humans: A Review of U.S. Studies|year=1994|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|url=http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0029.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal exposure of the public is controlled by regulatory limits on the radioactive content of food and water. These limits are typically expressed in [[becquerel]]/kilogram, with different limits set for each contaminant.

==History==
Although radiation was discovered in late 19th century, the dangers of radioactivity and of radiation were not immediately recognized. Acute effects of radiation were first observed in the use of X-rays when [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he attributed them to ozone rather than to X-rays. His injuries healed later.

The genetic effects of radiation, including the effects on cancer risk, were recognized much later. In 1927 [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] published research showing genetic effects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muller|first=Hermann Joseph|title=Artificial Mutation of the Gene|journal=Science|date=22 July 1927|volume=LXVI|issue=1699|pages=84–87|url=http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/m/hjm-1927a.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2012|doi=10.1126/science.66.1699.84|pmid=17802387}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1946 was awarded the [[Nobel prize]] for his findings. Radiation was soon linked to bone cancer in the [[radium dial painters]], but this was not confirmed until large-scale animal studies after World War II. The risk was then quantified through long-term studies of [[atomic bomb survivors]].

Before the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicians and corporations had begun marketing radioactive substances as [[patent medicine]] and [[radioactive quackery]]. Examples were radium [[enema]] treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. [[Marie Curie]] spoke out against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later died of [[aplastic anemia]], not cancer. [[Eben Byers]], a famous American socialite, died of multiple cancers in 1932 after consuming large quantities of [[radium]] over several years; his death drew public attention to dangers of radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death in enthusiasts, radium-containing medical products had nearly vanished from the market.

In the United States, the experience of the so-called [[Radium Girls]], where thousands of radium-dial painters contracted oral cancers, popularized the warnings of occupational health associated with radiation hazards. [[Robley D. Evans (scientist)|Robley D. Evans]], at MIT, developed the first standard for permissible body burden of radium, a key step in the establishment of [[nuclear medicine]] as a field of study. With the development of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s in the 1940s, heightened scientific attention was given to the study of all manner of radiation effects.

==Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats in the diets of hunter-gatherers==
It has been claimed that among hunter-gatherer populations, omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats are typically consumed in roughly a 1:1 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;"Populations maintaining historic omega-6 to omega-3 ratios (approximately 1 to 1) are protected from many of the scourges of the modern age." Source: Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; At one extreme of the spectrum of hunter-gatherer diets, the [[Greenland Inuit]], prior to the late Twentieth Century, consumed a diet in which omega-6s and omega-3s were consumed in a 1:2 ratio, thanks to a diet rich in cold-water fish (which are a rich source of omega-3s) and completely devoid of omega-6-rich seed oils.&lt;ref&gt;William Lands, ''Fish, Omega-3 and Human Health.'' Urbana, Illinois: APCS Press, 2005, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats==
To date, "no one knows what the optimal ratio in the diet is for these two families of fats."&lt;ref name="Susan Allport 2007, p. 115"&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3 Fats Were Removed From the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Allport writes that the current ratio in Japan is associated with a very low incidence of heart and other diseases. A dietary ratio of 4:1 produces almost a 1:1 ratio of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in cell membranes."&lt;ref name="Susan Allport 2007, p. 115"/&gt;

Andrew Stoll, who advocates the consumption of the two fats in a 1:1 ratio, states, "Once in the body, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids follow parallel pathways, continually competing with each other for chemical conversion to various structures and molecules inside and outside the cells. Given this mechanism, it makes sense that the two fats might be required in approximately equal amounts."&lt;ref name="Andrew Stoll 2001, p. 40"&gt;Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Stoll and Allport assert that present-day diets in the developed world have departed dramatically from this ratio. It has been estimated that in developed countries, the ratio of Omega-6s to Omega-3s is closer to 15:1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12442909 | year = 2002 | last1 = Simopoulos | first1 = AP | title = The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids | volume = 56 | issue = 8 | pages = 365–79 | journal = Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy | doi=10.1016/S0753-3322(02)00253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate is that "[t]he [[Standard American Diet#Standard American Diet|diet consumed by the typical American]] tends to contain 14 - 25 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids."&lt;ref&gt;http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/omega6-fatty-acids&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3793">'''Rice bran solubles''' are a nutritional product derived from the [[bran]] shavings produced as brown rice is converted into white rice.

Rice bran solubles are used as a nutritional supplement.  The supplement is sometimes called tocos because of its high content of [[tocopherol]]s (vitamin E).  Rice bran solubles contains about 15-40% [[fat]], 0-25% [[dietary fiber]], 0-15% [[protein]], and 25-80% [[carbohydrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 6303586 | inventor = Patricia McPeak, Rukmini Cheruvanky, Reddy Sastry V.

The '''Voluntary Guidelines to support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012d}}: "Background to the Voluntary Guidelines."&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Right to Food Guidelines''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2012a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a document adopted by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] in 2004, with the aim of guiding states to implement the [[right to food]]. It is not legally binding, but directed to states' obligations to the right to food under international law. In specific, it is directed towards States Parties to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[ICESCR]]) and to States that still have to ratify it. &lt;ref&gt;Katharine S. E. Cresswell Riol 2017: "The Right to Food Guidelines, Democracy and Citizen Participation: Country case studies."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1945, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) is founded.

In 1996, the FAO organises the 1996 [[World Food Summit]], in Rome. It requested that the right to food be given a more concrete and operational content.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2012a}}: "Right to Food."&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]] and the [[World Food Summit Plan of Action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We pledge our political will and our common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rome Declaration on World Food Security|1996}}: para. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1999, [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted General Comment No.12 ‘The Right to Adequate Food’ and described the various State obligations derived from the [[ICESCR]] regarding the right to food. It places three types of obligation on States Parties: the obligation to respect, to protect and to fulfil the right to food (which includes the obligations to facilitate and to provide).

In 2002, at the [[World Food Summit]] in June, the FAO adopted the [[Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; calling for the establishment of an intergovernmental working group to prepare a set of guidelines on the implementation of the right to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2012a}}: "Right to Food."&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the FAO Council set up an Intergovernmental Working Group which drafts the Right to Food Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the Right to Food Guidelines are adopted by 187 Member States of the General Council of the FAO.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2012a}}: "Right to Food."&lt;/ref&gt; The Guidelines build on international law and are a set of recommendations States have chosen on how to implement their obligations under Article 11 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2012a}}: "Right to Food."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] summarised the Right to Food guidelines in six phases or aspects to realizing the right to food:

# Providing '''basic prerequisites''', such as: good governance, democracy, non-discriminating [[Market (economics)|markets]], engaging in a multi-stakeholder approach including the private sector and civil society, and allocating sufficient national financial resources to anti-hunger and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012d}}: "I Enabling Environment."&lt;/ref&gt;
# Provide an enabling environment by adopting relevant '''strategies and policies''', such as: diverse and sustainable economic development in support of food security, adopting a legal “human-rights-based approach”, developing the relevant institutions, making access to natural secure and non-discriminatory, setting indicators for monitoring and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012d}}: "II Policies and Strategies."&lt;/ref&gt;
# Implementing a '''legal framework''' to enforce the right to food and the three state obligations of respecting, providing and fulfilling, such as: immediate and progressive implementation of policies, making states accountable, guaranteeing autonomous and independent human rights institutions, and educating in particular children and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012d}}: "III Legal Framework."&lt;/ref&gt;
# Guaranteeing on the market the '''availability of food''' which is adequate and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012d}}: "IV Adequate Food."&lt;/ref&gt;
# Provide extra '''support for vulnerable''' populations, including providing food for those who do not have access to adequate food for reasons beyond their control. Measures include: implementing safety nets for the weakest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012d}}: "V Vulnerable Populations."&lt;/ref&gt;
# Prepare for '''emergencies''', man made or natural disasters, and obligations to provide international food aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012d}}: "VI Emergencies."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the book|other uses|The Good Doctor (disambiguation)}}
'''''The Good Doctors: The Medical Committee for Human Rights and the Struggle for Social Justice in Health Care''''' is a 2009 non-fiction book by historian [[John Dittmer]].  The book documents the history of the [[Medical Committee for Human Rights]] (MCHR), a group of health professionals who delivered health care to wounded protesters and victims of police violence during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[anti-war movement]] in the United States in the 1960s, at a time when the health care system in the [[Southern United States|South]] was still segregated.&lt;ref name="blum"&gt;Blumenthal, Daniel S. (August 2010). "Review." ''Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved'', 21 (3): 1088-1089. {{doi|10.1353/hpu.0.0328}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, Martha F. (2011). "Review."  ''The American Historical Review'', 116 (2): 478-479. {{doi|10.1086/ahr.116.2.478}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Physician [[Walter Lear]] founded the Medical Committee for Civil Rights (MCCR) in 1963 to address the entrenched racism in the policies of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) which enabled Southern states to deny African American physicians the same rights as whites.  The group originally protested the AMA in Atlantic City in 1963, but widened their reach when hundreds of health professionals representing MCCR participated in the August 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].  

Out of this momentum, a new group, the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR) was created in 1964 by Tom Levin, who was asked by the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) to organize a group of health care workers to support activists during [[Freedom Summer]] in Mississippi, a ten-week effort to register disfranchised African American voters.  MCHR was needed because there were few black physicians and whites would not treat the injuries of civil rights activists in Mississippi.

MCHR made several discoveries while supporting activists during the Freedom Summer.  They found that the public health system for African Americans was virtually nonexistent in Mississippi.  Due to segregation, white physicians would not treat black patients.  Most blacks had received almost no health care, and most had never visited a doctor.  With access to health care so limited, MCHR was imbued with a new purpose.  They became a permanent organization and founded field offices.  Soon after, community health care clinics began to emerge.  MCHR expanded from Mississippi into Alabama and Louisiana.  Their mission expanded further, treating veterans from the Vietnam War for PTSD, and calling for a non-profit national health care system.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Traveler's diarrhea''' ('''TD''') is a stomach and intestinal infection. TD is defined as the passage of unformed [[human feces|stool]] (one or more by some definitions, three or more by others) while traveling.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; It may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, and bloating.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; Occasionally [[bloody diarrhea]] may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Feldman| first1= Mark| title= Sleisenger and Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, Management| date= 2015| publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences| isbn= 9781455749898| page= 1924| edition= 10th| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4CMJBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1924| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160310133204/https://books.google.com/books?id=4CMJBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1924| archivedate= 2016-03-10| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most travelers recover within four days with little or no treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; About 10% of people may have symptoms for a week.&lt;ref name=AFP2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leder|first1=K|title=Advising travellers about management of travellers' diarrhoea.|journal=Australian family physician|date=2015|volume=44|issue=1–2|pages=34–37|pmid=25688957|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2015/januaryfebruary/advising-travellers-about-management-of-travellers%E2%80%99-diarrhoea/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112200909/http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2015/januaryfebruary/advising-travellers-about-management-of-travellers%E2%80%99-diarrhoea|archivedate=2017-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
[[Bacteria]] are responsible for more than half of cases.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; The bacteria [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterotoxigenic ''Escherichia coli'']] (ETEC) are typically the most common except in [[Southeast Asia]], where ''[[Campylobacter]]'' is more prominent.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; About 10% to 20% of cases are due to [[norovirus]].&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; [[Protozoa]] such as ''[[Giardia]]'' may cause longer term disease.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; The risk is greatest in the first two weeks of travel and among young adults.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt; People affected are more often from the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Recommendations for prevention include eating only properly cleaned and cooked food, drinking [[bottled water]], and frequent [[hand washing]].&lt;ref name=CDC2013/&gt; The [[oral cholera vaccine]], while effective for [[cholera]], is of questionable use for traveler's diarrhea.&lt;ref name=Coch2013Duk&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Ahmed| first1= T| last2= Bhuiyan| first2= TR| last3= Zaman| first3= K|last4=Sinclair|first4=D|last5=Qadri|first5=F|title=Vaccines for preventing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) diarrhoea | journal= The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=5 July 2013| volume= 7| pages= CD009029| pmid= 23828581| doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD009029.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventive [[antibiotic]]s are generally discouraged.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; Primary treatment includes drinking lots of fluids and replacing lost salts ([[oral rehydration therapy]]).&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2013/&gt; Antibiotics are recommended for significant or persistent symptoms, and can be taken with [[loperamide]] to decrease diarrhea.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; Hospitalization is required in less than 3% of cases.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, prognosis, and culture --&gt;
Estimates of the percentage of people affected range from 20 to 50% among travelers to the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; TD is particularly common among people travelling to Asia (except Japan), the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.&lt;ref name=CDC2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travelers-diarrhea|date=April 26, 2013|title=Travelers' Diarrhea|work=cdc.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313100404/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travelers-diarrhea|archivedate=March 13, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is moderate in [[Southern Europe]], Russia, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diemert|first1=D.

==Signs and symptoms==
The onset of TD usually occurs within the first week of travel, but may occur at any time while traveling, and even after returning home, depending on the incubation period of the infectious agent. Bacterial TD typically begins abruptly, but ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' may incubate for seven days, and ''[[Giardia]]'' for 14 days or more, before symptoms develop.  Typically, a traveler experiences four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are abdominal cramping, bloating, fever, and [[malaise]].  Appetite may decrease significantly.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;  Though unpleasant, most cases of TD are mild, and resolve in a few days without medical intervention.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safewateronline.com/travelers_d.htm|title=Travelers' diarrhea|publisher=safewateronline.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606032848/http://www.safewateronline.com/travelers_d.htm |archivedate = 6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood or [[mucus]] in the diarrhea, significant abdominal pain, or high fever suggests a more serious cause, such as [[cholera]], characterized by a rapid onset of weakness and torrents of watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (described as "rice water" stools).  Medical care should be sought in such cases; dehydration is a serious consequence of cholera, and may trigger serious [[sequela]]e—including, in rare instances, death—as rapidly as 24 hours after onset if not addressed promptly.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;

[[Pathogen|Infectious agent]]s are the primary cause of travelers' diarrhea. [[Enterobacteriaceae|Bacterial enteropathogens]] cause about 80% of cases.  [[Viruses]] and [[protozoans]] account for most of the rest.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt;

The most common causative agent isolated in countries surveyed has been [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterotoxigenic ''Escherichia coli'']] (ETEC).&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt; Enteroaggregative ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' is increasingly recognized.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt; ''[[Shigella]]'' [[spp.]] and ''[[Salmonella]]'' spp. are other common bacterial pathogens.  ''[[Campylobacter]]'', ''[[Yersinia]]'', ''[[Aeromonas]]'', and ''[[Plesiomonas]]'' spp. are less frequently found.  Mechanisms of action vary: some bacteria release [[toxin]]s which bind to the intestinal wall and cause diarrhea; others damage the intestines themselves by their direct presence.

While viruses are associated with less than 20% of adult cases of traveler's diarrhea, they may be responsible for nearly 70% of cases in infants and children. Diarrhea due to viral agents is unaffected by antibiotic therapy, but is usually self-limited.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;  Protozoans such as ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' and ''[[Cyclospora cayetanensis]]'' can also cause diarrhea. Pathogens commonly implicated in travelers' diarrhea appear in the table in this section.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ortega |first1=Ynés R. |last2=Sanchez |first2=Roxana |title=Update on ''Cyclospora cayetanensis'', a Food-Borne and Waterborne Parasite |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=218–234 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00026-09 |pmc=2806662 |pmid=20065331 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subtype of traveler's diarrhea afflicting hikers and campers, sometimes known as [[wilderness diarrhea]], may have a somewhat different frequency of distribution of pathogens.&lt;ref name="Zell1992" /&gt;

===Risk factors===
The primary source of infection is ingestion of [[fecal]]ly contaminated food or water. Attack rates are similar for men and women.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;

The most important determinant of risk is the traveler's destination. High-risk destinations include [[developing country|developing countries]] in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt; Among backpackers, additional risk factors include drinking untreated surface water and failure to maintain personal hygiene practices and clean cookware.&lt;ref name="pmid16805145"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hargreaves JS |title=Laboratory evaluation of the 3-bowl system used for washing-up eating utensils in the field |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=94–102 |year=2006 |pmid=16805145 |doi= 10.1580/PR17-05.1|url=http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(06)70296-4/fulltext |location=Diarrhea is a common illness of wilderness travelers, occurring in about one third of expedition participants and participants on wilderness recreation courses. The incidence of diarrhea may be as high as 74% on adventure trips. …Wilderness diarrhea is not caused solely by waterborne pathogens, … poor hygiene, with fecal-oral transmission, is also a contributing factor |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campsites often have very primitive (if any) sanitation facilities, making them potentially as dangerous as any developing country.

Although traveler's diarrhea usually resolves within three to five days (mean duration: 3.6 days), in about 20% of cases, the illness is severe enough to require bedrest, and in 10%, the illness duration exceeds one week.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;  For those prone to serious infections, such as  [[bacillary dysentery]], [[amoebic dysentery]], and [[cholera]], TD can occasionally be life-threatening.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;  Others at higher-than-average risk include young adults, [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] persons, persons with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or [[diabetes]], and those taking [[H2 antagonist|H2 blockers]] or [[antacids]].&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt;

===Immunity===
Travelers often get diarrhea from eating and drinking foods and beverages that have no adverse effects on local residents. This is due to [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] that develops with constant, repeated exposure to pathogenic organisms. The extent and duration of exposure necessary to acquire immunity has not been determined; it may vary with each individual organism. A study among expatriates in Nepal suggests that immunity may take up to seven years to develop—presumably in adults who avoid deliberate pathogen exposure.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Shlim, [http://www.ciwec-clinic.com/diar/index.html#9 Understanding Diarrhea in Travelers. A Guide to the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of the World's Most Common Travel-Related Illness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524201811/http://www.ciwec-clinic.com/diar/index.html |date=2008-05-24 }}. [[CIWEC Clinic Travel Medicine Center]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, immunity acquired by American students while living in Mexico disappeared, in one study, as quickly as eight weeks after cessation of exposure.&lt;ref name="ostrosky"&gt;Luis Ostrosky-Zeichner, Charles D. Ericsson,

==Prevention==

===Sanitation===
Recommendations include avoidance of questionable foods and drinks, on the assumption that TD is fundamentally a [[sanitation]] failure, leading to bacterial contamination of drinking water and food.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt; While the effectiveness of this strategy has been questioned, given that travelers have little or no control over sanitation in hotels and restaurants, and little evidence supports the contention that food vigilance reduces the risk of contracting TD,&lt;ref name="CID-CHL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shlim|first1=DR|title=Looking for evidence that personal hygiene precautions prevent traveler's diarrhea.|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=1 December 2005|volume=41 Suppl 8|pages=S531-5|pmid=16267714|doi=10.1086/432947}}&lt;/ref&gt; guidelines continue to recommend basic, common-sense precautions when making food and beverage choices:&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt;

* Maintain good hygiene and use only [[safe water]] for drinking and brushing teeth.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;
* Safe beverages include bottled water, bottled [[carbonated]] beverages, and water boiled or appropriately treated by the traveler (as described below).&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt; Caution should be exercised with tea, coffee, and other hot beverages that may be only heated, not boiled.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;
* In restaurants, insist that bottled water be unsealed in your presence; reports of locals filling empty bottles with untreated tap water and reselling them as purified water have surfaced.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt; When in doubt, a bottled carbonated beverage is the safest choice, since it is difficult to simulate carbonation when refilling a used bottle.
* Avoid ice, which may not have been made with safe water.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;
* Avoid green salads, because the lettuce and other uncooked ingredients are unlikely to have been washed with safe water.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;
* Avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables unless cleaned and peeled personally.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;

If handled properly, thoroughly cooked fresh and packaged foods are usually safe.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt; Raw or undercooked meat and seafood should be avoided. [[Pasteurization|Unpasteurized]] milk, dairy products, mayonnaise, and pastry icing are associated with increased risk for TD, as are foods and beverages purchased from street vendors and other establishments where unhygienic conditions may be present.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;

===Water===
Although safe bottled water is now widely available in most remote destinations, travelers can treat their own water if necessary, or as an extra precaution.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt; 
Techniques include boiling, filtering, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet light; boiling is by far the most effective of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/the-pre-travel-consultation/water-disinfection-for-travelers&lt;/ref&gt; Boiling rapidly kills all active bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Prolonged boiling is usually unnecessary; most microorganisms are killed within seconds at water temperature above 55–70&amp;nbsp;°C (130–160&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods: Requisite Scientific Parameters for Establishing the Equivalence of Alternative Methods of Pasteurization, USDA, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/dining/bending-the-rules-on-bacteria-and-food-safety.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908185621/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/dining/bending-the-rules-on-bacteria-and-food-safety.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=2017-09-08 |df= }}. Retrieved October 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The second-most effective method is to combine filtration and chemical disinfection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/pdf/drinking/Backcountry_Water_Treatment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Filters eliminate most bacteria and protozoa, but not viruses. Chemical treatment with halogens—chlorine bleach, tincture of iodine, or commercial tablets—have low-to-moderate effectiveness against protozoa such as ''Giardia'', but work well against bacteria and viruses. 
UV light is effective against both viruses and cellular organisms, but only works in clear water, and it is ineffective unless manufacturer's instructions are carefully followed for maximum water depth/distance from UV source, and for dose/exposure time. Other claimed advantages include short treatment time, elimination of the need for boiling, no taste alteration, and decreased long-term cost compared with bottled water.  The effectiveness of UV devices is reduced when water is muddy or turbid; as UV is a type of light, any suspended particles create shadows that hide microorganisms from UV exposure.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultraviolet Light Disinfection in the Use of Individual Water Purification Devices''.

===Medications===
[[Bismuth subsalicylate]] four times daily reduces rates of traveler's diarrhea.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Du2009/&gt; Though many travelers find a four-times-per-day regimen inconvenient, lower doses have not been shown to be effective.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Du2009/&gt; Potential side effects include black tongue, black stools, nausea, constipation, and [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]]. Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken by those with [[aspirin]] allergy, kidney disease, or [[gout]], nor concurrently with certain antibiotics such as the [[quinolones]], and should not be taken continuously for more than three weeks.{{mcn|date=June 2017}}  Some countries do not recommend it due to the risk of rare but serious side effects.&lt;ref name=Du2009/&gt;

A [[colostrum#Hyperimmune colostrum|hyperimmune bovine colostrum]] to be taken by mouth is marketed in Australia for prevention of ETEC-induced TD.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; --&gt; As yet, no studies show efficacy under actual travel conditions.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt;

Though effective, antibiotics are not recommended for prevention of TD in most situations because of the risk of allergy or adverse reactions to the antibiotics, and because intake of preventive antibiotics may decrease effectiveness of such drugs should a serious infection develop subsequently. Antibiotics can also cause [[vaginal yeast infections]], or overgrowth of the bacterium ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', leading to [[pseudomembranous colitis]] and its associated severe, unrelenting diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;Travelers' Diarrhea. [http://www.travdoc.com/articles/28.html The Travel Doctor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201035514/http://www.travdoc.com/articles/28.html |date=2011-02-01 }} Retrieved March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic may be warranted in special situations where benefits outweigh the above risks, such as immunocompromised travelers, chronic intestinal disorders, prior history of repeated disabling bouts of TD, or scenarios in which the onset of diarrhea might prove particularly troublesome. Options for prophylactic treatment include the quinolone antibiotics (such as [[ciprofloxacin]]), [[azithromycin]], and [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]], though the latter has proved less effective in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Adachi J, et al. Empirical Antimicrobial Therapy for Traveler's Diarrhea. ''Clinical Infectious Diseases''; Vol. 31 Issue 4 (10/1/2000), p1079.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rifaximin]] may also be useful.&lt;ref name=Du2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=DuPont, H | title=Therapy for and Prevention of Traveler's Diarrhea | journal= Clinical Infectious Diseases | issue=45 (Suppl 1) | pages=S78–S84 | year=2007 | doi=10.1086/518155 | volume=45 | pmid=17582576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quinolone antibiotics may bind to metallic cations such as bismuth, and should not be taken concurrently with bismuth subsalicylate. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should not be taken by anyone with a history of [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa]] allergy.{{mcn|date=June 2017}}

===Vaccination===
The [[oral cholera vaccine]], while effective for prevention of cholera, is of questionable use for prevention of TD.&lt;ref name=Coch2013Duk/&gt; A 2008 review found tentative evidence of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jelinek T, Kollaritsch H | year = 2008 | title = Vaccination with Dukoral against travelers' diarrhea (ETEC) and cholera | url = | journal = Expert Rev Vaccines | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 561–7 | doi = 10.1586/14760584.7.5.561 | pmid = 18564011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 review stated it may be reasonable for those at high risk of complications from TD.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; Several vaccine candidates targeting ETEC or ''Shigella'' are in various stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index4.html World Health Organization.

===Probiotics===
One 2007 review found that [[probiotics]] may be safe and effective for prevention of TD, while another review found no benefit.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt; A 2009 review confirmed that more study is needed, as the evidence to date is mixed.&lt;ref name=Du2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DuPont|first1=HL|last2=Ericsson|first2=CD|last3=Farthing|first3=MJ|last4=Gorbach|first4=S|last5=Pickering|first5=LK|last6=Rombo|first6=L|last7=Steffen|first7=R|last8=Weinke|first8=T|title=Expert review of the evidence base for prevention of travelers' diarrhea.|journal=Journal of travel medicine|date=2009|volume=16|issue=3|pages=149–60|pmid=19538575|doi=10.1111/j.1708-8305.2008.00299.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Most cases of TD are mild and resolve in a few days without treatment, but severe or protracted cases may result in significant fluid loss and dangerous [[electrolyte disturbance|electrolytic imbalance]]. Dehydration due to diarrhea can also alter the effectiveness of medicinal and contraceptive drugs. Adequate fluid intake ([[oral rehydration therapy]]) is therefore a high priority. Commercial rehydration drinks&lt;ref&gt;Rehydration drinks.

===Antibiotics===
If diarrhea becomes severe (typically defined as three or more loose stools in an eight-hour period), especially if associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or blood in stools, medical treatment should be sought. Such patients may benefit from antimicrobial therapy.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt;  A 2000 literature review found that antibiotic treatment shortens the duration and severity of TD; most reported side effects were minor, or resolved on stopping the antibiotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Bruyn G, Hahn S, Borwick A | year = 2000 | title = Antibiotic treatment for travellers' diarrhoea | url = | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 3 | page = CD002242 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antibiotic recommended vary based on the recommendation being traveled too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Travelers' Diarrhea |url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travelers-diarrhea |website=CDC |accessdate=19 November 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole]] and [[doxycycline]] are no longer recommended because of high levels of resistance to these agents.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt; Antibiotics are typically given for three to five days, but single doses of [[azithromycin]] or [[levofloxacin]] have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sanders JW |title=Azithromycin and loperamide are comparable to levofloxacin and loperamide for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in United States military personnel in Turkey |journal=Clin.

===Antimotility agents===
Antimotility drugs such as [[loperamide]] and [[diphenoxylate]] reduce the symptoms of diarrhea by slowing transit time in the gut.  They may be taken to slow the frequency of stools, but not enough to stop bowel movements completely, which delays expulsion of the causative organisms from the intestines.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt; They should be avoided in patients with fever, bloody diarrhea, and possible inflammatory diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/gastroenterology/acute-diarrhea/Default.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030320/http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/gastroenterology/acute-diarrhea/Default.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse reactions may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hives or rash, and loss of appetite.&lt;ref&gt;Diphenoxylate package insert.

==Epidemiology==
An estimated 10 million people—20 to 50% of international travelers—develop TD each year.&lt;ref name=CDC_TD&gt;{{cite web |title=Travelers' Diarrhea |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/travelersdiarrhea_g.htm |date=November 21, 2006 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403234924/http://www.cdc.gov/NCIDOD/DBMD/DISEASEINFO/travelersdiarrhea_g.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is more common in the developing world, where rates exceed 60%, but has been reported in some form in virtually every travel destination in the world.&lt;ref name=Epi05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steffen|first=R|title=Epidemiology of traveler's diarrhea|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=Dec 1, 2005|volume=41 Suppl 8|pages=S536–40|pmid=16267715|doi=10.1086/432948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
''Montezuma's revenge'' (var. ''Moctezuma's revenge'') is a colloquial term for traveler's diarrhea contracted in Mexico. The name refers to [[Moctezuma II]] (1466–1520), the [[Tlatoani]] (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] civilization who was [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|overthrown]] by the Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] in the early 16th century, thereby bringing large portions of what is now Mexico and Central America under the rule of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish crown]].

===Wilderness diarrhea===
{{Main article|Wilderness acquired diarrhea}}
[[Wilderness acquired diarrhea|Wilderness diarrhea]], also called wilderness-acquired diarrhea (WAD) or backcountry diarrhea, refers to diarrhea among backpackers, hikers, campers and other outdoor recreationalists in wilderness or backcountry situations, either at home or abroad.&lt;ref name="Zell1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zell SC |title=Epidemiology of Wilderness-acquired Diarrhea: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |journal=J Wilderness Med |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=1992 |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S0953-9859(92)71235-2/pdf |doi=10.1580/0953-9859-3.3.241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is caused by the same fecal microorganisms as other forms of traveler's diarrhea, usually bacterial or viral.  Since wilderness campsites seldom provide access to sanitation facilities, the infection risk is similar to that of any developing country.&lt;ref name="pmid16805145"/&gt;  Water treatment, good hygiene, and dish washing have all been shown to reduce the incidence of WAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boulware|first1=DR|title=Medical risks of wilderness hiking|journal=American Journal of Medicine|date=2003|issue=March|pmid=12681456|volume=114|pages=288–93|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01494-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntosh|first1=SE|title=Medical Incidents and Evacuations on Wilderness Expeditions|journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine|date=2007|issue=Winter|pmid=18076301|doi=10.1580/07-WEME-OR-093R1.1|volume=18|pages=298–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;
