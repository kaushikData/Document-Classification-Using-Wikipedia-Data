'''Alaverdi Monastery''' ({{lang-ka|ალავერდის მონასტერი}}) is a [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Eastern Orthodox]] [[monastery]] located {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} from [[Akhmeta]], in the [[Kakheti]] region of Eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. While parts of the monastery date back to 6th century, the present day cathedral was built in the 11th century by [[Kvirike III of Kakheti]], replacing an older church of St. George.&lt;ref&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5221/ Alaverdi Cathedral] UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The monastery was founded by the [[Thirteen Assyrian Fathers|Assyrian]] monk Joseph (Yoseb, Amba) Alaverdeli, who came from Antioch and settled in Alaverdi, then a small village and former pagan religious center dedicated to the Moon. At a height of over {{convert|55|m|abbr=on}}, Alaverdi Cathedral was the tallest religious building in Georgia, until the construction of the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi]], which was consecrated in 2004. However its overall size is smaller than the cathedral of [[Svetitskhoveli]] in [[Mtskheta]]. The monastery is the focus of the annual religious celebration [[Alaverdoba]]. Situated in the heart of the world's oldest [[wine]] region, the monks also make their own wine, known as [[Alaverdi Monastery Cellar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.iamwine.it/en/producers/18-alaverdi-monastery-cellar |title=I Am Wine: Alaverdi Monastery Cellar |access-date=2013-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516023308/http://iamwine.it/en/producers/18-alaverdi-monastery-cellar |archive-date=2012-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Premio Iberoamericano de Poesía Pablo Neruda 2015 - Augusto de Campos.jpg|thumb|Augusto de Campos (2015)]]
'''Augusto de Campos''' (born 14 February 1931, [[São Paulo]]) is a [[Brazi]]lian writer who (with his brother [[Haroldo de Campos]]) was a founder of the [[Concrete poetry]] movement in Brazil. He is also a translator, music critic and visual artist.

In 1952, he founded the literary magazine ''[[Noigandres]]'' with his brother. Then in 1956 he and his associates declared the beginning of a movement. Since then he has had a number of collections and honors.
From the 1950s to 1970s his main works were directed to visual poetry but from 1980 on, intensified his experiments with the new media, presenting his poems on electric billboard, videotext, neon, hologram and laser, computer graphics, and multimedia events, involving sound and music, as the plurivocal reading of CIDADECITYCITÉ (with Cid Campos), 1987/1991.
Four of his holographic poems (in cooperation with the holographer [[Moysés Baumstein]] ) were included in the exhibitions TRILUZ (1986) and IDEHOLOGIA (1987). A videoclippoem, PULSAR, with music by Caetano Veloso, was produced in 1984 in an Intergraph high resolution computer station. BOMB POEM and SOS, with music by his son, Cid Campos, were animated in a Silicon Graphic Computer Station of the University of São Paulo, 1992-3. His cooperation with Cid, begun in 1987 resulted in POESIA É RISCO (Poetry is Risk), a CD launched by PolyGram in 1995 and developed in a multimedia performance with the same title, a "verbivocovisual" show of poetry/music/image, which gained video-editing by Walter Silveira, and has been presented in several cities in Brazil and abroad. An installation assembling his digital poetic animations. In 2017 he was honoured by the [[:hu:Janus Pannonius Költészeti Nagydíj|Janus Pannonius Grand Prize for Poetry]] (award of the Hungarian PEN Club).

In [[digital photography]], a '''bias frame''' is an image obtained from an opto-electronic [[image sensor]], with no actual exposure time. The image so obtained only contains unwanted signal due to the electronics that elaborate the sensor data, and not unwanted signal from charge accumulation (e.g. from [[dark current (physics)|dark current]]) within the sensor itself.

A bias frame is complementary to a [[dark frame]], which has a charge integration time but in darkness.
Since a dark frame contains unwanted signal including a [[fixed-pattern noise]] component, some of which corresponds to the bias frame, and some of which is due to dark current and is proportional to the exposure time, it is possible to obtain an image representing only the dark-current component by subtracting a bias frame from a dark frame.  The resulting image allows obtaining an "artificial" dark frame when multiplied by a factor depending on exposure time and then added back to the bias frame. Although this technique is less accurate than shooting a dark frame for each specific exposure duration, it has the advantage of drastically reducing the time needed to obtain dark-frame data for [[dark frame subtraction]].

[[File:Jan Karol Chodkiewicz 1.PNG|thumb|Hetman [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz|Chodkiewicz]] of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], holding a ''buława'']]
[[File:Buława Rydza-Śmigłego.JPG|right|thumb|''Buława'' of Polish Marshal [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]]]]

The '''bulava''' or '''buława''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] spelling: ''buława''; [[Ukraine]] spelling:  ''булава'' [''bula'va'']) is a [[ceremonial mace]] or [[club (weapon)|baton]].

==Poland, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth==
Historically the ''buława'' was an attribute of a [[hetman]], an officer of the highest [[military rank]]  (after the monarch) in the 15th- to 18th-century [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Hetmans typically added an image of a ''buława'' to their [[coat of arms|coats of arms]].

Today the ''buława'' appears in the [[Military rank|rank]] insignia of a [[List of Marshals of Poland|Marshal of Poland]].

==Ukraine==
In the Ukrainian language, a ''булава'' (bulava) is a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] or [[club (weapon)|club]], in both the military and ceremonial senses. The ''bulava'' was part of the Ukrainian Cossack ''kleinody'' ("jewels") that were awarded by Hetman [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] to the [[Zaporizhian Host]].&lt;ref name="kleinody"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://history.franko.lviv.ua/IIk_3.htm Definition of ''kleinody'' in the ''Handbook of the History of Ukraine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the ''bulava'' was an attribute of a [[hetman]], an officer of the highest [[military rank]], and of the [[Otaman]] of [[Ukraine]] or the military head of a [[Cossack]] state ([[Cossack Hetmanate]]).

Under the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (Ukraine)|General Staff]] of the Ukrainian Army was called the "General Bulava". 

The ''[[Bulava of the President of Ukraine|bulava]]'' is now an official emblem of the [[President of Ukraine]], and is housed in [[Ukraine]]'s [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine|Vernadsky National Library]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2519">In [[English law]] (and other countries which adopt the rule), the '''cab-rank rule''' is the obligation of a [[barrister]] to accept any work in a field in which they profess themselves competent to practise, at a court at which they normally appear, and at their usual rates. The rule derives its name from the tradition by which a [[Hackney carriage]] driver at the head of a queue of taxicabs is supposed to take the first passenger requesting a ride.

The cab rank rule is set out at rC29 of the [[Bar Standards Board]] Handbook. It states that if you receive instructions from a professional client and the instructions are appropriate taking into account your experience, seniority and/or field of practice, you must (subject to the
exceptions in rC30) accept those instructions irrespective of:
# The identity of the client;
# The nature of the case to which the instructions relate;
# Whether the client is paying privately or is publicly funded; and
# Any belief or opinion which you may have formed as to the character, reputation, cause, conduct, guilt or innocence of the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/media/1691033/cab_rank_rule_guidance_september_2015.pdf |title=Guidance on the Cab Rank Rule |work=Code of Conduct of the Bar of England &amp; Wales |publisher=Bar Standards Board|accessdate=12 October 2016 |date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the cab-rank rule, an unpopular person might not get legal representation; barristers who acted for them might be criticised for doing so.

Addressing the continued necessity for the rule in 2010, the [[Law Society of England and Wales]], which represents solicitors, together with [[General Council of the Bar|The Bar Council]] said:

A '''callback''', in terms of [[comedy]], is a [[joke]] that refers to one previously told in the set. It is also known as an internal [[allusion]], a literary device that helps give structure to the piece of writing. Callbacks are usually saved for later, towards the end of a set, the result is usually a much bigger laugh the second time as the audience is much more surprised the longer it's held back. The main principle behind the callback is to make the [[audience]] feel a sense of familiarity with the subject material, as well as with the comedian. It helps to create audience rapport. When the second joke is told, it induces a feeling similar to that of being told a personal or [[in-joke]].

==Television==
In television, the term callback has come to mean a joke or line that refers to a previous episode (or sometimes, in rare cases, movies). Particularly in earlier [[sitcoms]]—though even until the early 1990s—callbacks were rare and often frowned upon by networks, because they threaten to alienate a viewer who is new to the series, or who has missed episodes, particularly if the callback is tied to previous episodes (this is especially a threat to a show's [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] value, as shows in which the episodes are self-contained, and thus can be [[rerun]] out of order, can fetch a higher sale price than shows that must be [[serial (radio and television)|run in sequence]]). 

''[[Seinfeld]]'', a show built around [[stand-up comedy]], was one of the first sitcoms to regularly use callbacks in its scripts,{{cn|date=August 2016}} although on a level that would often be missed or disregarded by viewers; its use of the strategy commonly kept the callbacks confined to events in the same episodes, having the effect of bringing the episode full-circle or creating an [[irony|ironic]] [[twist ending]]. A more recent series, ''[[30 Rock]]'', employs callbacks to reference fictitious movies and television programs created within the show. ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' became well known by fans for its regular use of callbacks throughout all of its episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn |first=Gillian |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20211793,00.html |title=TV shows on the big screen &amp;#124; Arrested Development |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The line between a callback and simple [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] can be ambiguous. Repeatedly calling back to the same joke is a [[running gag]].

====NE Monsoon in Chennai====
The city of Chennai is located on the east coast of India, which is also known as the [[Coromandel Coast]].
Chennai is largely dependent on [[Monsoon#Northeast monsoon|NE monsoon]], since 65% of rains are received in this season. Cyclones and depressions are common features during the season. Cyclones in particular are really unpredictable. They can even move towards [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], west [[Bengal]], [[Bangladesh]], and also [[Myanmar]]. The season between October and December is referred as the NE monsoon period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/12imd.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Floods are common during this period. In [[2015 Chennai Floods|2015 Chennai]] received record breaking rains since 1918, which caused massive floods.

The entire east coast is vulnerable to cyclones during the monsoon period. For example, in 2007 a major cyclone named "[[Cyclone Sidr]]" skipped Chennai and headed towards Bangladesh. The result was a failure of NE monsoon in Chennai, that particular year. Even in the past, there has been many occasions where Cyclones had a great influence in the monsoon.

===Land usage===
As of 2018, the city had a green cover of 14.9 percent, against the [[World Health Organization]] recommendation of 9&amp;nbsp;square meters of green cover per capita in cities. The city had a built-up area of 71 percent. Waterbodies cover an estimated 6 percent of the total area, and at least 8 percent of the area has classified as open space.&lt;ref name="Hindu_228CrProjectForGreen"&gt;{{cite news

===Politics===
Since the 19th century, when Western scholars proposed that [[Dravidian languages]], which dominated the southern region of India, formed a different linguistic group to that of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] that are predominant in the north of the subcontinent, the aspects of Tamil nationalism gained prominence. This resulted in the [[Anti-Hindi agitations]] in the city and across the state. However, the post-[[Partition of India|Independence]] re-organisation of Indian states according to linguistic and ethnic basis has moderated Tamil nationalism, especially the demand for separation from the Indian Union. The [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|Anti-Hindi agitations in mid-1960s]] made the DMK more popular and more powerful political force in the state. The agitations of the 1960s played a crucial role in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics.&lt;ref name="hindu3"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/Readers-Editor/article61129.ece | title = Language issue again: the need for a clear-headed policy | author = S.

Being the capital of the [[Madras Province]] that covered a vast area of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region, Chennai remained the centre of politics in the southern region of India during the British colonial era. After [[Partition of India|Independence]], it remained the centre of political activities of the state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Chennai is the birthplace of the idea of the [[Indian National Congress]], commonly known as the Congress Party. Founded by Indian and British members of the [[Theosophical Society]] movement, most notably [[Allan Octavian Hume|A.O. Hume]],&lt;ref name=bevir&gt;[http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/73b4862g?display=all Theosophy and the Origins of the Indian National Congress], Bevir, Mark, University of California, Berkeley, Publication Date: 1 January 2003 s. 14–18. Original Citation: Mark Bevir, "Theosophy and the Origins of the Indian National Congress", [[International Journal of Hindu Studies]] 7 (2003), 99–115. E.g., "Theosophical Society provided the framework for action within which some of its Indian and British members worked to form the Indian National Congress.", "1884 annual convention of the Theosophical Society. At this convention, Rao argued that the Society should start formally to discuss the political situation in India as well as more strictly religious matters. Although Rao did not get his way, he did arrange a meeting of sympathetic theosophists to be held at his home. Those who attended this meeting with Rao included Aiyar, Ananda Charlu, and M. Viraraghavachariar. They formed the Madras Mahajana Sabha," "meeting to coincide with the next annual convention of the Theosophical Society. This meeting would promote their idea of an all-India body." "Hume was probably the single most important individual for the formation of the Indian National Congress."&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was originally conceived in a private meeting of 17 men after a Theosophical Convention held in the city in December 1884.&lt;ref name=pattabhi&gt;Sitaramayya, B.

After independence, the city hosted the Congress in 1955 in its suburb of [[Avadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political and Social Conflict in South India; The non-Brahmin movement and Tamil Separatism, 1916–1929| edition=|last=Irschick|first=Eugene F.| year=1969|ref=harv|oclc=249254802| publisher=[[University of California Press]]| url=http://history.berkeley.edu/faculty/Irschick/Politics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chennai is also the birthplace of several regional political movements since the British era. South Indian Welfare Association, one of the earliest regional parties, was founded in 1916, which later came to be known as the [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], which was the main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state.&lt;ref name="rajaraman4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rajaraman|1988| loc=ch. 4 (Ideology, Organisation and Programme of the Justice Party)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irschick10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irschick|1969| pp=172–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the party was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] (DK) by [[E. V. Ramasami]] (popularly known as 'Periyar'). The party was a non-political party that demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Taylor |first = Richard Warren |title = Religion and Society: The First Twenty-five Years, 1953–1978 |publisher = Christian Literature Society (for the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society, Bangalore) |year = 1982 |oclc = 9007066 |page = 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the differences between its two leaders Periyar and [[C. N. Annadurai]], the party was split. Annadurai left the party to form the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). The DMK decided to enter into politics in 1956.

With the history of many neighbourhoods of the city such as [[Mylapore]], [[Triplicane]], and [[Tiruvanmiyur]] antedating that of the city, the architecture of Chennai ranges in a wide chronology. The oldest buildings in the city dates from the 7th and 8th centuries CE, which include the [[Kapaleeshwarar Temple]] in Mylapore and the [[Parthasarathy Temple]] in Triplicane, built in the [[Dravidian architecture]]. This architecture includes various styles, such as those of the [[Pallavas]], the [[Chola]]s, and the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] empires. The associated ''Agraharam'' architecture, which consists of traditional row houses surrounding a temple, can still be seen in these areas.&lt;ref name="Agraharam_TimeVirtuallyStandsStill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sujatha |first=R. |title=Agraharam – time virtually stands still here |newspaper=The Hindu |location=Chennai |date=29 April 2012 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article3367816.ece |accessdate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705142259/http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article3367816.ece |archivedate=5 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VanishingAgraharams"&gt;{{cite news | last = Iyer | first = Aruna V. | title = Chennai's vanishing agraharams | newspaper = The Hindu | location = Chennai | date = 7 October 2011 | url = http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/article2518383.ece | accessdate =28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Heritage Site|heritage temples]] at [[Mamallapuram]] at the outskirts of the city are some of the examples of the Pallava architecture.

[[File:World Bank Office in Taramani, Chennai.jpg|thumb|right|World Bank Office in Chennai]]

The [[Reserve Bank of India]] ranked Chennai as third largest deposit centre and third largest credit centre nationwide as of June 2012. Prior to the advent of modern commercial banks, the banking services in the city were offered to the public by ''Nattukottai Chettiars'' or ''Nagarathars'', chiefly in and around the neighbourhood of George Town, who offered loans as well as accepted money deposits from the public, in addition to offering loans to the agricultural labourers. Even today, many of the banking offices are housed in heritage structures belonging to the colonial era that are chiefly clustered around Rajaji road in George Town.&lt;ref name="TOI_BankingHeritageOfMadras"&gt;{{cite news|last=Suresh|first=S.|title=The Banking Heritage of Madras|newspaper=Times of India|location=Chennai|date=3 November 2012|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TOINEW&amp;BaseHref=TOICH/2012/11/03&amp;PageLabel=50&amp;EntityId=Ar05001&amp;ViewMode=HTML|access-date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chennai is home to the first European-style banking system in India with the establishment of the 'Madras Bank' on 21 June 1683, almost a century before the establishment of the first commercial banks, such as the Bank of Hindustan and the General Bank of India, which were established in 1770 and 1786, respectively.&lt;ref name="InsightIntoProgressOfBanking"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mukund|first=Kanakalatha|title=Insight into the progress of banking|newspaper=The Hindu|location=Chennai|date=3 April 2007|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2007/04/03/stories/2007040300301600.htm|access-date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the recommendation of the British Finance Committee on the formation of a government bank, the Madras Bank, then known as the 'Government Bank', started functioning again from 1806.

[[File:José Jiménez Aranda A Pass in the Bullring 1870.jpg|thumb|right|[[José Jiménez Aranda]] (1837–1903): ''The Bullring'' (1870)]]
'''''Costumbrismo''''' (sometimes anglicized as '''Costumbrism''')  is the literary or pictorial interpretation of local everyday life, mannerisms, and customs, primarily in the [[Hispanic]] scene, and particularly in the 19th century. ''Costumbrismo'' is related both to artistic [[realism (arts)|realism]] and to [[Romanticism]], sharing the Romantic interest in expression as against simple representation and the romantic ''and'' realist focus on precise representation of particular times and places, rather than of humanity in the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;José Escobar, [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/09250620855792739754480/p0000001.htm#I_0_ Costumbrismo entre Romanticismo y Realismo], Biblioteca Virtual Miguel Cervantes. Accessed online 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón"&gt;Antonio Reina Palazón, [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/romanticismo/actas_pdf/romanticismo_6/reina.pdf El Costumbrismo en la Pintura Sevillana del Siglo XIX], Biblioteca Virtual Miguel Cervantes. Accessed online 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often satiric and even moralizing, but unlike mainstream realism does not usually offer or even imply any particular analysis of the society it depicts. When not satiric, its approach to quaint [[folklore|folkloric]] detail often has a romanticizing aspect.

''Costumbrismo'' can be found in any of the visual or literary arts; by extension, the term can also be applied to certain approaches to collecting folkloric objects, as well. Originally found in short essays and later in novels, ''costumbrismo'' is often found in the ''[[zarzuela]]s'' of the 19th century, especially in the ''género chico''. ''Costumbrista'' museums deal with folklore and local art and ''costumbrista'' festivals celebrate local customs and [[artisans]] and their work.

Although initially associated with Spain in the late 18th and 19th century, ''costumbrismo'' expanded to [[the Americas]] and set roots in the Spanish-speaking portions of the Americas, incorporating indigenous elements. Juan López Morillas summed up the appeal of ''costumbrismo'' for writing about Latin American society as follows: the ''costumbristas&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' "preoccupation with minute detail, local color, the picturesque, and their concern with matters of style is frequently no more than a subterfuge. Astonished by the contradictions observed around them, incapable of clearly understanding the tumult of the modern world, these writers sought refuge in the particular, the trivial or the ephemeral."&lt;ref&gt;Juan López Morillas, ''El Krausismo español'' (1980), p. 129, quoted by Enrique Pupo-Walker, "The brief narrative in Spanish America 1835–1915", 490:535 in Roberto González Echevarría, Enrique Pupo-Walker, ''The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature: Discovery to modernism'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-34069-1}}.

==Literary ''costumbrismo'' in Spain==

===Origins===
[[File:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Duelo a garrotazos.jpg|thumb|Some of the work of [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]] can be seen as prefiguring ''costumbrismo'', especially as practiced in [[Madrid]]. Here, the ''[[Fight with Cudgels]]'', one of Goya's [[Black Paintings]].]]
Antecedents to ''costumbrismo'' can be found as early as the 17th century (for example in the work of playwright [[Juan de Zabaleta]]) and the current becomes clearer in the 18th century ([[Diego de Torres Villarroel]], [[José Clavijo y Fajardo]], [[José Cadalso]], [[Ramón de la Cruz]], [[Juan Ignacio González del Castillo]]). All of these writers have, in at least some of their work, an attention to specific, local detail, an exaltation of the "typical" that would feed into both ''costumbrismo'' and Romanticism. In the 19th century ''costumbrismo'' bursts out as a clear genre in its own right, addressing a broad audience: stories and illustrations often made their first or most important appearance in cheap periodicals for the general public.&lt;ref name=Soria-1&gt;Andrés Soria, [http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=9241&amp;cat=literatura Costumbrismo I.

Literatura Española] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114616/http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=9241&amp;cat=literatura |date=July 16, 2011 }}, Ediciones Rialp S.A.

[[File:Bartolomé Esteban Perez Murillo - Trauben- und Melonenesser.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Much as Goya influenced ''costumbrismo'' in Madrid, [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] influenced ''costumbrismo'' in [[Seville]].]]
[[Sebastián de Miñano y Bedoya]] (1779–1845) is considered by some a ''costumbrista'', although arguably his writing is too political to properly fit the genre. According to Andrés Soria, the first incontestable ''costumbristas'' are the anonymous and pseudonymous contributors to ''La Minerva'' (1817), ''El Correo Literario y Mercantil'' (1823–33) and ''El Censor'' (1820–23). Later come the major figures of literary ''costumbrismo'': [[Serafín Estébanez Calderón]] (1799–1867), [[Ramón de Mesonero Romanos]] (1803–82), and [[Mariano José de Larra]] (1809–37) who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym "Fígaro". Estébanez Calderón (who originally wrote for the abovementioned ''Correo Literario y Mercantil'') looked for a "genuine" and picturesque Spain in the recent past of particular regions; Mesonero Romanos was a careful observer of the [[Madrid]] of his time, especially of the middle classes; Larra, according to [[José Ramón Lomba Pedraja]], arguably transcended his genre, using the form of ''costumbrismo'' for political and psychological ideas. An ''afrancesado''—a [[liberalism|liberal]] child of [[the Englightenment|the Enlightenment]]—he was not particularly enamored of the Spanish society that he nonetheless observed minutely.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

''Costumbrismo'' was by no means without foreign influences. The work of [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] nearly a century earlier in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' had influenced French writers, who in turn influenced the ''costumbristas''. Furthermore, Addison and Steele's own work was translated into Spanish in the early 19th century, and Mesonero Romanos, at least, had read it in French.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; Still, an even stronger influence came by way of [[Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy]] (whose work appeared in translation in ''La Minerva'' and ''El Censor''), [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] (especially for ''Le Tableau de Paris'', 1781–88), [[Charles Joseph Colnet Du Ravel]], and [[Georges Touchard-Lafosse]].&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; In addition, there were the travelogues such as [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]]'s ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'',  written by various foreigners who had visited Spain and, in painting, the foreign artists (especially, [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]]) who had settled for a time especially in [[Seville]] and [[Granada]] and drew or painted local subjects.&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón" /&gt;

While Estébanez Calderón, Mesonero Romanos, and (insofar as he fits the genre) Larra were the major ''costumbrista'' writers, many other Spanish writers of the 19th century devoted all or part of their careers to ''costumbrismo''.

===''The Spanish Drawn By Themselves''===
[[File:Bookstore from Los Españoles pintados por sí mismos.jpg|thumb|left|An unsigned illustration from ''Los españoles pintados por sí mismos'': a book shop in Madrid.]]
Much as literary ''costumbrismo'' had been influenced by English models, often by way of France, the same occurred with the equivalent in the visual arts, but with far more recent models. In a period when [[physiognomy]] was in vogue, ''Heads of the People or Portraits of the English'' was serialized in London starting in 1838 and was published in its entirety in 1840–41. It combined essays by such "distinguished writers" (the volume's own choice of words) as [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] with pictures of individuals emblematic of different English "types". This was followed in France by a work first serialized as ''Les Français, Moeurs Contemporaines'' ("The French, Contemporary Manners", beginning in 1839) and published in a volume in 1842 as ''Les Français peints par eux-mêmes. Encyclopédie Morale du dixneuviéme siécle'' ("The French, drawn by themselves. Moral Encyclopedia of the 19th Century"). The Spanish soon followed with ''Los españoles pintados por sí mismos'' ("The Spanish Drawn By Themselves") serialized from 1842 and published in a volume in 1843.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An 1851 edition of ''Los españoles pintados por sí mismos'' is [https://books.google.com/books?id=VMt198jfSqoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false available online] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:El Coche Simon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"El Coche Simón", unsigned illustration from ''Los españoles…'']]
A collective and hence, necessarily, uneven anthology of "types", ''Los españoles…'' was a mixture of verse and prose, and of writers and artists from various generations. Illustrators included [[Leonardo Alenza]] (1807–45), [[Fernando Miranda]], [[Francisco Lameyer]] (1825–1877), [[Vicente Urrabieta y Ortiz]], and [[Calixto Ortega]]. The writers included Mesonero and Estébanez as well as various less ''costumbrista'' writers and many not usually associated with the genre, such as [[Gabriel García Tassara]] (1817–75) or the conservative politician [[Francisco Navarro Villoslada]] (1818–95). Andrés Soria remarks that, except for the Andalusian "types", everything was from the point of view of Madrid. Unlike later ''costumbrismo'', the focus remained firmly on the present day. In some ways, the omissions are as interesting as the inclusions: no direct representation of the aristocracy, of prominent businessmen, of the high clergy, or of the army, and except for the "popular" classes, the writing is a bit circumspect and cautious. Still, the material is strong on ethnological, folkloric, and linguistic detail.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

In an epilogue to ''Los españoles…'', "Contrastes. Tipos perdidos, 1825, Tipos hallados, 1845" ("Contrasts. Types lost, 1825, types found, 1845"), Mesonero on the one hand showed that the genre, in its original terms, was played out, and on the other laid the ground for future ''costumbrismo'': new "types" would always arise, and many places remained to be written about in this fashion. The book had many descendants, and a major reissue in 1871. A particularly strong current came out of [[Barcelona]]: for example, [[José M. de Freixas]]'s ''Enciclopedia de tipos vulgares y costumbres de Barcelona'' ("Encyclopedia of vulgar types and customs of Barcelona", 1844) illustrated by Servat,&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josep Izquierdo, [http://librodenotas.com/laguillotinapiano/14263/goya-en-tiempos-de-guerrilla-artistica Goya en tiempos de guerrilla artística], Libro de Notas, 2008-07-25. Accessed online 2010-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''El libro Verde de Barcelona'' ("The Green Book of Barcelona", 1848) by "José y Juan" ([[José de Majarrés]] and [[Juan Cortada y Sala]]. The very title of ''Los valencianos pintados por sí mismos'' ([[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] 1859) gave a nod of the hat to the earlier work,&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

A revival of collective works of ''costumbrismo'' in the time of the [[First Spanish Republic]] saw the reissue of ''Los españoles…'' (1872), as well as the publication of ''Los españoles de hogaño'' ("The Spanish these days", 1872), focused on Madrid, and the vast undertaking ''Las mujeres españolas, portuguesas y americanas…'' ("Spanish, Portuguese, and American Women…", published in Madrid, [[Havana]], and [[Buenos Aires]] in 1872–1873 and 1876).&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/9251 A very nice online version of volume 3 of ''Las mujeres…''] can be found on the site of Rice University as part of the Rice Digital Scholarship Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; Also from this time was the satiric ''Madrid por dentro y por fuera'' ("Madrid from inside and outside, 1873) by Manuel del Palacio (1831–1906).&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ángeles Ayala note"&gt;María de los Ángeles Ayala, [http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Scriptura/article/viewFile/94986/142847 ''Una docena de cuentos'', primera recopilación de cuentos de Narciso Campillo y Correa], ''Scriptura'' (University of Lleida), ISSN 1130-961X, Vol. 16, Number 16, 2001, 133:148.

[[Carlos Frontaura]] carried on ''costumbrismo'' in Madrid with ''Las tiendas'' ("Shops", 1886) and "Tipos madrileños" ("Madrid types", 1888). [[Ramón de Navarrete]] (1822–1897) writing variously as or "Asmodeo" (after [[Asmodeus]], king of the demons), broke with the history of the genre by writing of the upper classes in Madrid during the [[Spain under the Restoration|Restoration]], as in his ''Sueños y realidades ("Dreams and realities'', 1878). [[Enrique Sepúlveda]] wrote about&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; both Madrid&lt;ref name="Ángeles Ayala note" /&gt; and Barcelona, Narcís Oller (1846–1930) about Barcelona,&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; and [[Sabino de Goicoechea]] (1826–1901), known as "Argos", about the Basque Country.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilbao.net/castella/residentes/vivebilbao/publicaciones/periodicobilbao/200504/pag08.pdf Antiguo edificio del Banco de España], ''Bilbao'' magazine, 2005-04, p. 8.

===''Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow''===
[[File:Doce Espanoles de Brocha Gorda - title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Doce españoles de brocha gorda…'', drawn by [[Fernando Miranda]].]]
Poet, journalist and pamphleteer [[Antonio Flores Algovia]] (1821–65), one of the contributors to ''Los españoles…'' followed up in 1846 with ''Doce españoles de brocha gorda, que no pudiéndose pintar a sí mismos, me han encargado a mí, Antonio Flores, sus retratos''&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book is online at Google Books (in Spanish): [https://books.google.com/books?id=TesCAAAAYAAJ ''Doce españoles…'']&lt;/ref&gt; ("Twelve Spaniards with a broad brush, who not being able to portray themselves have put me, Antonio Flores, in charge of their portraits"), subtitled a "novel of popular customs" (''"novela de costumbres populares"''). Published in 1846 and reissued several times, the book merged the hitherto more essayistic ''costumbrista'' form with aspects of the [[novel]] (although not a particularly tightly plotted novel). Somewhat more novelistic was his ''Fe, Esperanza y Caridad'' ("Faith Hope and Charity"), published serially in ''La Nación''&lt;!-- many publications with this name; if we ever have an article on the right one, please link--&gt; in 1850–1851 and also much reprinted. Flores had been [[Eugène Sue]]'s translator into Spanish, and Sue's influence is strong in this work. Flores turned to again to ''custumbrismo'', of a sort, in 1853 with ''Ayer, hoy y mañana o la fe, el vapor y la electricidad (cuadros sociales de 1800, 1850 y 1899)'' ("Yesterday, today and tomorrow or faith, steam and electricity (social pictures of 1800, 1850, and 1899)") going Mesonero's "types lost" and "types found" one better by projecting a vision of the future influenced by the work of [[Émile Souvestre]]. His newspaper ''El Laberinto'' continued publishing his ''costumbrista'' work even posthumously, such as ''Tipos y costumbres españolas'' (1877).&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

[[Eugenio de Ochoa]] (1815–72) carried ''costumbrismo'' in a different direction.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; Born in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque country]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/o/ochoa_eugenio.htm Eugenio de Ochoa], Biografías y Vidas. Accessed online 2010-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and moving often between Spain and France, his 1860 book ''Museo de las familias. París, Londres y Madrid'' ("Museum of families. Paris, London, Madrid") created a sort of cosmopolitan ''costumbrismo''.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

===''Costumbrismo'' by major Spanish realists===
Many of the great Spanish realist writers of the 19th century worked at times in the ''costumbrista'' mode, especially at the start of their careers. [[Fernán Caballero]] (pen name of  Cecilia Francisca Josefa Böhl de Faber) (1796–1877), for example, in the prose portions of her ''Cuentos y poesías populares andaluzas'' ("Popular Andalusian stories and poems", collected in 1859 from prior publication in magazines), writes within the genre, particularly in "Una paz hecha sin preliminares, sin conferencias y sin notas diplomáticas" ("A peace made without preliminaries, without conferences, and without diplomatic notes"), with its very specific setting in [[Chiclana de la Frontera]].&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The story is [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;sig=bNbWBBn4Bw1X3DcEdSNjHS4nyCE&amp;ei=cZtXS4DFOY3mswPfxPjFBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=MiYRAAAAIAAJ&amp;ots=w9SNcmUnZ8#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false available online] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Antonio de Alarcón]] (1833–1891) issued a collection ''Cosas que fueron'', bringing together 16 ''costumbrista'' articles.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;
[[File:JMPereda.jpg|thumb|142px&lt;!--actual width of image--&gt;|left|[[José María de Pereda]]]]
Andrés Soria sees [[José María de Pereda]] (1833–1906) as the most successful fusion of ''costumbrista'' scenes into proper novels, especially his portrayals of ''La Montaña'', the mountainous regions of [[Cantabria]]. His ''Escenas montañesas'' (1864) is particularly in the ''costumbrista'' mode, with its mixture of urban, rural and seafaring scenes, and sections offering sketches of various milieus.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; Poet and novelist [[Antonio de Trueba]] (1819 or 1821–89) wrote squarely within the genre with ''Madrid por fuera'' and ''De flor en flor''. [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]] (1836–1870) portrayed Madrid, Seville, and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. [[José María Gabriel y Galán]] (1870–1905), best known as a poet, also wrote ''costumbrista'' pieces about [[Salamanca]]. [[Armando Palacio Valdés]] (1853–1938) also essayed the genre in newspaper articles, collected in ''Aguas fuertes'' ("Strong waters", 1884). The writer and diplomat [[Ángel Ganivet]] (1865–98),&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; seen by some as a precursor to the [[Generation of '98]],&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Solalinde, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/40043365 review of Melchor Fernández Almagro's ''Vida y Obra de Ángel Ganivet''], 1927. Accessed online 2010-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''costumbrista'' scenes of [[Granada]].&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

Elements of ''costumbrismo'', or even entire works in the genre, can be found among major Spanish writers of the 20th century, though to a lesser extent. [[Miguel de Unamuno]] (1864–1936) worked in the genre for ''De mi país'' ("Of my country", 1903) and some stories such as "Solitaña" in of ''El espejo de la muerte'' ("The Mirror of Death", 1913), as did [[Pío Baroja]] with ''Vitrina pintoresca'' ("Picturesque showcase", 1935) and in passages of his novels set in the Basque Country. [[Azorín]] (José Augusto Trinidad Martínez Ruíz, 1873–1967) often wrote in this genre; one could comb the works of [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]] (1888–1963) and [[Camilo José Cela]] (1916–2002) and find many passages that could come straight from a work of ''costumbrismo''. Although taken as a whole these writers are clearly not ''costumbristas'', they use the ''costumbrista'' style to evoke surviving remnants of Spain's past.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

===20th century literary ''costumbrismo'' in Spain===
The tradition of ''costumbrismo'' in Spain by no means ended at the turn of the century, but it simply did not play as important a role in 20th-century Spanish literature as it did in the century before. As noted [[#Costumbrismo by major Spanish realists|above]], several of the most important 20th-century Spanish writers at least dabbled in, or were influenced by, the genre. When we go beyond the first string of writers, we see more of a continuation of ''costumbrismo''.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

In the course of the century, more and more Spanish regions asserted their particularity, allowing this now established technique of writing to be given new scope. In other regions—Madrid, Andalusia—''costumbrismo'' itself had become part of the region's identity. The magazine ''[[España (magazine)|España]]'', founded 1915, wrote about some new "types": the indolent ''golfo''; the lower class ''señorito chulo'' with his airs and exaggerated fashions; the ''albañil'' or construction worker, but with far less sympathy than ''costumbristas'' in the previous century had portrayed their predecessors. Other "types" were those who were a caricature of times past: ''el erudito'', with his vast but pointless book-learning, or ''El poeta de juegos florales'' ("the poet of floral games").&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

[[File:Blasco Ibañez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]]]]
Andrés Soria describes 20th century regional ''costumbrismo'' as more serious, less picturesque, and more poetic than in the 19th century. Among his many examples of the 20th century continuation of ''costumbrismo'' are [[Santiago Rusiñol]] (1861–1931), writing in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] about [[Catalonia]] and [[Mallorca]]; numerous chroniclers of the Basque Country: [[José María Salaverría]] (1873–1940), [[Ricardo Baroja]] (1871–1953), [[Dionisio de Azkue]] ("Dunixi"), [[José María Iribarren]] (1906–1971), and, as mentioned above, Pío Baroja; [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] (1867–1928) writing about Valencia; and [[Vicente Medina Tomás]] (1866–1937), writing about Murcia.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

A strong current of ''costumbrismo'' continued in 20th-century Madrid, including in poetry ([[Antonio Casero]], 1874–1936) and theater ([[José López Silva (playwright)|José López Silva]], 1860–1925; [[Carlos Arniches Barreda]], 1866–1943). Other writers who continued the tradition were [[Eusebio Blasco]] (1844–1903), [[Pedro de Répide]] (1882–1947), [[Emiliano Ramírez Ángel]] (1883–1928), [[Luis Bello (writer)|Luis Bello]] (1872–1935), and [[Federico Carlos Sainz de Robles]] (1899–1983). Similarly, 20th century Andalusia saw work by [[José Nogales]] (1860?–1908), [[Salvador Rueda]] (1857–1933), [[Arturo Reyes]] (1864–1913), José Mas y Laglera (1885–1940), [[Ángel Cruz Rueda]] (1888–1961), and [[Antonio Alcalá Venceslada]] (1883–1955).&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

==''Costumbrismo'' in the visual arts in Spain==
[[File:JoaquinDominguezBecquer.jpg|thumb|An 1849 painting by [[Joaquín Domínguez Bécquer]] is typical of Andalusian costumbrismo.]]

Costumbrismo is an art form developed by Spanish painters. In the 19th-century, a wave of nationalistic fervour took hold, providing the stimulus for painters to focus on local customs (or ''costumbres''). &lt;ref&gt;Boone, E., ''Vistas de Espana,'' Yale University Press, 2007, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; As in literary ''costumbrismo'', Madrid and Andalusia (particularly Seville) were Spain's two great centers of ''costumbrismo'' in the visual arts. Andalusian ''costumbrista'' paintings were mainly romantic and folkloric, largely devoid of social criticism. Much of their market was to foreigners for whom Andalusia epitomized their vision of a Spain distinct from the rest of Europe. The ''costumbrista'' artists of Madrid were more acerbic, sometimes even vulgar, in portraying the life of lower class Madrid. More of their market was domestic, including to the often snobbish (and often Europeanizing and liberal) elite of the capital.&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ArteHist1&gt;[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/artesp/contextos/8132.htm La pintura costumbrista] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002051251/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/artesp/contextos/8132.htm |date=2009-10-02 }}, ArteHistoria (Junta de Castilla y León). Accessed online 2010-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the School of Madrid often used large masses of solid color and painted with a broad brush, while the School of Seville painted more delicately. The Madrid paintings have a certain urgency, while the Seville paintings are typically serene, even misty. The Madrid painters focus more on unique individuals, the Sevillianos on individuals as representatives of a type.&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón" /&gt;

Romantic Andalusian ''costumbrismo'' (''costumbrismo andaluz'') follows in the footsteps of two painters of the School of Cádiz, [[Juan Rodríguez y Jiménez]], "el Panadero" ("the Baker", 1765–1830) and [[Joaquín Manuel Fernández Cruzado]] (1781–1856), both associated with Romanticism. The trend was continued by the School of Seville, in a city much more on the path of a foreign clientele. The founding figure was [[José Domínguez Bécquer]] (1805–41), father of the poet Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer (see [[#Costumbrismo by major Spanish realists|above]]) and painter [[Valeriano Bécquer]] (1833–70), who moved to Madrid. Domínguez Bécquer's influence came as an art teacher, as well as an artist. His student and cousin [[Joaquín Domínguez Bécquer]] (1817–79) was known for his acute observation of light and atmosphere. Another of José Domínguez Bécquer's students, the bold and forceful [[Manuel Rodríguez de Guzmán]] (1818–67), may have been the genre's strongest painter.&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

Other important early figures were [[Antonio Cabral Bejarano]] (1788–1861), best known for paintings of individuals theatrically posed against rural backgrounds, and an atmosphere reminiscent of [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], and [[José Roldán]] (1808–71), also very influenced by Murillo, known especially as a painter of children and urchins. One of Cabral Bejarano's sons, [[Manuel Cabral Bejarano]] (1827–91) began as a ''costumbrista'', but eventually became more of a [[realism (arts)|realist]]. Another son, [[Francisco Cabral Bejarano]] (1824–90), also painted in the genre.&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

Other painters of the School of Seville were [[Andrés Cortés]] (1810–79), [[Rafael García Hispaleto]] (1833–54), Francisco Ramos, and Joaquín Díez; history painter [[José María Rodríguez de Losada]] (1826–96); and portraitist [[José María Romero (artist)|José María Romero]] (1815–80).&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

Typical subject matter included ''[[majo]]s'' (lower class [[Dandy|dandies]]) and their female equivalents, horsemen, bandits and smugglers, street urchins and beggars, Gypsies, traditional architecture, fiestas, and religious processions such as [[Holy Week in Seville]].

[[File:LEONARDO ALENZA - Sátira del suicidio romántico (Museo Romántico, Madrid, c. 1839).jpg|thumb|left|upright|One of [[Leonardo Alenza]]'s "Romantic Suicides".]]
The School of Madrid was united less by a common visual style than by an attitude, and by the influence of [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]] rather than Murillo.&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt; Notable in this school were [[Leonardo Alenza|Alenza]] and [[Francisco Lameyer|Lameyer]], both contributors to ''Los españoles pintados por sí mismos''. Alenza, in particular, showed a strong influence from the [[Flanders|Flemish]] painters as well as from Goya. A fine portraitist who tended to take his subjects from among the common people, in some ways he epitomizes the difference between the School of Madrid and that of Seville. For him the "official" Romanticism was a topic to satirize, as in his series of paintings ''Suicidios románticos'' ("Romantic suicides").&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

[[File:Tercio de varas (Eugenio Lucas Velázquez).jpg|thumb|right|"Tercio de varas" ("[[Picador]]s"), [[Eugenio Lucas Velázquez]] c. 1850]]
Probably foremost in the School of Madrid was [[Eugenio Lucas Velázquez]] (1817–70). An artistic successor to Goya (though a more erratic painter than the master), Lucas Velázquez's work ranged from [[bullfighting]] scenes to [[Orientalism]] to scenes of [[witchcraft]]. His son [[Eugenio Lucas Villamil]] (1858–1918) and his students [[Paulino de la Linde]] (1837-?) and [[José Martínez Victoria]] followed in his tracks; he was also a strong influence on [[Antonio Pérez Rubio]] (1822–88) and [[Ángel Lizcano Monedero]] (1846–1929).&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

[[José Elbo]] (1804–44) was at least strongly akin to the School of Madrid. Although born in [[Úbeda]] in the Andalusian [[provinces of Spain|province]] of [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]], Elbo studied painting in Madrid under [[José Aparicio]] (1773–1838), and was influenced by Goya; he was also influenced by the [[Central Europe]]an equivalents of ''costumbrismo''. His painting is rife with social criticism, and often angrily populist.&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

Also in Madrid, but not really part of the School of Madrid, was Valeriano Bécquer (transplanted son of José Domínguez Bécquer). Although also influenced by Goya (and by [[Diego Velázquez]]), his work in Madrid did partake of some of the socially critical aspects of the other painters of that city, but not of the satiric aspects: his portraits of common people emphasize their dignity, seldom their foibles.&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

The dark vision of 20th-century Madrid painter [[José Gutiérrez Solana]] (1886–1945) was influenced by ''costumbrismo'' and also directly by the [[Black Paintings]] of Goya that had so influenced the ''costumbristas''.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

[[File:Arrietatertulia1.jpg|thumb|[[Agustín Arrieta|José Agustín Arrieta]], ''Tertulia de pulquería'', 1851]]
In nineteenth-century Mexico, colonial-era [[casta|casta paintings]], a type of secular [[genre painting]] depicting racial categories and hierarchy disappeared at independence when casta categories were abolished, but costumbrismo paintings resonated with the stereotypes of the earlier genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mey-Yen Moriuchi, "From Casta to Costumbrismo: Representations of Racialized Social Spheres" in ''Envisioning Others: Race: Color, and the Visual in Iberia and Latin America'', Pamela A. Patton, ed. Leiden: Brill 2016, pp. 213-240&lt;/ref&gt; A number of foreign visitors to Mexico produced images in the costumbrista tradition, including [[Claudio Linati]]&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Linati, ''Costumes, Civil, Militaires et Religieux du Mexique. Dessinés d;aorès Nature par C. Linati''. Bruxelles: Litographie Royal de Jobard 1828.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edouard Pingret]]. The most significant Mexican costumbrista painter is [[Agustín Arrieta|José Agustín Arrieta]], whose paintings of a market scene (''"La Sorpresa"''), a kitchen scene (''"La Cocina Poblana"''), and a tavern scene (''Tertulia de pulquería'') are well known.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny O.

==Literary ''costumbrismo'' in the Americas==

===Argentina===
[[File:Juan Bautista Alberdi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]]]]
Some of [[Argentina]]'s most distinguished writers worked in the ''costumbrista'' genre in at least some of their writing, though few worked narrowly within the genre. [[Esteban Echeverría]] (1805–51) was a politically passionate Romantic writer whose work has strong ''costumbrista'' aspects; his ''[[El Matadero]]'' ("The Slaughterhouse") is still widely read. [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]] (1810–84) and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] (1811–1888) both wrote at times in the genre, as did [[José Antonio Wilde]] (1813–83), in ''Buenos Aires desde setenta años atrás'' ("Buenos Aires from seventy years ago"); [[Vicente G. Quesada]] (1830–1913), in ''Recuerdos de un viejo'' ("Memories of an old man"); [[Lucio V. López]] (1848–94), in the novela ''La gran aldea'' ("The big village"); [[Martín Coronado]] (1850–1919), playwright; [[Martiniano Leguizamón]] (1858–1935), in the novel ''Montaraz''; [[José S. Alvarez]] (1858–1903, "Fray Mocho"), in the story "Viaje al país de los matreros" ("A trip to bandit country"); [[Emma de la Barra]] (1861–1947), who wrote under the pseudonym [[César Duayen]], in ''Stella''; [[Joaquín V. González]] (1863–1923), in ''Mis montañas'' ("My Mountains"); [[Julio Sánchez Gardel]] (1879–1937), in numerous comedies; and [[Manuel Gálvez]] (1882–1962), in such novels as ''La maestra normal'' ("The [[normal school]] teacher") and ''La sombra del convento'' ("The sleep of the convent").&lt;ref name=Escudero&gt;Alfonso M.

Gran Enciclopedia Rialp, 1991. Accessed online 2010-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolivia===
[[Bolivia]]n ''costumbristas'' include [[Julio Lucas Jaimes]] (1845–1914), [[Lindaura Anzoátegui de Campero]] (1846–98), [[Jaime Mendoza]] (1874–1938), [[Alcides Arguedas]] (1879–1946), and [[Armando Chirveches]] (1881–1926).&lt;ref name=Escudero/&gt;

===Central America===
[[Guatemala]]n novelist and historian [[José Milla]] (1822–82) wrote several ''costumbrista'' works and created the character of ''[[Juan Chapín]]'', the emblematic Guatemalan. Other Central American ''costumbristas'' are [[José María Peralta Lagos]] (1875–1944, [[El Salvador]]), [[Ramón Rosa]] (1848–93, [[Honduras]]), [[Carlos Alberto Uclés]] (1854–1942, Honduras), and a distinguished line of [[Costa Rica]]n writers: [[Manuel de Jesús Jiménez]] (1854–1916), [[Manuel González Zeledón]] (1864–1936), the verse writer [[Aquileo Echeverría]] (1866–1909), and, in the 20th century, [[Joaquín García Monge]] (1881–1958).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Chile===
[[File:Jose Joaquin Vallejo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[José Joaquín Vallejo]] ("Jotabeche") ''The Chilean [[Mariano José de Larra|Larra]]'']]
''Costumbrismo'' enters [[Chile]]an literature in some of the writing of [[José Zapiola]] (1804–85), [[Vicente Pérez Rosales]] (1807–86), [[Román Fritis]] (1829–74), [[Pedro Ruiz Aldea]] (ca. 1833–70) and especially [[José Joaquín Vallejo]] (1811–58), who under the name "Jotabeche" was the supreme Chilean ''costumbrista''.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

Strong aspects of ''costumbrismo'' can be seen in the novels and other works of [[Alberto Blest Gana]] (1830–1920). There are many ''costumbrista'' passages in the works of [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]] (1831–86)  and [[Daniel Barros Grez]](1833–1904); [[Román Vial]] (1833–1896) entitled one of his books ''Costumbres chilenas''; [[Zorobabel Rodríguez (writer)|Zorobabel Rodríguez]] (1839–1901), [[Moisés Vargas]] (1843–98), [[Arturo Givovich]] (1855–1905), Daniel Riquelme (1854–1912), [[Senén Palacios]] (1858–1927), [[Egidio Poblete]] (1868–1940) all wrote in the mode at times. ''Costumbrismo'' figures particularly heavily in stage comedies: ''El patio de los Tribunales'' ("The courtyard of the tribunals [of justice]", by [[Valentín Murillo]] (1841–1896); ''Don Lucas Gómez'', by [[Mateo Martínez Quevedo]] (1848–1923); ''Chincol en sartén'' ("A sparrow in the pan") and ''En la puerta del horno'' ("In the [[gates of horn and ivory|gate of horn]]"), by [[Antonio Espiñeira]] (1855–1907); ''La canción rota'' ("The broken song"), by [[Antonio Acevedo Hernández]] (1886–1962); ''Pueblecito'' ("Little town") by [[Armando Moock]] (1894–1942). In prose, ''costumbrismo'' mixes eventually into realism, with [[Manuel J. Ortiz]] (1870–1945) and [[Joaquín Díaz García]] (1877–1921) as important realists with ''costumbrista'' aspects.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Colombia===
[[File:Fi 322 Isaacs, Jorge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jorge Isaacs]]]]
[[Colombia]] can claim one of the earliest antecedents to the ''costumbrismo'' in ''[[El Carnero]]'' (written 1636–38, but not published until 1859) by [[Juan Rodríguez Freile]] (1566–1638 or 1640),&lt;ref&gt;Escudero says 1638, Stephen M. Hart says 1640.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodríguez's work begins as a chronicle of the conquest of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], but as it approaches his own time it becomes more and more detailed and quotidian, and its second half is a series of narratives that, according to Stephen M. Hart, give "lip service" to conventional morality while taking "a keen delight in recounting the various skullduggeries of witches, rogues, murderers, whores, outlaws, priests and judges."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Hart, ''A companion to Latin American literature'', Volume 243 of Colección Támesis. Serie A, Monografías, Tamesis Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-85566-147-0}}. p. 50–51. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ieEBqvGsaOoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Accessed online] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombia can also claim a particularly rich tradition of ''costumbrismo'' in the 19th century and into the 20th: [[José Manuel Groot]] (1800–78); novelists [[Eugenio Díaz]] (1803–65), [[José Manuel Marroquín]] (1827–1908), and [[José María Vergara y Vergara]] (1831–72), all of whom collaborated on the magazine ''El Mosaico, la revista bogotana del costumbrismo'' (1858–71); [[Luis Segundo Silvestre]] (1838–87); and [[Jorge Isaacs]] (1837–95), whose sole novel ''[[María (novel)|María]]'' was praised by Alfonso M. Escudero as the greatest Spanish-language romantic novel.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

Other Colombian ''costumbristas'' are [[José Caycedo Rojas]] (1816–1897), [[Juan de Dios Restrepo]] (1823–94), [[Gregorio Gutiérrez González]] (1826–72), [[Ricardo Carrasquilla]] (1827–86), [[Camilo A. Echeverri]] (1827–87), [[Manuel Pombo]] (1827–98), [[José David Guarín]] (1830–90), [[Ricardo Silva (writer 1836-87)|Ricardo Silva]] (1836–87), [[José María Cordovez Moure]] (1835–1918), [[Rafael María Camargo]] (1858–1926; wrote under the pseudonym [[Fermín de Pimentel y Vargas]]), and [[Tomás Carrasquilla]] (1858–1940).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Cuba===
[[Cuba]]'s leading ''costumbristas'' were [[Gaspar Betancourt Cisneros]] (1803–66, known as "El Lugareño"), [[Cirilo Villaverde]] (1812–94), and [[José María de Cárdenas y Rodríguez]] (1812–82). The patrician Betancourt published a series of ''Escenas cotidianas que abren camino al costumbrismo en Cuba'' ("Day-to-day scenes that open a road to ''costumbrismo'' in Cuba, 1838–40). His work focused often on what he found vulgar or ridiculous about Cuban life, but was written with a fatherly affection.  Villaverde, probably Cuba's greatest ''costumbrista'', wrote romantic novels, most notably ''[[Cecilia Valdés]]'' (the first part of which was published in 1839, although the definitive version was not published until 1882). This ''costumbrista'' [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] novel can be seen as an early realist work, and continues to be read in recent times. Villaverde also wrote the prologue for Cárdenas's 1847 collection of ''costumbrista''articles.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;
 
[[José Victoriano Betancourt]] (1813–75) was patron to many intellectuals in 1860s [[Havana]]; he later went into exile in Mexico. He is best remembered today as a ''costumbrista'' writer, as is another Betancourt, [[José Ramón Betancourt]] (1823–90), author of ''Una feria de caridad en 183…'' (ellipses in original title), set in [[Camagüey]] in the late 1830s.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Ramón Betancourt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=btdN-x8HzesC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Una feria de caridad en 183…]'', Third Edition, Barcelona, 1885.

===Dominican Republic===
In the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Francisco Gregorio Billini]] (1844–94) stands out for his novel ''Baní o Engracia y Antoñita'' (1892).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt; Still, in some ways, his vision was narrow. J. Alcántara Almánzar remarks that "black people are practically absent as important characters, and this absence is very significant in a country whose majority is 'mulatto'." Blacks are more present in the ''costumbrista'' works of [[Cesar Nicolas Penson]] (1855–1901), but he is far more sympathetic to his white characters, portraying [[Haiti]]ans as fierce beasts.&lt;ref name="Alcántara Almánzar"&gt;J. Alcántara Almánzar [http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/nwig/article/viewFile/3372/4133 Black images in Dominican literature] in New West Indian Guide/Nieuwe West-Indische Gids 61 (1987), no: 3/4, Leiden, 161:173.

===Ecuador===

[[Ecuador]]ians who wrote at least part of the time in the ''costumbrista'' mode include [[Pedro Fermín Cevallos]] (1812–93), [[Juan León Mera]] (1832–94), [[José Modesto Espinosa]] (1833–1915), [[Carlos R. Tobar]] (1854–1920), [[Honorato Vázquez]] (1855–1933), [[Víctor M. Rendón]] (1859–1940), [[J. Trajano Mera]] (1862–1919), and [[Luis A.

===Mexico===
Mexican ''costumbrismo'' can claim one of the longest lineages to be found in the Americas. In the same era in which the genre was gaining an identity in Spain, [[José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi]] (1776–1827) Mexico's first novelist (and perhaps Latin America's first novelist) wrote works that had many similar aspects, including ''Periquillo Sarniento'' (1816), recently translated into English as ''[[The Mangy Parrot]]''.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Tuck, [http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/277-mexico-s-voltaire-jos%C3%A9-joaqu%C3%ADn-fern%C3%A1ndez-de-lizardi-1776%E2%80%931827 Mexico's Voltaire: José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi (1776–1827)], Mexconnect.com, 2008-10-09.

In addition, [[José López Portillo y Rojas]] (1850–1923), [[Rafael Delgado]] (1853–1914), [[Ángel del Campo]] (1868–1908) and [[Emilio Rabasa]] (1856–1930) can be seen as ''costumbristas'', but their work can also be considered realist.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Paraguay===
[[Paraguay]]an ''costumbristas'' include [[Teresa Lamas Carísimo de Rodríguez Alcalá]] (1887–1976) and [[Carlos Zubizarreta]] (1904–72).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Peru===
[[File:Palma1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ricardo Palma]]]]
[[Peru]]vian ''costumbrismo'' begins with [[José Joaquín de Larriva y Ruiz]] (1780–1832), poeta and journalist and his younger, irreverent, Madrid-educated collaborator [[Felipe Pardo y Aliaga]] (1806–68). A more festive and comic note was struck by [[Manuel Ascensio Segura]] (1805–71). [[Manuel Atanasio Fuentes]] (1820–29) wrote verse under the name ''El Murciélago'' ("the Bat"), a name which he also gave to a magazine he founded.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

[[Ricardo Palma]] (1833–1919), best known for the multi-volume ''[[Tradiciones peruanas]]'', was a man of letters, a former liberal politician and later the director of the [[National Library of Peru]], who rebuilt the collection of that library after the [[War of the Pacific]]. He referred to his works in this mode as ''tradiciones'', rather than ''costumbrismo''.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Conway, "Chronology of Ricardo Palma", p.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1607">{{hatnote|This article is about the obsolete legal procedure. For the process of reviewing a decision already made by a court, see [[Appeal]] or [[Appellate court]]}}
A '''criminal appeal''' was a procedure in [[English law]] to bring about the [[prosecution]] of an individual accused of some crime. A private individual (the "appellor") would accuse another (the "appellee") of a crime, without the need for proceedings to be brought by the [[The Crown|crown]]. It possibly descended from the system of [[weregild]].

Appeals were among the legal proceedings for which [[trial by combat]] was available.

An appeal could be used to accuse a [[British subject|subject]] of [[high treason]]. It could also be used by someone when either they or a close relation had been the victim of a crime, such as [[murder]], [[rape]] or [[arson]].

An acquittal following an appeal prevented any further prosecution for the same offence (the doctrine of [[double jeopardy]]), just as if the proceedings had been brought by the crown (by [[indictment]]). The person bringing the appeal would be punished.

Unlike crown prosecutions, if a person was convicted, the crown did not have the option of a [[pardon]].

Appeals were abolished in [[England and Wales|England]] following the 1817 case of [[Ashford v Thornton]] where an appeal was withdrawn following the defendant requesting a trial by battle.

The '''''Dalhousie Journal of Legal Studies''''' is a non-profit, academic [[law journal]] that publishes work from current law students and recent alumni in Canada and throughout the world. It is produced by students from the [[Schulich School of Law]] (formerly Dalhousie Law School).

==History==
Established in 1991, the Dalhousie Journal of Legal Studies is a forum that promotes reflection and debate about contemporary legal issues. As one of the only publications of its kind in [[Canada]], the Journal serves as a unique vehicle for law students to publish their work.

The DJLS is published once per academic year and maintains a broad subscription base that includes law firms, law school libraries, corporations, government departments, alumni, and legal professionals from around the globe. The Journal is also indexed in the HeinOnline database.

An entirely student-run publication, the DJLS is managed by an editorial board, and over seventy volunteers comprising students from the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie assist in production and publication.

It is distinct from the [[Dalhousie Law Journal]] which is a peer-reviewed journal produced by faculty, rather than students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.dal.ca/Research,%20Journals%20and%20Publications/Journals/Dalhousie_Law_Journal/index.php |title=Schulich School of Law |publisher=Law.dal.ca |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rees' latest work is ''The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History'', published by [[Bloomsbury]] (August 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-vagina-a-literary-and-cultural-history-9781623568719/ |title=The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History |publisher=Bloomsbury |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book in [[United Kingdom|British]] daily newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', Kaite Welsh began by saying, "For readers disappointed by Naomi Wolf's treatise on a similar topic last year, this is the book you’ve been waiting for. If Wolf's book was billed as ''Vagina: A New Biography'', this could be subtitled ''A New Bibliography''. An enjoyable romp through depictions of female genitalia from oral history to adverts, Rees examines the changing role of the cultural vagina." Welsh found that, "Although Rees is an academic by trade, the book gleefully mixes highbrow and lowbrow, from Chaucer to [[Horror film|21st-century horror]]", adding that, "If the book has a flaw, it is that it's mis-titled in the same way that Eve Ensler's Monologues were. This is a book more about the [[vulva]] itself than simply the [[vagina]] – [[labia]] and [[clitoris]] get their fair share of attention – but Rees acknowledges the sensationalist desire to talk simply about the part that gets penetrated and the way this obscures women's sexual desire. Would ''The Vulva Monologues'' have garnered quite that much attention?" She concluded her review by writing, "Rees lacks Wolf's sometimes po-faced anger, instead mixing her [[Feminism|feminist]] outrage with a healthy dose of humour. Ever the cunning linguist, she leaves no pun unmade, but doesn’t skimp on the theory either, the perfect antidote for those feminists who find too much of the terminology dry and academic. This may not be the definitive text on the vagina – Rees is clear that she can't overturn centuries of embarrassment and taboo in a single book – but it's an excellent place to start."&lt;ref name="The Independent 24 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last= Welsh |first= Kaite |title= Book review: The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History, By Emma Rees|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-review-the-vagina-a-literary-and-cultural-history-by-emma-rees-8783684.html| date= 24 August 2013|newspaper= [[The Independent]] |location=London| accessdate= 31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}

'''Environmental, social and governance''' ('''ESG''') refers to the three central factors in measuring the [[sustainability]] and ethical impact of an [[investment]] in a company or [[business]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Kell]] ([[United Nations Global Compact]]), [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/five-trends-corporate-social-responsbility-global-movement "Five trends that show corporate responsibility is here to stay"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 August 2014 (page visited on 28 January 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

These criteria help to better determine the future financial performance of companies (return and risk).&lt;ref name=Eccles&gt;Robert Eccles, Ioannis Ioannou and George Serafeim, [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-key-corporate-success "Is sustainability now the key to corporate success? Companies that adopted environmental, social and governance policies in the 1990s have outperformed those that didn't"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 January 2012 (page visited on 28 January 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Historical decisions of where financial assets would be placed were based on various criteria, financial return being predominant.&lt;ref&gt;1. Coleman, James S, ''Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital'' , (American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 94, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have always been plenty of other criteria for deciding where to place your money – from Political considerations to Heavenly Reward. It was in the 1950s and 60s that the vast [[pension funds]] managed by the Trades Unions recognised the opportunity to affect the wider social environment using their capital assets&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B.C., ''Trade Union Government and Administration in Great Britain'' (Harvard University Press, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; - in the [[United States]] the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers invested their considerable [[capital (economics)|capital]] in developing [[affordable housing]] projects, whilst the [[United Mine Workers]] invested in health facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Hillel, ''New Directions in the Investment and Control of Pension Funds'', (Investor Responsibility Research Center, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the worldwide abhorrence of the [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]] led to one of the most renowned examples of selective [[disinvestment]] along ethical lines. As a response to a growing call for [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against the regime, the [[Reverend Leon Sullivan]], a board member of [[General Motors]] in the United States, drew up a Code of Conduct in 1971 for practising business with South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} What became known as the [[Sullivan Principles]] attracted a great deal of attention and several reports were commissioned by the government, to examine how many US companies were investing in South African companies that were contravening the Sullivan Code. The conclusions of the reports led to a mass disinvestment by the US from many South African companies. The resulting pressure applied to the South African regime by its business community added great weight to the growing impetus for the system of apartheid to be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesullivanfoundation.org|title=The leon H. Sullivan Foundation|work=thesullivanfoundation.org|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619122409/http://thesullivanfoundation.org/#|archive-date=19 June 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, [[Milton Friedman]], in direct response to the prevailing mood of [[philanthropy]] argued that social responsibility adversely affects a firm's financial performance and that regulation and interference from "big government" will always damage the macro economy.&lt;ref&gt;Freidman, Milton and Rose, ''Free to Choose, A Personal Statement'', (Harcourt, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; His contention that the valuation of a company or asset should be predicated almost exclusively on the pure bottom line (with the costs incurred by social responsibility being deemed non-essential), underwrote the belief prevalent for most of the 20th century. Towards the end of the century however a contrary theory began to gain ground. In 1988 James S. Coleman wrote an article in the [[American Journal of Sociology]] entitled ''Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital'', the article challenged the dominance of the concept of ‘self-interest’ in economics and introduced the concept of [[social capital]] into the measurement of value.&lt;ref&gt;9. Coleman, James S, Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a new form of pressure applied, acting in a coalition with environmental groups, it used the [[Leverage (finance)|leveraging]] power of its collective investors to encourage companies and capital markets to incorporate environmental and social challenges into their day-to-day decision-making. The [http://ceres.org/ Ceres coalition] today represents one of the world's strongest investment groups with over 60 institutional investors from the U.S. and Europe managing over $4 trillion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceres.org|title=Ceres - Mobilizing Business Leadership for a Sustainable World|work=ceres.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of selective investment was not a new one with the demand side of the investment market having a long history of those wishing to control the effects of their investments, what began to develop at the turn of the 21st century was a response from the supply-side of the equation. The investment market began to pick up on the growing need for products geared towards what was becoming known as the Responsible Investor. In 1998 [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]], co-founder of the business consultancy SustainAbility, published ''Cannibals with Forks: the Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business'' in which he identified the newly emerging cluster of non financial considerations which should be included in the factors determining a company or equity's value. He coined the phrase the "[[triple bottom line]]", referring to the financial, environmental and social factors included in the new calculation. At the same time the strict division between the environmental sector and the financial sector began to break down. In the [[City of London]] in 2002, Chris Yates-Smith a member of the international panel chosen to oversee the technical construction, accreditation and distribution of the Organic Production Standard and founder of one if the City of London's leading Branding Consultancies, established one of the first environmental finance research groups. The informal group of financial leaders, city lawyers and environmental stewardship [[NGO]]s became known as ''The Virtuous Circle'', its brief was to examine the nature of the correlation between environmental and social standards and financial performance. Several of the world's big banks and investment houses began to respond to the growing interest in the ESG investment market with the provision of sell-side services, among the first were the Brazilian bank [[Unibanco]], and Mike Tyrell's Jupiter Fund in London which used ESG based research to provide both [[HSBC]] and [[Citicorp]] with selective investment services in 2001.

In the early years of the new millennium, the major part of the investment market still accepted the historical assumption that ethically directed investments were by their nature likely to reduce financial return. Philanthropy was not known to be a highly profitable business and Friedman had provided a widely accepted academic basis for the argument that the costs of behaving in an ethically responsible manner would outweigh the benefits. However the assumptions were beginning to be fundamentally challenged. In 1998 two journalists Robert Levering and Milton Moskowitz had brought out the ''Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For'', initially a listing in the magazine ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', then a book compiling a list of the best practicing companies in the United States with regard to [[corporate social responsibility]] and how their financial performance fared as a result. Of the three areas of concern that ESG represented, the environmental and social had received most of the public and media attention, not least because of the growing fears concerning [[climate change]]. Moskowitz brought the spotlight onto the corporate governance aspect of responsible investment. His analysis concerned how the companies were managed, what the stockholder relationships were and how the employees were treated. He argued that improving corporate governance procedures did not damage financial performance, on the contrary it maximised productivity, ensured corporate efficiency and led to the sourcing and utilising of superior management talents. In the early 2000s, the success of Moskowitz's list and its impact on company's ease of recruitment and brand reputation began to challenge the historical assumptions regarding the financial effect of ESG factors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Ballou, B., Godwin, Norman H., Toppe Shortridge, Rebecca, ''Firm Value and Employee Attitudes on Workplace Quality'', (Accounting Horizons, Vol. 17, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Alex Edmans, a finance professor at Wharton, published a paper in the ''Journal of Financial Economics'' showing that the 100 Best Companies to Work For outperformed their peers in terms of stock returns by 2-3% a year over 1984-2009, and delivered earnings that systematically exceeded analyst expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=985735 Edmans, Alex, ''Does the Stock Market Fully Value Intangibles? Employee Satisfaction and Equity Prices'', (Journal of Financial Economics Vol. 101, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Finance Initiative commissioned a report from the international law firm [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]] on the interpretation of the law with respect to investors and ESG issues. The Freshfields report concluded that not only was it permissible for investment companies to integrate ESG issues into investment analysis but it was arguably part of their fiduciary duty to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unepfi.org|title=UNEP Finance Initiative: Innovative financing for sustainability|work=unepfi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/freshfields_legal_resp_20051123.pdf Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer ''A Legal Framework for the Integration of Environmental, Social and Governance Issues into Institutional Investment: A Report Produced for the Asset management Working Group of the UNEP FI'', 2005 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)]] confirmed that there was no bar on pension trustees and others from taking account of ESG factors when making investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/fiduciary_duties.htm |title=Law Commission |work=justice.gov.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924041547/http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/fiduciary_duties.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Friedman had provided the academic support for the argument that the integration of ESG type factors into financial practice would reduce financial performance, numerous reports began to appear in the early years of the century which provided research that supported arguments to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan Douglas, G, ''Corporate Governance and Climate Change: Making the Connexion'', (Ceres, March 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Oxford University's Michael Barnett and New York University's Robert Salomon published an influential study which concluded that the two sides of the argument might even be complementary – they propounded a curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, both selective investment practices and non-selective could maximise financial performance of an investment portfolio, the only route likely to damage performance was a middle way of selective investment.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Michael and Salomon, Robert, ''Beyond Dichotomy: The Curvilinear Relationship between Social Responsibility and Financial Performance'', (Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 27, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the large investment companies and banks taking an interest in matters ESG, an array of investment companies specifically dealing with responsible investment and ESG based portfolios began to spring up throughout the financial world.

Many in the investment industry believe the development of ESG factors as considerations in investment analysis to be inevitable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;IPE European Institutional Asset Management Survey, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence toward a relationship between consideration for ESG issues and financial performance is becoming greater and the combination of fiduciary duty and a wide recognition of the necessity of the sustainability of investments in the long term has meant that environmental social and corporate governance concerns are now becoming increasingly important in the investment market.&lt;ref name="responsibility2006"&gt;Aguilera, Ruth et al, ''Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility; a comparative analysis of the UK and the US'' (Corporate Governance, Blackwell, Vol. 14, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eccles/&gt; ESG has become less a question of philanthropy than practicality.

There has been uncertainty and debate as to what to call the inclusion of intangible factors relating to the sustainability and ethical impact of investments. Names have ranged from the early use of buzz words such as "green" and "eco", to the wide array of possible descriptions for the types of investment analysis - "responsible investment", "socially responsible investment" (SRI), "ethical", "extra-financial", "long horizon investment" (LHI), "enhanced business", "corporate health", "non-traditional", and others. But the predominance of the term ESG has now become fairly widely accepted. A survey of 350 global investment professionals conducted by AXA Investment Managers and AQ Research in 2008 concluded the vast majority of professionals preferred the term ESG to describe such data.

Interest in ESG and sustainable investing runs strong for plan participants, according to Natixis' 2016 Survey of Defined Contribution Plan Participants2. In fact, more than six in ten participants agreed they would be more likely to contribute or increase their contributions to their retirement plan if they knew their investments were doing social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ngam.natixis.com/us/resources/2016-survey-of-defined-contribution-plan-participants/ |title=Natixis Global Asset Management ''Investor Insight Series: Running on Empty, Attitudes and Actions of Defined Contribution Plan Participants''|date=2016|format=PDF|website=Ngam.natixis.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the PRI, UNEP FI and The Generation Foundation launched a three-year project to end the debate on whether fiduciary duty is a legitimate barrier to the integration of environmental, social and governance issues in investment practice and decision-making.

This follows the publication in September 2015 of ''Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century'' by the PRI, UNEP FI, UNEP Inquiry and UN Global Compact. The report concluded that “Failing to consider all long-term investment value drivers, including ESG issues, is a failure of fiduciary duty". It also acknowledged that despite significant progress, many investors have yet to fully integrate ESG issues into their investment decision-making processes.

== Environmental concerns ==
{{main article|Environmental governance}}
Threat of climate change and the depletion of resources has grown, so investors have to factor sustainability issues into their investment choices. The issues often represent externalities, such as influences on the functioning and revenues of the company that are not exclusively affected by market mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;IPE European Institutional Asset Management Survey, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As with all areas of ESG the breadth of possible concerns is vast, but some of the chief areas are listed below:

===Climate change===
The body of research providing evidence of global trends in climate change has led investors – pension funds, holders of insurance reserves – to begin to screen investments in terms of their impact on the perceived factors of climate change. Fossil fuel reliant industries are less attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Supachai Panitchpakdi, UNCTAD Secretary General’s Statement, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, investment policies were particularly affected by the conclusions of the ''[[Stern Review]]'' in 2006, a report commissioned by the British government to provide an economic analysis of the issues associated with climate change. Its conclusions pointed towards the necessity of including considerations of climate change and environmental issues in all financial calculations and that the benefits of early action on climate change would outweigh its costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sternreview.org.uk|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT]        Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change - HM Treasury|work=sternreview.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear energy===
Responsible Investing often chose to deselect firms associated with the construction of nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Co-operative Group Sustainable Leaders Trust, Report, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The dual concerns of the speed of depletion of fossil fuels and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have led to a re-examination of the concerns regarding nuclear power{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} .

===Sustainability===
In every area of the debate from the depletion of resources to the future of industries dependent upon diminishing [[raw materials]] the question of the obsolescence of a company's product or service is becoming central to the value ascribed to that company. The Long Term view is becoming prevalent amongst investors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Social concerns ==

===Diversity===
The level of [[inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]] in a company's recruitment policies is becoming a key concern to investors. There is a growing perception that the broader the pool of talent open to an employer the greater the chance of finding the optimum person for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne, Michele E. A. and Dipboye, Robert L., ''Leveraging Diversity to Improve Business Performance'', (Human Resource Management, Wiley, Vol. 43, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation and agility are seen as the great benefits of diversity and there is an increasing awareness of what has come to be known as ‘the power of difference’.&lt;ref&gt;Merck, ''Promoting Diversity and Inclusion'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
In 2006 the US Courts of Appeals ruled that there was a case to answer bringing the area of a company's social responsibilities squarely into the financial arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org|title=Homepage - Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre|work=business-humanrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area of concern is widening to include such considerations as the impact on local communities, the health and welfare of employees and a more thorough examination of a company's [[supply chain]].

===Consumer protection===
Until fairly recently, [[caveat emptor]] ("buyer beware") was the governing principle of commerce and trading. In recent times however there has been an increased assumption that the consumer has a right to a degree of protection and the vast growth in damages [[litigation]] has meant that consumer protection is a central consideration for those seeking to limit a company's risk and those examining a company's credentials with an eye to investing. The collapse of the US Sub-Prime Mortgage market initiated a growing movement against [[predatory lending]] has also become an important area of concern.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Donald P., ''Defining and Predicting Predatory Lending'', (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Report 273, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
From the testing of products on animals to the welfare of animals bred for the food market, concern about the welfare of animals is a large consideration for those investors seeking a thorough understanding of the company or industry being analyzed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Corporate governance concerns ==

Corporate governance covers the area of investigation into the rights and responsibilities of the management of a company – its board, shareholders and the various stakeholders in that company.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Management structure===
The system of internal procedures and controls that makes up the management structure of a company is in the valuation of that company's equity.&lt;ref name="responsibility2006"/&gt; Attention has been focused in recent years on the balance of power between the CEO and the Board of Directors and specifically the differences between the European model and the US model – in the States studies have found that 80% of companies have a CEO who is also the Chairman of the Board, in the UK and the European model it was found that 90% of the largest companies split the roles of CEO and Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Higgs, D, ''Review of the Role and Effectiveness of Non-Executive Directors'' (Higgs Report, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employee relations===
From diversity to the establishment of corporate behaviours and values, the role that improving employee relations plays in assessing the value of a company is proving increasingly central. In the United States Moskowitz's list of the ''Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For'' has become not only an important tool for employees but companies are beginning to compete keenly for a place on the list, as not only does it help to recruit the best workforce, it appears to have a noticeable impact on company values.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

===Executive compensation===
Companies are now being asked to list the percentage levels of bonus payments and the levels of remuneration of the highest paid executives are coming under close scrutiny from stock holders and equity investors alike.

== Responsible investment ==

The three concepts of social, environmental and corporate governance are intimately linked to the concept of Responsible Investment. RI began as a niche investment area, serving the needs of those who wished to invest but wanted to do so within ethically defined parameters. In recent years it has become a much larger proportion of the investment market.

===Investment strategies===
RI seeks to control the placing of its investments via several methods:
* Positive selection; where the investor actively selects the companies in which to invest; this can be done either by following a defined set of ESG criteria or by the best-in-class method where a subset of high performing ESG compliant companies is chosen for inclusion in an investment portfolio.
* Activism; strategic voting by shareholders in support of a particular issue, or to bring about change in the governance of the company.
* Engagement; investment funds monitoring the ESG performance of all portfolio companies and leading constructive shareholder engagement dialogues with each company to ensure progress.&lt;ref&gt;French research centre Novethic &lt;http://www.novethic.com&gt; issues a SRI engagement label, which was extended to [[Fondation Guilé]] e.g.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consulting role; the larger institutional investors and shareholders tend to be able to engage in what is known as ‘quiet diplomacy’, with regular meetings with top management in order to exchange information and act as early warning systems for risk and strategic or governance issues.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J., ''Influence and Intervention by Financial Institutions in their Investee Companies'', (Corporate Governance, Issue 6, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exclusion; the removal of certain sectors or companies from consideration for investment, based on ESG specific criteria.
* Integration; the inclusion of ESG risks and opportunities into traditional financial analysis of equity value.

===Institutional investors===
{{See also|Institutional investors}}
One of the defining marks of the modern investment market is the divergence in the relationship between the firm and its equity investors. Institutional investors have become the key owners of stock - rising from 35% in 1981 to 58% in 2002 in the US&lt;ref&gt;Binay, M., ''Performance Attribution of UA Institutional Investors '' (Financial Management, Summer, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and from 42% in 1963 to 84.7% in 2004 in the UK&lt;ref&gt;Office for National Statistics, ''Share Ownership'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions tend to work on a long term investment strategy. Insurance companies, Mutual Funds and Pension Funds with long-term payout obligations are much more interested in the long term sustainability of their investments than the individual investor looking for short-term gain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Where a Pension Fund is subject to ERISA, there are legal limitations on the extent to which investment decisions can be based on factors other than maximizing plan participants' economic returns.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'' §§2:125 - 2:127 (Thomson West, 2014-2015 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the belief that addressing ESG issues [https://www.malartu.co/blog/2018/5/22/overcoming-esg-challenges] will protect and enhance portfolio returns, responsible investment is rapidly becoming a mainstream concern within the institutional industry. By late 2016, over a third of institutional investors (commonly referred to as LPs) based in Europe and Asia-Pacific said that ESG considerations played a major or primary role in refusing to commit to a private equity fund, while the same is true for a fifth of North American LPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collercapital.com/coller-capital-global-pe-barometer-winter-2016-17|title=Coller Capital Global PE Barometer – Winter 2016-17 {{!}} Coller Capital|website=Collercapital.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to investor interest in ESG, private equity and other industry trade associations have developed a number of ESG best practices, including a due diligence questionnaire for private fund managers and other asset managers to use before investing in a portfolio company. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.navatargroup.com/webinar/finding-esg-mindset-invest-europe|title=Finding Your ESG Mindset with Invest Europe {{!}} Navatar|work=Navatar|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles for Responsible Investment===
The [[Principles for Responsible Investment]] Initiative (PRI) was established in 2005 by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and the [[UN Global Compact]] as a framework for improving the analysis of ESG issues in the investment process and to aid companies in the exercise of responsible ownership practices. As of 2015 there were a total of 1354 PRI signatories, consisting of 288 asset owners, 882 investment managers and 184 professional service partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unpri.org/signatories/signatories/|title = Principles for Responsible Investment {{ndash}} Signatories|date = 5 February 2015|accessdate = 5 February 2015|website = PRI Signatories|publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130921184606/http://www.unpri.org/signatories/signatories/#|archive-date = 21 September 2013|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equator Principles ===
{{main article|Equator Principles}}
The [http://www.equator-principles.com/ Equator Principles] is a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in project finance. It is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence to support responsible risk decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equator-principles.com/|title=Home|website=Equator-principles.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 6 March 2017, [http://www.equator-principles.com/index.php/members-reporting 92 adopting financial institutions] in 37 countries have officially adopted the Equator Principles, covering the majority of international Project Finance debt in emerging and developed markets.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Christopher, and Alexis Rwabizambuga. "Institutional pressures, corporate reputation, and voluntary codes of conduct: An examination of the equator principles." ''Business and Society Review'' 111.1 (2006): 89-117.&lt;/ref&gt; Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs) commit to not provide loans to projects where the borrower will not or is unable to comply with their respective social and environmental policies and procedures.

The Equator Principles, formally launched in Washington DC on 4 June 2003, were based on existing environmental and social policy frameworks established by the [[International Finance Corporation]].  These standards have subsequently been periodically updated into what is commonly known as the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards on social and environmental sustainability and on the World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equator Principles History and Context FAQ|url=http://equator-principles.com/resources/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions.pdf|format=PDF|website=Equator-principles.com|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ESG Ratings Agencies ==
Asset managers and other financial institutions increasingly rely on ESG ratings agencies to assess, measure and compare companies' ESG performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/07/27/esg-reports-and-ratings-what-they-are-why-they-matter/|title=ESG Reports and Ratings: What they are, why they matter|last=Huber|first=Betty|date=27 July 2017|website=Harvard Law School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disclosure and regulation ==
The first ten years of the new century has seen a vast growth in the ESG defined investment market. Not only do most of the world's big banks now have departments and divisions exclusively addressing Responsible Investment but boutique firms specialising in advising and consulting on environmental, social and governance related investments are proliferating. One of the major aspects of the ESG side of the insurance market which leads to this tendency to proliferation is the essentially subjective nature of the information on which investment selection can be made. By definition ESG data is qualitative; it is non-financial and not readily quantifiable in monetary terms. The investment market has long dealt with these intangibles – such variables as Goodwill have been widely accepted as contributing to a company's value. But the ESG intangibles are not only highly subjective they are also particularly difficult to quantify and more importantly verify.

One of the major issues in the ESG area is [[Corporation#Financial disclosure|disclosure]]. Environmental risks created by business activities have actual or potential negative impact on air, land, water, ecosystems, and human health &lt;ref&gt;esg.adec-innovations.com, [http://www.esg.adec-innovations.com/about-us/faqs/what-is-esg/ What is ESG?]&lt;/ref&gt; . The information on which an investor makes his decisions on a financial level is fairly simply gathered. The company's accounts can be examined, and although the accounting practices of corporate business are coming increasingly into disrepute after a spate of recent financial scandals, the figures are for the most part externally verifiable. With ESG considerations, the practice has been for the company under examination to provide its own figures and disclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Association of British Insurers, ''Disclosure Guidelines on Socially Responsible Investment'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt; These have seldom been externally verified and the lack of universal standards and [[regulation]] in the areas of environmental and social practice mean that the measurement of such statistics is subjective to say the least. As integrating ESG considerations into investment analysis and the calculation of a company's value become more prevalent it will become more crucial to provide units of measurement for investment decisions on subjective issues such as degrees of harm to workers, or how far down the supply chain of the production chain of a cluster bomb do you go.

One of the solutions put forward to the inherent subjectivity of ESG data is the provision of universally accepted standards for the measurement of ESG factors. Such organisations as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (International Organisation for Standardisation) provide highly researched and widely accepted standards for many of the areas covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html|title=ISO - International Organization for Standardization|website=ISO|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some investment consultancies, such as Probus-Sigma have created methodologies for calculating the ratings for an ESG based Ratings Index that is both based on ISO standards and externally verified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Burocratik |url=http://www.probus-sigma.eu |title=Probus Sigma |website=Probus-sigma.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the formalisation of the acceptance of such standards as the basis for calculating and verifying ESG disclosures is by no means universal.

The corporate governance side of the matter has received rather more in the way of regulation and standardisation as there is a longer history of regulation in this area. In 1992 the [[London Stock Exchange]] and the Financial Reporting Commission set up the Cadbury Commission to investigate the series of governance failures that had plagued the City of London such as the bankruptcies of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], [[Polly Peck]], and [[Robert Maxwell]]'s [[Mirror Group]]. The conclusions that the commission reached were compiled in 2003 into the ''Combined Code on Corporate Governance'' which has been widely accepted (if patchily applied) by the financial world as a benchmark for good governance practices.&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury Committee on [[the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance]], ''Report with Code of Best Practice'', (London, Gee Publishing, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key areas of concern in the discussion as to the reliability of ESG disclosures is the establishment of credible ratings for companies as to ESG performance. The world's financial markets have all leapt to provide ESG relevant ratings indexes, the [[Dow Jones Sustainability Index]], the [[FTSE4Good Index]] (which is co-owned by the London Stock Exchange and Financial Times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Baker &amp; McKenzie LLP |url=http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/LSE%20ESG%20reporting.pdf |title=ESG Reporting on the London Stock Exchange |publisher=Advocates for International Development |year=2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212180604/http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/LSE%20ESG%20reporting.pdf# |archive-date=12 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), Bloomberg ESG data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emisoft.com/bloomberg-esg-matters/|title=Why Bloomberg ESG Data Matters|last=|first=|date=|website=Emisoft.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the  MSCI ESG Indices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msci.com/products/indices/esg/|title=MSCI ESG Indexes - MSCI|website=Msci.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the GRESB benchmarks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gresb.com/gresb-assessments/|title=GRESB Assessments|website=Gresb.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some movement in the insurance market to find a reliable index of ratings for ESG issues, with some suggesting that the future lies in the construction of algorithms for calculating ESG ratings based on ISO standards and third party verification.

==Plot introduction==
Fancy Nancy is a young girl with a larger than life personality, who adores all things fancy.  She always dresses extravagantly, wearing [[Feather boa|boas]], [[Ballet tutu|tutus]], [[ruby slippers]], fairy wings, and fuzzy slippers.  Nancy loves using big fancy words such as "iridescent", "ecstatic", and "extraordinary" and anything in French.&lt;ref name="OCReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HC-Berkowitz"&gt;{{Cite news|title=BOOKS – Don't forget your tiara: It's a "Fancy" soiree – Celebration toasts author and illustrator |last=Berkowitz|first=Lana|date=March 27, 2007|publisher=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has redecorated her bedroom with everyday items, such as feather boas, Christmas lights, paper flowers, and hats. Her favorite doll is named Marabelle Lavinia Chandelier.&lt;ref name="NYTReview"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jenkins| first = Emily| author2 = | title ='Fancy Nancy,' by Jane O'Connor.

In Nancy's opinion, her family is ordinary and dresses rather plainly, so Nancy decides to hold a class in the art of fanciness for her family. They oblige, and Nancy helps to dress them in bows, ornaments, top hats, and gaudy scarves. "Ooo-la-la!" Nancy cries in delight. "My family is posh! That's a fancy word for fancy."&lt;ref name="NYTReview"/&gt;

==Jane O'Connor==
Jane O'Connor is vice-president and editor-at-large for Penguin Books for Young Readers!&lt;ref name="Sparkles"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lodge | first = Sally| title = From Sparkles to Sales, Nancy Is Fancy Indeed | publisher = [[Publishers Weekly]]| date = January 31, 2007| url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/16091-from-sparkles-to-sales-nancy-is-fancy-indeed.html |accessdate = January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written more than thirty children's books.  Her first adult novel, ''Dangerous Admissions: Secrets of a Closet Sleuth'' came out in July 2007.&lt;ref name="Sparkles"/&gt;

O'Connor came up with Fancy Nancy on a summer evening.  As she describes it, "It was after dinner one evening that the title just came to me," she recalls. "I sat down and wrote the first and last paragraphs. The rest of the story took me awhile, but the beginning and the end just flew into my head."&lt;ref name="Playthings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparkles"/&gt;  O'Connor is quick to point out that much of the book's success is Glasser's artwork.  She wrote the book in 2002, but it did not come out until 2005, because her editor, Margaret Anastas, insisted on Glasser as the illustrator who was busy with other projects.&lt;ref name="HC-Berkowitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparkles"/&gt;

==Robin Preiss Glasser==
{{main article|Robin Preiss Glasser}}

In 2013 Glasser was named 2013 Illustrator of the Year by the Children's Book Council for ''Fancy Nancy and the Mermaid Ballet'' after more than 1 million young people cast their votes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbcbooks.org/sub-news.php?id=1005 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808192138/http://www.cbcbooks.org/sub-news.php?id=1005#.UcCSU1oo6bg |archive-date=August 8, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 6th annual Children's Choice Book Awards.

==Marketing==
''Fancy Nancy'' has spawned a line of toys and games focusing on dress-up and role play targeted towards preschoolers and children aged 5 to 7.  In addition, the Fancy Nancy brand includes licenses for clothing, paper party goods, crafts, and more. Numerous bookstores and libraries around the United States have hosted events including readings by both Jane O'Connor and Robin Preiss Glasser, costume contests, “Fancy Nancy” days and tea parties.&lt;ref name="Playthings"/&gt;

A Fancy Nancy game called ''Fancy Nancy: Tea Party Time!'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] systems was released on September 14, 2010.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:Ferdinand Wolf Litho.jpg|right|thumb|Ferdinand Wolf ([[lithograph]] 1853)]]
'''Ferdinand Wolf''' (8 December 1796, [[Vienna]] &amp;ndash; 18 February 1866, Vienna) was a [[Romance studies|romanist]] from Austria. He was an author of literary studies as well as a publisher of periodicals, including the ''[[Jahrbuch für Romanische und Englische Literatur]]''.

Wolf studied philosophy and law at the [[University of Graz]], and then literature at the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1819, after graduation, he became a [[scrivener]] at the kaiserlichen Hofbibliothek, now the [[Austrian National Library]], and was later promoted to research fellow. He was succeeded in this office by his son Adolf. In 1847, Wolf was involved with the foundation of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], which he served as secretary. He is buried in Vienna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5507">[[File:Four-step impact assessment 2x2 grid of health and human rights.jpg|thumb|Four-step impact assessment 2x2 grid of health and human rights]]
The '''Four-Step Impact Assessment''' is an academic framework initiated and published by [[Jonathan Mann (WHO official)|Jonathan Mann]] and colleagues at the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]]. The assessment takes into account the negotiation of objectives between human rights and public health. Such an approach takes into account a measure of each discipline's respective overlap to expose infringement of goals. Such infringement or confluence can be mapped out in what Mann and colleagues proposed in a 2 by 2 table, as illustrated below.

The Four-Step Impact Assessment:

# To what extent does the proposed policy or program represent “good public health”?
# Is the proposed policy or program respectful and protective of human rights?
# How can we achieve the best possible combination of public health and human rights quality?
## How serious is the public health problem?
## Is the proposed response likely to be effective?
## What are the severity, scope and duration of the burdens on human rights resulting from the proposed policy or program?
## To what extent is the proposed policy or program restrictive and intrusive?
## Is the proposed policy or program over inclusive or under inclusive?
## What procedural safeguards are included in the proposed policy or program?
## Will the proposed policy or program be periodically reviewed to assess both its public health effectiveness and its impact on human rights? Identify specific changes to the proposed policy or program that increase its human rights and/or public health quality while maintaining (or even strengthening) its public health effectiveness.
#  Finally, does the proposed policy or program (as revised) still appear to be the optimal approach to the public health problem?

As a way to visualize the intersection of both health and human rights, this table places '''Human Rights Quality''' on the Y-axis, and '''Public Health Quality''' on the X-axis. The levels or rank of both measures are graphically displayed at some point in the cartesian plane. The organizations that jointly supported this framework consisted of Mann’s Francois Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, the International Federation of Red Cross, and Red Crescent Societies.

== Background and development ==

Mann was a central advocate of combining the synergistic forces of public health, ethics and human rights. He theorized and actively promoted the idea that human health and human rights are integrally and inextricably connected, arguing that these fields overlap in their respective philosophies and objectives to improve health, well-being, and to prevent premature death.&lt;ref&gt;Gostin LO. Public Health, Ethics, and Human Rights: A Tribute to the late Jonathan Mann. ''Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics''. 2001. 28:121-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, Mann proposed a three-pronged approach that has appropriately acted as a fundamental explanation of the relationship between health and human rights. First, health is a human rights issue. Secondly (and conversely), human rights are a health issue. Human rights violations result in adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;Schusky RW. Jonathan's Mantle. ''Lancet''. 1998. 352(9145):2025.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, linkages exist between health and human rights (a hypothesis to be rigorously tested).&lt;ref&gt;Mann JM, Gruskin S, Grodin MA and Annas GJ, eds., Health and Human Rights: A Reader New York: Routledge. 1999:11–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Literature substantiates the effects of the first two points, but Mann and colleagues proceeded to call for the validation of the third point and challenged the world to practice it.&lt;ref&gt;Mann JM, Gruskin S, Grodin MA and Annas GJ, eds., Health and Human Rights: A Reader New York: Routledge, 1999:7.&lt;/ref&gt; With this framework, Mann attempted to bridge a perceived gap of philosophies, correspondence and vocabulary, education and training, recruitment, and work methods between the disciplines of bioethics, jurisprudence, public health law and epidemiology. Furthermore, Mann knew that the history of “conflictual relationships” between officials of public health and civil liberties workers presented challenges to the pursuit of what he called a “powerful” confluence of health and human rights – a positive approach.4 While conflict between disciplines exists, Mann thought it important to first raise awareness of these challenges. In the spirit of negotiation and acting as mediator, Mann pointed out that such an intersection of fields can only benefit if a common ground in philosophies is uncovered and planted with a flag of cooperation.

{{Calligraphy}}
'''Georgian calligraphy''' ({{lang-ka|ქართული კალიგრაფია }} {{lang|ka-Latn|kartuli k'aligrapia}}) is a form of [[calligraphy]], or artistic writing of the [[Georgian language]] using its three [[Georgian scripts]].

==History==
[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has a centuries-old tradition of a calligraphic school. Hand-written books from the early centuries became a cultural and a national phenomenon in Georgia. Christianity had played an enormous role in Georgian literature life since the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] and its monks contributed their life to the Georgian writing by creating manuscripts and all the historical records for the [[Georgians|Georgian]] nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambioni.ge/qartvel-mxatvar-kaligrafta-kavsiri/ ქართველ მხატვარ-კალიგრაფთა კავშირი]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manuscript.ge/index.php?m=831&amp;ln=geo ქართული კალიგრაფია] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212054530/http://www.manuscript.ge/index.php?m=831&amp;ln=geo |date=February 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/Personalities/Participants/Lasha_Kintsurashvili/Article.aspx?ItemID=54 About Georgian calligraphy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514143310/http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/Personalities/Participants/Lasha_Kintsurashvili/Article.aspx?ItemID=54 |date=May 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year on April 14, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] celebrates the "Day of [[Georgian language]]". On this day the calligraphy contests are held, the winners are named and awards are given to the best calligraphers at the [[Georgian National Center of Manuscripts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/Personalities/Participants/Levan_Chaganava/Article.aspx?ItemID=128 Calligraphy fest in Tbilisi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085544/http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/Personalities/Participants/Levan_Chaganava/Article.aspx?ItemID=128 |date=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgian calligraphy was actively created outside [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] as well.

[[Georgians]] created calligraphical, religious and scholar works in the following places:
*Georgian-built [[Bachkovo Monastery|Petritsoni monastery]] of [[Bulgaria]]
*Georgian-built [[Iviron monastery]] of [[Mount Athos]]
*Georgian-built [[Monastery of the Cross]] of [[Jerusalem]]
*[[Mar Saba]] of [[Jerusalem]]
*[[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] of [[Mount Sinai]]
*[[Antioch]] and [[Constantinople]]

Within Georgia, the Kingdom of [[Tao-Klarjeti]] being the cultural center of the country had produced the most excellent masters of the Georgian calligraphy, art, literature and architecture.

'''Hot foot powder''' is used in African American [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] folk magic to drive unwanted people away.  It is a mixture of herbs and minerals, virtually always including [[chilli powder]], [[salt]], [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[chilli flakes]]. Other ingredients, such as wasp's nests, sulfur, and graveyard dirt are sometimes added.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

It shares certain common uses with the Mexican [[sal negra]] or "black salt."{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It also shows some overlapping uses with '[[Goofer dust|goofer dust]]', which also is known to create restlessness and drive people away.

[[Harry M. Hyatt]] collected several recipes and spells for hot foot powder. Some modes of deploying hot foot collected by him include secreting a small amount into the victim's shoes or clothing, mixing it with a victim's foottrack, or placing a paper with the victim's name into a bottle with hot foot powder and disposing of it in a river.

In the 1930s song [[Hell Hound on My Trail]], the famous [[blues]] musician [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] said, "You sprinkled hot foot powder [...]  all around  your daddy's door / it keep me with ramblin' mind, rider, every old place I go."&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~music/blues/homt.html Hellhound on My Trail]. The Robert Johnson Notebooks. American Studies at the University of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[guitarist]] [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] released a CD called "Hot Foot Powder," containing 13 covers of songs written by Robert Johnson.

'''Hypotaxis''' is the grammatical arrangement of functionally similar but "unequal" constructs (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''hypo-'' "beneath", and ''taxis'' "arrangement"), i.e., certain constructs have more importance than others inside a sentence.

A common example of  syntactic expression of hypotaxis is the [[subordination (linguistics)|subordination]] of one syntactic unit to another in a [[complex sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Fish]], ''How to Write a Sentence'' p 51 {{ISBN|978-0-06-184054-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is observed in [[premodification]]. In the phrase "inexpensive composite materials",  "composite" modifies "materials" while "inexpensive" modifies the complex [[head (linguistics)|head]] "composite materials", rather than "composite" or "materials". In this example the phrase units are hierarchically structured, rather than being on the same level, as compared to the example "Cockroaches love warm, damp, dark places." Notice the syntactic difference; hypotactic modifiers cannot be separated by [[comma]]s.

A classical example of [[verb]]al hypotaxis is the blandly mocking [[Greek language|Greek]] response King [[Leonidas I]] reportedly made to the Persian messengers at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], ''[[Molon labe]]'' (i.e., "Having come, take!").

[[Keats|Keats's]] "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]" has an example of hypotaxis in the second stanza: "O, for a draught of vintage! That hath been/ Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth, / Tasting of Flora and the country green" (1. 11–13). The "draught of vintage" is modified by the clauses in the successive lines.&lt;ref name=Greenblatt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Stephen|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature, vol. D|date=2012|publisher=Norton|edition=9th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Blake|Blake's]] poem "[[The Clod and the Pebble]]", the phrase "So sang a little Clod of Clay,/ Trodden with the cattle's feet" (l. 5–6) is an example of hypotaxis; line 6 modifies the "Clod of Clay" in line 5.&lt;ref name=Greenblatt /&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Indigenous intellectual property''' is an umbrella legal term used in national and international forums to identify [[indigenous peoples]]' claims of [[intellectual property]] rights to protect specific cultural knowledge of their groups.&lt;ref&gt;RAINFOREST ABORIGINAL NETWORK (1993) &lt;u&gt;''Julayinbul: Aboriginal Intellectual and Cultural Property Definitions, Ownership and Strategies for Protection.''&lt;/u&gt; Rainforest Aboriginal Network. Cairns. Page 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart31"&gt;Working Group on Indigenous Populations, accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], ''[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112013/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement |date=26 June 2015 }}''; UN Headquarters; New York City (13 September 2007): Article 31: "Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a concept that has developed out of predominantly [[Western culture|western]] concepts of intellectual property law, and has most recently been promoted by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], as part of a more general [[United Nations]] push&lt;ref name="OHCRC001"&gt;{{cite web | last = OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS | first =  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/ | title = Indigenous peoples | format = WEB PAGE | work =  | publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights.

[[Nation state]]s across the world have experienced difficulties reconciling local indigenous  laws and cultural norms with a predominantly western legal system, in many cases leaving indigenous peoples' individual and [[community|communal]] intellectual property rights largely unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hadley | first = Marie | title = Lack of Political Will or Academic Inertia? - The need for non-legal responses to the issue of Indigenous art and copyright | journal = Alternative Law Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 152–156 | publisher = Legal Service Bulletin Co-operative Ltd | location = Melbourne | year = 2009 | url = http://www.altlj.org/index.php?option=Articles&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;artid=69#2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, international bodies such as the [[United Nations]] have become involved in the issue,&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart31"/&gt; making more specific declarations that intellectual property also includes cultural property such as historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, and performing arts in addition to artwork and literature.&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart11"&gt;Working Group on Indigenous Populations, accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], ''[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112013/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement |date=26 June 2015 }}''; UN Headquarters; New York City (13 September 2007): Article 11: "Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, '''protect''' and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, '''ceremonies''', technologies and visual and performing arts and literature."[bold added]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declarations regarding Indigenous Intellectual Property ==
While a number of [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] communities have issued tribal declarations over the past 35 years, in the lead up to and during the United Nations International Year for the World's Indigenous Peoples (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WATSON, Irene |title=1993: International Year for Indigenous Peoples |publisher=AustLII |year=1992 |work=&lt;u&gt;Aboriginal Law Bulletin&lt;/u&gt; |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AboriginalLB/1992/52.html |accessdate=2007-11-29 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; then during the following United Nations Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004)&lt;ref name="OHCRC001"/&gt; a number of conferences of both indigenous and non-indigenous specialists were held in different parts of the world, resulting in a number of unified declarations and statements identifying, explaining, refining, and defining 'indigenous intellectual property'.&lt;ref name="WIPO002"&gt;WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANISATION (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution of the 5th Annual Meeting of the Traditional Elders Circle, October, 1980===

Before ceremonies and ceremonial knowledge were affirmed as protected intellectual property by the [[United Nations General Assembly|U.N. General Assembly]],&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart11"/&gt; smaller coalitions of Indigenous cultural leaders met to issue declarations about protection of ceremonial knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rez5"&gt;Yellowtail, Tom, ''et al''; "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/history/elders.html Resolution of the 5th Annual Meeting of the Traditional Elders Circle]" Northern Cheyenne Nation, Two Moons' Camp, Rosebud Creek, Montana; 5 October 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (10 June 1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/ladecwar.htm Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality]." "At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality." The following declaration was unanimously passed."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"&gt;Taliman, Valerie (1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/warlakot.htm Article On The 'Lakota Declaration of War']."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1980, spiritual leaders of the [[Cheyenne people|Northern Cheyenne]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Hopi people|Hopi]], [[Muscogee people|Muskogee]], [[Ojibwe people|Chippewa]]-[[Cree]], [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Nations met on the [[Northern Cheyenne Reservation]] in [[Montana]],&lt;ref name="Rez5"/&gt; and issued a resolution that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''These [non-Native] individuals are gathering non-Indian people as followers who believe they are receiving instructions of the original people. We, the Elders and our representatives sitting in Council, give warning to these non-Indian followers that it is our understanding this is not a proper process, that the authority to carry these sacred objects is given by the people...''&lt;ref name="Rez5"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Declaration of Belem, July 1988===

The first international congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology involving [[anthropology|anthropologists]], [[biology|biologists]], [[chemistry|chemists]], [[sociology|sociologists]], and indigenous peoples met at [[Belém|Belem]], [[Brazil]]. They identified themselves collectively as '[[Ethnobiology|ethnobiologists]]', and announced that (amongst other matters) since "Indigenous cultures around the world are being disrupted and destroyed.":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Mechanisms [ought to] be established by which indigenous specialists are recognized as proper Authorities and are consulted in all programs affecting them, their resources and their environment"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Procedures must be developed to compensate native peoples for the utilization of their knowledge and their biological resources"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Declaration of Belem|publisher=|year=1988|format=PDF|work=|url=http://ise.arts.ubc.ca/_common/docs/DeclarationofBelem.pdf|accessdate=2007-12-04}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kari-Oca Declaration and Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter, May 1992 ===

The Kari-Oca Declaration and [[charter]] was first affirmed in [[Brazil]] in May 1992, and then re-affirmed in [[Indonesia]], in June 2002. Ratifying the document were Indigenous peoples from the Americas, Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and the Pacific who, at Kari-Oca Villages, united in one voice to collectively express their serious concern at the way the world was exploiting the natural resources upon which indigenous peoples depend.

Specific reference is made within the Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter to perceived abuses of indigenous people's intellectual and cultural properties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henrietta Marrie|FOURMILE, Henrietta]] (1996) "Making things work: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Involvement in Bioregional Planning" in ''Approaches to bioregional planning.

===Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality, June 1993===

At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality."&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; Representatives affirmed a zero-tolerance policy on the exploitation of Lakota, Dakota and Nakota ceremonial knowledge.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Whereas''' ''we are conveners of an ongoing series of comprehensive forums on the abuse and exploitation of Lakota spirituality; and''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''we represent the recognized Lakota leaders, traditional elders, and grassroots advocates of the Lakota people; and ... ''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''non-Indian charlatans and "wannabes" are selling books that promote systematic colonization of our Lakota spirituality; and ''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''this exponential exploitation of our Lakota spiritual traditions requires that we take immediate action to defend our most precious Lakota spirituality from further contamination, desecration and abuse; ...''&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''6.'''  ''We urge traditional people, tribal leaders, and governing councils of all other Indian Nations, as well as all national Indian organizations, to join us in calling for an immediate end to this rampant exploitation of our respective American Indian sacred traditions by issuing statements denouncing such abuse; for it is not the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people alone whose spiritual practices are being systematically violated by non-Indians.''&lt;br/&gt;
'''7.'''  ''We urge all our Indian brothers and sisters to act decisively and boldly in our present campaign to end the destruction of our sacred traditions, keeping in mind that our highest duty as Indian people: to preserve the purity of our precious traditions for future generations, so that our children and our children's children will survive and prosper in the sacred manner intended for each of our respective peoples by our Creator.''&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mataatua Declaration on Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous Peoples, June, 1993===

On 18 June 1993, 150 delegates from fourteen countries, including indigenous representatives from  Japan ([[Ainu people|Ainu]]), Australia, [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], India, [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[Surinam]], United States and [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand) met at Whakatane ([[Bay of Plenty]] region of New Zealand). The assembly '''affirmed''' Indigenous peoples' knowledge is of benefit to all humanity; '''recognised''' Indigenous peoples are willing to offer their knowledge to all humanity provided their fundamental rights to define and control this knowledge is protected by the international community; '''insisted''' the first beneficiaries of Indigenous knowledge must be the direct Indigenous descendants of such knowledge; and '''declared''' all forms of exploitation of Indigenous knowledge must cease.&lt;ref name="FOURMILE page 262"&gt;FOURMILE page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 2 of their declaration they specifically ask State, National and International Agencies to:&lt;ref name="FOURMILE page 262"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.1''': Recognise that Indigenous peoples are the guardians of their customary knowledge and have the right to protect and control dissemination of that knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.2''': Recognise that Indigenous peoples also have the right to create new knowledge based on cultural tradition"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.3''': Accept that the cultural and intellectual property rights of Indigenous peoples are vested with those who created them.''&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Julayinbul Statement on Indigenous Intellectual Property Rights, November 1993===
[[File:JulayinbulIP.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Julayinbul Aboriginal Intellectual Property Conference Logo (1993)]]
This declaration arose out of a meeting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous specialists, who, at [[Daintree, Queensland|Jingarrba]], in north-eastern Australia, agreed Indigenous intellectual property rights are best determined from within the [[Custom (law)|customary law]]s of the Indigenous groups' themselves.&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE page 236&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the declaration, Indigenous customary laws are (re)named 'Aboriginal common laws', and it is insisted these laws must be acknowledged and treated as equal to any other systems of law:&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE pages 264&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Indigenous Peoples and Nations reaffirm their right to define for themselves their own intellectual property, acknowledging...the uniqueness of their own particular heritage.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Indigenous Peoples and Nations...declare that we...are willing to share [our intellectual property] with all humanity provided that our fundamental rights to define and control this property are recognised by the international community...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Aboriginal intellectual property, within Aboriginal Common Law, is an inherent, inalienable right which cannot be terminated, extinguished, or taken... Any use of the intellectual property of Aboriginal Nations and Peoples may only be done in accordance with Aboriginal Common Law, and any unauthorised use is strictly prohibited."&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAINFOREST ABORIGINAL NETWORK Pages 9–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Santa Cruz de la Sierra Statement on Intellectual Property, September, 1994===

A regional meeting was held at [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Bolivia]] where indigenous peoples from the South America's concerned about the way internationally prevailing intellectual property systems and regimes appeared to be favouring the appropriation of indigenous peoples' knowledge and resources for commercial purposes, agreed:&lt;ref name="FOUR02"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For members of indigenous peoples, knowledge and determination of the use of resources are collective and intergenerational. No...individuals or communities, nor the Government, can sell or transfer ownership of [cultural] resources which are the property of the people and which each generation has an obligation to safeguard for the next.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Work must be conducted on the design of a protection and recognition system which is in accordance with ..our own conception, and mechanisms must be developed .. which will prevent appropriation of our resources and knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''There must be appropriate mechanisms for maintaining and ensuring the right of Indigenous peoples to deny indiscriminate access to the [cultural] resources of our communities or peoples and making it possible to contest patents or other exclusive rights to what is essentially Indigenous.''&lt;ref name="FOUR02"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tambunan Statement on the Protection and Conservation of Indigenous Knowledge, February, 1995===

Indigenous people of Asia met at [[Tambunan]], [[Sabah]], East [[Malaysia]], to assert rights of self-determination, and to express concern about, and fear of, the threat unfamiliar 'western' intellectual property rights systems may pose to them.  It was agreed:&lt;ref name="FOUR003"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For the Indigenous peoples of Asia, the intellectual property rights system is not only a very new concept but it is also very western...[W]ith [western style] intellectual property property rights, alien laws will be devised to exploit the Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources of the Indigenous peoples.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The [western] intellectual property rights system and the (mis)appropriation of Indigenous knowledge without the prior knowledge and consent of Indigenous peoples evoke feelings of anger, or being cheated''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Indigenous peoples are not benefiting from the intellectual property rights system.  Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources are being eroded, exploited and/or appropriated by outsiders in the likes of transnational corporations, institutions, researchers, and scientists who are after profits and benefits gained..''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"For indigenous peoples, life is a common property which cannot be owned, commercialized, and monopolised...Based on this world view, Indigenous peoples find it difficult to relate [western] intellectual property rights...to their daily lives...''&lt;ref name="FOUR003"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Suva Statement on Indigenous Peoples Knowledge and Intellectual Property Rights, April 1995===

Participants from the independent countries and "nonautonomous colonised territories" of the Pacific region met in [[Suva]], [[Fiji]] to discuss internationally dominant intellectual property rights regimes, and at that meeting they resolved to support the Kari Oca, Mataatua, Julayinbul, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Tambunan initiatives&lt;ref name="FOUR004"/&gt;(above).  In particular participants:&lt;ref name="FOUR004"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Reaffirme[d] that imperialism is perpetuated through [western] intellectual property rights systems...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Declar[ed] Indigenous peoples are willing to share our knowledge with humanity provided we determine when, where and how it is used: at present the international system does not recognise or respect our past, present and potential contribution...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Seek[s] repatriation of Indigenous peoples [cultural] resources already held in external collections, and seek[s] compensation and royalties from commercial developments resulting from these resources''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...encourage[s]...governments...to protest against any [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] provisions which facilitate the expropriation of Indigenous peoples'  knowledge and resources...[to instead] incorporate the concerns of Indigenous peoples...into legislation...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[Seek to] Strengthen the capacities of Indigenous peoples to maintain their oral traditions, and encourage initiatives by Indigenous peoples to record their knowledge .. according to their customary access procedures.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Urge universities, churches, government, non-government organizations, and other institutions to reconsider their roles in the expropriation of Indigenous people's knowledge and resources and to assist in their return to their rightful owners."''&lt;ref name="FOUR004"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 270–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kimberley Declaration, August, 2002===

([[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]] August 2002)

Indigenous people from around the world attended an international indigenous peoples' summit on sustainable development in Khoi-San Territory, [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]], where they reaffirmed previous declarations and statements (above), and, amongst other matters, declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Our traditional knowledge systems must be respected, promoted and protected; our collective intellectual property rights must be guaranteed and ensured. Our traditional knowledge is not in the public domain; it is collective, cultural and intellectual property protected under our customary law. Unauthorized use and misappropriation of traditional knowledge is theft.''&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, September, 2007 ===
{{main article|Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}
[[File:UN General Assembly.jpg|thumb|230px|right|United Nations General Assembly 2003]]
At the United Nation's General Assembly's 61st session, on 13 September 2007, an overwhelming majority of members resolved to adopt the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS | first =  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/declaration.htm | title = Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples | format = WEB PAGE | work =  | publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 11''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.''&lt;ref&gt;UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 24''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals...''&lt;ref name="UNGA001"&gt;UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 31''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of these rights."''&lt;ref name="UNGA001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism and Problems ==
Theory for intellectual property/privilege law is give creators temporary government monopoly for help creators earn their investments (patents and copyrights) but with idea after monopoly terminates everything becomes public domain for help create new innovation. Because of this theory, use intellectual property/privilege for control culture create many problems:

• Most culture items are too old for patent or copyright.  Additionally, often the author or creator unknown.

• Registration is not filed and fees are not paid

• Natural languages lie within the public domain

• Art styles lie within the public domain

• Properties of fauna and flora are scientific fact and their discovery and description can't have intellectual privilege for facts or information. Fauna and flora evolved, not created by humans.

• Can't own culture, it belongs to every person that uses it. This causes problems with human rights like expression freedom and choice.

• Cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions lie in the public domain.

• Powerful indigenous cultures in Europa (English, Italianos, Russians, etc) and Asia (Hindustanis, Han Chinese, etc.) can reverse this and forbid indigenous people from their culture (modern medicine, science, mathematics, printing, combustion engines, computer, etc) and languages (like English, Chinese, Arabic, etc.) and religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, etc.)

• Indigenous people consume more outside culture than they can give

• Intellectual property owners must pay maintenance fee (patents).

• Proponents have not offered a solid concept of collective intellectual property rights, need a specific owner that can follow laws and must accept liability in courts.

• Names of all groups are generic, can't protect name Maori, Apache more than English, or Thai, Chinese.

• Intellectual property is an idea that belongs to European culture, therefore it fails to meet the needs of indigenous culture since it is too stuck up to see indigenous communities eye to eye and come to an understanding

• People innovate around restrictions

• May encourage use of stereotypes instead because outside people created them

• Restricting culture helps it become lost 

• Use of intellectual property/privilege this encourages the move against cultural prostitution.

== Traditional cultural expressions ==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional cultural expressions can include designs and styles, which means that applying traditional Western-style international copyright laws{{snd}}which apply to a specific work, rather than a style{{snd}}can be problematic. Indigenous customary law often treats such concepts differently, and may apply restrictions upon the use of underlying styles and concepts.&lt;ref name=Engaging/&gt;

==Examples of Indigenous peoples claiming violation of their intellectual property==

===Intertribal Coalitions in North America===

Since the 1970s, Intertribal groups in North American have organized demonstrations against non-native use of Native American cultural elements; such as the sale of products and services allegedly derived from Indigenous knowledge:&lt;ref name=hagan&gt;Hagan, Helene E. [http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html "The Plastic Medicine People Circle."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305155048/http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html |date=5 March 2013 }} ''Sonoma Free County Press.'' Accessed 31 Jan 2013: "Shequish...came to the attention of Native American people two years ago as an impostor who pretended to have Shumash ancestry. I received a personal telephone call and a letter from the Chairman of a Shumash group south of Monterey. This phone call and a letter followed a Council meeting in which Shumash people took the decision to put a stop to Shequish Ohoho's activities in the Bay area as an 'Indian woman.' A group of real Indian women of San Francisco led a protest against Shequish and effectively terminated her money making seminars and ceremonies in this area. Her real name and background are known to California Indians who have denied her any tribal affiliation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sieg1"&gt;Sieg, Katrin, ''Ethnic Drag: Performing Race, Nation, Sexuality in West Germany'';  University of Michigan Press (20 August 2002) p.232&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is a very alarming trend. So alarming that it came to the attention of an international and intertribal group of medicine people and spiritual leaders called the Circle of Elders. They were highly concerned with these activities and during one of their gatherings addressed the issue by publishing a list of Plastic Shamans in ''Akwesasne Notes'', along with a plea for them to stop their exploitative activities. One of the best known Plastic Shamans, Lynn Andrews, has been picketed by the Native communities in New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle and other cities.&lt;ref name="Sieg1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota Peoples===

The 1993 Lakota Declaration of War (see above), urges people to identify instances where sacred traditions are being abused and to work toward stopping the abuse through demonstrations, boycotts, press coverage and direct intervention.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;

==== ''Ka Mate'' haka ====
[[File:Te Raparaha, chief of the Kawias, watercolour by R. Hall, c. 1840s.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Te Rauparaha]], alleged composer of ''Ka Mate''.]]
{{Main article|Ka Mate}}
Since the 19th century, Maori-style [[Haka]]s have been popularly-used by New Zealanders as [[Haka (sports)|a cheer at sporting events]]; especially for New Zealand national teams.  Between 1998 and 2006, the [[Ngati Toa]] [[iwi]] attempted to trademark the [[Ka Mate]] [[haka]] and to forbid its use by commercial organisations without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/793975.stm

|title= Iwi threatens to place trademark on All Black haka|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=2005-05-22 |accessdate=2008-05-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand]] turned their claim down in 2006, since ''Ka Mate'' had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10389347 |title=Iwi claim to All Black haka turned down|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2008-05-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the [[New Zealand government]] agreed to:
:"...record the authorship and significance of the haka Ka Mate to Ngāti Toa and ... work with Ngāti Toa to address their concerns with the haka... [but] does not expect that redress will result in royalties for the use of Ka Mate or provide Ngāti Toa with a veto on the performance of Ka Mate...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/livearticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 Ngāti Toa Rangatira Letter of Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521222630/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/LiveArticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 |date=21 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7882775.stm|title=New Zealand Maori win haka fight |date=11 February 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a survey of nineteenth-century New Zealand newspapers found Ka Mate was used by tribes from other parts of New Zealand, and was generally described by them as being an ancient peacekeeping song, from eras long before its appropriation by the Ngati Toa chief Te Rauparaha. When Ngati Toa authorities were asked for evidence that Ka Mate was of Ngati Toa authorship, they were unable to provide any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folksong.org.nz/ka_mate/ka_mate.pdf|title=Archer J.H.

==== Lego's Bionicle ====

In 2001 a dispute concerning the popular [[LEGO]] toy-line "[[Bionicle]]" arose between [[Denmark|Danish]] toymaker [[Lego Group]] and several Māori tribal groups (fronted by lawyer Maui Solomon) and members of the on-line discussion forum ([[Aotearoa Cafe]]). The Bionicle product line allegedly used many words [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] from Māori language, imagery and folklore. The dispute ended in an amicable settlement. Initially Lego refused to withdraw the product, saying it had drawn the names from many cultures, but later agreed that it had taken the names from Māori and agreed to change certain names or spellings to help set the toy-line apart from the Māori legends. This did not prevent the many Bionicle users from continuing to use the disputed words, resulting in the popular Bionicle website BZPower coming under a [[denial-of-service attack]] for four days from an attacker using the name Kotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/11/56451|title=Lego Site Irks Maori Sympathizer|last=Griggs|first=Kim|date=21 November 2002 |work=Wired|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Māori" cigarettes====

In 2005 a New Zealander in [[Jerusalem]] discovered that the [[Philip Morris International|Phillip Morris]] cigarette company had started producing a brand of cigarette in Israel called the "L &amp; M Maori mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411319/638858 |title=Disgust over 'Maori' brand cigarettes |date=12 December 2005 |work=TVNZ |accessdate=29 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613105447/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411319/638858 |archivedate=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the head of Phillip Morris, [[Louis C.

===Hopi and Apache Opt-Out From American Museums===

In 1994 certain Native American tribal organisations demanded that a number of museums remove certain materials from exhibition and access to the public. They cited the [[NAGPRA]] as the legal basis for their complaints.  Their position was that they would only permit such uses, selectively. after permission was requested directly to them.
Vernon Masayesva, CEO of the Hopi Tribe, and a consortium of Apache tribes demanded a number of American museums end public exhibition of and access to materials from their tribal cultures; including images, text, ceremonies, music, songs, stories, symbols, beliefs, customs, ideas, concepts and ethnographic field-notes, feature films, historical works, and any other medium in which their culture may appear literally, imagined, expressed, parodied or embellished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brown | first = Michael F. | authorlink =  | title = Can Culture Be Copyrighted? | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–222 | date = April 1998 | url = | jstor = 10.1086/204721 | doi=10.1086/204721}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 12 Dec 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kronos Quartet''' is an American [[string quartet]] based in San Francisco. They have been in existence with a rotating membership of musicians for over forty years. The quartet covers a very broad range of musical genres, including [[contemporary classical music]]. More than 900 works have been [[commission (art)|written for them]].

==History==
The quartet was founded by [[violin]]ist David Harrington in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Its first performance was in November 1973.&lt;ref name=Graves/&gt; Since 1978, the quartet has been based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].  The longest-running combination of performers (from 1978 to 1999) had Harrington and John Sherba on [[violin]], Hank Dutt on [[viola]], and [[Joan Jeanrenaud]] on [[cello]].  In 1999, Joan Jeanrenaud left Kronos because she was "eager for something new";&lt;ref name=Templeton/&gt; she was replaced by Jennifer Culp&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; who, in turn, left in 2005 and was replaced by Jeffrey Zeigler. In June 2013, Zeigler was replaced by Sunny Yang.&lt;ref name=press1/&gt; With over forty studio albums to their credit and having performed worldwide, they were called "probably the most famous '[[Contemporary classical music|new music]]' group in the world"&lt;ref name=McCalla/&gt; and were praised in philosophical studies of music for the inclusiveness of their repertoire.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

By the time the quartet celebrated their twenty-fifth anniversary in 1999, they had a repertoire of over 600 works, which included 400 string quartets written for them, more than 3,000 performances, seven first-prize [[ASCAP]] awards, [[Edison Award]]s in classical and popular music, and had sold more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million records.&lt;ref name=Derk/&gt;

===30th anniversary===
When Kronos turned 30, in 2003, they decided on a commissioning process for composers under the age of 30, in the hope of bringing some of the talented young composers to light. The program, called the Under 30 Project, is now run in cooperation with [[Carnegie Hall]], Cal Performances at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[Montalvo Arts Center]]. The first recipient was [[Alexandra du Bois]] (at the time a student at [[Indiana University]], later a [[Juilliard School]] graduate),&lt;ref name=Cahill/&gt; followed by Felipe Perez Santiago (born in Mexico in 1973),&lt;ref name=Sisario/&gt; and Dan Visconti (born in Illinois in 1982);&lt;ref name=Martini/&gt; in 2007, Israeli composer Aviya Kopelman became the fourth.&lt;ref name=MusicalA/&gt;

===40th anniversary===
To celebrate the fortieth year of the organization, the Kronos Quartet decided to return to Seattle, the city in which they first played, and work in collaboration with Seattle's [[Degenerate Art Ensemble]] to create a piece incorporating music, dance and video.&lt;ref name=Graves/&gt; They celebrated their 40th anniversary with a sold-out performance at [[Zellerbach Hall]], [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], in December 2013. The same year, [[Michael Giacchino]], a soundtrack composer who often names his pieces with puns, published a piece named after them as a part of the soundtrack to ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (the name of the piece is "The Kronos Wartet"), for a scene that takes place on the fictional planet "Kronos"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/Playback/2013/05/wecreatemusic/fmf-michael-giacchino-on-star-trek-into-darkness.aspx|title=Film Music Friday: Michael Giacchino on Star Trek: Into Darkness|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also spelled "[[Qo'noS]]").

{{quote box|quote=I've always wanted the string quartet to be vital, and energetic, and alive, and cool, and not afraid to kick ass and be absolutely beautiful and ugly if it has to be.

This is a list of people of [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-Latino]] descent. An '''Afro-Latin American''' (also '''Afro-Latino''') is a [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] person of [[Black people|Black African]] descent; the term may also refer to historical or cultural elements in [[Latin America]] thought to emanate from this community.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

&lt;!--a list of NOTABLE people--that is, with Wikipedia articles--&gt;Many Brazilians, Dominicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans,Panamanians,Hondurans,Mexicans and other Latinos can fall under this label. 95% of the Africans who came into the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade were scattered about Latin America and the Caribbean.  The very first Africans to reach the New World arrived on the island of Hispaniola, which is the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Dominicans and Haitians are descendants of the first African slaves in the New World, yet the majority of Africans to inhabit any American nation inhabited Brazil.  Only 5% of the Africans to arrive in the Americas went to North America, who are the African Americans, descendants of the last and the fewest number of Africans to reach the New World.

The '''Louvre''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|uː|v|(|r|ə|)}}),&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' gives the respelling "/'l{{Overline|oo}}v(rə)/", which has been converted to its [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalent. The portion within parentheses indicates a variant pronunciation.&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Louvre Museum''' ({{Lang-fr|Musée du Louvre}} {{IPA-fr|myze dy luvʁ||Musée du Louvre pronunciation.ogg}}), is the world's  [[list of largest art museums|largest art museum]] and a historic monument in [[Paris]], [[France]]. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the [[Rive Droite|Right Bank]] of the [[Seine]] in the city's [[1st arrondissement of Paris|1st arrondissement]] (district or ward). Approximately 38,000&amp;nbsp;objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square metres (782,910 square feet).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/dp_pyramide%2028102014_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Louvre was the [[List of most visited art museums|world's most visited art museum]], receiving 8.1 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presse.louvre.fr/81-millions-de-visiteurs-au-louvre-en-2017/ |title=8,1 millions de visiteurs au Louvre en 2017 |language=fr|publisher=Louvre|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is housed in the [[Louvre Palace]], originally built as the [[Louvre castle]] in the late 12th to 13th&amp;nbsp;century under [[Philip II of France|Philip&amp;nbsp;II]]. Remnants of the fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to the urban expansion of the city, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function and, in 1546, was converted by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] into the main residence of the [[French Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louvre Museum|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Louvre-Museum|website=Inexhibit|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, [[Louis XIV]] chose the [[Palace of Versailles]] for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/musee/detail_repere.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226981&amp;CURRENT_LLV_PERIODE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226961&amp;CURRENT_LLV_CHRONOLOGIE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226610&amp;CURRENT_LLV_REPERE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226981&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500938&amp;bmLocale=en&amp;leftPosition=-300 |title=Louvre Website- Chateau to Museum, 1672 and 1692 |publisher=Louvre.fr |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615182627/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/musee/detail_repere.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226981&amp;CURRENT_LLV_PERIODE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226961&amp;CURRENT_LLV_CHRONOLOGIE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226610&amp;CURRENT_LLV_REPERE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226981&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500938&amp;bmLocale=en&amp;leftPosition=-300 |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1692, the building was occupied by the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] and the [[Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture]], which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons.

The museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537&amp;nbsp;paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under [[Napoleon]] and the museum was renamed ''Musée Napoléon'', but after Napoleon's abdication many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], and during the [[Second French Empire]] the museum gained 20,000&amp;nbsp;pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: [[Egyptian Antiquities]]; [[Near Eastern Antiquities]]; [[Greek art|Greek]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] and [[Roman art|Roman Antiquities]]; [[Islamic Art]]; [[Sculpture]]; [[Decorative Arts]]; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.

==History==
===12th–20th centuries===
==== Medieval, Renaissance, and Bourbon palace ====
[[File:Donjon chateau louvre.JPG|thumb|Below-ground portions of the medieval Louvre are still visible.&lt;ref name="Mignot 32"/&gt;]]
{{Main|Louvre Palace}}
The [[Louvre Palace]], which houses the museum, was begun as a [[Louvre castle|fortress]] by [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] in the 12th century to protect the city from English soldiers which were in Normandy. Remnants of this castle are still visible in the crypt.&lt;ref name="Mignot 32"&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this was the first building on that spot is not known; it is possible that Philip modified an existing tower.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt; According to the authoritative ''[[Grand Larousse encyclopédique]]'', the name derives from an association with [[wolf hunting]] den (via Latin: ''lupus'', lower Empire: ''lupara'').&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Edwards,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;193–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Larousse ''Nouveau Dictionnaire étymologique et historique'', Librairie Larousse, Paris, 1971, p. 430: ***'''loup''' 1080, Roland (''leu'', forme conservée dans ''à la queue leu leu'', ''Saint Leu'', etc.); du lat. lupus; loup est refait sur le fém. louve, où le *v* a empêché le passage du *ou* à *eu* (cf. Louvre, du lat. pop. lupara)*** the etymology of the word ''louvre'' is from ''lupara'', feminine (pop.

The Louvre Palace was altered frequently throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Charles V of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;V]] converted the building into a residence and in 1546, [[Francis I of France|Francis&amp;nbsp;I]] renovated the site in [[French Renaissance]] style.&lt;ref name="Edwards198"&gt;Edwards,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;198&lt;/ref&gt; Francis acquired what would become the nucleus of the Louvre's holdings, his acquisitions including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]''.&lt;ref name="Mona"&gt;{{cite news|author=Chaundy, Bob|title=Faces of the Week|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5392000.stm|publisher=BBC |date=29 September 2006|accessdate=5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682, constructions slowed; however, the move permitted the Louvre to be used as a residence for artists, under Royal patronage.&lt;ref name="Edwards198"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nore,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;274&lt;/ref&gt; Four generations of Boulle were granted Royal patronage and resided in the Louvre in the following order: Pierre Boulle, Jean Boulle, [[Andre-Charles Boulle]] and his four sons (Jean-Philippe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O185910/design-for-a-boulle-jean-philippe/|title=Jean Philippe Boulle, Son of André-Charles Boulle|publisher= V&amp;A| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre-Benoît (c.1683-1741), Charles-André (1685–1749) and Charles-Joseph (1688–1754)), after him.

By the mid-18th&amp;nbsp;century there were an increasing number of proposals to create a public gallery, with the art critic La Font de Saint-Yenne publishing, in 1747, a call for a display of the royal collection. On 14 October 1750, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] agreed and sanctioned a display of 96 pieces from the royal collection, mounted in the Galerie royale de peinture of the [[Luxembourg Palace]]. A hall was opened by [[Charles François Paul Le Normant de Tournehem|Le Normant de Tournehem]] and the [[Abel François Poisson|Marquis de Marigny]] for public viewing of the ''Tableaux du Roy'' on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and contained [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s ''Charity'' and works by [[Raphael]]; [[Titian]]; [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]; [[Rembrandt]]; [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]] or [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]], until its closing in 1780 as a result of the gift of the palace to the [[Louis XVIII of France|Count of Provence]] (the future king, Louis XVIII) by the king in 1778.&lt;ref name="Nora 278"/&gt; Under [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], the royal museum idea became policy.&lt;ref name="Carb 56"&gt;Carbonell, p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, comte d'Angiviller|comte d'Angiviller]] broadened the collection and in 1776 proposed conversion of the Grande Galerie of the Louvre – which contained maps – into the "French Museum". Many proposals were offered for the Louvre's renovation into a museum; however, none was agreed on. Hence the museum remained incomplete until the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Nora 278"/&gt;

====French Revolution====
During the French Revolution the Louvre was transformed into a public museum. In May 1791, [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|the Assembly]] declared that the Louvre would be "a place for bringing together monuments of all the sciences and arts".&lt;ref name="Nora 278"/&gt; On 10 August 1792, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XVI]] was imprisoned and the royal collection in the Louvre became national property. Because of fear of vandalism or theft, on 19 August, the National Assembly pronounced the museum's preparation as urgent. In October, a committee to "preserve the [[national memory]]" began assembling the collection for display.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Opening=====
[[File:Amor-Psyche-Canova-JBU02.JPG|thumb|right|[[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'' was commissioned in 1787, donated in 1824.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite web|last = Monaghan|first = Sean M.|author2 = Rodgers, Michael|title = French Sculpture 1800–1825, Canova|work = 19th Century Paris Project|year = 2000|url = http://gallery.sjsu.edu/paris/the_academy/canova.htm|publisher = School of Art and Design, San Jose State University|accessdate = 24 April 2008|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080420173109/http://gallery.sjsu.edu/paris/the_academy/canova.htm|archivedate = 20 April 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The museum opened on 10 August 1793, the first anniversary of the monarchy's demise. The public was given free accessibility on three days per week, which was "perceived as a major accomplishment and was generally appreciated".&lt;ref&gt;Oliver,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;35&lt;/ref&gt; The collection showcased 537&amp;nbsp;paintings and 184&amp;nbsp;objects of art. Three quarters were derived from the royal collections, the remainder from confiscated [[émigrés]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] property (''[[biens nationaux]]'').&lt;ref name="Alex 24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nave"&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;68,&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt; To expand and organize the collection, the Republic dedicated 100,000&amp;nbsp;[[livres]] per year.&lt;ref name="Nora 278"&gt;Nora,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;278&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794, France's revolutionary armies began bringing pieces from Northern Europe, augmented after the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797) by works from the Vatican, such as ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' and the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'', to establish the Louvre as a museum and as a "sign of popular sovereignty".&lt;ref name="Alex 24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McClellan,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt;

The early days were hectic; privileged artists continued to live in residence, and the unlabelled paintings hung "frame to frame from floor to ceiling".&lt;ref name="Alex 24"&gt;Alderson,&amp;nbsp;p.24,&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt; The structure itself closed in May 1796 due to structural deficiencies. It reopened on [[Bastille Day|14 July]] 1801, arranged chronologically and with new lighting and columns.&lt;ref name="Alex 24"/&gt;

===={{anchor|Musée Napoléon|Napoleon I}}Napoleon====
Under [[Napoleon I]], a northern wing paralleling the Grande Galerie was begun, and the collection grew through successful military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|Egyptian campaign]] of 1798–1801, Napoléon appointed the museum's first director, [[Dominique Vivant Denon]]. In tribute, the museum was renamed the "Musée Napoléon" in 1803, and acquisitions were made of Spanish, Austrian, Dutch, and Italian works, either as [[War looting|spoils]] or through treaties such as the [[Treaty of Tolentino]].&lt;ref name="Alderson 25"/&gt; At the end of Napoleon's First Italian Campaign in 1797, the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] was signed with [[Count Philipp von Cobenzl]] of the [[Austrian Monarchy]]. This treaty not only marked the completion of Napoleon's conquest of Italy, but also the end of the first phases of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Under this treaty, Italian cities were required to contribute pieces of art and patrimony to take part in Napoleon's "parades of booty" through Paris before being put into the Louvre Museum.&lt;ref name="Plant, p. 36"&gt;Plant, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous pieces taken under this program was the [[Horses of Saint Mark]]. The four antique bronze horses, which had adorned the basilica of San Marco in Venice after the sack of [[Constantinople]] in 1204, were brought to Paris to reside atop [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel|Napoleon's Arc du Carrousel]] in Paris in 1797.&lt;ref name="Plant, p. 36"/&gt;

Several churches and palaces, including Saint Mark's Basilica, were looted by the French, which outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; In 1797, the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] was signed by Napoleon, and two statues, the ''Nile'' and ''Tiber'', were taken to Paris. These statues had previously been in the Vatican, and both were housed in the Louvre until 1815. After the defeat of Napoleon, the ''Nile'' was returned to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Swetnam-Burland |first=Molly |date=2009 |title=Egypt Embodied: The Vatican Nile |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |page=440 |jstor=20627596}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Tiber'' remained in the Louvre Museum and can be seen in the collections today.

The Italian Peninsula was not the only region from which Napoleon took art. Under the Directory government of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist effort on the part of the government, but the Directory had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dominique Vivant Denon]] was Napoleon's art advisor, and accompanied him on the expedition to Egypt. Through his initiative, the [[Valley of the Kings]] in Egypt was discovered and studied extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was later installed by Napoleon as the director of [[Musée Napoléon]], formerly the Louvre, cementing the status of the museum as a center for global patrimony and storehouse for cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Quynn, Dorothy (1945) "The Art Confiscations of the Napoleonic Wars". ''The American Historical Review''. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1843116 p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important discoveries made during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt was the [[Rosetta Stone]]. It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French, it actually never made it to the Louvre Museum. It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, Pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; It is now on display at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], the works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works in their private collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and many pieces were returned, even some that had been restored by the Louvre.&lt;ref name="Alderson 25"&gt;Alderson,&amp;nbsp;p.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;p. 69. According to Mignot, [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s ''Calvary'', [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]'s ''The Wedding at Cana|The Marriage of Cana'', and Rogier van der Weyden's ''Annunciation'' were not returned.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815 [[Louis XVIII]] finally concluded agreements with the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=59chAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA741#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |magazine= The Gentleman's Magazine |publisher= A.

====Restoration and Second Empire====
[[File:MG-Paris-Aphrodite of Milos edited.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The ''[[Venus de Milo]]'' was added to the Louvre's collection during the reign of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]].]]

During the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] (1814–30), [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;X]] between them added 135&amp;nbsp;pieces at a cost of 720,000&amp;nbsp;francs and created the department of Egyptian antiquities curated by [[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion]], increased by more than 7,000&amp;nbsp;works with the acquisition of antiquities in the [[Edme-Antoine Durand]], the Egyptian collection of [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] or the second collection former by [[Bernardino Drovetti]]. This was less than the amount given for rehabilitation of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and the Louvre suffered relative to the rest of Paris. After the creation of the [[French Second Republic]] in 1848, the new government allocated two&amp;nbsp;million francs for repair work and ordered the completion of the [[Galerie d'Apollon]], the Salon Carré, and the Grande Galérie.&lt;ref name="Mignot 52"/&gt; In 1861, [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] bought 11,835&amp;nbsp;artworks including 641 paintings, Greek gold and other antiquities of the [[Campana collection]]. During the [[Second French Empire]], between 1852 and 1870, the French economy grew; by 1870 the museum had added 20,000&amp;nbsp;new pieces to its collections, and the [[Pavillon de Flore]] and the Grande Galérie were remodelled under architects [[Louis Visconti]] and [[Hector Lefuel]].&lt;ref name="Mignot 52"&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;52–54&lt;/ref&gt;

====Damage during the 1871 Paris Commune====
The Louvre was damaged during the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]].  On 23 May 1871, as the French Army advanced into Paris, a force of Communards led by Jules Bergeret set fire to the adjoining [[Tuileries Palace]]. The fire burned for forty-eight hours, entirely destroying the interior of the palace and spreading to the museum next to it.  The library of the museum and some of the adjoining halls were destroyed, but the museum was saved by the efforts of Paris firemen and museum employees.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Heron de Villefosse, ''Histoire de Paris'', Bernard Grasset (1959). The father of the author of this book was an assistant curator at the Louvre, and helped put out the fires&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third Republic and World Wars====

During the [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]] (1870–1940) the Louvre acquired new pieces mainly via donations and gifts. The ''Société des Amis du Louvre'' (established in 1897) donated the ''[[Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon]]'', and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture ''[[Winged Victory of Samothrace]]'' in the Aegean Sea. This piece, though heavily damaged, has been prominently displayed since 1884.&lt;ref name="Mignot 70"/&gt; The 583-item ''Collection La Caze'' donated in 1869, included works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]; [[Fragonard]]; [[Rembrandt]] – such as ''[[Bathsheba at Her Bath]]'' – and ''Gilles'' by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]].&lt;ref name="Mignot 70"&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum expansion slowed after World War I, and the collection did not acquire many significant new works; exceptions were [[Georges de La Tour]]'s ''Saint Thomas'' and [[Edmond James de Rothschild|Baron Edmond de Rothschild's]] (1845–1934) 1935 donation of 4,000&amp;nbsp;prints, 3,000&amp;nbsp;drawings, and 500&amp;nbsp;illustrated books.&lt;ref name="Nave"/&gt;
[[Evacuation of the Louvre museum art collection during World War II|At the beginning of World War II the museum removed most of the art and hid valuable pieces]]. When Germany occupied the [[Sudetenland]], many important artworks such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' were temporarily moved to the [[Château de Chambord]]. When war was formally declared a year later, most of the museum's paintings were sent there as well. Select sculptures such as ''[[Winged Victory of Samothrace]]'' and the ''[[Venus de Milo]]'' were sent to the [[Château de Valençay]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding, ''And the Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris''. Alfred A Knopf, New York: 2010. p34.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August 1939, after two days of packing, truck convoys began to leave Paris. By 28 December, the museum was cleared of most works, except those that were too heavy and "unimportant paintings [that] were left in the basement".&lt;ref&gt;Matila Simon, "The battle of the Louvre;: The struggle to save French art in World War II". Hawthorn Books, 1971. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1945, after the liberation of France, art began returning to the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;Simon,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;177&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grand Louvre Pyramids====
{{Main|Louvre Pyramid}}

By 1874, the Louvre Palace had achieved its present form of an almost rectangular structure with the Sully Wing to the east containing the Cour Carrée (Square Court) and the oldest parts of the Louvre; and two wings which wrap the Cour Napoléon, the Richelieu Wing to the north and the Denon Wing, which borders the Seine to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, French President [[François Mitterrand]] proposed, as one of his [[Grands Projets of François Mitterrand|Grands Projets]], the '''Grand Louvre''' plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry, allowing displays throughout the building. Architect [[I. M. Pei]] was awarded the project and proposed a glass pyramid to stand over a new entrance in the main court, the Cour Napoléon.&lt;ref&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;66&lt;/ref&gt; The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988 and the ''[[Louvre Pyramid]]'' was completed in 1989. The second phase of the Grand Louvre plan, ''[[La Pyramide Inversée]]'' (''The Inverted Pyramid''), was completed in 1993. As of 2002, attendance had doubled since completion.&lt;ref name="Biz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_24/b3787627.htm | date=17 June 2002 | title=Online Extra: Q&amp;A with the Louvre's Henri Loyrette | work=Business Week Online | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210154237/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2002-06-16/online-extra-q-and-a-with-the-louvres-henri-loyrette | archive-date=10 December 2013| accessdate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Satellite museums====

=====Lens=====
{{Main|Louvre-Lens}}

In 2004, French officials decided to build a satellite museum on the site of an abandoned coal pit in the former mining town of [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy.&lt;ref name=Gentleman/&gt; Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] chose Lens to be the site of the new building, the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects [[SANAA]] were selected to design the Lens project in 2005. Museum officials predicted that the new building, capable of receiving about 600&amp;nbsp;works of art, would attract up to 500,000&amp;nbsp;visitors a year when it opened in 2012.&lt;ref name=Gentleman&gt;{{cite news| last = Gentleman| first = Amelia| title = Lens puts new angle on the Louvre| pages =|work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 1 December 2004| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/01/france.arts| accessdate =27 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Abu Dhabi=====
{{Main|Louvre Abu Dhabi}}
On 8 November 2017, a direct extension of the Louvre, [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]], opened its doors to the public in the city of [[Abu Dhabi]]. A 30-year agreement, signed by French Culture Minister [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]] and Sheik [[Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan]], established the museum on [[Saadiyat Island]] in Abu Dhabi in exchange for €832,000,000 (US$1.3&amp;nbsp;billion). The Louvre Abu Dhabi, designed by the French architect [[Jean Nouvel]] and the engineering firm of [[Buro Happold]], occupy {{convert|24000|m2|sqft}} and is covered by an iconic metallic roof designed to cast rays of light mimicking sunlight passing through [[date palm]] fronds in an [[oasis]]. France agreed to rotate between 200 and 300&amp;nbsp;artworks during a 10-year period; to provide management expertise; and to provide four temporary exhibitions a year for 15&amp;nbsp;years. The art will come from multiple museums, including the Louvre, the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Georges Pompidou Centre]], the Musée d'Orsay, Versailles, the [[Guimet Museum|Musée Guimet]], the [[Musée Rodin]], and the [[Musée du quai Branly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/arts/design/07louv.html|title=The Louvre's Art: Priceless.

=====Iran=====
In March 2018 an exhibition of dozens of artworks and relics belonging to France’s Louvre Museum was opened to visitors in [[Tehran]], as a result of an agreement between Iranian and French presidents in 2016. In the Louvre, two departments were allocated to the antiquities of the Iranian civilization, and the managers of the two departments visited Tehran. Relics belonging to Ancient Egypt, Rome and Mesopotamia as well as French royal items were showcased at the Tehran exhibition.

Iran’s [[National Museum of Iran|National Museum]] building was designed and constructed by French architect [[André Godard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ifpnews.com/exclusive/exhibition-louvre-museums-items-opens-tehran/|title=Exhibition of Louvre Museum’s Items Opens in Tehran|publisher=IFP News (Iran Front Page)|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its time in Tehran, the exhibition is set to be held in the [[Khorasan Grand Museum]] in [[Mashhad]], northeastern Iran in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://ifpnews.com/exclusive/mashhad-to-host-louvre-exhibit-after-end-of-tehran-show/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conservation====
[[File:Vista exterior del Museo del Louvre.JPG|thumb|The Louvre Palace]]
In 2009, [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[Frédéric Mitterrand]] approved a plan that would have created a storage facility {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Paris to hold objects from the Louvre and two other national museums in Paris's flood zone, the [[Musée du Quai Branly]] and the [[Musée d'Orsay]]; the plan was later scrapped. In 2013, his successor [[Aurélie Filippetti]] announced that the Louvre would move more than 250,000 works of art&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Vincent Noce (13 July 2015), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/157551/ Louvre's superstore to go ahead despite protests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715025743/http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/157551/ |date=15 July 2015 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; held in a {{convert|20000|m2|sqft}} basement storage area in [[Liévin]]; the cost of the project, estimated at €60 million, will be split between the region (49%) and the Louvre (51%).&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Stapley-Brown (10 November 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Designers-chosen-for-Louvres-m-storage-outpost/36260 Designers chosen for Louvre's €60m storage outpost] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111010540/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Designers-chosen-for-Louvres-m-storage-outpost/36260 |date=11 November 2014 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Louvre will be the sole owner and manager of the store.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In July 2015, a team led by British firm [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]] was selected to design the complex, which will have light-filled work spaces under one vast, green roof.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Controversial acquisitions===

The Louvre is involved in controversies that surround cultural property seized under Napoleon I, as well as during World War II by the Nazis. During [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation]], thousands of artworks were stolen. But after the war, 61,233 articles of more than 150,000 seized artworks returned to France and were assigned to the Louvre's Office des Biens Privés. In 1949, it entrusted 2,130 unclaimed pieces (including 1,001 paintings) to the Direction des Musées de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as MNRs (Musées Nationaux Recuperation or, in English, the National Museums of Recovered Artwork). Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/mnr/Matteoli/RM-musees-nationaux.pdf |title=Rapport Matteoli, Le pillage de l'art en France pendant l'occupation et la situation des 2000 oeuvres confiées aux Musées nationaux, p. 50, 60, 69 |format=PDF |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined at the end of the 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.

They were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years (1950–1954) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947–1949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] initiated the Mattéoli Commission, headed by [[Jean Mattéoli]], to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678&amp;nbsp;pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, p.&amp;nbsp;294&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to less formal criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.

According to [[Serge Klarsfeld]], since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of ''prescription acquisitive'' of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.

In June 2015, the Louvre was accused of discriminating against Israeli students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2015/06/15/soupcons-de-discrimination-a-l-encontre-d-etudiants-israeliens_1329404|title=Soupçons de discrimination à l'encontre d'étudiants israéliens|work=Libération.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/06/15/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/louvre-accused-of-discriminating-against-israeli-students|title=Louvre accused of discriminating against Israeli students|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israeli-student-group-turned-away-from-Louvre-406109|title=Israeli student group turned away from Louvre|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the [[British Museum]]. On the other hand, the [[Dendera zodiac]] is, like the [[Rosetta Stone]], claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return. The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via [[UNESCO]]'s Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin.&lt;ref&gt;Merryman, abstract&lt;/ref&gt; The museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes (30&amp;nbsp;cm x 15&amp;nbsp;cm each) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008, eight to five years after their good-faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect of the procedure of ''déclassement'' from French public collections before the [[Commission scientifique nationale des collections des musées de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/culture/20091009.OBS4116/le-louvre-se-dit-satisfait-de-la-restitution-des-fresques-egyptiennes.html |title=Le Louvre se dit "satisfait" de la restitution des fresques égyptiennes - Culture - Nouvelobs.com |publisher=Tempsreel.nouvelobs.com |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The Musée du Louvre contains more than 380,000&amp;nbsp;objects and displays 35,000&amp;nbsp;works of art in eight curatorial departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.citibreak.com/the-fabulous-collections-of-the-greatest-museums-in-the-world-the-louvre/ | title =The fabulous collections of the Louvre Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian antiquities===
{{main|Department of Egyptian Antiquities of the Louvre}}
The department, comprising over 50,000&amp;nbsp;pieces,&lt;ref name="Mignot 74"/&gt; includes artifacts from the [[Nile]] civilizations which date from 4,000&amp;nbsp;BC to the 4th&amp;nbsp;century AD.&lt;ref name="Nave 42"/&gt; The collection, among the world's largest, overviews Egyptian life spanning [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the [[New Kingdom]], [[Coptic art]], and the [[Roman Egypt|Roman]], [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]], and [[Byzantine]] periods.&lt;ref name="Nave 42"&gt;Nave,&amp;nbsp;pp.42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The seated scribe-E 3023-IMG 4267-gradient.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[The Seated Scribe]]'' from [[Saqqara]], Egypt, limestone and alabaster, circa 2600 and 2350&amp;nbsp;BC&lt;ref name="Pocket"&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;92&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The department's origins lie in the royal collection, but it was augmented by Napoleon's 1798 expeditionary trip with [[Dominique Vivant]], the future director of the Louvre.&lt;ref name="Mignot 74"&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;pp&amp;nbsp;76,&amp;nbsp;77&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Jean-François Champollion]] translated the [[Rosetta Stone]], [[Charles X of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;X]] decreed that an Egyptian Antiquities department be created. Champollion advised the purchase of three collections, formed by [[Edmé-Antoine Durand]], [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] and [[Bernardino Drovet]]; these additions added 7,000&amp;nbsp;works. Growth continued via acquisitions by [[Auguste Mariette]], founder of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo. Mariette, after excavations at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], sent back crates of archaeological finds including ''[[The Seated Scribe]]''.&lt;ref name="Mignot 74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Egyptian"/&gt;

Guarded by the ''Large Sphinx'' (c. 2000&amp;nbsp;BC), the collection is housed in more than 20&amp;nbsp;rooms. Holdings include art, [[papyrus]] scrolls, mummies, tools, clothing, jewelry, games, musical instruments, and weapons.&lt;ref name="Mignot 74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nave 42"/&gt; Pieces from the ancient period include the ''[[Gebel el-Arak Knife]]'' from 3400&amp;nbsp;BC, ''The Seated Scribe'', and the ''Head of King Djedefre''. Middle Kingdom art, "known for its gold work and statues", moved from realism to idealization; this is exemplified by the [[schist]] statue of [[Amenemhatankh]] and the wooden ''Offering Bearer''. The New Kingdom and Coptic Egyptian sections are deep, but the statue of the goddess [[Nephthys]] and the limestone depiction of the goddess [[Hathor]] demonstrate New Kingdom sentiment and wealth.&lt;ref name="Nave 42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Egyptian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/presentation_departement.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211727&amp;CURRENT_LLV_FICHE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211727&amp;CURRENT_LLV_DEP%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474395181077&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500768&amp;bmLocale=en |publisher=Musée du Louvre |title=Egyptian Antiquities |accessdate=30 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311063405/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/presentation_departement.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211727&amp;CURRENT_LLV_FICHE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211727&amp;CURRENT_LLV_DEP%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474395181077&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500768&amp;bmLocale=en |archivedate=11 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near Eastern antiquities===
[[File:Human headed winged bull profile.jpg|thumb|upright|Human-headed winged bull (''[[shedu]]''), [[Assyria]], limestone, 8th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC]]
Near Eastern antiquities, the second newest department, dates from 1881 and presents an overview of early Near Eastern civilization and "first settlements", before the arrival of [[Islam]]. The department is divided into three geographic areas: the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]] (Iraq), and Persia (Iran). The collection's development corresponds to archaeological work such as [[Paul-Émile Botta]]'s 1843 expedition to [[Khorsabad]] and the discovery of [[Sargon II]]'s palace.&lt;ref name="Nave 42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mignot 119"/&gt; These finds formed the basis of the Assyrian museum, the precursor to today's department.&lt;ref name="Nave 42"/&gt;

The museum contains exhibits from [[Sumer]] and the city of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], with monuments such as the Prince of Lagash's ''[[Stele of the Vultures]]'' from 2450&amp;nbsp;BC and the [[stele]] erected by [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], King of Akkad, to celebrate a victory over barbarians in the [[Zagros Mountains]]. The {{convert|2.25|m|ft|2|adj=on}} [[Code of Hammurabi]], discovered in 1901, displays [[Babylonian Law]]s prominently, so that no man could plead their ignorance. The 18th-century BC mural of the ''[[Investiture of Zimrilim]]'' and the 25th-century BC ''[[Statue of Ebih-Il]]'' found in the ancient city-state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] are also on display at the museum.

The Persian portion of Louvre contains work from the archaic period, like the ''Funerary Head'' and the Persian ''Archers of Darius I''.&lt;ref name="Nave 42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Near East"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/presentation_departement.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211730&amp;CURRENT_LLV_FICHE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211730&amp;CURRENT_LLV_DEP%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474395181111&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500768&amp;bmLocale=en |title=Decorative Arts |publisher=Musée du Louvre |accessdate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020071258/http://louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/presentation_departement.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211730&amp;CURRENT_LLV_FICHE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211730&amp;CURRENT_LLV_DEP%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474395181111&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500768&amp;bmLocale=en |archivedate=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This section also contains rare objects from [[Persepolis]] which were also lent to the [[British Museum]] for its Ancient Persia exhibition in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This department is one of the museum's oldest; it began with appropriated royal art, some of which was acquired under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].&lt;ref name="Nave 42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mignot 155"&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;155–58&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the collection focused on marble sculptures, such as the ''[[Venus de Milo]]''. Works such as the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'' arrived during the Napoleonic Wars, but these pieces were returned after Napoleon I's fall in 1815. In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, the Louvre acquired works including vases from the Durand collection, bronzes such as the ''[[Borghese Vase]]'' from the [[Bibliothèque nationale]].&lt;ref name="Pocket"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreekER"/&gt;

The archaic is demonstrated by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone ''[[Lady of Auxerre]]'', from 640 BC; and the cylindrical ''[[Hera]] of Samos'', circa 570–560&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Nave 42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannan,&amp;nbsp;p.252&lt;/ref&gt; After the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the ''[[Borghese Gladiator]]''. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the [[Hellenistic]] era, including The ''Winged Victory of Samothrace'' (190&amp;nbsp;BC) and the ''Venus de Milo'', symbolic of classical art.&lt;ref name="Mignot 155"/&gt; The long ''Galerie Campana'' displays an outstanding collection of more than one thousand [[Greek pottery|Greek potteries]]. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed.&lt;ref name="GreekER"/&gt; The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Marcus Annius Verus|Annius Verus]]; among the bronzes is the Greek ''[[Apollo of Piombino]]''.

It remained small until 1847, when Léon Laborde was given control of the department. Laborde developed the medieval section and purchased the first such statues and sculptures in the collection, ''[[Childebert I|King Childebert]]'' and ''stanga door'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Mignot 397"/&gt; The collection was part of the Department of Antiquities but was given autonomy in 1871 under [[Louis Courajod]], a director who organized a wider representation of French works.&lt;ref name="Sculpture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mignot 397"/&gt; In 1986, all post-1850 works were relocated to the new Musée d'Orsay. The Grand Louvre project separated the department into two exhibition spaces; the French collection is displayed in the Richelieu wing, and foreign works in the Denon wing.&lt;ref name="Sculpture"/&gt;

The collection's overview of French [[sculpture]] contains [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] works such as the 11th-century ''Daniel in the Lions' Den'' and the 12th-century ''Virgin of Auvergne''. In the 16th century, Renaissance influence caused French sculpture to become more restrained, as seen in [[Jean Goujon]]'s bas-reliefs, and [[Germain Pilon]]'s ''Descent from the Cross'' and ''Resurrection of Christ''. The 17th and 18th centuries are represented by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s 1640–1 [[Bust of Cardinal Richelieu]], [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]]'s ''Woman Bathing'' and ''Amour menaçant'', and [[François and Michel Anguier|François Anguier]]'s obelisks. [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] works includes [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'' (1787).&lt;ref name="Mignot 397"/&gt; The 18th and 19th centuries are represented by the French sculptor [[Alfred Barye]].

===Decorative arts===

The [[Objet d'art|Objets d'art]] collection spans the time from the Middle Ages to the mid-19th&amp;nbsp;century. The department began as a subset of the sculpture department, based on royal property and the transfer of work from the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]], the burial ground of French monarchs that held the ''Coronation Sword of the Kings of France''.&lt;ref name="Nave 130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mignot 451"&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;451–54&lt;/ref&gt; Among the budding collection's most prized works were [[pietre dure]] vases and bronzes. The Durand collection's 1825 acquisition added "ceramics, enamels, and stained glass", and 800&amp;nbsp;pieces were given by Pierre Révoil. The onset of [[Romanticism]] rekindled interest in [[Renaissance]] and [[Medieval]] artwork, and the Sauvageot donation expanded the department with 1,500&amp;nbsp;middle-age and [[faience|faïence]] works. In 1862, the [[Campana collection]] added gold jewelry and maiolicas, mainly from the 15th&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;16th&amp;nbsp;centuries.&lt;ref name="Mignot 451"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/presentation_departement.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211732&amp;CURRENT_LLV_FICHE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211732&amp;CURRENT_LLV_DEP%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474395181114&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500768&amp;bmLocale=en |title=Decorative Arts |publisher=Musée du Louvre |accessdate=30 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203074306/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/presentation_departement.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211732&amp;CURRENT_LLV_FICHE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673211732&amp;CURRENT_LLV_DEP%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474395181114&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500768&amp;bmLocale=en |archivedate=3 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works are displayed on the Richelieu Wing's first floor and in the Apollo Gallery, named by the painter Charles Le Brun, who was commissioned by Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV (the Sun King) to decorate the space in a solar theme. The medieval collection contains the coronation crown of Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV, [[Charles V of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;V's]] sceptre, and the 12th&amp;nbsp;century ''porphyry vase''.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;242&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance art holdings include [[Giambologna]]'s bronze ''Nessus and Deianira'' and the tapestry ''Maximillian's Hunt''.&lt;ref name="Nave 130"&gt;Nave,&amp;nbsp;p&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt; From later periods, highlights include [[Madame de Pompadour]]'s [[Sèvres]] vase collection and [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]]'s apartments.&lt;ref name="Nave 130"/&gt;

In September 2000, the Louvre Museum dedicated the [[Gilbert R. Chagoury|Gilbert Chagoury]] and Rose-Marie Chagoury Gallery to display tapestries donated by the Chagourys, including a 16th-century six-part tapestry suite, sewn with gold and silver threads representing sea divinities, which was commissioned in Paris for [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquis de Seignelay|Colbert de Seignelay]], Secretary of State for the Navy.

When the ''d'Orsay'' train station was converted into the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 1986, the collection was split, and pieces completed after the [[1848 Revolution]] were moved to the new museum. French and Northern European works are in the Richelieu wing and ''Cour Carrée''; Spanish and Italian paintings are on the first floor of the Denon wing.&lt;ref name="Mignot 199"/&gt;

Exemplifying the French School are the early ''[[Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon|Avignon Pietà]]'' of [[Enguerrand Quarton]]; the anonymous painting of ''King Jean le Bon'' (c.1360), possibly the oldest independent portrait in Western painting to survive from the postclassical era;&lt;ref&gt;Mignot,&amp;nbsp;p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s ''Louis XIV''; [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]''; and [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]''.

[[Caravaggio]] is represented by ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|The Fortune Teller]]'' and ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]''.

The La Caze Collection, a bequest to the Musée du Louvre in 1869 by [[Louis La Caze]], was the largest contribution of a person in the history of the Louvre. La Caze gave 584 paintings of his personal collection to the museum. The bequest included [[Antoine Watteau]]'s Commedia dell'arte player of Pierrot ("Gilles").

==Location, access, and facilities==
[[File:Louvre Access Map.png|thumb|right|Map of Louvre museum and around, showing bus stops and metro lines serving the area as well as parking]]
The museum lies in the center of Paris on the Right Bank, in the [[1st arrondissement of Paris|1st arrondissement]]. It was home to the former [[Tuileries Palace]], which closed off the western end of the Louvre entrance courtyard, but was heavily damaged by fire during the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 and later demolished. The adjacent [[Tuileries Gardens]], created in 1564 by Catherine de' Medici, was designed in 1664 by [[André Le Nôtre]]. The gardens house the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], a [[contemporary art]] exhibition space which was used to store confiscated Jewish cultural property during the 1940 to 1944 German occupation of France.&lt;ref name="Frommer"&gt;Mroue, p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel to the Jeu de Paume is the Orangerie, home to the famous ''[[Water Lilies]]'' paintings by [[Claude Monet]].

The Louvre is slightly askew of the Historic Axis (''[[Axe historique]]''), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins on the east in the Louvre courtyard and runs west along the [[Champs-Élysées]]. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the [[Paris Commune]] revealed that the Louvre was slightly askew of the ''Axe'' despite past appearances to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The Louvre can be reached by the [[Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre (Paris Métro)|Palais Royal&amp;nbsp;– Musée du Louvre]] [[Paris Metro|Métro]] or the [[Louvre - Rivoli (Paris Métro)|Louvre-Rivoli]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/venir.jsp |title=How to get here |work=Louvre Museum |accessdate=28 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921232331/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/venir.jsp |archivedate=21 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Louvre has three entrances: the main entrance at the pyramid, an entrance from the [[Carrousel du Louvre]] underground shopping mall, and an entrance at the Porte des Lions (near the western end of the Denon wing).

Under the main entrance to the museum is the [[Carrousel du Louvre]], a shopping mall operated by [[Unibail-Rodamco]]. Among other stores, it has the first Apple Store in France, and a [[McDonald's]] restaurant, the presence of which has created controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/06/mcdonalds.louvre/ |publisher=CNN | title='Bad taste' cries as McDonald's moves into 'Mona Lisa' museum | accessdate=11 May 2010 | date=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{AmericanEmpire}}

In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, '''manifest destiny''' was a widely held belief in the [[United States]] that its settlers were destined to expand across [[North America]]. There are three basic themes to manifest destiny:
* The special virtues of the American people and their institutions
* The mission of the United States to redeem and remake the west in the image of [[History of agrarianism#United States|agrarian]] America
* An irresistible destiny to accomplish this essential duty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J. Miller|title=Native America, Discovered And Conquered: Thomas Jefferson, Lewis &amp; Clark, And Manifest Destiny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ccnP7tWU7hwC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|page=120|isbn=9780275990114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Frederick Merk]] says this concept was born out of "a sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have emphasized that "manifest destiny" was a contested concept—''pre-civil war'' [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] endorsed the idea but many prominent Americans (such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and most [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]]) rejected it. Historian [[Daniel Walker Howe]] writes, "American imperialism did not represent an American consensus; it provoked bitter dissent within the national polity&amp;nbsp;... ''Whigs'' saw America's moral mission as one of democratic example rather than one of conquest."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815–1848'', (2007) pp. 705–06&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper editor [[John L. O'Sullivan|John O'Sullivan]] is generally credited with coining the term ''manifest destiny'' in 1845 to describe the essence of this mindset, which was a rhetorical tone;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/29.asp|title=29. Manifest Destiny|website= American History|publisher=USHistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the unsigned editorial titled "Annexation" in which it first appeared was arguably written by journalist and annexation advocate [[Jane Cazneau]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Linda S. Mistress of Manifest Destiny: A Biography of Jane McManus Storm Cazneau, 1807–1878. Texas State Historical Association, 2001. {{ISBN|0-87611-179-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was used by [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the 1840s to justify the [[Mexican–American War|war with Mexico]] and it was also used to divide half of [[Oregon country|Oregon]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. But manifest destiny always limped along because of its internal limitations and the issue of slavery, says Merk. It never became a national priority. By 1843, former U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]], originally a major supporter of the concept underlying manifest destiny, had changed his mind and repudiated [[expansionism]] because it meant the expansion of slavery in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merk|1963|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA215 215–216]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merk concluded:
{{quote|From the outset Manifest Destiny—vast in program, in its sense of [[Continentalism#Continentalism in North America|continentalism]]—was slight in support. It lacked national, sectional, or party following commensurate with its magnitude. The reason was it did not reflect the national spirit. The thesis that it embodied nationalism, found in much historical writing, is backed by little real supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;p=PA215 215]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Context ==
There was never a set of principles defining manifest destiny, therefore it was always a general idea rather than a specific policy made with a motto. Ill-defined but keenly felt, manifest destiny was an expression of conviction in the morality and value of expansionism that complemented other popular ideas of the era, including [[American exceptionalism]] and [[Romantic nationalism]]. [[Andrew Jackson]], who spoke of "extending the area of freedom", typified the conflation of America's potential greatness, the nation's budding sense of Romantic self-identity, and its expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|1962|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vQQ_uxoWdpYC&amp;pg=PA136 136–37]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifest Destiny"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401802517.html | title=Manifest Destiny | publisher=Encyclopedia.com taken from ''Dictionary of American History'' | year=2003 | accessdate=June 11, 2014 | last=Hidalgo |first=Dennis R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Jackson would not be the only president to elaborate on the principles underlying manifest destiny. Owing in part to the lack of a definitive narrative outlining its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America's destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: "A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase "Manifest Destiny". They are not, as we should expect, all compatible, nor do they come from any one source."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tuveson|1980|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-FM8cDl9g00C&amp;pg=PA91 91]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[File:John O'Sullivan.jpg|thumb|[[John L. O'Sullivan]], sketched in 1874, was an influential columnist as a young man, but he is now generally remembered only for his use of the phrase "manifest destiny" to advocate the annexation of Texas and Oregon.]]
Journalist [[John L. O'Sullivan]] was an influential advocate for [[Jacksonian democracy]] and a complex character, described by [[Julian Hawthorne]] as "always full of grand and world-embracing schemes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA27 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Sullivan wrote an article in 1839 that, while not using the term "manifest destiny", did predict a "divine destiny" for the United States based upon values such as equality, rights of conscience, and personal enfranchisement "to establish on earth the moral dignity and salvation of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Sullivan|first=John|title=The Great Nation of Futurity|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=usde;cc=usde;idno=usde0006-4;node=usde0006-4%3A6;view=image;seq=350;size=100;page=root|website=The United States Democratic Review Volume 0006 Issue 23 (November 1839)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This destiny was not explicitly territorial, but O'Sullivan predicted that the United States would be one of a "Union of many Republics" sharing those values.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, John L., [http://www.newhumanist.com/md4.html ''A Divine Destiny for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016015009/http://www.newhumanist.com/md4.html |date=October 16, 2004 }}, 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years later, in 1845, O'Sullivan wrote another essay titled ''Annexation'' in the ''Democratic Review'',&lt;ref name = Annex&gt;{{cite journal

Linda S. Hudson has argued that it was coined by writer Jane McManus Storm; Greenburg, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EQV6wPzlyOcC&amp;pg=PA20 20]; Hudson 2001; O'Sullivan biographer Robert D. Sampson disputes Hudson's claim for a variety of reasons (See note 7 at {{Harvnb|Sampson|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d1y5ew93xxIC&amp;pg=PA244 244–45])}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this article he urged the U.S. to [[Texas annexation|annex]] the [[Republic of Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9SE_zwYlXrQC&amp;pg=PA188 188]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; not only because Texas desired this, but because it was "our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by [[Divine providence|Providence]] for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas R. Hietala, ''Manifest design: American exceptionalism and Empire'' (2003) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Overcoming Whig opposition, Democrats [[Annexation of Texas|annexed Texas]] in 1845. O'Sullivan's first usage of the phrase "manifest destiny" attracted little attention.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Johannsen, "The Meaning of Manifest Destiny", in {{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Sullivan's second use of the phrase became extremely influential. On December 27, 1845, in his newspaper the ''New York Morning News'', O'Sullivan addressed the [[Oregon boundary dispute|ongoing boundary dispute]] with Britain. O'Sullivan argued that the United States had the right to claim "the whole of Oregon":
&lt;blockquote&gt;And that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.&lt;ref name = McCrisken&gt;McCrisken, Trevor B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHDkqb-myscC&amp;pg=PA68 "Exceptionalism: Manifest Destiny"] in ''Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy'' (2002), Vol. 2, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, O'Sullivan believed that Providence had given the United States a mission to spread [[republican democracy]] ("the great experiment of liberty"). Because Britain would not spread democracy, thought O'Sullivan, British claims to the territory should be overruled. O'Sullivan believed that manifest destiny was a moral ideal (a "higher law") that superseded other considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=145}}; {{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Sullivan's original conception of manifest destiny was not a call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that the expansion of the United States would happen without the direction of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government or the involvement of the military. After Americans immigrated to new regions, they would set up new democratic governments, and then seek admission to the United States, as Texas had done. In 1845, O'Sullivan predicted that California would follow this pattern next, and that Canada would eventually request annexation as well. He disapproved of the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846, although he came to believe that the outcome would be beneficial to both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, O'Sullivan's term became popular only after it was criticized by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] opponents of the [[James K. Polk|Polk administration]]. Whigs denounced manifest destiny, arguing, "that the designers and supporters of schemes of conquest, to be carried on by this government, are engaged in treason to our Constitution and Declaration of Rights, giving aid and comfort to the enemies of republicanism, in that they are advocating and preaching the doctrine of the right of conquest".&lt;ref&gt;"Prospectus of the New Series", ''The American Whig Review'' Volume 7 Issue 1 (Jan 1848) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3, 1846, Representative [[Robert Charles Winthrop|Robert Winthrop]] ridiculed the concept in Congress, saying "I suppose the right of a manifest destiny to spread will not be admitted to exist in any nation except the universal Yankee nation". Winthrop was the first in a long line of critics who suggested that advocates of manifest destiny were citing "Divine Providence" for justification of actions that were motivated by chauvinism and self-interest. Despite this criticism, expansionists embraced the phrase, which caught on so quickly that its origin was soon forgotten.

== Themes and influences ==
Historian William E. Weeks has noted that three key themes were usually touched upon by advocates of manifest destiny:
* the '''virtue''' of the American people and their institutions;
* the '''mission''' to spread these institutions, thereby redeeming and remaking the world in the image of the United States;
* the '''destiny''' under God to do this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weeks|1996|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the first theme, later known as [[American exceptionalism]], was often traced to America's [[Puritan]] heritage, particularly [[John Winthrop]]'s famous "[[City upon a Hill]]" sermon of 1630, in which he called for the establishment of a virtuous community that would be a shining example to the [[Old World]].&lt;ref&gt;Justin B. Litke, "Varieties of American Exceptionalism: Why John Winthrop Is No Imperialist", ''Journal of Church and State'', 54 (Spring 2012), 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt; In his influential 1776 pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', [[Thomas Paine]] echoed this notion, arguing that the [[American Revolution]] provided an opportunity to create a new, better society:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation, similar to the present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now. The birthday of a new world is at hand&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many Americans agreed with Paine, and came to believe that the United States' virtue was a result of its special experiment in freedom and democracy. Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to [[James Monroe]], wrote, "it is impossible not to look forward to distant times when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent."&lt;ref name=ford2010pp315-319&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|2010|pp=315–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Americans in the decades that followed their proclaimed freedom for mankind, embodied in the Declaration of Independence, could only be described as the inauguration of "a new time scale" because the world would look back and define history as events that took place before, and after, the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Somkin|1967|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed that Americans owed to the world an obligation to expand and preserve these beliefs.{{Original research inline|date=November 2018}}

The second theme's origination is less precise. A popular expression of America's mission was elaborated by President Abraham Lincoln's description in his December 1, 1862, message to Congress. He described the United States as "the last, best hope of Earth". The "mission" of the United States was further elaborated during Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]], in which he interpreted the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] as a struggle to determine if any nation with democratic ideals could survive; this has been called by historian Robert Johannsen "the most enduring statement of America's Manifest Destiny and mission".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johannsen|1997|pp=18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third theme can be viewed as a natural outgrowth of the belief that God had a direct influence in the foundation and further actions of the United States. [[Clinton Rossiter]], a scholar, described this view as summing "that God, at the proper stage in the march of history, called forth certain hardy souls from the old and privilege-ridden nations ... and that in bestowing his grace He also bestowed a peculiar responsibility". Americans presupposed that they were not only divinely elected to maintain the North American continent, but also to "spread abroad the fundamental principles stated in the Bill of Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rossiter|1950|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases this meant neighboring colonial holdings and countries were seen as obstacles rather than the destiny God had provided the United States.

[[John Mack Faragher|Faragher's]] analysis of the political polarization between the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] is that:
{{quote|Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the North) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue, the extension of slavery to the territories. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed... For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow Thomas Jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'', (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another possible influence is racial predominance, namely the idea that the American Anglo-Saxon race was "separate, innately superior" and "destined to bring good government, commercial prosperity and Christianity to the American continents and the world". This view also held that "inferior races were doomed to subordinate status or extinction." This was used to justify "the enslavement of the blacks and the expulsion and possible extermination of the Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Race and Manifest Destiny |author=Reginald Horsman |pages=2, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative interpretations ==
With the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, which doubled the size of the United States, [[Thomas Jefferson]] set the stage for the continental expansion of the United States. Many began to see this as the beginning of a new [[providentialism|providential]] mission: If the United States was successful as a "[[City upon a Hill|shining city upon a hill]]", people in other countries would seek to establish their own democratic republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Witham |first=Larry |title=A City Upon a Hill: How Sermons Changed the Course of American History |location=New York |publisher=Harper |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all Americans or their political leaders believed that the United States was a divinely favored nation, or thought that it ought to expand. For example, many [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] opposed territorial expansion based on the Democratic claim that the United States was destined to serve as a virtuous example to the rest of the world, and also had a divine obligation to spread its superordinate political system and a way of life throughout North American continent. Many in the Whig party "were fearful of spreading out too widely", and they "adhered to the concentration of national authority in a limited area".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA40 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1848, [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]] denounced [[James K. Polk|President Polk's]] expansionist interpretation of America's future as "mendacious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Byrnes |first=Mark Eaton |title=James K. Polk: A Biographical Companion |location=Santa Barbara, Calif |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2001 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid‑19th century, expansionism, especially southward toward Cuba, also faced opposition from those Americans who were trying to abolish slavery. As more territory was added to the United States in the following decades, "extending the area of freedom" in the minds of southerners also meant extending the institution of slavery. That is why slavery became one of the central issues in the continental expansion of the United States before the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=Michael A. |title=Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and during the Civil War both sides claimed that America's destiny were rightfully their own. Lincoln opposed anti-immigrant [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], and the imperialism of manifest destiny as both unjust and unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mountjoy |first=Shane |title=Manifest Destiny: Westward Expansion |location=New York |publisher=Chelsea House Publishers |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He objected to the Mexican War and believed each of these disordered forms of patriotism threatened the inseparable moral and fraternal bonds of liberty and Union that he sought to perpetuate through a patriotic love of country guided by wisdom and critical self-awareness. Lincoln's "[[s:Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln/Volume 3/Eulogy of Henry Clay|Eulogy to Henry Clay]]", June 6, 1852, provides the most cogent expression of his reflective patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joseph R. Fornieri |title=Lincoln's Reflective Patriotism |journal=Perspectives on Political Science |date=April–June 2010 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=108–17 |doi=10.1080/10457091003685019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Era of continental expansion ==
[[File:John Quincy Adams.jpeg|thumb|[[John Quincy Adams]], painted above in 1816 by [[Charles Robert Leslie]], was an early proponent of continentalism. Late in life he came to regret his role in helping U.S. slavery to expand, and became a leading opponent of the annexation of Texas.]]
The phrase "manifest destiny" is most often associated with the [[United States territorial acquisitions|territorial expansion of the United States]] from 1812 to 1860. This era, from the end of the [[War of 1812]] to the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], has been called the "age of manifest destiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kurt Hanson |author2=Robert L. Beisner|title=American Foreign Relations since 1600: A Guide to the Literature, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCQsQdqFyMYC|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-080-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rCQsQdqFyMYC&amp;pg=PA313 313]|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean—"from sea to shining sea"—largely defining the borders of the [[contiguous United States]] as they are today.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart and Weeks call this period the "era of manifest destiny" and the "age of manifest destiny", respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War of 1812 ===
{{Further|War of 1812}}
One of the causes of the War of 1812 may have been an American desire to annex or threaten to annex British Canada in order to stop the Indian raids into the Midwest, expel Britain from North America, and gain additional land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nugent|pp=74–79}}{{cnf|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us experience for the attack of Halifax the next, and the final expulsion of England from the American continent.—To William Duane. vi, 75. Ford ed., ix, 366. (M., August 1812.)&lt;/ref&gt; The American victories at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] and the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813 ended the Indian raids and removed one of the reasons for annexation. The American failure to occupy any significant part of Canada prevented them from annexing it for the second reason, which was largely ended by the [[Era of Good Feelings]], which ensued after the war between Britain and the United States.

To end the [[War of 1812]] [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Henry Clay]] and [[Albert Gallatin]] (former Treasury Secretary and a leading expert on Indians) and the other American diplomats negotiated the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814 with Britain. They rejected the British plan to set up an Indian state in U.S.&amp;nbsp;territory south of the Great Lakes. They explained the American policy toward acquisition of Indian lands:
{{quote|The United States, while intending never to acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, and with their free consent, are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim from the state of nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or of humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation. If this be a spirit of aggrandizement, the undersigned are prepared to admit, in that sense, its existence; but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations, or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain&amp;nbsp;... They will not suppose that that Government will avow, as the basis of their policy towards the United States a system of arresting their natural growth within their own territories, for the sake of preserving a perpetual desert for savages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charles M. Gates |title=The West in American Diplomacy, 1812–1815 |journal=Mississippi Valley Historical Review |year=1940 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=499–510 |doi=10.2307/1896318 |jstor=1896318}} quote on p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A shocked [[Henry Goulburn]], one of the British negotiators at Ghent, remarked, after coming to understand the American position on taking the Indians' land:
{{quote|Till I came here, I had no idea of the fixed determination which there is in the heart of every American to extirpate the Indians and appropriate their territory.&lt;ref&gt;PBS, ''The War of 1812'', Essays. https://www.pbs.org/wned/war-of-1812/essays/treaty-ghent/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Continentalism ===
The 19th-century belief that the United States would eventually encompass all of North America is known as "continentalism",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociologyindex.com/continental.htm Continental and Continentalism], sociologyindex.com. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193436/http://www.sociologyindex.com/continental.htm |date=May 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savagesandscoundrels.org/flashpoints-conflicts/1820s-continentalism/&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[tellurocracy]]. An early proponent of this idea, [[John Quincy Adams]], became a leading figure in U.S. expansion between the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the [[James K. Polk|Polk administration]] in the 1840s. In 1811, Adams wrote to [[John Adams|his father]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole continent of North America appears to be destined by Divine Providence to be peopled by one ''nation'', speaking one language, professing one general system of religious and political principles, and accustomed to one general tenor of social usages and customs. For the common happiness of them all, for their peace and prosperity, I believe it is indispensable that they should be associated in one federal Union.&lt;ref&gt;Adams quoted in {{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Fort Laramie - Walters 37194049.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[Fort Laramie]] as it looked prior to 1840. Painting from memory by Alfred Jacob Miller]]
Adams did much to further this idea. He orchestrated the [[Treaty of 1818]], which established the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] as far west as the Rocky Mountains, and provided for the joint occupation of the region known in American history as the [[Oregon Country]] and in British and Canadian history as the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] and [[Columbia District]]s. He negotiated the [[Adams–Onís Treaty|Transcontinental Treaty]] in 1819, transferring [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] from Spain to the United States and extending the U.S. border with Spanish Mexico all the way to the Pacific Ocean. And he formulated the [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, which warned Europe that the [[Western Hemisphere]] was no longer open for European colonization.

The Monroe Doctrine and "manifest destiny" formed a closely related nexus of principles: historian Walter McDougall calls manifest destiny a corollary of the Monroe Doctrine, because while the Monroe Doctrine did not specify expansion, expansion was necessary in order to enforce the Doctrine. Concerns in the United States that European powers (especially Great Britain) were seeking to acquire colonies or greater influence in North America led to calls for expansion in order to prevent this. In his influential 1935 study of manifest destiny, Albert Weinberg wrote: "the expansionism of the [1830s] arose as a defensive effort to forestall the encroachment of Europe in North America".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|p=74}}; {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== All Oregon ====
Manifest destiny played its most important role in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] between the United States and Britain, when the phrase "manifest destiny" originated. The [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]] had provided for the joint occupation of the [[Oregon Country]], and thousands of Americans migrated there in the 1840s over the [[Oregon Trail]]. The British rejected a proposal by U.S. President [[John Tyler]] (in office 1841–1845) to divide the region along the [[49th parallel north|49th&amp;nbsp;parallel]], and instead proposed a boundary line farther south along the [[Columbia River]], which would have made most of what later became the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] part of British North America. Advocates of manifest destiny protested and called for the annexation of the entire Oregon Country up to the [[Alaska line]] (54°40ʹ N). Presidential candidate [[James K. Polk]] used this popular outcry to his advantage, and the Democrats called for the annexation of "All Oregon" in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1844|1844 U.S.&amp;nbsp;Presidential election]].

[[File:Emanuel Leutze - Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way - Smithsonian.jpg|thumb|American westward expansion is idealized in [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''[[Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way]]'' (1861). The title of the painting, from a 1726 poem by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]], was a phrase often quoted in the era of manifest destiny, expressing a widely held belief that civilization had steadily moved westward throughout history. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060105071332/http://americanart.si.edu/t2go/1lw/1931.6.1.html (more)] ]]

As president, however, Polk sought compromise and renewed the earlier offer to divide the territory in half along the 49th&amp;nbsp;parallel, to the dismay of the most ardent advocates of manifest destiny. When the British refused the offer, American expansionists responded with slogans such as "The Whole of Oregon or None!" and "Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!", referring to the northern border of the region. (The latter slogan is often mistakenly described as having been a part of the 1844 presidential campaign.) When Polk moved to terminate the joint occupation agreement, the British finally agreed in early 1846 to divide the region along the 49th parallel, leaving the lower Columbia basin as part of the United States. The [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 formally settled the dispute; Polk's administration succeeded in selling the treaty to Congress because the United States was about to begin the [[Mexican–American War]], and the president and others argued it would be foolish [[Two-front war|to also fight the British Empire]].

Despite the earlier clamor for "All Oregon", the Oregon Treaty was popular in the United States and was easily ratified by the Senate. The most fervent advocates of manifest destiny had not prevailed along the northern border because, according to [[Reginald C. Stuart|Reginald Stuart]], "the compass of manifest destiny pointed west and southwest, not north, despite the use of the term 'continentalism{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;
Treaty popular: {{Harvnb|Stuart|1988|p=104}}; compass quote p. 84.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, American historian [[Frances Fuller Victor]] published ''[[wikisource:en:The Overland Monthly/Volume 3/Manifest Destiny in the West|Manifest Destiny in the West]] in the ''[[Overland Monthly]]'', arguing that the efforts of early American fur traders and missionaries presaged American control of Oregon. She concluded the article as follows:
{{cquote|It was an oversight on the part of the United States, the giving up the island of Quadra and Vancouver, on the settlement of the boundary question. Yet, "what is to be, will be", as some realist has it; and we look for the restoration of that picturesque and rocky atom of our former territory as inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Frances Fuller | last=Victor | title=Manifest Destiny in the West | journal=[[Overland Monthly]] |volume=3 |issue=2 |date=August 1869 | title-link=wikisource:en:The Overland Monthly/Volume 3/Manifest Destiny in the West }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Mexico and Texas ===
Manifest destiny played an important role in the expansion of Texas and American relationship with [[History of Mexico|Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramon Eduardo Ruiz, ed., ''The Mexican War--was it Manifest Destiny?'' (Harcourt, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1836, the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico and, after the [[Texas Revolution]], sought to join the United States as a new state. This was an idealized process of expansion that had been advocated from Jefferson to O'Sullivan: newly democratic and independent states would request entry into the United States, rather than the United States extending its government over people who did not want it. The annexation of Texas was attacked by anti-slavery spokesmen because it would add another slave state to the Union. Presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren declined Texas's offer to join the United States in part because the slavery issue threatened to divide the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon Rathbun, Lyon "The debate over annexing Texas and the emergence of manifest destiny." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 4#3 (2001): 459–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the election of 1844, Whig candidate [[Henry Clay]] and the presumed Democratic candidate, former President Van Buren, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas, each hoping to keep the troublesome topic from becoming a campaign issue. This unexpectedly led to Van Buren being dropped by the Democrats in favor of Polk, who favored annexation. Polk tied the Texas annexation question with the Oregon dispute, thus providing a sort of regional compromise on expansion. (Expansionists in the North were more inclined to promote the occupation of Oregon, while Southern expansionists focused primarily on the annexation of Texas.) Although elected by a very slim margin, Polk proceeded as if his victory had been a mandate for expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark R. Cheathem|author2=Terry Corps|title=Historical Dictionary of the Jacksonian Era and Manifest Destiny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtprDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139|year=2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=139|isbn=9781442273207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== All Mexico ====
{{Main|All of Mexico Movement}}
[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|American occupation of Mexico City in 1847]]
After the election of Polk, but before he took office, Congress approved the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]]. Polk moved to occupy a portion of Texas that had [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence from Mexico]] in 1836, but was still claimed by Mexico. This paved the way for the outbreak of the [[Mexican–American War]] on April 24, 1846. With American successes on the battlefield, by the summer of 1847 there were calls for the annexation of "All Mexico", particularly among Eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union was the best way to ensure future peace in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA144 144–47]}}; {{Harvnb|Fuller|1936}}; {{Harvnb|Hietala|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a controversial proposition for two reasons. First, idealistic advocates of manifest destiny like John L. O'Sullivan had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed on people against their will. The annexation of "All Mexico" would be a violation of this principle. And secondly, the annexation of Mexico was controversial because it would mean extending U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizenship to millions of Mexicans. Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of South Carolina, who had approved of the annexation of Texas, was opposed to the annexation of Mexico, as well as the "mission" aspect of manifest destiny, for racial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Paul Reeve|title=Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mpYKBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=2015|publisher=Oxford UP|page=6|isbn=9780199754076}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made these views clear in a speech to Congress on January 4, 1848:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race—the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind, of incorporating an Indian race; for more than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes. I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.... We are anxious to force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged ... that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake.&lt;ref name = Calhoun&gt;{{cite web| last = Calhoun | first = John C. | title = Conquest of Mexico | publisher = TeachingAmericanHistory.org | year = 1848 | url = http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=478 | accessdate = October 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This debate brought to the forefront one of the contradictions of manifest destiny: on the one hand, while identitarian ideas inherent in manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans, as non-whites, would present a threat to white racial integrity and thus were not qualified to become Americans, the "mission" component of manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans would be improved (or "regenerated", as it was then described) by bringing them into American democracy. Identitarianism was used to promote manifest destiny, but, as in the case of Calhoun and the resistance to the "All Mexico" movement, identitarianism was also used to oppose manifest destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|pp=87–95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, proponents of annexation of "All Mexico" regarded it as an anti-slavery measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fuller|1936|pp=119, 122, 162 and ''passim''}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USA Territorial Growth 1850.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Growth from 1840 to 1850]]
The controversy was eventually ended by the [[Mexican Cession]], which added the territories of [[Alta California]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]] to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the All Oregon movement, the All Mexico movement quickly abated.

Historian [[Frederick Merk]], in ''Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation'' (1963), argued that the failure of the "All Oregon" and "All Mexico" movements indicates that manifest destiny had not been as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that, while belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, aggressive "continentalism" were aberrations supported by only a minority of Americans, all of them Democrats. Some Democrats were also opposed; the Democrats of Louisiana opposed annexation of Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Billy H. Gilley |title='Polk's War' and the Louisiana Press |journal=Louisiana History |year=1979 |pages=5–23 |jstor=4231864 |volume=20|issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while those in Mississippi supported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert A. Brent |title=Mississippi and the Mexican War |journal=Journal of Mississippi History |year=1969 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=202–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filibusterism ===
After the Mexican–American War ended in 1848, disagreements over the expansion of slavery made further annexation by conquest too divisive to be official government policy. Some, such as [[John Quitman]], governor of Mississippi, offered what public support they could offer. In one memorable case, Quitman simply explained that the state of Mississippi had "lost" its state arsenal, which began showing up in the hands of filibusters. Yet these isolated cases only solidified opposition in the North as many Northerners were increasingly opposed to what they believed to be efforts by Southern slave owners—and their friends in the North—to expand slavery through [[filibuster (military)|filibustering]]. [[Sarah Parker Remond|Sarah P. Remond]] on January 24, 1859, delivered an impassioned speech at [[Warrington, England]], that the connection between filibustering and slave power was clear proof of "the mass of corruption that underlay the whole system of American government".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ripley|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wilmot Proviso]] and the continued "[[Slave Power]]" narratives thereafter, indicated the degree to which manifest destiny had become part of the sectional controversy.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Without official government support the most radical advocates of manifest destiny increasingly turned to [[filibuster (military)|military filibustering]]. Originally filibuster had come from the Dutch ''vrijbuiter'' and referred to buccaneers in the West Indies that preyed on Spanish commerce. While there had been some filibustering expeditions into Canada in the late 1830s, it was only by mid-century did filibuster become a definitive term. By then, declared the ''[[The New York Times|New-York Daily Times]]'' "the fever of Fillibusterism is on our country. Her pulse beats like a hammer at the wrist, and there's a very high color on her face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E7D8133DE034BC4C53DFB566838F649FDE |title=A Critical Day|date=March 4, 1854|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millard Fillmore's second annual message to Congress, submitted in December 1851, gave double the amount of space to filibustering activities than the brewing sectional conflict. The eagerness of the filibusters, and the public to support them, had an international hue. Clay's son, diplomat to Portugal, reported that Lisbon had been stirred into a "frenzy" of excitement and were waiting on every dispatch.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:WilliamWalker.jpg|thumb|left|Filibuster [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]], who launched several expeditions to [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], ruled [[Nicaragua]], and was captured by the British Navy before being executed in [[Honduras]].]]
Although they were illegal, filibustering operations in the late 1840s and early 1850s were romanticized in the United States. The Democratic Party's national platform included a plank that specifically endorsed William Walker's filibustering in [[Nicaragua]]. Wealthy American expansionists financed dozens of expeditions, usually based out of [[New Orleans]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[San Francisco]]. The primary target of manifest destiny's filibusters was Latin America but there were isolated incidents elsewhere. Mexico was a favorite target of organizations devoted to filibustering, like the Knights of the Golden Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crenshaw|1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Walker got his start as a filibuster in an ill-advised attempt to separate the Mexican states Sonora and Baja California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|2006|pp=1–50}}{{citation not found|date=October 2010&lt;!-- possibly should be Greene 2008, for which there is a cite in the article --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narciso López]], a near second in fame and success, spent his efforts trying to secure Cuba from the [[Spanish Empire]].

The United States had long been interested in acquiring Cuba from the declining [[Spanish Empire]]. As with Texas, Oregon, and California, American policy makers were concerned that Cuba would fall into British hands, which, according to the thinking of the Monroe Doctrine, would constitute a threat to the interests of the United States. Prompted by John L. O'Sullivan, in 1848 President Polk offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100&amp;nbsp;million. Polk feared that filibustering would hurt his effort to buy the island, and so he informed the Spanish of an attempt by the Cuban filibuster Narciso López to seize Cuba by force and annex it to the United States, foiling the plot. Nevertheless, Spain declined to sell the island, which ended Polk's efforts to acquire Cuba. O'Sullivan, on the other hand eventually landed in legal trouble.&lt;ref name="Tread"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crocker|2006|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filibustering continued to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Millard Fillmore]] tried to suppress the expeditions. When the Democrats recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of [[Franklin Pierce]], a filibustering effort by [[John A. Quitman]] to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off, however, and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130&amp;nbsp;million. When the public learned of the [[Ostend Manifesto]] in 1854, which argued that the United States could seize Cuba by force if Spain refused to sell, this effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weeks|1996|pp=144–52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filibusters like [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] continued to garner headlines in the late 1850s, but to little effect. Expansionism was among the various [[origins of the American Civil War|issues that played a role]] in the coming of the war. With the divisive question of the expansion of slavery, Northerners and Southerners, in effect, were coming to define manifest destiny in different ways, undermining nationalism as a unifying force. According to Frederick Merk, "The doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which in the 1840s had seemed Heaven-sent, proved to have been a bomb wrapped up in idealism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA214 214]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native Americans ===
[[File:Across the Continent - Currier &amp; Ives 1868.jpg|right|thumb|''Across The Continent'', an 1868 lithograph illustrating the westward expansion of white settlers]]
Manifest destiny had serious consequences for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], since continental expansion implicitly meant the occupation and annexation of Native American land, sometimes to expand slavery. This ultimately led to confrontations and  wars with several groups of native peoples via [[Indian removal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E.

In a policy formulated largely by [[Henry Knox]], [[Secretary of War]] in the Washington Administration, the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government sought to expand into the west through the purchase of Native American land in treaties. Only the Federal Government could purchase Indian lands and this was done through treaties with tribal leaders. Whether a tribe actually had a decision-making structure capable of making a treaty was a controversial issue. The national policy was for the Indians to join American society and become "civilized", which meant no more wars with neighboring tribes or raids on white settlers or travelers, and a shift from hunting to farming and ranching. Advocates of civilization programs believed that the process of settling native tribes would greatly reduce the amount of land needed by the Native Americans, making more land available for homesteading by white Americans. [[Thomas Jefferson]] believed that while American Indians were the intellectual equals of whites,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prucha|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iSeWGTYsFcsC&amp;pg=PA137 137]}}, "I believe the Indian then to be in body and mind equal to the white man," (Jefferson letter to the Marquis de Chastellux, June 7, 1785).&lt;/ref&gt; they had to live like the whites or inevitably be pushed aside by them.&lt;ref name="American Indians"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/american-indians |title=American Indians |publisher=Thomas Jefferson's Monticello |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's belief, rooted in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, that whites and Native Americans would merge to create a single nation did not last his lifetime, and he began to believe that the natives should emigrate across the [[Mississippi River]] and maintain a separate society, an idea made possible by the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803.&lt;ref name="American Indians" /&gt;

In the age of manifest destiny, this idea, which came to be known as "[[Indian removal]]", gained ground. Humanitarian advocates of removal believed that American Indians would be better off moving away from whites. As historian Reginald Horsman argued in his influential study ''Race and Manifest Destiny'', racial rhetoric increased during the era of manifest destiny. Americans increasingly believed that Native American ways of life would "fade away" as the United States expanded. As an example, this idea was reflected in the work of one of America's first great historians, [[Francis Parkman]], whose landmark book ''[[Pontiac's Rebellion|The Conspiracy of Pontiac]]'' was published in 1851. Parkman wrote that after the British conquest of Canada in 1760, Indians were "destined to melt and vanish before the advancing waves of Anglo-American power, which now rolled westward unchecked and unopposed". Parkman emphasized that the collapse of Indian power in the late 18th century had been swift and was a past event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Parkman|title=The conspiracy of Pontiac and the Indian war after the conquest of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yA4tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR9|origyear=1851|year=1913|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond North America ==
[[File:Annexation Here to Stay.jpg|thumb|[[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Annexation]] of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] in 1898]]
As the Civil War faded into history, the term ''manifest destiny'' experienced a brief revival. Protestant missionary [[Josiah Strong]], in his best seller of 1885 [[Our Country (book)|''Our Country'']], argued that the future was devolved upon America since it had perfected the ideals of civil liberty, "a pure spiritual Christianity", and concluded, "My plea is not, Save America for America's sake, but, Save America for the world's sake."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strong|1885|pp=107–08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1892|1892 U.S.&amp;nbsp;presidential election]], the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] platform proclaimed: "We reaffirm our approval of the [[Monroe doctrine]] and believe in the achievement of the manifest destiny of the Republic in its broadest sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Official Manual of the State of Missouri|year=1895|publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Missouri|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AtWgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=%22achievement+of+the+manifest+destiny+of+the+Republic%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22achievement%20of%20the%20manifest%20destiny%20of%20the%20Republic%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was meant by "manifest destiny" in this context was not clearly defined, particularly since the Republicans lost the election.

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1896|1896 election]], however, the Republicans recaptured the White House and held on to it for the next 16&amp;nbsp;years. During that time, manifest destiny was cited to promote [[history of United States overseas expansion|overseas expansion]]. Whether or not this version of manifest destiny was consistent with the continental expansionism of the 1840s was debated at the time, and long afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Republican Party [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showplatforms.php?platindex=R1892 platform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018004944/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showplatforms.php?platindex=R1892 |date=October 18, 2007 }}; context not clearly defined, {{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA241 241]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when President [[William McKinley]] advocated annexation of the [[Territory of Hawaii|Republic of Hawaii]] in 1898, he said that "We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny." On the other hand, former President [[Grover Cleveland]], a Democrat who had blocked the annexation of Hawaii during his administration, wrote that McKinley's annexation of the territory was a "perversion of our national destiny". Historians continued that debate; some have interpreted American acquisition of other Pacific island groups in the 1890s as an extension of manifest destiny across the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Others have regarded it as the antithesis of manifest destiny and merely [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;McKinley quoted in {{Harvnb|McDougall|1997|pp=112–13}}; {{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA257 257]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish–American War and the Philippines ===
[[File:Well, I hardly know which to take first! 5-28-1898.JPG|thumb|A cartoon of [[Uncle Sam]] seated in restaurant looking at the bill of fare containing "Cuba steak", "Porto Rico pig", the "Philippine Islands" and the "Sandwich Islands" (Hawaii).]]
In 1898, the United States intervened in the Cuban insurrection and launched the [[Spanish–American War]] to force Spain out. According to the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba and ceded the [[The Philippines|Philippine Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Guam]] to the United States. The terms of cession for the Philippines involved a payment of the sum of $20 million by the United States to Spain. The treaty was highly contentious and denounced by [[William Jennings Bryan]], who tried to make it a central issue [[United States presidential election, 1900|in the 1900 election.]] He was defeated in landslide by McKinley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Thomas A.| last=Bailey| authorlink=Thomas A. Bailey| title=Was the Presidential Election of 1900 a Mandate on Imperialism?| journal=[[Mississippi Valley Historical Review]]| year=1937| pages=43–52| volume=24| doi=10.2307/1891336| jstor=1891336| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Teller Amendment]], passed unanimously by the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Senate before the war, which proclaimed Cuba "free and independent", forestalled annexation of the island. The [[Platt Amendment]] (1902), however, established Cuba as a virtual [[protectorate]] of the United States.

The acquisition of [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Philippines]] after the war with [[Spain]] marked a new chapter in U.S.&amp;nbsp;history. Traditionally, territories were acquired by the United States for the purpose of becoming new states on equal footing with already existing states. These islands, however, were acquired as [[colonialism|colonies]] rather than prospective states. The process was validated by the [[Insular Cases]]. The Supreme Court ruled that full constitutional rights did not automatically extend to all areas under American control. Nevertheless, in 1917, Puerto Ricans were all made full American citizens via the [[Jones–Shafroth Act|Jones Act]]. This also provided for a popularly elected legislature and a bill of rights, and authorized the election of a Resident Commissioner who has a voice (but no vote) in Congress.

According to Frederick Merk, these colonial acquisitions marked a break from the original intention of manifest destiny. Previously, "Manifest Destiny had contained a principle so fundamental that a Calhoun and an O'Sullivan could agree on it—that a people not capable of rising to statehood should never be annexed. That was the principle thrown overboard by the imperialism of 1899."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA257 257]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Beveridge|Albert J. Beveridge]] maintained the contrary at his September 25, 1900, speech in the Auditorium, at Chicago. He declared that the current desire for Cuba and the other acquired territories was identical to the views expressed by Washington, Jefferson and Marshall. Moreover, "the sovereignty of the Stars and Stripes can be nothing but a blessing to any people and to any land."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beveridge|1908|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines was eventually given its independence in 1946; Guam and Puerto Rico have special status to this day, but all their people have United States citizenship.

The English poet [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote "[[The White Man's Burden]]" to Americans, calling on them to take up their share of the burden. Subtitled "The United States and the Philippine Islands", it was a widely noted expression of imperialist sentiments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kipling |first=Rudyard |url=http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/kipling/white_mans_burden.html |title=The White Man's Burden}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were common at the time. The nascent [[First Philippine Republic|revolutionary government]] desirous of independence, however, resisted the United States in the [[Philippine–American War]] in 1899; it won no support from any government anywhere and collapsed when its leader was captured. [[William Jennings Bryan]] denounced the war and any form of overseas expansion, writing, {{"'}}Destiny' is not as manifest as it was a few weeks ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryan|1899}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panama canal cartooon 1903.jpg|thumb|The U.S.'s intentions to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to the [[separation of Panama from Colombia]] in 1903]]
After the turn of the nineteenth century to the twentieth, the phrase ''manifest destiny'' declined in usage, as territorial expansion ceased to be promoted as being a part of America's "destiny". Under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] the role of the United States in the New World was defined, in the 1904 [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], as being an "international police power" to secure American interests in the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt's corollary contained an explicit rejection of territorial expansion. In the past, manifest destiny had been seen as necessary to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere, but now expansionism had been replaced by [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] as a means of upholding the doctrine.

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] continued the policy of interventionism in the Americas, and attempted to redefine both manifest destiny and America's "mission" on a broader, worldwide scale. Wilson led the United States into [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] with the argument that "The world must be made safe for democracy." In his 1920 message to Congress after the war, Wilson stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... I think we all realize that the day has come when Democracy is being put upon its final test. The Old World is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as asserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction, of the multitude. This is the time of all others when Democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was the only time a president had used the phrase "manifest destiny" in his annual address. Wilson's version of manifest destiny was a rejection of expansionism and an endorsement (in principle) of [[self-determination]], emphasizing that the United States had a mission to be a world leader for the cause of democracy. This U.S. vision of itself as the leader of the "[[Free World]]" would grow stronger in the 20th century after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], although rarely would it be described as "manifest destiny", as Wilson had done.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:President Wilson's War Address|"Safe for democracy"]]; [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29561 1920 message]; Wilson's version of manifest destiny: {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1935|p=471}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Manifest destiny" is sometimes used by critics of U.S.&amp;nbsp;foreign policy to characterize interventions in the Middle East and elsewhere. In this usage, "manifest destiny" is interpreted as the underlying cause of what is denounced by some as "[[American imperialism]]". A more positive-sounding phrase devised by scholars at the end of the twentieth century is "nation building", and State Department official Karin Von Hippel notes that the U.S. has "been involved in nation-building and promoting democracy since the middle of the nineteenth century and 'Manifest Destiny{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Karin Von Hippel |title=Democracy by Force: U.S. Military Intervention in the Post-Cold War World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with German ''Lebensraum'' ideology ==
German geographer [[Friedrich Ratzel]] visited North America beginning in 1873&lt;ref name=Mattelart&gt;{{Harvnb|Mattelart|1996|pp=212–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and saw the effects of American manifest destiny.&lt;ref name=Klinghoffer&gt;{{Harvnb|Klinghoffer|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WhyPBHJV5VYC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ratzel sympathized with the results of "manifest destiny", but he never used the term. Instead he relied on the [[Frontier Thesis]] of [[Frederick Jackson Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Atlantic Monthly |date=January 1895 |pages=124–28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z5ERAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA124 |title=A German Appraisal of the United States |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratzel promoted overseas colonies for Germany in Asia and Africa, but not an expansion into Slavic lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woodruff D.

'''Monte Albán''' is a large [[pre-Columbian]] [[archaeological site]] in the [[Santa Cruz Xoxocotlán]] Municipality in the southern [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Oaxaca]] (17.043° N, 96.767°W). The site is located on a low mountainous range rising above the plain in the central section of the [[Valley of Oaxaca]] where the latter's northern [[Etla]], eastern [[Tlacolula]], and southern [[Zimatlán]] &amp; [[Ocotlán (Oaxaca)|Ocotlán]] (or [[Valle Grande (Oaxaca)|Valle Grande]]) branches meet. The present-day state capital [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca City]] is located approximately {{convert|9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of Monte Albán.

The partially excavated civic-ceremonial center of the Monte Albán site is situated atop an artificially-leveled ridge, which with an elevation of about {{convert|1940|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]] rises some {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} from the valley floor, in an easily defensible location. In addition to the monumental core, the site is characterized by several hundred artificial terraces, and a dozen clusters of mounded architecture covering the entire ridgeline and surrounding flanks.&lt;ref name="Blanton 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blanton|first1=Richard E.|title=Monte Albán: Settlement Patterns at the Ancient Zapotec Capital|date=1978|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological ruins on the nearby Atzompa and El Gallo hills to the north are traditionally considered to be an integral part of the ancient city as well.

Besides being one of the earliest cities of [[Mesoamerica]], Monte Albán's importance stems also from its role as the pre-eminent [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] socio-political and economic center for close to a thousand years. Founded toward the end of the Middle [[Formative stage|Formative period]] at around 500 BC, by the Terminal Formative (ca.100 BC-AD 200) Monte Albán had become the capital of a large-scale expansionist [[polity]] that dominated much of the Oaxacan highlands and interacted with other Mesoamerican regional states such as [[Teotihuacan]] to the north (Paddock 1983; Marcus 1983). The city had lost its political pre-eminence by the end of the [[Mesoamerican_chronology#Classic_period_2|Late Classic]] (ca. AD 500-750) and soon thereafter was largely abandoned. Small-scale reoccupation, opportunistic reutilization of earlier structures and tombs, and ritual visitations marked the archaeological history of the site into the Colonial period.

The etymology of the site's present-day name is unclear, and tentative suggestions regarding its origin range from a presumed corruption of a native [[Zapotec language|Zapotec]] name to a colonial-era reference to a Spanish soldier by the name Montalbán or to the [[Alban Hills]] of Italy. The ancient Zapotec name of the city is not known, as abandonment occurred centuries before the writing of the earliest available [[ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] sources.

== Research history ==
[[Image:Monte Alban archaeological site.png|right|250px|thumb|Site plan for Monte Albán.]]
Being visible from anywhere in the central part of the Valley of Oaxaca, the impressive ruins of  Monte Albán attracted visitors and explorers throughout the colonial and modern eras. Among others, Guillermo Dupaix investigated the site in the early 19th century CE, J. M. García published a description of the site in 1859, and [[Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier|A. F. Bandelier]] visited and published further descriptions in the 1890s. A first intensive archaeological exploration of the site was conducted in 1902 by [[Leopoldo Batres]], then General Inspector of Monuments for the Mexican government under [[Porfirio Diaz]].&lt;ref name="Batres 1902"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batres|first1=Leopoldo|title=Exploraciones en Monte Albán|date=1902|publisher=Casa Editorial Gante|location=México}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was however only in 1931 that large-scale scientific excavations were undertaken under the direction of Mexican archaeologist [[Alfonso Caso]]. In 1933, [[Eulalia Guzmán]] assisted with the excavation of Tomb 7.&lt;ref name="PRI (2015)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Presidencia CEN|title=¿Sabías Que..?|url=http://pri.org.mx/TransformandoaMexico/SabiasQue/Sabias.aspx?y=17735|accessdate=20 March 2015|publisher=Partido Revolucionario Institucional|date=February 12, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following eighteen years Caso and his colleagues [[Ignacio Bernal]] and [[Jorge R. Acosta|Jorge Acosta]] excavated large sections within the monumental core of the site, and much of what is visible today in areas open to the public was reconstructed at that time. Besides resulting in the excavation of a large number of residential and civic-ceremonial structures and hundreds of tombs and burials, one lasting achievement of the project by Caso and his colleagues was the establishment of a ceramic chronology (phases Monte Albán I through V) for the period between the site's founding in ca. 500 BCE to end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] period in CE 1521.

The investigation of the periods preceding Monte Albán's founding was a major focus of the Prehistory and Human Ecology Project started by [[Kent Flannery]] of the [[University of Michigan]] in the late 1960s. Over the following two decades this project documented the development of socio-political complexity in the valley from the earliest Archaic period (ca. 8000-2000 BCE) to the Rosario phase (700-500 BCE) immediately preceding Monte Albán, thus setting the stage for an understanding of the latter's founding and developmental trajectory. In this context, among the major accomplishments of Flannery's work in Oaxaca are his extensive excavations at the important formative center of [[San José Mogote]] in the Etla branch of the valley, a project co-directed with Joyce Marcus of the University of Michigan.&lt;ref name="Flannery and Marcus 1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Joyce|authorlink1=Teotihuacan Visitors on Monte Alban Monuments and Murals|editor1-last=Flannery|editor1-first=K.V.|editor2-last=Marcus|editor2-first=J.|title=In The Cloud People|date=1983|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcus and Flannery 1996"/&gt;

A further important step in the understanding of the history of occupation of the Monte Albán site was reached with the Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Valley of Oaxaca Project begun by Richard Blanton and several colleagues in the early 1970s. It is only with their intensive survey and mapping of the entire site that the real extension and size of Monte Albán beyond the limited area explored by Caso became known.&lt;ref name="Blanton 1978"/&gt; Subsequent seasons of the same project under the direction of Blanton, Gary Feinman, Steve Kowalewski, Linda Nicholas, and others extended the survey coverage to practically the entire valley, producing an invaluable amount of data on the region's changing settlement patterns from the earliest times to the arrival of the Spanish in CE 1521.&lt;ref name="Blanton et al. 1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanton|first1=Richard E.|last2=Kowalewski|first2=Stephen A.|last3=Feinman|first3=Gary M.|last4=Appel|first4=Jill|title=Monte Albán's Hinterland, Part I: Prehispanic Settlement Patterns of the Central and Southern Parts of the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico.|journal=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Museum of Anthropology Memoir 15|date=1982|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalewski et al. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowalewski|first1=Stephen A.|last2=Feinman|first2=G.|last3=Finsten|first3=L.|last4=Blanton|first4=R.|last5=Nicholas|first5=L.|title=Monte Albán's Hinterland, Part II: The Prehispanic Settlement Patterns in Tlacolula, Etla and Ocotlán, the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico.|journal=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Museum of Anthropology Memoir 23|date=1989|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site history==
As indicated by Blanton's survey of the site, the Monte Albán hills appear to have been uninhabited prior to 500 BCE (the end of the Rosario ceramic phase). At that time, San José Mogote was the major population center in the valley and head of a [[chiefdom]] that likely controlled much of the northern Etla branch.&lt;ref name="Marcus and Flannery 1996"/&gt; Perhaps as many as three or four other smaller chiefly centers controlled other sub-regions of the valley, including [[Tilcajete]] in the southern Valle Grande branch and [[Yegüih]] in the Tlacolula arm to the east. Competition and warfare seem to have characterized the Rosario phase, and the regional survey data suggests the existence of an unoccupied buffer zone between the San José Mogote chiefdom and those to the south and east.&lt;ref name="Marcus and Flannery 1996"/&gt; It is within this no-man's land that at the end of the Rosario period Monte Albán was founded, quickly reaching a population estimate of around 5,200 by the end of the following Monte Albán Ia phase (ca.300 BCE). This remarkable population increase was accompanied by an equally rapid decline at San José Mogote and neighbouring satellite sites, making it likely that its chiefly elites were directly involved in the founding of the future Zapotec capital. This rapid shift in population and settlement, from dispersed localized settlements to a central urban site in a previously unsettled area, has been referred to as the “Monte Alban Synoikism” by Marcus and Flannery&lt;ref name="Marcus and Flannery 1996"/&gt;{{rp|140-146}} in reference to similar recorded instances in the [[Mediterranean]] area in antiquity. Although it was previously thought&lt;ref name="Blanton 1978"/&gt; that a similar process of large-scale abandonment, and thus participation in the founding of Monte Albán, occurred at other major chiefly centers such as Yegüih and Tilcajete, at least in the latter's case this now appears to be unlikely. A recent project directed by [[Charles S. Spencer|Charles Spencer]] and Elsa Redmond of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York, New York|New York]] has shown that rather than being abandoned the site actually grew significantly in population during the periods Monte Albán Early I and Late I (ca. 500-300 BCE and 300-100 BCE, respectively) and might have actively opposed incorporation into the increasingly powerful Monte Albán state.&lt;ref name="Spencer and Redmond 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=Charles S|last2=Redmond|first2=Elsa M.|title=Multilevel Selection and Political Evolution in the Valley of Oaxaca, 500-100 B.C.|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|date=2001|volume=20|pages=195–229|doi=10.1006/jaar.2000.0371}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Monte Albán-12-05oaxaca161.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Aerial view of Monte Albán]]

By the beginning of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Formative]] (Monte Albán II phase, ca. 100 BCE-CE 200) Monte Albán had an estimated population of 17,200,&lt;ref name="Marcus and Flannery 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Joyce|last2=Flannery|first2=Kent V.|title=Zapotec Civilization: How Urban Society Evolved in Mexico's Oaxaca Valley|date=1996|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=0-500-05078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|139}} making it one of the largest Mesoamerican cities at the time. As its political power grew, Monte Albán expanded militarily, through cooption, and via outright colonization into several areas outside the Valley of Oaxaca, including the Cañada de [[Cuicatlán]] to the north and the southern [[Ejutla de Crespo|Ejutla]] and [[Sola de Vega]] valleys.&lt;ref name="Balkansky 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balkansky|first1=Andrew K.|title=The Sola Valley and the Monte Albán State. A Study of Zapotec Imperial Expansion.|journal=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Museum of Anthropology Memoir 36|date=2002|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spencer 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=Charles S.|title=The Cuicatlán Cañada and Monte Albán: A Study of Primary State Formation|date=1982|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Redmond 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redmond|first1=Elsa M.|title=A Fuego y Sangre: Early Zapotec Imperialism in the Cuicatlán Cañada.|journal=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Museum of Anthropology Memoir 16|date=1983|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Feinman and Nicholas 1990) During this period and into the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] (Monte Albán IIIA phase, ca. CE 200-500) Monte Albán was the capital of a major regional [[polity]] that exerted a dominating influence over the Valley of Oaxaca and across much of the Oaxacan highlands. As mentioned earlier, evidence at Monte Albán is suggestive of high-level contacts between the site's elites and those at the powerful central Mexican city of [[Teotihuacan]], where archaeologists have identified a neighbourhood inhabited by ethnic Zapotecs from the valley of Oaxaca (Paddock 1983). By the Late Classic (Monte Albán IIIB/IV, ca. CE 500-1000) the site's influence outside and inside the valley declined, and elites at several other centers, once part of the Monte Albán state, began to assert their autonomy, including sites such as [[Cuilapan]] and [[Zaachila]] in the Valle Grande and [[Lambityeco]], [[Mitla]], and [[El Palmillo]] in the eastern Tlacolula arm. The latter is the focus of an ongoing project by Gary Feinman and Linda Nicholas of [[Chicago]]'s [[Field Museum]] (Feinman and Nicholas 2002). By the end of the same period (ca. AD 900-1000) the ancient capital was largely abandoned, and the once powerful Monte Albán state was replaced by dozens of competing smaller polities, a situation that lasted up to the Spanish conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Blanton, ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monuments ==
[[Image:Monte Albán-12-05oaxaca053.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of Main Plaza from the North Platform. The South Platform can be seen in the distance.]]
The monumental center of Monte Albán is the Main Plaza, which measures approximately 300 meters by 200 meters. The site's main civic-ceremonial and elite-residential structures are located around it or in its immediate vicinity, and most of these have been explored and restored by Alfonso Caso and his colleagues.
To the north and south the Main Plaza is delimited by large platforms accessible from the plaza via monumental staircases. On its eastern and western sides the plaza is similarly bounded by a number of smaller platform mounds on which stood temples and elite residences, as well as one of two [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourts]] known to have existed at the site. A north-south spine of mounds occupies the center of the plaza and similarly served as platforms for ceremonial structures.

[[Image:Monte-Alban-South-Platform.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The impressive stairs leading up to the South Platform.]]
One characteristic of Monte Albán is the large number of carved stone monuments one encounters throughout the plaza. The earliest examples are the so-called "Danzantes" (literally, dancers), found mostly in the vicinity of Building L and which represent naked men in contorted and twisted poses, some of them genitally mutilated. The figures are said to represent sacrificial victims, which explains the morbid characteristics of the figures. The Danzantes feature physical traits characteristic of Olmec culture.&lt;ref&gt;MexOnline, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The 19th century notion that they depict dancers is now largely discredited, and these monuments, dating to the earliest period of occupation at the site (Monte Albán I), are now seen to clearly represent tortured, sacrificed war prisoners, some identified by name, and may depict leaders of competing centers and villages captured by Monte Albán.&lt;ref name="Marcus and Flannery 1996"/&gt;(Blanton et al. 1996) Over 300 “Danzantes” stones have been recorded to date, and some of the better preserved ones can be viewed at the site's museum. There is some indication that the Zapotecs had writing and calendrical notation.

A different type of carved stones is found on the nearby Building J in the center of the Main Plaza, a building characterized by an unusual arrow-like shape and an orientation that differs from most other structures at the site. Inserted within the building walls are over 40 large carved slabs dating to Monte Albán II and depicting place-names, occasionally accompanied by additional writing and in many cases characterized by upside-down heads. Alfonso Caso was the first to identify these stones as "conquest slabs", likely listing places the Monte Albán elites claimed to have conquered and/or controlled. Some of the places listed on Building J slabs have been tentatively identified, and in one case (the Cañada de Cuicatlán region in northern Oaxaca) Zapotec conquest has been confirmed through archaeological survey and excavations.&lt;ref name="Spencer 1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redmond 1983"/&gt;

The site of Monte Alban contains several pieces of evidence through the architecture of the site to suggest that there was social stratification within the settlement. Walls that were as large as nine meters tall and twenty meters wide were built around the settlement and would have been used not only to create a boundary between Monte Alban and neighboring settlements but also prove the power of the elites within the community. In Scott Hutson’s analysis of the relationships between the commoners and the elites in Monte Alban he notes that the monumental mounds that were found in the site seemed to be evenly spaced throughout the site so that each house would be close enough to a mound that it could easily be kept under surveillance. Hutson also makes note that over time the style of houses seem to have changed to become more private to those living in the buildings making it harder for information to be obtained by outsiders. These changes to the ability of the elites to gain information about the private lives of its citizens would have played a key role in the internal political structure of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutson|first=Scott|title=Built Space and Bad Subjects|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|year=2002|volume=2|issue=1|pages=53–80|doi=10.1177/1469605302002001597|url=http://jsa.sagepub.com/content/2/1/53.full.pdf+html|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artifacts excavated at Monte Albán in over a century of archaeological exploration can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropologia]] in [[Mexico City]] and at the Museo Regional de Oaxaca in the ex-convento de Santo Domingo de Guzmán in Oaxaca City. The latter museum houses, among others, many of the objects discovered in 1932 by Alfonso Caso in Monte Albán's ''Tomb 7'',&lt;ref&gt;In January 2018, Ernest Vargas Ludd, a Mexican-American entrepreneur, son of Zapotec and Mixtec immigrants, claimed copyrights over the pieces supposedly discovered by Alfonso Caso in 1932. According to Vargas Ludd he inherited tools and molds from his great grandfather, a jeweller who made replicas of the Tomb Seven, in the 30s, to be shown in some exhibitions around México. Thus, Vargas Ludd, in collaboration with two Asian American associates, Wu Ming and Cliff Man, founded a Mexican-Korean company, [https://www.instagram.com/ninewind7/ "NineWind"], dedicated to promote the work of his ancestors.&lt;/ref&gt; a Classic period Zapotec tomb that was opportunistically reused in Postclassic times for the burial of [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]] elite individuals. Their burial was accompanied by some of the most spectacular burial offerings of any site in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Caso 1932"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caso|first1=Alfonso|title=Monte Albán, richest archaeological find in the Americas|journal=National Geographic Magazine|date=1932|volume=62|pages=487-512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monte Albán is a popular tourist destination for visitors to Oaxaca and has a small site museum mostly displaying original carved stones from the site. The site received 429,702 visitors in 2017.&lt;ref name=visitors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708021202/http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=Estadística de Visitantes |language=es |publisher=[[INAH]] |accessdate=25 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
The primary threat to this archaeological site is urban growth that is encroaching and "threatening to expand into territories that have potential archaeological value."&lt;ref name="ICOMOS Heritage at Risk 2001/2002"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2001/mexi2001.htm |title= World Heritage at Risk within Mexico |publisher=[[ICOMOS]] |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate matters, the administration of the site is divided amongst four different municipalities, making a unified effort to stop the urban encroachment challenging.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS Heritage at Risk 2001/2002"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11843">'''MyLink'''  a.k.a. '''Intellilink''' is a [[telematics]] system/infotainment system offered by [[General Motors]] vehicles starting in the 2012 model year. 

It is offered in all GM brands aside from [[Cadillac]], who uses their exclusive CUE infotainment system. The MyLink name is used for vehicles under the [[Chevrolet]] and [[Holden]] brands, while the Intellilink name is used for [[Buick]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and [[Opel]]. MyLink systems are manufactured by three companies for GM, [[Panasonic]] for most MyLink models, [[LG Electronics]] for the unit equipped on the [[Chevrolet Sonic]], [[Chevrolet Spark]], [[Chevrolet Trax]] and Vauxhall/[[Opel Adam]], and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] for [[Cadillac]]'s CUE system.

The system is based on [[QNX]] [[real-time operating system]] and voice recognition software from [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autonews.com/article/20110419/OEM06/110419863/buick-gmc-will-get-version-of-chevrolet%E2%80%99s-mylink&lt;/ref&gt; It allows users to control online services through apps, like [[Pandora Internet Radio]] or [[Stitcher Radio]] through voice commands or the touch-screen interface. The car is able to access online content via a smartphone with a 3G data connection connected through [[Bluetooth]].&lt;ref name="allcartech"&gt;[http://www.allcartech.com/blog/1055574_chevrolet-launches-mylink-infotainment-system-on-volt-equinox Chevrolet Launches MyLink Infotainment System On Volt and Equinox], All Car Tech.&lt;/ref&gt; Users are also able to control their phone wirelessly via the same interface. MyLink also integrates [[OnStar]]'s services ([[Advanced Automatic Collision Notification]], roadside assistance, vehicle diagnostics information, live advisors, and turn-by-turn navigation).&lt;ref name="Motortrend"&gt;[http://wot.motortrend.com/2011-new-york-buicks-new-intellilink-looks-lot-like-chevy-mylink-69499.html 2011 New York: Buick’s New IntelliLink Looks A Lot Like Chevy Mylink], Motortrend.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capabilities ==
MyLink can play video and image files in select formats. Images should be in .jpg, .bmp, .png, or .gif format. Video files should be .avi, .mpg, .mp4, .divx, .xvid, or .wmv. Additionally, MyLink supports a large variety of song file formats, including MP3, WMA, and AAC. It also supports the following playlist files M3U standard and extended, iTunes, PLS, WAX, ASX and RMP.&lt;ref name=mylink-capabilities&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chevrolet MyLink Radio Connects to Your Media|url=http://www.chevrolet.com/mylink-bring-your-own-media.html|publisher=Chrvrolet|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
* Integration with driver's iOS, Android or Windows Phone mobile devices, allowing music on the device to be browsed and played from the built-in touch screen
* Integration with iOS, Android or Windows Phone smart phones via Bluetooth to allow hands-free phone conversations
* Pandora internet radio, which provides personalized radio stations based on a user's favorite artists, songs, or genres; purchase songs; and rate songs "up" or "down"&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
* Stitcher SmartRadio, which lets users build a personalized listening experience from thousands of audio choices&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
* Gracenote music identification, which provides artist names, music genre, and album art&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
* Hands-free control of infotainment and vehicle climate controls, powered by Nuance&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;

* MyLink software upgrades that users can download online and transfer to the vehicle&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
*Some functionality is being withheld based on vehicle style/trim level

Note that the supported features and services vary from model to model. For example, MyLink in the Chevrolet Sonic and Spark models does not support Gracenote (since those models have no CD player) or climate control.  The screen size, trim and appearance vary from model to model as well.

Additional features have been announced by Chevrolet for delivery in calendar year 2013.

== Intellilink ==
'''Intellilink''' is the branding for MyLink used by [[Buick]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and [[Opel]]. It is basically the same system as MyLink with the only differences being the graphic interface used.&lt;ref name="Motortrend" /&gt;

== Availability ==

Originally the MyLink systems were set to be available on select 2012 model year vehicles before the end of 2011, however that was pushed back until "Spring 2012".&lt;ref name=mylink-delay&gt;{{cite web|last=Luft|first=Alex|title=Chevy Delays MyLink Until Spring 2012|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2011/12/chevy-delays-mylink-infotainment-system-to-spring-2012/|publisher=GM Authority|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Palais am Festungsgraben''''' (“Palace on the Moat”), originally known as the '''''Palais Donner''''', is a stately building in [[Berlin|Berlin’s]] [[Mitte]] subdistrict located behind, and facing, the ensemble of chestnut trees around the ''[[Neue Wache]]'' (“New Guardhause”), near the eastern terminus of the boulevard ''[[Unter den Linden]]''. The name refers to its construction next to a redundant canal, gradually filled in by 1883, which had originally been a moat surrounding the 17th century city wall. Built as a private residence, it later housed a succession of [[Prussia]]n government offices, and after [[World War II]] various cultural institutions in the [[East Berlin|Soviet sector]] of Berlin. After administrative authority was transferred to the newly established [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic (GDR)]] in 1949 it hosted a succession of institutions established to further German-Russian contacts. Since [[German reunification]] it has accommodated a theater (''Theater im Palais'') and from 2004 an art gallery (''Saarländische Galerie – Europäisches Kunstforum e.V.'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/cgi-bin/hidaweb/getdoc.pl?DOK_TPL=lda_doc.tpl&amp;KEY=obj%2009030078|title=Finanzministerium &amp; Palais am Festungsraben &amp; Palais Donner|publisher=Berlin.de|accessdate=3 June 2015 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By royal order [[Frederick the Great|King Friedrich II]] of [[Prussia]] presented the plot to his [[valet]], Johann Gottfried Donner, on 7 November 1751. Donner had the palace constructed from 1751 to 1753 following plans by the court architect Friedrich Feldmann. Donner and his family lived on the ground floor of the palace and on the first upper storey (''bel étage'') Donner installed a large, elegant hall for public festivities as well as a private residence, which was rented to the administrator of the Prussian mint, [[Johann Philipp Graumann]]. The attic was used to store and air bulk grain, and at the back of the lot Donner laid out a garden with an underground cold storage room (''Eiskeller'') and a carriage house, using the remaining space to run a flourishing trade in timber.&lt;ref&gt;BIM Berliner Immobilienmanagement information sheet, "Palais am Festungsgraben"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 147-0267, Berlin, preußisches Finanzministerium.jpg|thumb|The building as headquarters of the Prussian Finance Ministry (1930)]]

After Donner’s death in 1787 the Prussian Finance Ministry purchased the palace and provided lodgings on the top floor for its senior officers. In 1797 the right side wing was raised one storey. The reformist Prussian statesman [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein]] lived there from 1804 to 1806. In 1863-1864 the building was altered according to plans by the architects Georg Heinrich Bürde and [[Hermann von der Hude]], who redesigned the main staircase and laid out a sequence of several prestigious interconnected rooms on the ''bel étage''. From 1906 until 1944 the palace was the official headquarters of the Prussian Finance Ministry and the residence of 48 ministers. Further modifications took place in 1934 when the Prussian finance minister Johannes Popitz built into the eastern ground floor room the formal dining room of the historic Weydinger House on Unterwasserstrasse. The hall was of high artistic value, being the only remaining example of interior decoration by the prominent Prussian architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], who had designed the banquet room of this private residence in 1830. Owned by the Prussian state since 1860, Weydinger House was torn down to construct the ''Reichsbank'', the central bank of Germany from 1876 until 1945.

In World War II the palace was slightly damaged in air strikes and by combat taking place at the end of the war. The [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] (SMAD) had the building repaired and used it for various purposes, opening it to the public in 1947 as the House of Soviet Culture (''Haus der Kultur der Sowjetunion''). In 1949, now as an institution of the GDR, it became the House of German-Soviet Friendship (run by the ''Gesellschaft für Deutsch-Sowjetische Freundschaft''). As one of the so-called [[mass organization]]s of the GDR, it had the mandate to convey to the German population knowledge about the culture and society of the Soviet Union.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-13812-0001, Berlin, "Haus der Kultur der Sowjetunion".jpg|thumb|The building decorated to celebrate the fifth anniversary in 1952 of the House of Soviet Culture/ House of German-Soviet Friendship]]

After German reunification the listed building came under the ownership of the Federal State of Berlin, was extensively renovated, and renamed ''Palais am Festungsgraben''. Since its founding in 1991 the 99-seat, innovative ''Theater im Palais'' has been located on the ground floor, and in September 2004 the federal state of Saarland rented 200 square meters of exhibition space in the palace for an art gallery, the ''Saarländische Galerie'', featuring work by contemporary artists from the Czech Republic, France, Luxemburg, and Belgium as well as from Saarland and Berlin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9238">The term '''''post-democracy''''' was coined by [[Warwick University]] [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Colin Crouch]] in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that operate by [[Democracy|democratic system]]s ([[election]]s are held, governments fall, [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small [[elite]] is taking the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch further developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] By Colin Crouch. [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''.

[[File:Colin Crouch - Festival Economia 2013.JPG|thumb|[[Colin Crouch]] introduced the term ''post-democracy'' in 2000.]]The term was used by Crouch to design an evolution within democracies during the 21st century.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; It is a [[polemic]]al term because it calls attention to recognized democracies that are losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The term may also denote a general conception of a post-democratic system that may involve other structures of [[group decision-making]] and [[governance]] than the ones found in contemporary or historical democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Joanna|last2=Long|first2=Nicholas J.|last3=Moore|first3=Henrietta L.|title=The State We're In: Reflecting on Democracy's Troubles|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781785332258|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zlSNCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Popescu|first1=Delia|title=Political Action in Václav Havel's Thought: The Responsibility of Resistance|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739149577|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ToGGaQ0dabgC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fonte|first1=John|title=Democracy’s Trojan Horse|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/56-4-Democracys%20Trojan%20Horse.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
By Crouch's definition:&lt;ref name="LSEpd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Five minutes with Colin Crouch|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/five-minutes-with-colin-crouch/|website=[[London School of Economics]]|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"A post-democratic society is one that continues to have and to use all the institutions of democracy, but in which they increasingly become a formal shell. The energy and innovative drive pass away from the democratic arena and into small circles of a politico-economic elite."}}

Crouch states that we are not "living in a post-democratic society, but that we were moving towards such a condition".&lt;ref name="LSEpd"/&gt;

== Causes ==
Crouch names the following reasons:
* '''No common goals:''' For people in the [[post-industrial society]] it is increasingly difficult, in particular for the [[underclass]], to identify themselves as a group and therefore difficult to focus on [[Political party|political parties]] that represent them. For instance [[laborer]]s, [[farmer]]s or [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] no longer feel attracted to one political movement and this means that there is no common goal for them as a group to get united.
* '''[[Globalization]]:''' The effect of globalization makes it almost impossible for nations to work out their own economic policy. Therefore, large [[trade agreement]]s and [[supranational union]]s (e.g., the [[European Union]]) are used to make policy but this level of politics is very hard to control with democratic instruments. Globalization additionally endows [[Multinational_corporation|transnational corporations]] with more political leverage given their ability to avoid federal regulation and directly affect domestic economies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Post-Democracy|last = Crouch|first = |publisher = |year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Non-balanced debates:''' In most democratic countries the positions of the political parties have become very much alike. This means that there is not much to choose from for its voters. The effect is that [[political campaign]]s are looking more like [[advertising]] to make the differences look bigger. Also the private lives of the politicians have become an important item in elections. Sometimes "sensitive" issues stay undiscussed. The English conservative journalist [[Peter Oborne]] presented a documentary of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], arguing that it had become [[Aristocracy (government)|anti-democratic]] because it targeted a number of [[floating voters]] with a narrow agenda.
* '''Entanglement between public and private sector:''' There are large shared interests between politics and business. Through [[lobbying]] companies, [[multinational corporations]] are able to bring about [[legislation]] more effectively than the inhabitants of a country. Corporations and governments are in close relation because states need corporations as they are great employers. But as much of the production is [[outsourcing|outsourced]], and corporations have almost no difficulty in moving to other countries, labor law becomes employee-unfriendly and tax bites are moved from companies to individuals. It becomes more common for politicians and managers to switch jobs (the 'revolving door').
* '''[[Privatization]]:''' Then there is the neoliberal idea of [[new public management]] ([[neoliberalism]]) of privatizing public services. Privatized institutions are difficult to control by democratic means and have no allegiance to human communities, unlike government. Crouch uses the term “phantom firms” to describe the flexibility and elusive nature of firms which bend to the market. He concludes that private firms have incentive to make individual profit rather than better the welfare of the public. For example, he states that there is a problem with pharmaceutical companies funding (and skewing) medical research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
As a consequence:
* Fewer voters use their right to vote, or do vote but don't expect much.
* Politicians can ignore an undesirable outcome of a [[referendum]] or [[opinion poll]]. For instance in 2005 when [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] voted ''No'' at a referendum about the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] these countries still ratified the treaty after only minor modifications were made.
* The rise of [[xenophobic]] and other [[populist]] parties who capitalise on prevailing discontent. 
* Foreign governments can influence the internal politics of a sovereign country. According to Crouch, the way the [[eurozone crisis]] was handled is the best example of how things work in a post-democracy. European leaders managed to bring about a new government taking office in [[Italy]], and in [[Greece]] far-reaching [[austerity]] measures were put in place, contrary to the vote in a popular referendum.
* Private interest becomes increasingly influential in public policy.

== Solutions ==
{{See also|Online participation|LiquidFeedback|Collective problem solving}}
According to Crouch there is an important task for [[social media]] in which voters can participate more actively in [[public debate]]s. In addition, these voters would have to join [[advocacy groups]] for specific interests. The citizens have to reclaim their place in decision making. He calls this post-post-democracy.

The [[Occupy movement]] was a form of more or less disorganized opposition that grew out of the dissatisfaction with to the power of the [[bank]]ing industry.

It is a medium-sized site covering approximately {{convert|3|km2|sqmi}} along the lower [[Motagua River]],&lt;ref&gt;Ashmore 1980, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; with the ceremonial center about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} from the north bank.&lt;ref name="Sharer352"/&gt; During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Maya Classic Period]] (AD&amp;nbsp;200&amp;ndash;900), Quiriguá was situated at the juncture of several important [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade routes]]. The site was occupied by 200, construction on the [[acropolis]] had begun by about 550, and an explosion of grander construction started in the 8th&amp;nbsp;century. All construction had halted by about 850, except for a brief period of reoccupation in the Early [[Mesoamerica#Postclassic|Postclassic]] (''c''.&amp;nbsp;900&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; ''c''.&amp;nbsp;1200). Quiriguá shares its architectural and sculptural styles with the nearby Classic Period city of [[Copán]], with whose history it is closely entwined.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiriguá's rapid expansion in the 8th century was tied to king [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]]'s military victory over Copán in 738. When the greatest king of Copán, [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] or "18-Rabbit", was defeated, he was captured and then sacrificed in the Great Plaza at Quiriguá.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.4&amp;ndash;5, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, Quiriguá had been a [[vassal state]] of Copán, but it maintained its independence afterwards. The ceremonial [[Maya architecture|architecture]] at Quiriguá is quite modest, but the site's importance lies in its wealth of sculpture, including the tallest stone [[monumental sculpture]] ever erected in the [[New World]].&lt;ref name="Coe121"/&gt;

The archaeological site of Quiriguá is named after the nearby village of the same name,&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, viii.&lt;/ref&gt; and is located a little over {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Guatemala City]];&lt;ref&gt;Stross et al. 1983, p.333.&lt;/ref&gt; it lies in the municipality of [[Los Amates]] in the department of Izabal and has an elevation of {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;Inforpress.&lt;/ref&gt;

Positioned on the north bank of the lower reaches of the [[Motagua River]], Quiriguá is situated at the point where the valley broadens into a [[flood plain]], which has exposed the site to periodic flooding over the centuries.&lt;ref name="Loop1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loop35"&gt;Looper 2003, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the river passed close to the site during the period of the city's occupation, it has since changed course and now flows {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} south of the ceremonial centre.&lt;ref name="Sharer352"/&gt; Quiriguá is {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Copán,&lt;ref name="Coe121"/&gt; and is located {{convert|15.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of the international border with [[Honduras]].

The local [[bedrock]] is a hard red [[sandstone]], which the inhabitants used in the construction of monuments and [[Mesoamerican architecture|architecture]]. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to [[Shear (geology)|shearing]] or [[Fracture (geology)|fracturing]], allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt; Quiriguá was built directly over the [[Motagua Fault]] and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major [[earthquake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.507.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
Although the Quiriguá elite were clearly Maya in ethnicity,&lt;ref&gt;Looper 1999, p.264.&lt;/ref&gt; the site lies on the southern periphery of the [[Mesoamerica]]n area and the population was at least bi-ethnic,&lt;ref name="Sheets442"&gt;Sheets 2000, p.442.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Maya people|ethnic Maya]] in a minority.&lt;ref name="Loop1"/&gt; The majority of the population belonged ethnically to the less complex [[Intermediate Area]] lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="Sheets442"/&gt; The [[population density]] of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square mile) in the centre of the city during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]]&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.344.&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated peak population of 1200&amp;ndash;1600;&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.688.&lt;/ref&gt; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3767 per square mile) in central Copán.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.686.&lt;/ref&gt; The low population density indicates that Quiriguá served as the focus for a dispersed rural population.&lt;ref name="Loop1"&gt;Looper 2003, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population levels of the Quiriguá valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Copán in 738, although it was never a heavily populated site.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th&amp;nbsp;century there was a severe decline in population, culminating in the abandonment of the city.&lt;ref name="MG225"/&gt;

==Economy==
The Motagua River flows down from the western [[Guatemalan Highlands|Guatemalan highlands]], and Quiriguá was ideally positioned to control the trade of uncut [[jade]], the majority of which was found in the middle reaches of the Motagua Valley,&lt;ref name="Miller54"&gt;Miller 1999, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as controlling the flow of other important commodities up and down the river such as [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], which was produced as a local [[cash crop]].&lt;ref name="Drew240"&gt;Drew 1999, p.240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loop2"/&gt; Although cacao was produced for trade, maize remained the primary local crop due to its central role in the [[Maya cuisine|Maya diet]].&lt;ref name="Ash111"&gt;Ashmore 2007, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, maize probably formed an important component in the site's tribute payments to its overlords at Copán, a city that was exhausting its own local resources.&lt;ref name="Ash111"/&gt; Although little jade has been recovered from the site, there is evidence for [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|trade in obsidian]] originating from the [[Ixtepeque]] source situated near the upper reaches of the Motagua.&lt;ref name="Loop2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stross ''et al.'' 1983, p.335.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Classic Period, the location of the site would have placed Quiriguá on a crossroads between the trading route from the highlands to the Caribbean coast and the route from Copán to the major cities of the [[Petén Basin]].&lt;ref name="Loop2"&gt;Looper 2003, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known rulers==
{{Maya civilization}}
As recorded on hieroglyphic inscriptions at Quiriguá, all dates are AD. Maya inscriptions for rulers sometimes include reference to a number ("''hel''-number" or count, named after its main glyph) that are believed to specify the position of that ruler in the sequence of dynastic succession to the rulership of the site. Thus a ''hel''-number of five indicates the ruler was fifth in the line of dynastic succession.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1983, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:QuiriguaStelaDNorth.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A tall, narrow monument with the prominent sculpture of a king surrounded by elaborate decoration|Stela D&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; North face]]

There is evidence that Quiriguá was occupied as early as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] (400&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; AD&amp;nbsp;200). Although no structures have been securely dated to this period, a number of Late Preclassic [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been recovered, including 63&amp;nbsp;[[figurine]]s and a [[chert]] blade.&lt;ref name="Loop35"/&gt; Early Classic [[Ceramic art|ceramics]] from Quiriguá are similar to finds at both Copán and [[Chalchuapa]] in [[El Salvador]], while jade hunchback figurines from the same period resemble those found in central Honduras and in the Guatemalan highlands. These early finds demonstrate the participation of Quiriguá in the wider southeastern Maya region from the Late Preclassic onwards.&lt;ref name="Looper 2003, p.38"&gt;Looper 2003, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of hieroglyphic texts from [[Tikal]], Copán and Quiriguá, together with architectural styles and chemical tests of the bones of the founder of the Copán dynasty all suggest that Quiriguá and Copán were founded by elite colonists from the great city of [[Tikal]] as a part of its expansion into the southeastern border area of the Maya region.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharer ''et al.'' 2005, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The recorded history of Quiriguá starts in 426, in the Early Classic (''c''.&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; ''c''.&amp;nbsp;600); according to [[hieroglyph]]ic [[Maya script|inscriptions]] at other sites, on 5&amp;nbsp;September of that year [[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']] was enthroned as king of Copán.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.192.&lt;/ref&gt; Just three days later he installed "Tok Casper", the first known king of Quiriguá, upon the throne.&lt;ref name="MG216"/&gt; From this it is evident that right from the beginning of its recorded history Quiriguá was subservient to its southern neighbour, and was founded to bring the lucrative trade route of the Motagua River under the control of Copán and, indirectly, of Tikal.&lt;ref name="MG216"/&gt; During the next few centuries, about which little is known, the ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá was limited to the hilltop Group A and a broad earthen platform on the valley floor.&lt;ref name="MG216"/&gt; It is recorded that a stela, as yet undiscovered, was erected in 455 by Tutuum Yohl K'inich, the second king of Quiriguá.&lt;ref name="MG217"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; An early monument records the supervision of a ritual in 480 by the then overlord from Copán, demonstrating Quiriguá's continued status as a vassal of that city. A hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of Quiriguá, but interruptions in the text make the reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult.&lt;ref name="MG217"/&gt;

There are close parallels between the 5th-century architecture and monuments of Quiriguá and [[Uaxactun]] in the northern Petén, a site that fell under the domination of Tikal in the late 4th century. The similarities show that Quiriguá remained strongly aligned with the great Tikal alliance network.&lt;ref name="Loop50"&gt;Looper 2003, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hiatus and recovery===
Quiriguá suffered a hiatus from the turn of the 6th century that lasted through to the middle of the 7th century. This may be linked to the [[Tikal#Tikal hiatus|Tikal hiatus]] of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by [[Calakmul]]. There is evidence that Quiriguá suffered an attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument&amp;nbsp;26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.&lt;ref name="Loop50"/&gt;

In the 6th or early 7th century a natural disaster caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried the surface of the site under a deep layer of [[silt]], completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, and it was one of the site's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.&lt;ref name="MG217"/&gt;

A revival can be identified by the dedication of the first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with [[Caracol]] in [[Belize]]. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the [[acropolis]], including the building of the site's first [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apogee===
Quiriguá traditionally had been subordinate to its southern neighbour, Copán, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, king of Copán, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá's throne as his vassal.&lt;ref name="Drew241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loop79"/&gt; As early as 734, however, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat had shown that he was no longer an obedient subordinate of Copán when he started to refer to himself as ''k'ul [[ajaw|ahaw]]'', holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ''ahaw'', subordinate lord; at the same time he began to use his own Quiriguá [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|emblem glyph]].&lt;ref name="Drew241"&gt;Drew 1999, p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; These early assertions of independence can only have been made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance.&lt;ref name="Drew241"/&gt;

[[File:Quirigua Stela C.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A stela with the prominent sculpture of a king surrounded by elaborate decoration. The monument is covered by a thatched roof supported on wooden poles.|Stela C, south face, representing K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.158, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Indeed, this local act of rebellion appears to have been part of the larger political struggle between the two Maya "superpowers", the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul. In 736, only two years later, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat received a visit from Wamaw K'awiil, the high king of distant Calakmul, while Copán was one of Tikal's oldest allies. The timing of this visit by the king of Calakmul is highly significant, falling between the accession of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat to the throne of Quiriguá as a vassal of Copán and the outright rebellion that was to follow. This strongly suggests that Calakmul sponsored Quiriguá's rebellion in order to weaken Tikal and to gain access to the rich trade route of the Motagua Valley.&lt;ref name="Loop79"&gt;Looper 2003, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharer482"/&gt; It is likely that contact with Calakmul had been initiated soon after K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat acceded to the throne, since Quiriguá experienced rapid growth soon after, suggesting that Quiriguá already was receiving external support.&lt;ref name="Loop79"/&gt;

In 738 the interlinked fortunes of Quiriguá and Copán took a stunning change of direction when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of Quiriguá, captured the powerful, but elderly 13th king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil,&lt;ref name="Web300"&gt;Webster 2002, p.300.&lt;/ref&gt; who had installed him on his throne in 725.&lt;ref name="Drew240"/&gt; This coup does not seem to have affected either Copán or Quiriguá physically, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute.&lt;ref name="Drew 1999, p.286"&gt;Drew 1999, p.286.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loop78"/&gt; Quiriguá seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes.&lt;ref name="Drew 1999, p.286"/&gt; An inscription at Quiriguá, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán's patron [[deity|deities]].&lt;ref name="Loop78"/&gt; All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|Maya deities]] often were carried into battle on [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquins]], facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of Copán was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]], and was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.&lt;ref name="Loop78"&gt;Looper 2003, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The captured lord was taken back to Quiriguá and on 3 May 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual.&lt;ref name="Miller1345"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loop76"/&gt; The sacrificial offering of the blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced the standing of Quiriguá and its royal family throughout the region and it proclaimed Quiriguá as the new capital of the south-eastern Maya region.&lt;ref name="Drew241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loop76"&gt;Looper 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Quiriguá engaged in a major monument-building programme, closely mimicking the sculptural style of Copán, possibly using captured Copán sculptors to carry out the work.&lt;ref name="Miller1345"&gt;Miller 1999, pp.134&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Quiriguá and of other sites in the valley rapidly increased after the events of 738, although Quiriguá was always a small centre and its total population probably never exceeded 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.219. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.688.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quirigua Altar M.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Stone sculpture shaped like the head of an animal looking to the left|Altar M, dating to 734. It has been identified variously as feline, a crocodile, and a snake. It may be a three-dimensional representation of a rare [[wikt:toponym|toponymic]] glyph &lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the Late Classic (''c''. 600&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; ''c''. 900), alliance with Calakmul frequently was associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 1999, p.271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 718, the city of Xkuy&amp;nbsp;– an as yet undiscovered site&amp;nbsp;– was attacked and burned by Copán under the leadership of king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. After the king of Copán was sacrificed in 738, Xkuy seems to have become a loyal vassal of Quiriguá and in 762 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat supervised the accession of "Sunraiser Jaguar" to the subservient city's throne.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp.203, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who had so dramatically changed the destiny of his city, died on 27&amp;nbsp;July 785. [[Zoomorph]]&amp;nbsp;G is his memorial stone and it describes how he was buried 10&amp;nbsp;days later in the ''13&amp;nbsp;Kawak House'', a building that has not been identified. The great king was succeeded by "Sky Xul", a king whose name has not been properly identified. "Sky&amp;nbsp;Xul" became the reigning lord of Quiriguá 78&amp;nbsp;days after the death of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who is thought to have been his father.&lt;ref name="Sharer494"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.494&lt;/ref&gt; His reign lasted from 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;years and was a period of continued activity. In most of the Maya region cities already were suffering terminal decline, engulfed by the [[Classic Maya collapse]], but in Quiriguá "Sky&amp;nbsp;Xul" dedicated three great zoomorph sculptures and two [[altar]]s, considered marvels of Maya stoneworking. "Sky&amp;nbsp;Xul" died some time between 795 and 800.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp.222&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and collapse===
Little is known of "Jade Sky", who succeeded "Sky Xul" and was the last recorded ruler of Quiriguá. The city's power already was waning, as evidenced by the two stunted stelae erected during his reign, which indicate that the kingdom no longer had access to the kind of resources needed to produce monuments of a similar quality to those of his predecessors. "Jade&amp;nbsp;Sky" did build two of the largest structures in the acropolis, however.&lt;ref name="MG224"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.224.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stela H east.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Eroded and unreadable hieroglyphs forming a diagonal interlace pattern|The badly eroded east face of Stela H&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Quiriguá apparently retained its independence from Copán and continued to flourish until the beginning of the 9th century.&lt;ref name="Drew242"/&gt; Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810, when king [[Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat]] of Copán visited Quiriguá in order to carry out a ''[[katun (Maya calendar)|k'atun]]''-ending ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Webster 2002, p.303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.483.&lt;/ref&gt; However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá, although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest ''et al.'' 2005, p.556.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Quiriguá falls into silence, engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the [[Classic Maya collapse]]&amp;nbsp;– it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua;&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.527.&lt;/ref&gt; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.&lt;ref name="MG225"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.225.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassic===
In the early [[Postclassic]] Period (''c''. 900 &amp;ndash; ''c''. 1200), Quiriguá was occupied by peoples closely linked to the Caribbean coastal areas of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and [[Belize]], perhaps due to [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal]] Maya control of a trade network that included the Yucatán coast and the Motagua Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, p.488.&lt;/ref&gt; During their brief reoccupation of the site they made substantial additions to the acropolis complex. Finds associated with their occupation include a reclining [[chacmool]] sculpture and ceramics from the east coast of Yucatán,&lt;ref name="MG225"/&gt; artifacts that demonstrate a close link with the distant city of [[Chichen Itza]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.579.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[copper]] bells and ornaments were recovered from Quiriguá, they are among the earliest finds of [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|metal artifacts]] in the Maya area. They have been dated to either the Terminal Classic (''c''.&amp;nbsp;800&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; ''c''.&amp;nbsp;950) or the Early Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.576.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
[[File:QuriguaBlockBMaudslay.jpg|thumb|alt=A man standing beside a large sculptured boulder|Zoomorph B&amp;nbsp;– ''photo by Maudslay'']]

The first European visitor to publish an account of Quiriguá was English architect and artist [[Frederick Catherwood]], who reached the ruins in 1840. The previous landowner, by the surname of Payés, had related the existence of the ruins to his sons and to Carlos Meiney, a [[Jamaica]]n Englishman resident in Guatemala. The elder Payés had recently died and passed the land to his sons and, since neither Meiney nor Payés' sons had visited the land containing the ruins, they invited [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and Catherwood to join them on their first trip to the site. Stephens had other duties to attend to, but Catherwood was able to accompany the Payés brothers to Quiriguá.&lt;ref name="Kelly243"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to adverse conditions he was only able to stay a short time at the ruins, but made drawings of two of the stelae, which were published with a short account of Catherwood's visit in John Lloyd Stephens's book ''Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan'' in 1841. Quiriguá was the first site that Stephens and Catherwood could claim to have discovered themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.65.&lt;/ref&gt; A longer account of the ruins was made in 1854 by Dr. Karl Scherzer.

Explorer and archaeologist [[Alfred Maudslay]] visited Quiriguá for three days in 1881; they were the first [[pre-Columbian]] ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology.&lt;ref name="Kelly243"/&gt; He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], made paper and plaster [[Molding (process)|molds]] of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures;&lt;ref name="Kelly243"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; these molds were then shipped to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], with casts being transferred to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Trustees of the British Museum, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the [[United Fruit Company]] bought Quiriguá and all the land for a great distance around the site for [[banana]] production; they set aside {{convert|75|acre}} around the ceremonial centre as an archaeological park, leaving an island of jungle among the plantations.&lt;ref name="Kelly244"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.244.&lt;/ref&gt; More archaeological work was carried out from 1910 to 1914 by [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] and [[Sylvanus Morley]] for the [[School of American Archaeology]] in Santa&amp;nbsp;Fe.&lt;ref name="Sharer352"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly244"/&gt;  Duplicates of the stelae of Quiriguá made from Hewitt's plaster casts of the originals were exhibited at the [[Panama-California Exposition (1915)|Panama-California Exposition]] in [[San Diego, California]], in 1915.&lt;ref name="Kelly244"/&gt; The casts are still on display at the [[San Diego Museum of Man]] in their "Maya: Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth" exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;San Diego Museum of Man n.d. (a). San Diego Museum of Man n.d. (b).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carnegie Institution]] conducted several intermittent projects at Quiriguá from 1915 through 1934.&lt;ref name="Kelly244"/&gt;  [[Aldous Huxley]], writing after visiting the site in the early 1930s, noted that Quiriguá's stelae commemorated "man's triumph over time and matter and the triumph of time and matter over man."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley 1934, 1950, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Quiriguá was among the first Maya archaeological sites to be studied intensively, although little restoration was carried out and the ruins once again became overgrown with jungle.&lt;ref name="Kelly244"/&gt;

Quiriguá was declared a National Monument in 1970 under Ministerial Accord 1210, this was followed on 19&amp;nbsp;June 1974 by its declaration as an Archaeological Park under Governmental Accord 35-74.&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1974 through 1979, an extensive archaeological project was conducted at Quiriguá sponsored by the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[National Geographic Society]], and the Guatemalan [[Instituto de Antropología e Historia]]. Directed by [[Robert Sharer]] and [[William R. Coe (archaeologist)|William R. Coe]], the project excavated the acropolis, cleaned the monuments, and studied outlying groups.&lt;ref name="Sharer352"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly244"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MG215"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.215.&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1981, and in 1999 UNESCO approved one-off funding of US$27,248 for "emergency assistance for the rehabilitation of the archaeological site of Quiriguá".&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the site's stelae is depicted on the Guatemalan [[Guatemalan quetzal#Coins|10 centavo coin]].&lt;ref&gt;Banco de Guatemala.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|34|ha|acre|adj=on}} area included within the Archaeological Park of Quiriguá has been developed for tourism with the construction of a car park, site museum, and sanitation facilities and is open to the public on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Torres"/&gt;

==The site==

===Architecture===
[[File:QuiriguaGreatPlaza1.jpg|thumb|alt=A flat, open grassy area bordered by trees with a few thatched rooves covering monuments and a path and drainage channel to the left|The Great Plaza of Quiriguá, originally laid out by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat; view is from the acropolis looking north]]

After Quiriguá's pivotal victory over Copán in 738, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat rebuilt the main group in the image of Copán itself. Thus, the [[acropolis]], palace, and ballcourt all lie at the southern end of the Great Plaza.&lt;ref name="Miller54"/&gt; The ceremonial centre is laid out around three plazas, the northernmost is the Great Plaza. This plaza measures {{convert|325|m|ft|abbr=on}} from north to south and is the largest plaza in the whole Maya region. At the southern end of the Great Plaza is the Ballcourt Plaza, surrounded on three sides by structures associated with the acropolis. The Acropolis Plaza is a fully enclosed plaza within the acropolis itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; The area to the west of the Ballcourt Plaza was probably the riverside docking area and there is evidence that the southern part of the Great Plaza was a marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.353, 486.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ceramic-lined [[Water well|wells]] have been excavated close to the site core, these were all built in the 8th&amp;nbsp;century and although some continued in use into the 9th century, none are known to have been built that late.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmore 1984, pp.149, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1A-1''' is an enormous platform forming the northern part of the Great Plaza. It measures {{convert|100|by|85|m|ft}} and rises {{convert|0.5|m|in}} above the level of the southern part of the plaza. It forms the northern portion of the Great Plaza, being built by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat when he extended the plaza northward. The platform was built from river [[Cobblestone|cobbles]] and was paved with stone slabs.&lt;ref name="Loop122"&gt;Looper 2003, p.122.&lt;/ref&gt; Platform&amp;nbsp;1A-1 supported the stelae&amp;nbsp;A, C, D, E and F and Zoomorph&amp;nbsp;B.&lt;ref name="Loop123"&gt;Looper 2003, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was built in two phases over about 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1A-3''' is a large mound marking the northern edge of the Great Plaza. It originally measured {{convert|82.5|by|20|m|ft}} and was {{convert|7|m|ft}} high. A {{convert|63|m|ft|adj=on}} wide stairway climbed the southern face of the structure from the plaza. The structure was later extended to the north but this second phase of construction was never finished.&lt;ref name="Loop122"/&gt;
*'''The acropolis''' is the largest architectural complex at Quiriguá, it lies at the southern limit of the ceremonial centre of the city. It is a complex construction, with new buildings and features being added over time. Construction of the acropolis began in 550 and continued through to 810 when the site was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Kelly239"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.239.&lt;/ref&gt; The acropolis was a palace complex used primarily as an elite residence and for administrative purposes.&lt;ref name="Kelly241"/&gt; The acropolis complex includes structures 1B-1, 1B-2, 1B-3, 1B-4, 1B-5 and 1B-6. Excavations of the acropolis encountered the fallen remains of [[corbel arch]]es, but none are still standing.&lt;ref name="Kelly241"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.241.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1B-sub.1''' is also known as the K'inich Ahau Wall. It was a free-standing wall over {{convert|23|m|ft}} long and {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} thick, it stood on top of the western platform of the acropolis. The western side of the wall overlooked the river and bore five alternating [[mosaic]] masks representing [[Solar deity|solar deities]] and [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] with human arms. These masks were supported by a [[frieze]] consisting of two concentric ovals flanked by serpent heads. The wall was completed around 750, during the reign of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.&lt;ref name="Loop119"&gt;Looper 2003, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1B-sub.4''' Excavations at the acropolis discovered a completely buried [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] under the structures on the western side of the Acropolis Plaza,&lt;ref name="Sharer353"/&gt; a rare example of a ballcourt having been built over by subsequent construction, in this case by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough 1991, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first ballcourt at the site and dates to the middle of the 7th century. It was built with blocks of [[rhyolite]].&lt;ref name="Loop53"&gt;Looper 2003, p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; This ballcourt is a close copy of the ballcourts at Copán, being built in the same style, to the same dimensions, and with the same orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.53, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballcourt was buried when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat built the massive western platform to restrict access to the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Loop119"/&gt;

[[File:QuiriguaAcropolis.jpg|thumb|alt=A flat grassy area with low stepped structures at the far side, bordered by trees|View of the acropolis across the Ballcourt Plaza]]

*'''1B-1''' is a structure which forms the southern limit of the Acropolis Plaza, a broad stairway leads down to the plaza from the northern side of the building. The lower walls of the structure are still standing and it has three entrances, each of which opens onto a small chamber. Each of the three chambers has a hieroglyphic step on the back wall leading to another small chamber. Originally the building had an external band of hieroglyphs. Both the exterior and internal [[glyph]]s bear the last known date recorded at Quiriguá, falling in June 810. This building was built during the reign of "Jade Sky".&lt;ref name="MG224"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.240.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1B-2''' also lies south of the Acropolis Plaza, in the southwest corner. It is smaller than structure 1B-1, which it adjoins, and its lower walls also are still standing. It was a small residential building that was elaborately decorated with sculptured stonework. This structure was probably the residence of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.&lt;ref name="Sharer353"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly236-40"&gt;Kelly 1996, pp.236, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1B-3''' and '''1B-4''' are structures on the west side of the Acropolis Plaza, only the lower walls remain.&lt;ref name="Kelly239"/&gt; Between these two structures is an older free-standing wall. This wall has a westward facing mosaic frieze that bears damaged and now headless depictions of [[Kinich Ahau]], the sun god.&lt;ref name="Kelly239"/&gt;
*'''1B-5''' lies to the north of the Acropolis Plaza, at the south-eastern corner of the Ballcourt Plaza. This structure was accessed via a broad stairway from the Acropolis Plaza to the south, which rises to a single entrance opening onto seven interconnected chambers. This is the largest building at Quiriguá and its walls are still standing.&lt;ref name="Kelly236-41"&gt;Kelly 1996, pp.236, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built during the reign of "Jade&amp;nbsp;Sky".&lt;ref name="MG224"/&gt;
*'''1B-6''' lies to the east of the Acropolis Plaza and contained an [[Veneration of the dead|ancestral shrine]], reflecting a long established tradition first seen at Tikal.&lt;ref name="Sharer353"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.353.&lt;/ref&gt; Located under the building was a tomb lined with slabs of [[schist]], which contained an elite burial. The remains probably belonged to a male, the teeth were inlaid with jade, and a [[bead]] of the same material had been placed in the mouth. Associated ceramic offerings date this tomb to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="Loop36"&gt;Looper 2003, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1B-7''' is a ballcourt, built by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat to replace the ballcourt buried under his expansion of the acropolis. The ballcourt lies in the Ballcourt Plaza, to which it gives its name, to the northwest of the acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.20, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballcourt has an east–west orientation that is unusual in the Maya region, where ballcourts traditionally are aligned north–south.&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough 1991, p.138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stela E north.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Close up of upper portion of an intricately carved stela, showing the face of a king with elaborate headdress and jewellery|Detail of the north face of Stela&amp;nbsp;E, depicting K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat holding a [[God K]] sceptre&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.149–152.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

*'''3C-1''' is a broad earthen platform on the valley floor, it dates to the middle of the Classic Period and is one of the earlier constructions at the site, parts of it continuing in use after a catastrophic flood.&lt;ref name="MG216"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MG217"/&gt;
*'''3C-7''' is a group dating to the Early Classic. It is on the floodplain some distance to the north of the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Loop36"/&gt;
*'''3C-8''' is another Early Classic group located to the north of the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Loop36"/&gt;
*'''Locus 011''' and '''Locus 057''' may have been watchposts, they were situated at the points where the Quiriguá and the Jubuco rivers entered the Motagua Valley and may have been used to control passing traffic on these routes. Locus&amp;nbsp;057 was situated on one of the most probable routes to Copán and may have been a watchpost to look out for enemy warriors after the defeat of Copán by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.120.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Locus 122''' and '''Locus 123''' are groups located on the floodplain south of the river. Locus 122, although unexcavated, is a compound consisting of a pyramidal mound and a NE–SW oriented plaza, similar to some Preclassic complexes in the highlands, for which reason it is presumed to date from that period.&lt;ref name="Loop35"/&gt;

Groups A, B and C lie at a distance of one to three miles from the site core.&lt;ref name="Kelly241"/&gt;
*'''Group A''' is a hilltop complex roughly dating to the early [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]].&lt;ref name="MG216"/&gt; A stela found in this group dates to 493.&lt;ref name="Kelly241"/&gt;
*'''Group B''', also known as '''Group 7A-1''', is to the north of the site core.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.195.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the location of the badly eroded Stela S, which was moved here from the Great Plaza in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Kelly241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loop88"&gt;Looper 2003, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Group C''' has an unsculptured stela.&lt;ref name="Kelly241"/&gt;

===Monuments===
[[File:QuiriguáGlyphs1.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=The side of a stela, divided into square panels containing sculpted hieroglyphs|Elaborate full-figure hieroglyphs on the west side of Quiriguá Stela D&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The monuments at Quiriguá include unusually large [[Maya stelae|stelae]] elaborately carved from single blocks of red sandstone, brought from quarries {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} away.&lt;ref name="Drew241"/&gt; The characteristics of this hard rock allowed the local sculptors to produce low-[[relief]] sculptures enhanced by three-dimensional faces, in contrast with the contemporary two-dimensional sculpture of the [[Petén Basin|Petén]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp.132&amp;ndash;133.&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat and execution of the king of Copán in 738, the sculptural style of Quiriguá closely resembled that of its former overlord.&lt;ref name="Miller1345"/&gt;  The enormous stelae at Quirigá originally would have been visible from the Motagua River, which once flowed past the west side of the Great Plaza, announcing the new-found power of the city to passing traders.&lt;ref name="Sharer486"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.486.&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments include long panels of glyphic text that are considered among the most complex and beautiful of all Maya stone inscriptions. A characteristic of these texts is the use of full-figure glyphs in which the normal bar and dot number glyphs of [[Maya script]] are replaced with exquisitely carved representations of the deities.&lt;ref name="Drew242"&gt;Drew 1999, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the latter part of the 8th century Quiriguá had developed an original style with the production of boulders elaborately sculpted into the forms of composite [[Legendary creature|mythological animals]] bearing elements of [[toad]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[crocodile]]s, and [[birds of prey]]; these sculptures are referred to as ''zoomorphs'' and were completed by two later kings after the death of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 785.&lt;ref name="Miller1345"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew242"/&gt;

There also are various altars and sculptures used as decoration in the facades of buildings; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff compared to the naturalistic grace of the art of some other Maya sites. Traces of red [[pigment]] have been found on some of the monuments and most of the monuments were likely to have been painted red, the colour of birth, sacrifice, and renewal.&lt;ref name="Loop17"&gt;Looper 2003, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Stela A''' was erected in 775 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.&lt;ref name="Kelly235"/&gt; Stela A and Stela C form a pair and were both dedicated on 29 December 775.&lt;ref name="Loop164"&gt;Looper 2003, pp.158, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Zoomorph B''' was dedicated in 780 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, it is a multi-ton boulder sculptured into a half-crocodile half-mountain beast. The hieroglyphic text on this monument consists entirely of full-figure glyphs.&lt;ref name="MG222"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of red pigment have been found on this zoomorph, which is {{convert|4|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.17, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; A dedication cache was found buried in a pit under Zoomorph B, it included seven flint blades between {{convert|14|and|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.237, n.12.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stela C''' was erected in 775 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.&lt;ref name="Kelly235"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.235.&lt;/ref&gt; The hieroglyphic text contains references to 455 and Tutuum Yohl K'inich, an early king.&lt;ref name="Looper 2003, p.38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly235"/&gt; The stela also bears a reference to the date 13.0.0.0.0 4&amp;nbsp;Ahaw 8&amp;nbsp;Kumk'u (13&amp;nbsp;August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp.221&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt; This date is recorded throughout the entire Maya area as the beginning of the current creation, when the deities were placed in order.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart 2008, pp.212–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Stela&amp;nbsp;C forms a pair with Stela&amp;nbsp;A and was dedicated on the same date.&lt;ref name="Loop164"/&gt;
*'''Stela D''' dates to 766, during the reign of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.&lt;ref name="Kelly235"/&gt; It is distinguished by the relatively rare, extravagant, full-figure [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] versions of Maya hieroglyphics on the upper parts of its sides, which are particularly well preserved.&lt;ref name="Kelly235"/&gt; Stela&amp;nbsp;D is roughly {{convert|6|m|ft}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GT Quirigua StelaE.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, narrow monument covered by a thatched roof. Two further stelae are visible in the background, also covered by thatched roofs, against a backdrop of trees.|Stela E at Quiriguá, possibly the largest freestanding stone monument in the New World&lt;ref name="Coe121"/&gt;]]

*'''Stela E''' stands in the northern half of the Great Plaza.&lt;ref name="Loop20"&gt;Looper 2003, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; This stela was dedicated on 24&amp;nbsp;January 771 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Its total shaft measures {{convert|10.6|m|ft}} in height, including the buried portion holding it in place, which measures just under {{convert|3|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name="Loop147"&gt;Looper 2003, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; This enormous [[monolith]] is the largest stone ever quarried by the ancient Maya and weighs approximately 65&amp;nbsp;tons,&lt;ref name="Loop147"/&gt; it may even be the largest free-standing worked [[monolith]] in the [[New World]].&lt;ref name="Coe121"&gt;Coe 1999, p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 this stela, already tilting away from vertical, finally fell over completely after heavy rains, although it remained unbroken. In 1934 an attempt was made to raise the stela using a [[winch]] and steel cables, during which the cables snapped and the monolith fell and was broken into two pieces, which have since been joined back together using [[concrete]].&lt;ref name="Loop147"/&gt; This stela bears portraits of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its front and back.&lt;ref name="MG221"/&gt;
*'''Stela F''' is an enormous {{convert|7.3|m|ft|adj=on}} high monolith carved from sandstone. It bears representations of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its north and south sides and hieroglyphic inscriptions on its east and west sides. It dates to 761 and when it was raised it was the tallest monument ever erected by the Maya; it was only surpassed when Stela&amp;nbsp;E was erected 10&amp;nbsp;years later.&lt;ref name="Loop123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MG221"/&gt;
*'''Zoomorph G''' is the memorial monument to K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, dedicated during the reign of "Sky Xul". It shows the face of the dead king emerging from the maw of an enormous jaguar. The text of this monument describes the death and burial of Quiriguá's greatest king.&lt;ref name="MG222"/&gt;
*'''Stela H''' dates to 751, during the reign of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Its glyphs are arranged in a rare mat pattern, copied from Copán.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp.235&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt; The stela is executed in the wrap-around style.&lt;ref name="MG221"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.221.&lt;/ref&gt; A flint blade was found buried under the stela butt, buried as an offering when the stela was dedicated.&lt;ref name="Loop90"/&gt; The hieroglyphic inscriptions on Stela H are badly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stela J''' was erected by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 756 and is carved in the wrap-around style.&lt;ref name="MG221"/&gt; It stands {{convert|5|m|ft}} high and is located in the southern part of the Great Plaza. The dedicatory cache consisted of a house-shaped clay box with unknown contents.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.100&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Altar L''' is fairly crudely worked and dates to 653. The text bears the name of king K'awiil Yopaat and also mentions "[[Copán#Smoke Imix|Smoke Imix]]", the 12th&amp;nbsp;king of Copán. The altar is a [[rhyolite]] disk {{convert|1|m|in|0}} in diameter and {{convert|0.25|m|in|0}} thick. The sculptural style of this altar is unique, and shows affinities with the distant site of Caracol in Belize.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.50&amp;ndash;53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp.201, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Altar M''' this modest monument is the earliest known monument dedicated by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. The importance of this monument lies in its text, in which this preeminent king of Quiriguá claimed the title of ''k'uhul ajaw'', holy lord, and began his bid for independence from Copán.&lt;ref name="Sharer482"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.482.&lt;/ref&gt; This rhyolite sculpture was dedicated on 15&amp;nbsp;September 734 and has the form of a monstrous head, possibly that of a crocodilian.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Altar N''' is another small rhyolite sculpture stylistically similar to Altar M. This sculpture has the form of a [[turtle]] shell with a skeletal head with a [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirror]] on its forehead emerging sideways from one end and an elderly figure from the other. This is a representation of the [[bicephalic]] deity [[Pawatun]] (God&amp;nbsp;N), a prominent [[underworld]] deity.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.58, 61&amp;ndash;62.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Zoomorph O''' is a crocodile-mountain hybrid monster, dedicated in 790 by king "Sky Xul". It is accompanied by an altar depicting a lightning god. It is located in the Ballcourt Plaza, just south of the ballcourt itself.&lt;ref name="MG223"/&gt;
*'''Zoomorph P''' (which explorer Maudslay nicknamed ''The Great Turtle'') was dedicated in 795 by "Sky Xul" and is a masterpiece of Mesoamerican art. It weighs around 20&amp;nbsp;tons. On one side it depicts a larger-than-life portrait of "Sky&amp;nbsp;Xul" himself seated cross-legged in the open jaws of an enormous crocodile-mountain hybrid monster. The design of this zoomorph is incredibly intricate and the whole monument is covered with skilfully executed sculpture. It is located in the Ballcourt Plaza, just south of the ballcourt. Zoomorph&amp;nbsp;P is accompanied by an altar depicting an unidentified deity leaping from a split in the earth.&lt;ref name="MG223"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; A hieroglyphic text on the zoomorph describes the founding of Quiriguá under the supervision of the king of Copán.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.494.&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of red pigment have been found on this monument, suggesting that it was originally painted red.&lt;ref name="Loop17"/&gt;

[[File:Quiriguá zoomorph.jpg|thumb|alt=A carved boulder, showing a human face surrounded by elaborate sculpted decoration|Detail from Zoomorph B, dedicated in 780 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]]

*'''Altar Q''' and '''Altar R''' are two small rhyolite disks that probably served as ballcourt markers for the earliest ballcourt, the buried Structure 1B-sub.4. Together with a third stone they would have marked the central axis of the ballcourt. They both bear seated cross-legged figures carved in shallow relief.&lt;ref name="Loop53"/&gt;
*'''Stela S''' is the earliest surviving monument of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, it dates to 746.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp.220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally located in the northern half of the Great Plaza but was moved to an outlying group in ancient times. It is heavily eroded, some of the damage may have been inflicted by the process of moving it. It was fashioned from sandstone and bears the figure of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on the front, the other three sides being covered by hieroglyphic text. Unfortunately, due to the heavy erosion most of the text is illegible.&lt;ref name="Loop88"/&gt; Stela&amp;nbsp;S is {{convert|2.8|m|ft|0}} high (not including the part of the stela buried in the ground) and the dimensions of the base are {{convert|1.6|m|ft}} by {{convert|1.2|m|ft}}, making it the earliest of the huge stelae that were to characterise Quiriguá, although it is significantly smaller than those that were to follow.&lt;ref name="Loop90"&gt;Looper 2003, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stela T''' was dedicated in 692 by an unknown ruler. It is a badly eroded schist sculpture bearing mostly unreadable glyphs accompanying a poorly preserved figure. The stela is conservative in style, being similar to the much older Stela&amp;nbsp;U.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.55&amp;ndash;56, 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stela U''' comes from Group A and bears a heavily eroded portrait of a king in wrap-around style (extending over three sides of the stela). This style originated in Tikal and indicates contact with the central Petén region. This stela has an identifiable date, corresponding to 18&amp;nbsp;April 480, and a reference to a ritual taking place that was supervised by the king of Copán.&lt;ref name="MG217"/&gt; This stela is carved from [[schist]] and is broken in two pieces, being snapped off at the knees&amp;nbsp;– apparently deliberately during an attack by unknown enemies. It was originally {{convert|2.7|m|ft|0}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.39, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Monument 25''' is a plain round column carved from schist. It is about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|0}} long and {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0}} in diameter. It was found in Locus&amp;nbsp;011.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, p.233, n.5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Monument 26''' is a stela in wrap-around style found close to structure 3C-1. A date corresponding to 493 is contained in the hieroglyphic text on its back, this text mentions the third and fourth rulers of Quiriguá but their names are currently unreadable.&lt;ref name="MG217"/&gt; It is carved from schist and was originally {{convert|2|m|ft}} high but the stela was broken in ancient times, apparently deliberately. It was broken off at the knees and the left eye of the ruler's portrait was scratched away, damage characteristic of that inflicted by invading warriors. Only two pieces have been recovered, an upper section measuring {{convert|1|m|ft}} and a lower section measuring {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003, pp.40, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Monument 29''' and '''Monument 30''' are heavily eroded columnar sculptures fashioned from schist, each measuring a little over {{Nowrap|1 m}} in length. They were found together in a modern drainage ditch to the north and northwest of the ceremonial centre of Quiriguá. They apparently were sculptures of anthropomorphs or [[monkey]]s standing on [[pedestal]]s with their hands clasped on their chests. It is thought on stylistic grounds that these two monuments date to the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref name="Loop35"/&gt;

The '''Rastafari Movement in the United States''' is the [[Rastafari Movement]], founded in [[Jamaica]], manifestation in the [[United States]].
{{Rastafari}}

== Background ==
The name ''Rastafari'' is taken from ''Ras Tafari'', the title (Ras) and first name (Tafari Makonnen) of Haile Selassie I before his coronation. In Amharic, ''Ras'', literally "head", is an Ethiopian title equivalent to prince or chief, while the personal given name ''Täfäri'' (''teferi'') means one who is revered. The origin of Rastafari came from Jamaica and Ethiopia.  Jah is a Biblical name of God, from a shortened form of Jahweh or ''Jehovah'' found in Psalms 68:4 in the King James Version of the Bible. Most adherents see Haile Selassie I as ''Jah'' or ''Jah Rastafari'', an incarnation ofGod the Father, the Second Advent of Christ "the Anointed One", i.e. the Second Coming of Jesus Christ the King to Earth.The Rastafari way of life encompasses the spiritual use of cannabis and the rejection of the degenerate society of materialism, oppression, and sensual pleasures, called Babylon. Rastas assert that Zion (i.e., Ethiopia) is a land that Jah promised to them. To achieve this, they reject modern western society, calling it "Babylon", which they see as entirely corrupt due to materialism and greed. "Babylon" is considered to have been in rebellion against "Earth's Rightful Ruler" (Jah) ever since the days of the Biblical king Nimrod.

The lion is a symbol for Rastafari because it appears on the Imperial Ethiopian flag, used in Haile Selassie I's Ethiopia.

== Marcus Garvey ==
[[Marcus Garvey]], a [[Jamaican people|native Jamaican]], speaking on the topic of the creation of an [[Africa]]n state for displaced [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]], told his followers to “look to the [[East Africa]], for the crowning of the Black King." This was also to influence the minds of the masses of black people from continuing to worship [[George V|King George of England]].  Marcus Mosiah Garvey was referring to [[Haile Selassie I]] of [[Ethiopia]], the only remaining African Monarch of Biblical ancestry. However, some found a more literal interpretation. Among some of these were working class Jamaicans, who saw Garvey as a prophet, and more specifically the reincarnation of [[John the Baptist]]. Consequentially, when Ras Tafari of [[Ethiopia]] was crowned Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] in 1930, many saw the prophecy fulfilled, and proclaimed King Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia Jah, or God.

The movement has had strong cultural, social, and political effects on both Ethiopia and Jamaica, but to date, little scholarly research has been done on the effects of the movement on the [[United States of America]]. But this is not to say that such influences and affections do not exist in America, which many Rastafari see as the epitome of [[Babylon]], and the hearth of all evil in the world. This does not stop Rastafari from immigrating to America, as a considerable influx of Jamaican Rastafari made the United States their new home during the 1960s and 1970s. The [[Rastafari movement]] played a vital role in the shaping of local United States society and culture, as was seen in the socio-cultural accomplishments of Marcus Garvey, the effects of localized Rastafari community building on the greater metropolitan area, and through the medium of Rastafari riddims, or [[reggae]] music. Adding to the idea that the United States is "Babylon" some American Rastas don't believe that the United States is Babylon due to the Revolutionary War against Britain.

[[Marcus Garvey]] was one of the most influential elements of the Rastafari Movement on the United States. Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. was born into working class Jamaica on 17 August 1887. At the age of 13, Garvey was already learning to influence the masses through an internship at his grandfather’s newspaper printing business in Jamaica. It was not long before Garvey began preaching his ideals of Black Nationalism, as well as political and economic independence. In 1910, the young prophet began to spread his messages to countries of [[Latin America]], such as [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]]. In 1914, Garvey would find his way to the United States. These ideals would greatly influence American society for generations to come, and were seen as a prelude to the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

== The Universal Negro Improvement Association ==
Foremost, Marcus Garvey sought to organize blacks worldwide to give them an influential voice in society through overwhelming numbers. To do so, Garvey established the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA), which appealed to Negroes everywhere, calling for them to “reorganize, link up (their) strength, morally, financially, educationally, and physically”. After failed attempts to create a following in Jamaica, Garvey relocated the UNIA to [[Harlem]], in [[New York City]], where membership grew rapidly and enthusiastically. By 1920, Garvey had over 2,000,000 members in over 1,000 local chapters of the UNIA.

The UNIA had two principal goals: to establish black independence politically, and economically. Initially, Garvey came to America to preach his prophecy of [[Black Nationalism]] through Back to Africa movement. Under this action, displaced Africans would return to the land of their ancestors where they would create a prosperous African state, and lead Africa to become an influential world power. In 1924, with the financial assistance of the more than 2,000,000 members of the UNIA, Garvey sought to purchase 1 million acres (4000&amp;nbsp;km²) of land from the African country of [[Liberia]]. This land would serve as the place of repatriation Garvey had spoken of for nearly two decades. However, only 11 days after Garvey agreed to purchase the land, [[Firestone Tires]], with the aide of the US government, stole the land from under Garvey’s nose. Firestone paid an unprecedented price to purchase what Garvey saw as his land. This was, effectively, the end of the [[back to Africa movement]]. Although the movement was essentially a failure, it deeply affected America by showing the power of the black community, effectively giving them an influential voice within society. It showed that blacks would not stand for white oppression, and had the ability to organize and fight back against corruption. Overall, the back to Africa movement showed that blacks had the power to pool together and play an active role in political affairs.

== The Negro Factories Corporation ==
Instituted on January 20, 1920, the [[Negro Factories Corporation]] sought to create corporations which would employ only blacks, as well as produce commodities only sold to black consumers. As Marcus Garvey proclaimed himself: “Negro producers! Negro distributors! Negro Consumers!”  Garvey’s ideal of an all black [[economy]] that could eventually supply black consumers across the globe was not only ambitious, but to an extent also successful. Under Garvey’s guidance, independent black grocery stores, restaurants, Laundromats, tailor shops, millinery stores, and publishing houses were created. The Negro Factories Corporation had vital impacts on the United States. It proved to society that blacks were economically able, and could operate successfully and independently as business men and entrepreneurs. More importantly, it gave blacks across the country initiative and hope, as well as the secular identity required to prosper in American society.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

== The Black Star Line ==
Marcus Garvey’s most famous initiative of black societal reform came from the institution of the [[Black Star Line]]. Created as an offshoot of the Negro Factories Corporation, and designed to correlate with the Back to Africa movement, the Black Star Line was announced on June 23, of 1919. The Black Star Line was created as a shipping company that would link black communities in [[United States|America]], Jamaica, Canada, [[Central America]], and Africa. Ideally, the Black Star Line would transport black labored goods, including raw materials and manufactured items, to black consumers across the globe.

To purchase the company’s first ship, as well as to get the shipping line to sea, Garvey had to raise $500,000, which he did though the sale of stocks to only blacks. This economic enterprise was so important to the black community, that over 15,000 spectators came to see the [[S.S. Fredrick Douglass]] take sail for its first trip to Jamaica. However, the company eventually folded in 1922, with net losses estimated to be over $1,000,000. But the Black Star Line still had profound effects on America, giving blacks the opportunity to invest in stock was new to the country, and thus gave them a modernized way of investing their money. Again, it proved that blacks could act as successful business men and contribute economically to America. The fact that the Black Star Line was an independent black movement showed that blacks were capable of organizing international businesses.

The social and cultural results of the Black Star Line were unheard of in the 1920s, and consequently presented blacks with more economic and social opportunities than ever before.

== Rastafari community building ==
With Rastafari unable to bring themselves to [[Zion]] until the day of repatriation, they decided to bring Zion to their home, which for more and more Rastafari was Babylon (the United States). As Jamaican Rastafari began to immigrate to the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, small, localized, and homogeneous Rastafari communities began to spring up across the country. Such communities appeared in [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Hartford]], [[Miami]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], and most notably [[New York City]]. Specifically in New York City, six different Rastafari communities exist in five different boroughs. Most influential of these communities are [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] and [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in [[Brooklyn]].

Generally, the building of localized Rastafari communities occurs through the establishment of Rastafari Community centers, schools, tabernacles, as well as Rasta Culture Stores.

=== The process ===
All Rastafari communities must undergo the community building process, which begins small, and then grows larger. The initial part of the community consists of extremely small Rastafari centers, where Rastas go out of convenience, but not necessarily to congregate with other Rastafari. The goal of these centers is to bring Zion-like elements to their respective [[The Exodus|Exodus]] communities. Examples of such centers are [[smoking yards]] or [[weed gates]], where Rastafari go to smoke ganja, or [[marijuana]], which they believe purifies the soul and brings one closer to the Almighty [[Jah]]. Another example of such centers are Rastafari stores, such as supermarkets where Rastafari goods may be purchased. These stores range from [[ital]] foods stores, to reggae record stores, to specialized medical stores.

The second level of community building occurs with the greater organization of Rastafari truly into a community. This often coincides with the creation of large [[church (building)|churches]], which provides the Rastafari with an organized and active community in which to carry out further Rasta [[evangelicalism]]. In Jamaican Rastafari practices, organized congregations are frowned upon, and finding [[Jah]] is seen as a personal passageway, but churches are essential for Rasta worship in America. These churches offer an array of opportunities, including [[Sunday schools]] for the youth, “rastalogical” counseling, [[Ital]] cooking classes, sewing and knitting, craft building and language instruction courses. Additionally, churches provide public recognition of individual Rastafari, as well as the movement overall. All for one and one for all.

Localized community building influenced America in the sense that they introduced the greater metropolitan area to the Rastafari community. American non-Rastas were welcome at Rastafari hang outs, such as [[dance hall]]s or reggae record stores. By building a community, the individual Rastafari attained a sense of belonging and fellowship. These small pocket societies contributed to the growing diversity of American society, and thus helped to further establish America for what it was known: a cultural melting pot.

== Reggae ==
Reggae was known in Jamaica as a popular dance move until 1968, when the [[Toots &amp; the Maytals]] released their single “[[Do the Reggay]]”. From this point on, Reggae referred to a genre of music centered on a steady and regular beat played on a [[rhythm guitar]], called the “bang”, and biblical lyrics pertaining to Rastafari ideology. In Jamaica and around the world, reggae, and especially the music of [[Bob Marley]], was used as a medium to bring about social and political change.

This was seen in [[Zimbabwe]]’s independence movement in the 1980s, as Bob Marley’s hit song Zimbabwe is today seen as a second national anthem. But what is unique about reggae is that it rarely strays from its Rastafari roots—reggae lyrics have a universal Rastafari theme. Despite the fact that reggae has not always been as popular in America as in Jamaica, reggae music has deeply affected American culture, not only through the radio waves, but also through the ways of the Rasta man.

=== Bob Marley ===
Bob Marley was and is reggae music's most transcendent figure. He lived in Delaware briefly before returning to Jamaica to pursue his musical career, which was discernibly influenced by musical genres then popular in the US. Along with his band the Wailers, Marley was able to become the first international music star to rise to prominence from the 'Third World'. Although Marley was initially very popular in Jamaica for the better part of a decade with the Wailers being Jamaica's biggest stars for a much of that time, it was a slower climb to international fame for both Marley and Reggae music.  The first two 'official' Wailers albums, 'Catch a Fire' and 'Burnin' received great critical acclaim, but sales were less than impressive. However, after the split of the original Wailers and the release of 'Natty Dread' in 1974 as well as the 1975 'Live" album, Marley's music and message began to take hold specifically in England (UK), where Bob Marley and The Wailers' two performances at the Lyceum Ballroom are regarded as two of the most influential concerts ever to take place in that country. In 1976, Bob Marley and The Wailers "Rastaman Vibration" LP cracked the American charts peaking at #8, as well as producing Marley's only Hot 100 single 'Roots Rock Reggae'. All of Marley's follow- up LPs with the exception of "Babylon by Bus" placed in the US Billboard Top 100, and his message only continued to grow, having a profound effect on a large element of American society, very specifically on white American society. Marley's 'Exodus' released in 1977 is considered his crossover LP placing at #15 and #20 on the Black Albums Chart and Billboard Chart respectively. Towards the later half of Bob Marley's career, his message began to pick up steam in America's black community, a segment of US society that had long remained impervious to the impact of Bob Marley and Reggae music{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. However, a series of legendary shows at Harlem's Apollo Theatre in 1979 coupled with the release of the militant Pan-African oriented 'Survival', as well as an appearance at the Amandla Festival in the same year, began to elevate Marley's reputation in the eyes of black America{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. By the time of Marley's passing in 1981, the Rastafari faith had developed progressively, e.g. in the creation of the 'Twelve Tribes' sect which Marley himself was a member of. In the US (as in other parts of the world) the music press played a crucial role for Rastafari to be heard, felt and seen. Even though it wasn't fully understood, and occasionally mocked or ridiculed, the Rastafari lifestyle was essentially (as far as the western press was concerned) indistinguishable from reggae music.

The Rastafari faith or way of life remains largely misunderstood. However, as a result of Bob Marley's international reputation in life as well as his enormous posthumous success which only continues to grow, the Rastafari movement in the United States has multiplied considerably since Marley died in 1981. The influence of reggae music and its association with Rastafari reached a peak with the success of Rasta artists such as Marley, his wife [[Rita Marley]], Peter Tosh, Dennis Brown, and many others. The reputation of reggae music in general and Bob Marley in particular only continues to gain new respect among younger generations of appreciative fans and the Rastafari message has, along with this popularity, found its place alongside some of the world's great philosophies and ideologies. Even if Rastafari is not universally embraced, concepts of it are widely accepted and appreciated, due largely to the popularity of Bob Marley and reggae music. Marley is considered in many Rasta circles to be a prophet, and holds a similar standing with many people throughout the world who do not identify themselves as Rastafari.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2161">[[File:Book from the Ryukyu Kingdom (ca. 1600).jpg|thumb|Rekidai Hōan]]

The '''Rekidai Hōan''' (歴代宝案), '''Precious Documents of Successive Generations''', is an official compilation of [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] documents of the royal government of the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]]. Covering the period from 1424 to 1867, it contains records, written entirely in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], of communications between Ryukyu and ten different trading partners in this period, detailing as well the gifts given in [[tribute]]. The ten countries or trading ports are [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Siam]], [[Malacca]], [[Palembang]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Pattani Province|Pattani]], and Sunda Kelapa ([[Jakarta]]). There are 242 volumes in total, including four lists, and an extra four sections.

It is believed that the documents were first formally compiled in 1697 from documents kept at the [[Naha]] [[Tempi Palace]]. Some documents were already lost at this time, and copies contained errors. It is not known whether the documents had been kept separately or bound prior to this.

The compilation first became known to the public, and put on display, in 1932, when it was moved from the [[Tenson Shrine (Okinawa)|Tenson Shrine]] in Naha to the [[Okinawa Prefectural Library]]. This "First Series" compiled in 1697 contained 49 volumes, but by 1932 a number were missing or severely damaged. All were destroyed in the 1945 [[battle of Okinawa]]. 

Copies in [[Taiwan University]] and [[Tokyo University]] survived, and form the basis for scholarship of these documents; unfortunately, further copying errors were introduced in the 1930s-1940s when these versions were created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4497">In [[linguistics]], a '''segment''' is "any discrete unit that can be identified, either physically or auditorily, in the stream of speech".{{Sfn | Crystal | 2003 | pp = 408–9}} The term is most used in [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] to refer to the smallest  elements in a language, and this usage can be synonymous with the term [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]].  

In spoken languages, segments will typically be grouped into [[Consonant|consonants]] and [[Vowel|vowels]], but the term can be applied to any minimal unit of a linear sequence meaningful to the given field of analysis, such as a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] or a [[syllable]] in [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic phonology]], a [[morpheme]] in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], or a [[chereme]] in [[sign language]] analysis.{{sfn|Bussmann|2006|page=1038}}

Segments are called "discrete" because they are, at least at some analytical level, separate and individual, and temporally ordered.  Segments are generally not completely discrete in speech production or perception, however.  The articulatory, visual and acoustic cues that encode them often overlap. Examples of overlap for spoken languages can be found in discussions of [[Assimilation (phonology)|phonological assimilation]], [[coarticulation]], and other areas in the study of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]], especially [[autosegmental phonology]]. 

Other articulatory, visual or acoustic cues, such as [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] ([[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]), and [[secondary articulation]]s such as [[nasalization]], may overlap multiple segments and cannot be discretely ordered with them. These elements are termed ''[[Suprasegmentals|suprasegmental]].''  

== Kinds of segments ==
In [[phonetics]], the smallest perceptible segment is a [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]]. In [[phonology]], there is a subfield of segmental phonology that deals with the analysis of speech into [[phoneme]]s (or ''segmental phonemes''), which correspond fairly well to phonetic segments of the analysed speech.

The segmental phonemes of [[sign language]] (formally called "[[chereme]]s") are visual movements of hands, face, and body.  They occur in a distinct spatial and temporal order.  The [[SignWriting]] script represents the spatial order of the segments with a spatial cluster of [[grapheme]]s.  Other notations for sign language use a temporal order that implies a spatial order.

== Marginal segments ==
When analyzing the inventory of segmental units in any given [[language]], some segments will be found to be ''marginal,'' in the sense that they are only found in [[onomatopoeic]] words, [[interjection]]s, [[loan word]]s, or a very limited number of ordinary words, but not throughout the language. Marginal segments, especially in loan words, are often the source of new segments in the general inventory of a language.{{Example needed|date=September 2017}}

== Suprasegmentals ==
{{main|Suprasegmentals}}

Some contrastive elements of speech cannot be easily analyzed as distinct segments but rather belong to a syllable or word. These elements are called suprasegmental, and include [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. In some languages [[nasal vowel|nasality]] and [[vowel harmony]] are considered suprasegmental or [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] by some phonologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=F.R.|title=Prosodic Analysis|date=1970|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Firth|first1=J.R.|title=Sounds and Prosodies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|date=1948|pages=127–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''teleological''' or '''physico-theological argument''', also known as the '''argument from design''', or '''intelligent design argument''' is an argument for the [[existence of God]] or, more generally, for an intelligent creator based on perceived evidence of [[intelligent design|deliberate design]] in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=teleological argument |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/teleological_argument}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala]] (2006), Review article of "The Blasphemy of Intelligent Design: Creationism's Trojan Horse. The Wedge of Intelligent Design" by Barbara Forrest; Paul R. Gross ''History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences'', Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 409–421, {{JSTOR|23334140}}.: "The argument from design to demonstrate God's existence, now called the 'Intelligent Design' argument (ID) is a two-tined argument. The first prong asserts that the universe, humans, as well as all sorts of organisms, in their wholes, in their parts, and in their relations to one another and to their environment, appear to have been designed for serving certain functions and for certain ways of life. The second prong of the argument is that only an omnipotent Creator could account for the perfection and purposeful design of the universe and everything in it."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/design.html |title=The Argument from Design |publisher= [[Princeton University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest recorded versions of this argument are associated with [[Socrates]] in [[ancient Greece]], although it has been argued that he was taking up an older argument.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;Ahbel-Rappe, S. and Kamtekar, R., ''A Companion to Socrates'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, p. 45. "Xenophon attributes to Socrates what is probably the earliest known natural theology, an argument for the existence of the gods from observations of design in the physical world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007) agrees (p.&amp;nbsp;86), and cites other recent commentators who agree, and argues in detail that the argument reported by Xenophon and Plato is "at any rate the antecedent" of the argument from design (p.&amp;nbsp;213). He shows that the Stoics frequently paraphrased the account given by Xenophon.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], his student, and [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, developed complex approaches to the proposal that the cosmos has an intelligent cause, but it was the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] who, under their influence, "developed the battery of creationist arguments broadly known under the label 'The Argument from Design{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Sedley 2007, page xvii"&gt;Sedley 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abrahamic religion]]s have used the teleological argument in many ways, and has a long association with them. In the [[Middle Ages]], Islamic theologians such as [[Al-Ghazali]] used the argument, although it was rejected as unnecessary by [[Quran]]ic literalists, and as unconvincing by many [[Islamic philosophers]]. Later, the teleological argument was accepted by [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] and included as the fifth of his "[[Quinque viae|Five Ways]]" of proving the existence of God. In early modern England clergymen such as [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]] and [[John Ray]] were well-known proponents. In the early 18th century, [[William Derham]] published his ''Physico-Theology'', which gave his "demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation".&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Paley]], in his 1802 ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' published a prominent presentation of the design argument with his version of the [[watchmaker analogy]] and the first use of the phrase "argument from design".&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' under "Design", substantive number 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its beginning, there have been numerous criticisms of the different versions of the teleological argument, and responses to its challenge to the claims against non-teleological natural science. Especially important were the general logical arguments made by [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'', published 1779, and the explanation of biological complexity given in [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'', published in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=Zp5pAgAAQBAJ The Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology], p.&amp;nbsp;3, for example: "Between them, so the story goes, Hume, Darwin and Barth pulled the rug out from underneath the pretensions of natural theology to any philosophical, scientific, or theological legitimacy".&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, Paley's arguments, including the words "[[intelligent design]]", have been influential in the development of a [[creation science]] movement, especially the form known as the [[intelligent design movement]], which not only uses the teleological argument to argue against the modern scientific understanding of [[evolution]], but also makes the claim that supposed flaws in evolutionary science justify removing it from the educational curriculum.&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;

Also starting already in classical Greece, two approaches to the teleological argument developed, distinguished by their understanding of whether the natural order was literally created or not. The non-creationist approach starts most clearly with Aristotle, although many thinkers, such as the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], believed it was already intended by Plato. This approach is not creationist in a simple sense, because while it agrees that a cosmic intelligence is responsible for the natural order, it rejects the proposal that this requires a "creator" to physically make and maintain this order. The Neoplatonists did not find the teleological argument convincing, and in this they were followed by medieval philosophers such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]. Later, [[Averroes]] and Thomas Aquinas considered the argument acceptable, but not necessarily the best argument.

Contemporary defenders of the teleological argument are [[Antony Flew]], [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[John Lennox]].

== History ==

While the concept of an intelligence behind the natural order is ancient, a rational argument that concludes that we can know that the natural world has a designer, or a creating intelligence which has human-like purposes, appears to have begun with [[classical philosophy]].&lt;ref name=comp /&gt; Religious thinkers in [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] also developed versions of the teleological argument. Later, variants on the argument from design were produced in [[Western philosophy]] and by [[Christian fundamentalism]].

=== Classical philosophy ===

====Socrates and the pre-Socratics====
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato and [[Aristotle]], depicted here in ''[[The School of Athens]]'', both developed philosophical arguments addressing the universe's apparent order (''[[logos]]'')]]

The argument from intelligent design appears to have begun with [[Socrates]], although the concept of a cosmic intelligence is older and [[David Sedley]] has argued that Socrates was developing an older idea, citing [[Anaxagoras of Clazomenae]], born about 500 BC, as a possible earlier proponent.&lt;ref name=mcpherr/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahbel/&gt;&lt;ref name=sed/&gt; The proposal that the order of nature showed evidence of having its own human-like "intelligence" goes back to the origins of Greek natural philosophy and science, and its attention to the orderliness of nature, often with special reference to the revolving of the heavens. Anaxagoras is the first person who is definitely known to have explained such a concept using the word "''[[nous]]''" (which is the original Greek term that leads to modern English "intelligence" via its Latin and French translations). Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher from [[Clazomenae]] named [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]] who had taken a similar position.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.4.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+1.984b 984b].&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst [[Pre-Socratic philosophers]] before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar intelligent ordering principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example [[Empedocles]], like [[Hesiod]] much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of [[love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter X.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pythagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]] attributed the cosmos with "[[reason]]" (''[[logos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pages 204 and 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28c [[Plato]] has Socrates speak of this as a tradition, saying that "all philosophers agree—whereby they really exalt themselves—that mind (''nous'') is king of heaven and earth. Perhaps they are right." and later states that the ensuing discussion "confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind (''nous'') always rules the universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D28 28c] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D30 30d]. Translation by Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon's report in his ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' might be the earliest clear account of an argument that there is evidence in nature of intelligent design.&lt;ref name=ahbel&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKewlVwJ9rgC&amp;pg=PA27|page=27|title=Socrates: A Guide for the Perplexed| first=Sara |last=Ahbel-Rappe|isbn=9780826433251|date=2009-08-30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word traditionally translated and discussed as "design" is ''[[wikt:γνώμη|gnōmē]]'' and Socrates is reported by Xenophon to have pressed doubting young men to look at things in the market, and consider whether they could tell which things showed evidence of ''gnōmē'', and which seemed more to be by blind chance, and then to compare this to nature and consider whether it could be by blind chance.&lt;ref name=mcpherr&gt;{{citation|title=The Religion of Socrates| first=Mark |last= McPherran|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nWfQx1CjZl0C&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=socrates+religion+%22intelligent+design%22#v=onepage&amp;q=socrates%20religion%20%22intelligent%20design%22&amp;f=false|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press| isbn=978-0271040325 }}, pp. 273–275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sed&gt;{{citation|title=Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity|first=David|last=Sedley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgRuJEfzUG8C|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520934368}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'', Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras' concept of a cosmic ''nous'' as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras' [[materialism|materialist]] understanding of [[Causality|causation]]. Socrates complained that Anaxagoras restricted the work of the cosmic ''nous'' to the beginning, as if it were uninterested and all events since then just happened because of causes like air and water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D97 97]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D98 98]. Also see Ahbel Rappe.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates, on the other hand, apparently insisted that the demiurge must be "loving", particularly concerning humanity. (In this desire to go beyond Anaxagoras and make the cosmic ''nous'' a more active manager, Socrates was apparently preceded by [[Diogenes of Apollonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ahbel-Rappe|2009}}, {{harvcoltxt|McPherran|1996|p=290}} and {{harvcoltxt|Kirk|Raven| Schofield|1983}}, chapter XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;)

====Plato and Aristotle====
Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' is presented as a description of someone who is explaining a "likely story" in the form of a myth, and so throughout history commentators have disagreed about which elements of the myth can be seen as the position of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;132.&lt;/ref&gt; Sedley nevertheless calls it "the creationist manifesto" and points out that although some of Plato's followers denied that he intended it, in classical times writers such as Aristotle, Epicurus, the Stoics and Galen all understood Plato as proposing the world originated in an "intelligent creative act".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato has a character explain the concept of a "[[demiurge]]" with supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work .

Plato's teleological perspective is also built upon the analysis of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' order and structure in the world that he had already presented in ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]''. The story does not propose creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''; rather, the demiurge made order from the chaos of the cosmos, imitating the eternal Forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plato/ | title=Plato | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=April 21, 2005 | accessdate=November 12, 2011 | last1=Brickhouse | first1=Thomas | last2=Smith | first2=Nicholas D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine Artisan, contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic [[Weltanschauungen]], of which [[atomism]] was, by the 4th century at least, the most prominent...

Hankinson|Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought}}

Plato's student and friend Aristotle (c. 384 – 322 BC), continued the Socratic tradition of criticising natural scientists such as [[Democritus]] who sought (as in modern science) to explain everything in terms of matter and chance motion. He was very influential in the future development of classical creationism, but was not a straightforward "creationist" because he required no creation interventions in nature, meaning he "insulated god from any requirement to intervene in nature, either as creator or as administrator".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of direct intervention by a creator it is "scarcely an exaggeration to say that for Aristotle the entire functioning of the natural world, as also the heavens, is ultimately to be understood as a shared striving towards godlike [[actuality]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt; And whereas the myth in the ''Timaeus'' suggests that all living things are based on one single paradigm, not one for each species, and even tells a story of "devolution" whereby other living things devolved from humans, it was Aristotle who presented the influential idea that each type of normal living thing must be based on a fixed paradigm or form for that species.&lt;ref name=sed/&gt;

Aristotle felt that biology was a particularly important example of a field where materialist natural science ignored information which was needed in order to understand living things well. For example birds use wings for the purpose of flight.&lt;ref name="HistAnimI2"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.1.i.html#223 |title=History of Animals |author=Aristotle |at=I 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the most complete explanation in regard to the natural, as well as the artificial, is for the most part teleological.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.C. |last=Nussbaum |year=1985 |title=Aristotle's de Motu Animalium |series=Princeton paperbacks |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-02035-8 |lccn=77072132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISD05P7TcOAC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60 |page=60,66,69–70,73–81,94–98,101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, proposals that species had changed by chance survival of the fittest, similar to what is now called "[[natural selection]]", were already known to Aristotle, and he rejected these with the same logic.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysI2"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.1.i.html#130 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=I 2 (¶15)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PartsAnimI1"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/parts_animals.1.i.html#100 |title=Parts of Animals |author=Aristotle |at=I 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=D. |last=Ross |first2=J.L. |last2=Ackrill |year=2004 |title=Aristotle |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-32857-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Bg2-8xsEC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;pg=PA80 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HullRuse2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.L. |last=Hull |first2=M. |last2=Ruse |year=2007 |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |series=Cambridge Companions to Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-61671-3 |lccn=2006025898 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOgg-x4UyIC&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;pg=PA174 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conceded that monstrosities (new forms of life) could come about by chance,&lt;ref name="PhysII8a"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#530 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysII8b"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#585 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he disagreed with those who ascribed all nature purely to chance&lt;ref name="PhysII8c"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#604 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶8)}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he believed science can only provide a general account of that which is normal, "always, or for the most part".&lt;ref name="PhysII8"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#522 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between what is normal, or by nature, and what is "accidental", or not by nature, is important in Aristotle's understanding of nature. As pointed out by Sedley, "Aristotle is happy to say (''Physics'' II 8, 199a33-b4) without the slightest fear of blasphemy, crafts make occasional mistakes; therefore, by analogy, so can nature".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;186.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle the changes which happen by nature are caused by their "[[formal cause]]s", and for example in the case of a bird's wings there is also a [[final cause]] which is the purpose of flying. He explicitly compared this to human technology:
{{quotation|If then what comes from art is for the sake of something, it is clear that what come from nature is too [...] This is clear most of all in the other animals, which do nothing by art, inquiry, or deliberation; for which reason some people are completely at a loss whether it is by intelligence or in some other way that spiders, ants, and such things work. [...] It is absurd to think that a thing does not happen for the sake of something if we do not see what sets it in motion deliberating. [...] This is most clear when someone practices medicine himself on himself; for nature is like that.|Aristotle, Physics, II 8.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs translation (1998), ''Aristotle's physics; a guided study'', 2nd ed., pages 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question of how to understand Aristotle's conception of nature having a purpose and direction something like human activity is controversial in the details. [[Martha Nussbaum]] for example has argued that in his biology this approach was practical and meant to show nature only being analogous to human art, explanations of an organ being greatly informed by knowledge of its essential function.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"/&gt; Nevertheless, Nussbaum's position is not universally accepted. In any case, Aristotle was not understood this way by his followers in the Middle Ages, who saw him as consistent with monotheistic religion and a teleological understanding of all nature. Consistent with the medieval interpretation, in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and other works Aristotle clearly argued a case for their being one highest god or "[[prime mover theory|prime mover]]" which was the ultimate cause, though specifically not the material cause, of the eternal forms or natures which cause the natural order, including all living things. And he clearly refers to this entity having an [[active intellect|intellect]] that humans somehow share in, which helps humans see the true natures or forms of things without relying purely on sense perception of physical things, including living species. This understanding of nature, and Aristotle's arguments against materialist understandings of nature, were very influential in the Middle Ages in Europe. The idea of fixed species remained dominant in biology until Darwin, and a focus upon biology is still common today in teleological criticisms of modern science.

====Roman era====
It was the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] who "developed the battery of creationist arguments broadly known under the label 'The Argument from Design{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Sedley 2007, page xvii"/&gt; Cicero (c. 106 – c. 43 BC) reported the teleological argument of the Stoics in ''De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)'' Book II, which includes an early version of the watchmaker analogy, which was later developed by William Paley. He has one of the characters in the dialogue say:
{{Quotation|When you see a sundial or a water-clock, you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers?|Cicero|''De Natura Deorum''|II.34}}

Another very important classical supporter of the teleological argument was [[Galen]], whose compendious works were one of the major sources of medical knowledge until modern times, both in Europe and the medieval Islamic world. He was not a Stoic, but like them he looked back to the Socratics and was constantly engaged in arguing against atomists such as the Epicureans. Unlike Aristotle (who was however a major influence upon him), and unlike the Neoplatonists, he believed there was really evidence for something literally like the "demiurge" found in Plato's ''Timaeus'', which worked physical upon nature. In works such as his ''On the Usefulness of Parts'' he explained evidence for it in the complexity of animal construction. His work shows "early signs of contact and contrast between the pagan and the Judaeo-Christian tradition of creation", criticizing the account found in the Bible. "Moses, he suggests, would have contented himself with saying that God ordered the eyelashes not to grow and that they obeyed. In contrast to this, the Platonic tradition's Demiurge is above all else a technician." Surprisingly, neither Aristotle nor Plato, but Xenophon are considered by Galen, as the best writer on this subject. Galen shared with Xenophon a scepticism of the value of books about most speculative philosophy, except for inquiries such as whether there is "something in the world superior in power and wisdom to man". This he saw as having an everyday importance, a usefulness for living well. He also asserted that Xenophon was the author who reported the real position of Socrates, including his aloofness from many types of speculative science and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007) ''Epilogue''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galen's connection of the teleological argument to discussions about the complexity of living things, and his insistence that this is possible for a practical scientist, foreshadows some aspects of modern uses of the teleological argument.

===Medieval philosophy and theology===

====Late classical Christian writers====
As an appeal to [[general revelation]], [[Paul the Apostle]] (AD 5–67), argues in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:18–20{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:18–20}}, that because it has been made plain to all from what has been created in the world, it is obvious that there is a God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Christian philosophy as natural theology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67536/Christian-philosophy-as-natural-theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Minucius Felix]] (c. late 2nd to 3rd century), an Early Christian writer, argued for the existence of God based on the analogy of an ordered house in his ''The Orders of Minucius Felix'': "Supposing you went into a house and found everything neat, orderly and well-kept, surely you would assume it had a master, and one
much better than the good things, his belongings ; so in this house of the universe, when throughout
heaven and earth you see the marks of foresight, order and law, may you not assume that the lord and
author of the universe is fairer than the stars themselves or than any portions of the entire world ?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Octavius of Minucius Felix | publisher=OrthodoxEbook | author=Marcus Minucius Felix | year=2010 | pages=359–361 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OZqxbh23sQC&amp;lpg=PA360&amp;dq=Marcus%20Minucius%20Felix%20ordered%20house&amp;pg=PA359#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (AD 354–430) in [[The City of God]] mentioned the idea that the world's "well-ordered changes and movements", and "the fair appearance of all visible things" was evidence for the world being created, and "that it could not have been created save by God".&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book XI, Chapter 4. "the world itself, by its well-ordered changes and movements, and by the fair appearance of all visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has been created, and also that it could not have
been created save by God, whose greatness and beauty are unutterable and invisible."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islamic philosophy ====
Early Islamic philosophy played an important role in developing the philosophical understandings of God among Jewish and Christian thinkers in the Middle Ages, but concerning the teleological argument one of the lasting effects of this tradition came from its discussions of the difficulties which this type of proof has. Various forms of the argument from design have been used by Islamic theologians and philosophers from the time of the early [[Mutakallimun]] theologians in the 9th century, although it is rejected by fundamentalist or literalist schools, for whom the mention of God in the Qu'ran should be sufficient evidence. The argument from design was also seen as an unconvincing sophism by the early Islamic philosopher [[Al-Farabi]], who instead took the "emanationist" approach of the Neoplatonists such as Plotinus, whereby nature is rationally ordered, but God is not like a craftsman who literally manages the world. Later, [[Avicenna]] was also convinced of this, and proposed instead a cosmological argument for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Avicenna |first=Lenn Evan |last=Goodman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=779JPlxYtGoC&amp;pg=PA63| page=63| publisher= Cornell university press| year=1992|isbn=978-0801472541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument was however later accepted by both the Aristotelian philosopher [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd) and his great anti-philosophy opponent [[Al-Ghazali]]. Averroes' term for the argument was ''Dalīl al-ˁināya'', which can be translated as "argument from providence". Both of them however accepted the argument ''because'' they believed it is explicitly mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Kitāb al-Dalīl al-Kabīr| editor-first= Binyāmîn |editor-last=Abrahamov |chapter=Introduction| first=Binyāmîn |last=Abrahamov |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYqKHJFAhr8C |year=1990| publisher=Brill| isbn= 978-9004089853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, like Aristotle, the Neoplatonists, and Al-Farabi, Averroes proposed that order and continual motion in the world is caused by God's intellect. Whether Averroes was an "emanationist" like his predecessors has been a subject of disagreement and uncertainty. But it is generally agreed that what he adapted from those traditions, agreed with them about the fact that God does not create in the same way as a craftsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Averroes and the metaphysics of causation | publisher=SUNY Press | author=Kogan, Barry S. | year=1985 | pages=240–243 | isbn=978-0-88706-063-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAyv0Ayy-R0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20averroes&amp;pg=PA240#v=snippet&amp;q=teleological%20argument&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catarina Carriço Marques de Moura Belo ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4Nii9xOmTYC Chance and Determinism in Avicenna and Averroës]''. See for example p.&amp;nbsp;194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact then, Averroes treated the teleological argument as one of two "religious" arguments for the existence of God. The principal demonstrative proof is, according to Averroes, Aristotle's proof from motion in the universe that there must be a first mover which causes everything else to move.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlos Fraenkel]] "Philosophical Religions from Plato to Spinoza: Reason, Religion, and Autonomy", p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2wYgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199 199].&lt;/ref&gt; Averroes' position that the most logically valid proof should be physical rather than metaphysical (because then metaphysics would be proving itself) was in conscious opposition to the position of Avicenna. Later Jewish and Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas were aware of this debate, and generally took a position closer to Avicenna.

====Jewish philosophy====
An example of the teleological argument in [[Jewish philosophy]] appears when the medieval Aristotelian philosopher [[Maimonides]] cites the passage in [[Isaiah]] 40:26, where the "Holy One" says: "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number:"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A26&amp;version=AKJV King James Version of the Bible]
&lt;/ref&gt; However, Barry Holtz calls this "a crude form of the argument from design", and that this "is only one possible way of reading the text". He asserts that "Generally, in the biblical texts the existence of God is taken for granted."&lt;ref&gt;Holtz, B., ''Back to the Sources'', Simon and Schuster, 2008, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides also recalled that [[Abraham]] (in the [[midrash]], or explanatory text, of [[Genesis Rabbah]] 39:1) recognized the existence of "one transcendent deity from the fact that the world around him exhibits an order and design".&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt; The [[midrash]] makes an analogy between the obviousness that a building has an owner, and that the world is looked after by God. Abraham says "Is it conceivable that the world is without a guide?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/RabbaGenesis/midrashrabbahgen027557mbp#page/n359/mode/2up ''Genesis Rabbah'', 39:1]
&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these examples, the 19th century philosopher [[Nachman Krochmal]] called the argument from design "a cardinal principle of the Jewish faith".&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;Harris, J.M., ''Nachman Krochmal: Guiding the Perplexed of the Modern Age'', NYU Press, 1991, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American orthodox rabbi, [[Aryeh Kaplan]], retells a legend about the 2nd century AD [[Rabbi Meir]]. When told by a philosopher that he did not believe that the world was created by God, the rabbi produced a beautiful poem that he claimed had come into being when a cat accidentally knocked over a pot of ink, "spilling ink all over the document. This poem was the result." The philosopher exclaims that would be impossible: "There must be an author. There must be a scribe." The rabbi concludes, "How could the universe ... come into being by itself? There must be an Author. There must be a Creator."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A., ''The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology: Illuminating Expositions on Jewish Thought and Practice by a Revered Teacher'', Volume 1, Mesorah Publications, 1991, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thomism ====
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|upright|The fifth of Thomas Aquinas' proofs of God's existence was based on teleology]]

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), whose writings became widely accepted within Catholic western Europe, was heavily influenced by Aristotle, Averroes, and other Islamic and Jewish philosophers. He presented a teleological argument in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. In the work, Aquinas presented five ways in which he attempted to prove the existence of God: the ''[[quinque viae]]''. These arguments feature only ''a posteriori'' arguments, rather than literal reading of holy texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Thought of Thomas Aquinas | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Davies, Brian | year=1992 | page=30, footnote 30 | isbn=978-0-19-152044-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxrDzeKU2VsC&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=aquinas%20teleological%20argument%20aristotle&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=aquinas%20teleological%20argument%20aristotle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sums up his teleological argument as follows:

{{Quote|The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack knowledge, such as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that they achieve their end, not fortuitously, but designedly. Now whatever lacks knowledge cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is directed by the archer. Therefore, some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God. |St Thomas Aquinas|''Summa Theologica: Article 3, Question 2)''&lt;ref name="Himma"&gt;Himma, Kenneth Einar (2006). [http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/design.htm#SH1b "Design Arguments for the Existence of God"], in James Fieser and Bradley Dowden, eds., ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', retrieved 8/24/08&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aquinas notes that the existence of [[final cause]]s, by which a cause is directed toward an effect, can only be explained by an appeal to intelligence. However, as natural bodies aside from humans do not possess intelligence, there must, he reasons, exist a being that directs final causes at every moment. That being is what we call God.&lt;ref name="Himma" /&gt;

===Modernity===

==== Newton and Leibniz ====
[[Isaac Newton]] affirmed his belief in the truth of the argument when, in 1713, he wrote these words in an appendix to the second edition of his [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;This most elegant system of the sun, planets, and comets could not have arisen without the design and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, I., quoted in Huyssteen, JWV. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Science and Religion'', Macmillan, 2003, p. 621.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;This view, that "God is known from his works", was supported and popularized by Newton's friends [[Richard Bentley]], [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[William Whiston]] in the [[Boyle lectures]], which Newton supervised.&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton wrote to Bentley, just before Bentley delivered the first lecture, that:&lt;blockquote&gt;when I wrote my treatise about our Systeme I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the beliefe [sic] of a Deity, and nothing can rejoice me more than to find it useful for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] disagreed with Newton's view of design in the teleological argument. In the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]], Samuel Clarke argued Newton's case that God constantly intervenes in the world to keep His design adjusted, while Leibniz thought that the universe was created in such a way that God would not need to intervene at all. As quoted by Ayval Leshem, Leibniz wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;According to [Newton's] doctrine, God Almighty wants [i.e. needs] to wind up his watch from time to time; otherwise it would cease to move. He had not it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, pp. 21–22.[https://books.google.com/books?id=fD-qvJp0Q5kC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=argument+from+design+%22Samuel+Clarke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h_xkU8jdEc7vOa7pgfAL&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=argument%20from%20design%20%22Samuel%20Clarke%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Leibniz considered the argument from design to have "only moral certainty" unless it was supported by his own idea of [[pre-established harmony]] expounded in his [[Monadology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomerlaeau, ''Western Philosophies Religion'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 1998, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that "The proof from the pre-established harmony is a particular form of the so-called physico-theological proof, otherwise known as the argument from design." According to Leibniz, the universe is completely made from individual substances known as [[monad (philosophy)|monads]], programmed to act in a predetermined way.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': "monads are basic substances that make up the universe but lack spatial extension and hence are immaterial. Each monad is a unique, indestructible, dynamic, soullike entity whose properties are a function of its perceptions and appetites."&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In Leibniz's form, the argument states that the harmony of all the monads can only have arisen from a common cause. That they should all exactly synchronize, can only be explained by a Creator who pre-determined their synchronism.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B., ''A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz,'', Routledge, 2005, First published 1900, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== British empiricists ====

The 17th-century [[Dutch people|Dutch]] writers [[Lessius]] and [[Grotius]] argued that the intricate structure of the world, like that of a house, was unlikely to have arisen by chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = James|last= Franklin | title = The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2001| location = Baltimore| pages = 244–5| isbn = 978-0-8018-6569-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The empiricist [[John Locke]], writing in the late 17th century, developed the Aristotelian idea that, excluding geometry, all science must attain its knowledge ''a posteriori'' - through sensual experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cambridge companion to Locke | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Claiborne Chappell, Vere | year=1994 | pages=161–164 | isbn=978-0-521-38772-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f28fFbiohXMC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=locke%20a%20priori&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=locke%20a%20priori&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Locke, Anglican Irish Bishop [[George Berkeley]] advanced a form of [[idealism]] in which things only continue to exist when they are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Dicker, Georges | year=2011 | page=260 | isbn=978-0-19-538146-7 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=XBqQXI3JGeEC&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20berkeley&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20argument%20berkeley&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When humans do not perceive objects, they continue to exist because God is perceiving them.

David Hume, in the mid-18th century, referred to the teleological argument in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. Here, he appears to give his support to the argument from design. John Wright notes that "Indeed, he claims that the whole thrust of his analysis of causality in the Treatise supports the Design argument", and that, according to Hume, "we are obliged 'to infer an infinitely perfect Architect.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Wright, JP., in Traiger, S., ''The Blackwell Guide to Hume's Treatise'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later he was more critical of the argument in his ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. This was presented as a dialogue between Hume and "a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes", where the friend gives a version of the argument by saying of its proponents, they "paint in the most magnificent colours the order, beauty, and wise arrangement of the universe; and then ask if such a glorious display of intelligence could come from a random coming together of atoms, or if chance could produce something that the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire."&lt;ref&gt;Pomerleau, WP., ''Twelve Great Philosophers: A Historical Introduction to Human Nature'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume also presented arguments both for and against the teleological argument in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''. The character Cleanthes, summarizing the teleological argument, likens the universe to a man-made machine, and concludes by the principle of similar effects and similar causes that it must have a designing intelligence:
{{quotation|Look round the world: contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be nothing but one great-machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which he has executed. By this argument ''a posteriori,'' and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity, and his similarity to human mind and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Hume1779" /&gt;}}
On the other hand, Hume's sceptic, Philo, is not satisfied with the argument from design. He attempts a number of refutations, including one that arguably foreshadows Darwin's theory, and makes the point that if God resembles a human designer, then assuming divine characteristics such as omnipotence and omniscience is not justified. He goes on to joke that far from being the perfect creation of a perfect designer, this universe may be "only the first rude essay of some infant deity... the object of derision to his superiors".&lt;ref name="Hume1779"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hume |year=1779 |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |edition=The Second |location=London |publisher=[[Sine nomine|s.n.]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Derham's natural theology ====
Starting in 1696 with his ''Artificial Clockmaker'', [[William Derham]] published a stream of teleological books. The best known of these are ''Physico-Theology'', 1713; ''Astro-Theology'', 1714; and ''Christo-Theology'', 1730. ''Physico-Theology'', for example, was explicitly subtitled "A demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation". A [[Natural theology|natural theologian]], Derham listed scientific observations of the many variations in nature, and proposed that these proved "the unreasonableness of infidelity". At the end of the section on Gravity for instance, he writes: "What else can be concluded, but that all was made with manifest Design, and that all the whole Structure is the Work of some intelligent Being; some Artist, of Power and Skill equivalent to such a Work?"&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, of the "sense of sound" he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For who but an intelligent Being, what less than an omnipotent and infinitely wise God could contrive, and make such a fine Body, such a Medium, so susceptible of every Impression, that the Sense of Hearing hath occasion for, to empower all Animals to express their Sense and Meaning to others.&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derham concludes: "For it is a Sign a Man is a wilful, perverse Atheist, that will impute so glorious a Work, as the Creation is, to any Thing, yea, a mere Nothing (as Chance is) rather than to God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Physico_theology_Or_A_Demonstration_of_t.html?id=6Tm2CZLTl0wC Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, p. 328]&lt;/ref&gt; A.S. Weber writes that Derham's ''Physico-Theology'' "directly influenced" William Paley's later work.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, AS., ''Nineteenth-Century Science: An Anthology'', Broadview Press, 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The power, and yet the limitations, of this kind of reasoning is illustrated in microcosm by the history of [[La Fontaine's Fables|La Fontaine's]] fable of [[The Acorn and the Pumpkin]], which first appeared in France in 1679. The light-hearted anecdote of how a doubting peasant is finally convinced of the wisdom behind creation arguably undermines this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Peter France, "The poet as a teacher" in ''Poetry in France: metamorphoses of a muse'', Edinburgh U 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;138&lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning with [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]]'s conversion of the story into a polemic against atheism, it has been taken up by a succession of moral writers as presenting a valid argument for the proposition that "The wisdom of God is displayed in creation".&lt;ref&gt;''Anecdotes and Examples illustrating the Catholic catechism'', New York 1904, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=--ELAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;f=false pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Watchmaker analogy ====
[[File:WilliamPaley.jpg|thumb|[[William Paley]] popularized the "watchmaker analogy" used by earlier [[natural theology|natural theologians]], making it a famous teleological argument.]]
{{main|Watchmaker analogy}}

The [[watchmaker analogy]], framing the teleological argument with reference to a timepiece, dates at least back to the Stoics, who were reported by Cicero in his ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (II.88), using such an argument against [[Epicureans]], whom, they taunt, would "think more highly of the achievement of [[Archimedes]] in making a model of the revolutions of the firmament than of that of nature in creating them, although the perfection of the original shows a craftsmanship many times as great as does the counterfeit".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=De natura deorum| url= https://archive.org/details/denaturadeorumac00ciceuoft| year=1933| publisher= London W. Heinemann}}, translated by H. Rackham. This is discussed at Sedley p.&amp;nbsp;207.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by [[Robert Hooke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hooke | first = Rober |title = Micrographia | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 2003 |page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=0DYXk_9XX38C | isbn = 978-0-486-49564-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Voltaire]], the latter of whom remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The Universe troubles me, and much less can I think
That this clock exists and should have no clockmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from ''Aristotle to Darwin and Back Again: A Journey in Final Causality, Species, and Evolution'' Etienne Gilson Ignatius Press, 2009 p. 126. Original: "L'univers m'embarrasse, et je ne puis songer Que cette horloge existe, et n'ait point d'horloger"; {{cite book | last = Voltaire | authorlink =Voltaire | title = Les cabales,: oeuvre pacifique | publisher = Oxford University, s. n., 1772  | location = | page = 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ai8HAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Les%20Cabales%20Oeuvre%20Pacifique&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=point%20d%27horloger&amp;f=false | doi = | isbn = 978-1-165-51896-8 | year = 1772}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Paley]] presented his version of the watchmaker analogy at the start of his ''Natural Theology'' (1802).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paley|1809|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=7 1].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]uppose I found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place, I should hardly think … that, for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. Yet why should not this answer serve for the watch as well as for [a] stone [that happened to be lying on the ground]?… For this reason, and for no other; namely, that, if the different parts had been differently shaped from what they are, if a different size from what they are, or placed after any other manner, or in any order than that in which they are placed, either no motion at all would have been carried on in the machine, or none which would have answered the use that is now served by it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Alister McGrath]], Paley argued that "The same complexity and utility evident in the design and functioning of a watch can also be discerned in the natural world. Each feature of a biological organism, like that of a watch, showed evidence of being designed in such a way as to adapt the organism to survival within its environment. Complexity and utility are observed; the conclusion that they were designed and constructed by God, Paley holds, is as natural as it is correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Darwinism and the Divine: Evolutionary Thought and Natural Theology | author = McGrath, AE. | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year =  2011 | page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural theology strongly influenced British science, with the expectation as expressed by [[Adam Sedgwick]] in 1831 that truths revealed by science could not conflict with the moral truths of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, E. Janet (1995), ''Charles Darwin: vol. 1 Voyaging'', London: Jonathan Cape, {{ISBN|1-84413-314-1}}, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; These natural philosophers saw God as the first cause, and sought secondary causes to explain design in nature: the leading figure Sir [[John Herschel]] wrote in 1836 that by analogy with other [[Physical law|intermediate causes]] "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=hersch&gt;Wyhe, John van. (2007) ''Mind the gap: Did Darwin avoid publishing his theory for many years?''. Notes and Records of the Royal Society 61: 177–205. p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]&lt;br /&gt;Babbage, Charles (1838) ''The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise''. 2nd edn. London: John Murray. pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A25&amp;pageseq=232 225–227]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theology student, [[Charles Darwin]] found Paley's arguments compelling. However, he later developed his theory of [[evolution]] in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', which offers an alternate explanation of biological order. In his autobiography, Darwin wrote that "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=61 59], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=89 87].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin struggled with the [[problem of evil]] and of suffering in nature, but remained inclined to believe that nature depended upon "designed laws" and commended [[Asa Gray]]'s statement about "Darwin's great service to Natural Science in bringing back to it Teleology: so that, instead of Morphology versus Teleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to Teleology."&lt;ref name="SMiles"&gt;Miles, Sara Joan, "[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2001/PSCF9-01Miles.html Charles Darwin and Asa Gray Discuss Teleology and Design]," ''PSCF'' (2001) 53: 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin owned he was "bewildered" on the subject, but was "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance":
&lt;blockquote&gt;But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as others do, &amp; as I shd wish to do, evidence of design &amp; beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent &amp; omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''More Letters of Charles Darwin'', ed. Francis Darwin, (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1903), p. 252. Quoted in Miles, Sara Joan, "[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2001/PSCF9-01Miles.html Charles Darwin and Asa Gray Discuss Teleology and Design]," ''PSCF'' (2001) 53: 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recent proponents===

====Probabilistic arguments====
In 1928 and 1930, [[Frederick Robert Tennant|F. R. Tennant]] published his ''Philosophical Theology'', which was a "bold endeavour to combine scientific and theological thinking".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Article on Tennant, Frederick Robert.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a version of the teleological argument based on the accumulation of the probabilities of each individual biological adaptation. "Tennant concedes that naturalistic accounts such as evolutionary theory may explain each of the individual adaptations he cites, but he insists that in this case the whole exceeds the sum of its parts: naturalism can explain each adaptation but not their totality."&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' notes that "Critics have insisted on focusing on the cogency of each piece of theistic evidence – reminding us that, in the end, ten leaky buckets hold no more water than one." Also, "Some critics, such as [[John Hick]] and D.H. Mellor, have objected to Tennant's particular use of probability theory and have challenged the relevance of any kind of probabilistic reasoning to theistic belief."&lt;ref name=Rout&gt;Craig, E., ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy", Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, Entry for "Tennant, Frederick Robert (1866–1957)."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Swinburne]]'s "contributions to philosophical theology have sought to apply more sophisticated versions of probability theory to the question of God's existence, a methodological improvement on Tennant's work but squarely in the same spirit".&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; He uses [[Bayesian probability]] "taking account not only of the order and functioning of nature but also of the 'fit' between human intelligence and the universe, whereby one can understand its workings, as well as human aesthetic, moral, and religious experience".&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', entry on "Christian philosophy".&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne writes: "the existence of order in the world confirms the existence of God if and only if the existence of this order in the world is more probable if there is a God than if there is not. ... the probability of order of the right kind is very much greater if there is a God, and so that the existence of such order adds greatly to the probability that there is a God."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, R., ''The Existence of God'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne acknowledges that his argument by itself may not give a reason to believe in the existence of God, but in combination with other arguments such as [[cosmological argument]]s and evidence from [[mystical experience]], he thinks it can.

While discussing Hume's arguments, [[Alvin Plantinga]] offered a probability version of the teleological argument in his book ''[[God and Other Minds]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every ''contingent'' object such that we know whether or not it was the product of intelligent design, ''was'' the product of intelligent design.

The universe is a contingent object.

So probably the universe is designed.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, A., ''God and Other Minds: A Study of the Rational Justification of Belief in God'', Cornell University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
Following Plantinga, Georges Dicker produced a slightly different version in his book about [[Bishop Berkeley]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A. The world ... shows amazing teleological order.

B. All Objects exhibiting such order ... are products of intelligent design.

C. Probably the world is a result of intelligent design.

D. Probably, God exists and created the world.&lt;ref&gt;Dicker, G., ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford University Press, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;262. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5yVwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=plantinga+++%22argument+from+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vqVWU-zUOIOrhAe36ICwBA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=plantinga%20%20%20%22argument%20from%20design%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' has the following criticism of such arguments:&lt;blockquote&gt; It can of course be said that any form in which the universe might be is statistically enormously improbable as it is only one of a virtual infinity of possible forms. But its actual form is no more improbable, in this sense, than innumerable others. It is only the fact that humans are part of it that makes it seem so special, requiring a transcendent explanation.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Fine-tuned Universe ====
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
A modern variation of the teleological argument is built upon the concept of the [[fine-tuned Universe]]: According to the website ''Biologos'': "Fine-tuning refers to the surprising precision of nature's physical constants, and the beginning state of the Universe. To explain the present state of the universe, even the best scientific theories require that the physical constants of nature and the beginning state of the Universe have extremely precise values."&lt;ref name="biologos.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221081439/http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning |archivedate=2014-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the fine-tuning of the Universe is the apparent delicate balance of conditions necessary for human life. In this view, speculation about a vast range of possible conditions in which life cannot exist is used to explore the probability of conditions in which life can and does exist. For example, it can be argued that if the force of the [[Big Bang]] explosion had been different by 1/10 to the sixtieth power or the [[strong interaction|strong interaction force]] was only 5% different, life would be impossible.&lt;ref name="Himma2009"/&gt;Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking estimates that "if the rate of the universe's expansion one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million, the universe would have re-collapsed into a hot fireball due to gravitational attraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/323074|title=Constraints on the Long‐Range Properties of Gravity from Weak Gravitational Lensing|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=560|issue=2|pages=539–543|year=2001|last1=White|first1=Martin|last2=Kochanek|first2=C. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of a teleological argument, the intuition in relation to a fine-tuned universe would be that God must have been responsible, if achieving such perfect conditions is so improbable.&lt;ref name="biologos.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Himma2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/design | title=Design Arguments for the Existence of God | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=12 April 2009 | accessdate=November 19, 2011 | author=Himma, Kenneth Einar}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in regard to fine-tuning, [[Kenneth Einar Himma]] writes: "The mere fact that it is enormously improbable that an event occurred... by itself, gives us no reason to think that it occurred by design ... As intuitively tempting as it may be..."&lt;ref name="Himma2009"/&gt; Himma attributes the "Argument from Suspicious Improbabilities", a formalization of "the fine-tuning intuition" to [[George N. Schlesinger]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;To understand Schlesinger's argument, consider your reaction to two different events. If John wins a 1-in-1,000,000,000 lottery game, you would not immediately be tempted to think that John (or someone acting on his behalf) cheated. If, however, John won three consecutive 1-in-1,000 lotteries, you would immediately be tempted to think that John (or someone acting on his behalf) cheated. Schlesinger believes that the intuitive reaction to these two scenarios is epistemically justified. The structure of the latter event is such that it… justifies a belief that intelligent design is the cause… Despite the fact that the probability of winning three consecutive 1-in-1,000 games is exactly the same as the probability of winning one 1-in-1,000,000,000 game, the former event… warrants an inference of intelligent design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Himma considers Schlesinger's argument to be subject to the same vulnerabilities he noted in other versions of the design argument: &lt;blockquote&gt;While Schlesinger is undoubtedly correct in thinking that we are justified in suspecting design in the case [of winning] three consecutive lotteries, it is because—and only because—we know two related empirical facts about such events. First, we already know that there exist intelligent agents who have the right motivations and causal abilities to deliberately bring about such events. Second, we know from past experience with such events that they are usually explained by the deliberate agency of one or more of these agents. Without at least one of these two pieces of information, we are not obviously justified in seeing design in such cases… [T]he problem for the fine-tuning argument is that we lack both of the pieces that are needed to justify an inference of design. First, the very point of the argument is to establish the fact that there exists an intelligent agency that has the right causal abilities and motivations to bring the existence of a universe capable of sustaining life. Second, and more obviously, we do not have any past experience with the genesis of worlds and are hence not in a position to know whether the existence of fine-tuned universes are usually explained by the deliberate agency of some intelligent agency. Because we lack this essential background information, we are not justified in inferring that there exists an intelligent Deity who deliberately created a universe capable of sustaining life.&lt;ref name="Himma2009" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Antony Flew]], who spent most of his life as an atheist, converted to [[deism]] late in life, and postulated "an intelligent being as involved in some way in the design of conditions that would allow life to arise and evolve".&lt;ref name="Diogenes"&gt;{{cite book | title=Theology for a Troubled Believer: An Introduction to the Christian Faith | publisher=Westminster John Knox Press | author=Allen, Diogenes | year=2010 | page=42 | isbn=978-0-664-22322-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouWlkBXeg5IC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=anthropic%20principle%20antony%20flew&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=anthropic%20principle%20antony%20flew&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that the fine-tuning of the universe was too precise to be the result of chance, so accepted the existence of God. He said that his commitment to "go where the evidence leads" meant that he ended up accepting the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=What's so great about Christianity | publisher=Regnery | author=D'Souza, Dinesh | year=2007 | pages=132–3 | isbn=978-1-59698-517-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVXf2PV8pyQC&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=anthropic%20principle%20antony%20flew&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flew proposed the view, held earlier by [[Fred Hoyle]], that the universe is too young for life to have developed purely by chance and that, therefore, an intelligent being must exist which was involved in designing the conditions required for life to evolve.&lt;ref name="Diogenes" /&gt;

==== Creation science and intelligent design ====
{{Main|Intelligent design}}
A version of the argument from design is central to both [[creation science]] and [[Intelligent design]],&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt; but unlike Paley's openness to [[deism|deistic]] design through God-given laws, proponents seek scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous interventions in the history of life, and argue that their [[theistic science]] should be taught in science classrooms.&lt;ref name="PM 09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Padian | first1 = K. | last2 = Matzke | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1042/bj20081534 | title = Darwin, Dover, 'Intelligent Design' and textbooks | journal = Biochemical Journal | volume = 417 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–42 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19061485| pmc = }} [http://www.biochemj.org/bj/417/0029/4170029.pdf .pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of [[evolution]] was effectively barred from United States public school curricula by the outcome of the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]], but in the 1960s the [[National Defense Education Act]] led to the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] reintroducing the teaching of evolution. In response, there was a resurgence of [[creationism]], now presented as "creation science", based on biblical literalism but with Bible quotes optional. ("Explicit references to the Bible were optional: Morris's 1974 book ''Scientific Creationism'' came in two versions, one with Bible quotes, and one without."&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;)

A 1989 survey found that virtually all literature promoting creation science presented the design argument, with [[John D. Morris]] saying "any living thing gives such strong evidence for design by an intelligent designer that only a willful ignorance of the data (II Peter 3:5) could lead one to assign such intricacy to chance." Such publications introduced concepts central to intelligent design, including ''[[irreducible complexity]]'' (a variant of the watchmaker analogy) and ''[[specified complexity]]'' (closely resembling a fine-tuning argument). The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling on ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' barred the teaching of "Creation Science" in public schools because it breached the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]], and a group of creationists rebranded Creation Science as "intelligent design" which was presented as a scientific theory rather than as a religious argument.&lt;ref name="SM 07"&gt;

Scientists disagreed with the assertion that intelligent design is scientific, and its introduction into the science curriculum of a [[Pennsylvania]] school district led to the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, which ruled that the "intelligent design" arguments are essentially religious in nature and not science.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci2010"/&gt; The court took evidence from theologian [[John F. Haught]], and ruled that "ID is not a new scientific [[argument]], but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God. He traced this argument back to at least Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, who framed the argument as a syllogism: Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer." "This argument for the existence of God was advanced early in the 19th century by Reverend Paley": "The only apparent difference between the argument made by Paley and the argument for ID, as expressed by defense expert witnesses Behe and Minnich, is that ID's 'official position' does not acknowledge that the designer is God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

Proponents of the [[intelligent design movement]] such as [[Cornelius G. Hunter]], have asserted that the methodological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] upon which science is based is religious in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Science's Blind Spot: The Unseen Religion of Scientific Naturalism". Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; They commonly refer to it as 'scientific materialism' or as 'methodological materialism' and conflate it with 'metaphysical naturalism'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism]: Clarifying the Connection (2000), [[Barbara Forrest]], Retrieved 2007-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; They use this assertion to support their claim that modern science is atheistic, and contrast it with their preferred approach of a revived [[natural philosophy]] which welcomes supernatural explanations for natural phenomena and supports [[Theistic realism|theistic science]]. This ignores the distinction between science and religion, established in Ancient Greece, in which science can not use supernatural explanations.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Massimo |last=Pigliucci |year=2010 |title=Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-66786-7 |lccn=2009049778 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;pg=PA177 |page=177 |quote=[E]ven back in Aristotle's time, a fundamental assumption of doing things scientifically is that the supernatural is out: no explanations that invoke non-natural causes are allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent design advocate and [[biochemist]] [[Michael Behe]] proposed a development of Paley's watch analogy in which he argued in favour of intelligent design. Unlike Paley, Behe only attempts to prove the existence of an intelligent designer, rather than the God of classical theism. Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to propose [[irreducible complexity]]: he argues that if a mousetrap loses just one of its parts, it can no longer function as a mousetrap. He argues that irreducible complexity in an object guarantees the presence of intelligent design. Behe claims that there are instances of irreducible complexity in the natural world and that parts of the world must have been designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Arguing About Gods | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Oppy, Graham | year=2006 | pages=187–189 | isbn=978-0-521-86386-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlVtfUxPD14C&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;vq=188&amp;dq=arguing%20about%20gods&amp;pg=PA187#v=snippet&amp;q=behe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This negative argument against step by step evolution ignores longstanding evidence that evolution proceeds through [[exaptation|changes of function]] from preceding systems. The specific examples Behe proposes have been shown to have simpler [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] which could act as precursors with different functions. His arguments have been rebutted, both in general and in specific cases by numerous scientific papers{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. In response, Behe and others, "ironically, given the absence of any detail in their own explanation, complain that the proffered explanations lack sufficient detail to be empirically tested."&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;

==== "Third way" proposal ====

[[University of Chicago]] [[genetics|geneticist]] [[James A. Shapiro]], writing in the [[Boston Review]], states that advancements in genetics and molecular biology, and "the growing realization that cells have molecular computing networks which process information about internal operations and about the external environment to make decisions controlling growth, movement, and differentiation", have implications for the teleological argument. Shapiro states that these "[[natural genetic engineering]]" systems, can produce radical reorganizations of the "genetic apparatus within a single cell generation".&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;Shapiro, James, The Third Way, http://new.bostonreview.net/BR22.1/shapiro.html{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro suggests what he calls a 'Third Way'; a non-creationist, non-Darwinian type of evolution:
{{quote|What significance does an emerging interface between biology and information science hold for thinking about evolution? It opens up the possibility of addressing scientifically rather than ideologically the central issue so hotly contested by fundamentalists on both sides of the Creationist-Darwinist debate: Is there any guiding intelligence at work in the origin of species displaying exquisite adaptations ...&lt;ref name=Shapiro /&gt;}}
In his book, ''Evolution: A View from the 21st Century'', Shapiro refers to this concept of "natural genetic engineering", which he says, has proved troublesome, because many scientists feel that it supports the intelligent design argument. He suggests that "function-oriented capacities [can] be attributed to cells", even though this is "the kind of teleological thinking that scientists have been taught to avoid at all costs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: A View from the 21st Century|last=Shapiro|first=James|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2011|pages=136–137}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=T7-UgI_kgT8C&amp;dq=shapiro+creationism&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

===Classical===
The original development of the argument from design was in reaction to atomistic, explicitly non-teleological understandings of nature. Socrates, as reported by Plato and Xenophon, was reacting to such natural philosophers. While less has survived from the debates of the Hellenistic and Roman eras, it is clear from sources such as [[Cicero]] and [[Lucretius]], that debate continued for generations, and several of the striking metaphors used to still today such as the unseen watchmaker, and the [[infinite monkey theorem]], have their roots in this period. While the Stoics became the most well-known proponents of the argument from design, the atomistic counter arguments were refined most famously by the [[Epicurus|Epicureans]]. On the one hand, they criticized the evidence for there being evidence of an intelligent design to nature and the logic of the Stoics. On the defensive side, they were faced with the challenge of explaining how un-directed chance can cause something which appears to be a rational order. Much of this defence revolved around arguments such as the infinite monkey metaphor. Democritus had already apparently used such arguments at the time of Socrates, saying that there will be infinite planets, and only some having an order like the planet we know. But the Epicureans refined this argument, by proposing that the actual number of types of atoms in nature is small, not infinite, making it less coincidental that after a long period of time, certain orderly outcomes will result.&lt;ref name=sed/&gt;

These were not the only positions held in classical times. A more complex position also continued to be held by some schools, such as the Neoplatonists, who, like Plato and Aristotle, insisted that Nature did indeed have a rational order, but were concerned about how to describe the way in which this rational order is caused. According to Plotinus for example, Plato's metaphor of a craftsman should be seen only as a metaphor, and Plato should be understood as agreeing with Aristotle that the rational order in nature works through a form of causation unlike everyday causation. In fact, according to this proposal each thing already has its own nature, fitting into a rational order, whereby the thing itself is "in need of, and directed towards, what is higher or better".&lt;ref&gt;Riccardo Chiaradonna, "Plotinus' account of demiurgic causation and its philosophical background", in ''Causation and Creation in Late Antiquity'' edited by Anna Marmodoro, Brian D. Prince, [https://books.google.be/books?id=7Wt2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 p.&amp;nbsp;31].&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Hume===
[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume outlined his criticisms of the teleological argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''.]]
Louis Loeb writes that [[David Hume]], in his ''Enquiry'', "insists that inductive inference cannot justify belief in extended objects". Loeb also quotes Hume as writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only when two species of objects are found to be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other ... If experience and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can reasonably follow in inference of this nature; both the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effects and causes ... which we have found, in many instances, to be conjoined with another ... [The proponents of the argument] always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Loeb notes that "we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction
involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either
to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ECxW_2tAf0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=%22insists+that+inductive%22+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cLTzU-nZDYWf7AaRvoCIBw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22insists%20that%20inductive%22%20hume&amp;f=false Loeb, LE., in Radcliffe, ES (ed.), ''A Companion to Hume'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 118.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hume also presented a criticism of the argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''. The character ''Philo'', a religious sceptic, voices Hume's criticisms of the argument. He argues that the design argument is built upon a faulty analogy as, unlike with man-made objects, we have not witnessed the design of a universe, so do not know whether the universe was the result of design. Moreover, the size of the universe makes the analogy problematic: although our experience of the universe is of order, there may be chaos in other parts of the universe.&lt;ref name="IEP Hume"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume | title=David Hume (1711–1776) | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=June 30, 2011 | accessdate=November 24, 2011 | author=Fiesar, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo argues:
{{Quote|A very small part of this great system, during a very short time, is very imperfectly discovered to us; and do we thence pronounce decisively concerning the origin of the whole?|David Hume|Dialogues 2&lt;ref name="IEP Hume" /&gt;}}
Philo also proposes that the order in nature may be due to nature alone. If nature contains a principle of order within it, the need for a designer is removed. Philo argues that even if the universe is indeed designed, it is unreasonable to justify the conclusion that the designer must be an omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent God – the God of classical theism.&lt;ref name="IEP Hume" /&gt; It is impossible, he argues, to infer the perfect nature of a creator from the nature of its creation. Philo argues that the designer may have been defective or otherwise imperfect, suggesting that the universe may have been a poor first attempt at design.&lt;ref name="God Hypothesis"&gt;{{cite book | title=The God Hypothesis and Other Theories of the Universe | publisher=Infinity Publishing | author=Auerbach, Albert A. | year=2001 | pages=59–60 | isbn=978-0-7414-0245-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtDSNNPjpRwC&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20from%20ignorance&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20argument%20from%20ignorance&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also pointed out that the argument does not necessarily lead to the existence of one God: “why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing the world?” (p.&amp;nbsp;108).&lt;ref name="Hume1779" /&gt;

[[Wesley C. Salmon]] developed Hume's insights, arguing that all things in the universe which exhibit order are, to our knowledge, created by material, imperfect, finite beings or forces. He also argued that there are no known instances of an immaterial, perfect, infinite being creating anything. Using the probability calculus of [[Bayes Theorem]], Salmon concludes that it is very improbable that the universe was created by the type of intelligent being theists argue for.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley C. Salmon, "Religion and Science: A New Look at Hume's Dialogues", Philosophical Studies, 33 (1978), 143–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] accuses Salmon of [[begging the question]]. One piece of evidence he uses in his probabilistic argument – that atoms and molecules are not caused by design – is equivalent to the conclusion he draws, that the universe is probably not caused by design. The atoms and molecules are what the universe is made up of and whose origins are at issue. Therefore, they cannot be used as evidence against the theistic conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00571885 |jstor=4319204|title=Comments on Wesley Salmon's 'Science and Religion ...'|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=33|issue=2|pages=177–183|year=1978|last1=Cartwright|first1=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
Referring to it as the physico-theological proof, [[Immanuel Kant]] discussed the teleological argument in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]]. Even though he referred to it as "the oldest, clearest and most appropriate to human reason", he nevertheless rejected it, heading section VI with the words, "On the impossibility of a physico-theological proof".&lt;ref&gt;Buroker, JV., ''Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason': An Introduction'', Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;279.[https://books.google.com/books?id=2DaHzDGjR48C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=kant+%22argument+from+design%22+criticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZS5UU-qhB-nH7AaNsYHwAg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22argument%20from%20design%22%20&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', in Guyer, P. and Wood, AW.(Trans.), CUP, 1998, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt; In accepting some of Hume's criticisms, Kant wrote that the argument "proves at most intelligence only in the arrangement of the 'matter' of the universe, and hence the existence not of a 'Supreme Being', but of an 'Architect{{'"}}. Using the argument to try to prove the existence of God required "a concealed appeal to the [[Ontological argument]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rabitte, E., in Tweyman, S, (ed.), ''David Hume: Critical Assessments'', Volume 5, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Does not prove the existence of God ===
[[File:D'après Nicolas de Largillière, portrait de Voltaire (Institut et Musée Voltaire) -001.jpg|thumb|[[Voltaire]] argued that, at best, the teleological argument could only indicate the existence of a powerful, but not necessarily all-powerful or all-knowing, intelligence.]]

In his ''Traité de métaphysique'' [[Voltaire]] argued that, even if the argument from design could prove the existence of a powerful intelligent designer, it would not prove that this designer is God.&lt;ref name=Voltaire&gt;{{cite book | author = Voltaire | authorlink = Voltaire | others = trans.

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] questioned the existence of God, rejecting all rational arguments for God's existence (including the teleological argument) on the grounds that reason is inevitably accompanied by doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Words of Wisdom: Philosophy's Most Important Quotations And Their Meanings | publisher=Quercus | author=Southwell, Gareth | isbn=978-1-78087-092-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9JWTes9fH0C&amp;lpg=PT325&amp;dq=S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;pg=PT325#v=onepage&amp;q=S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;f=false | date=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that the argument from design does not take into consideration future events which may serve to undermine the proof of God's existence: the argument would never finish proving God's existence.&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments'' (1844).&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', Kierkegaard writes:

{{Quotation|The works of God are such that only God can perform them. Just so, but where then are the works of the God? The works from which I would deduce his existence are not directly and immediately given. The wisdom in nature, the goodness, the wisdom in the governance of the world – are all these manifest, perhaps, upon the very face of things? Are we not here confronted with the most terrible temptations to doubt, and is it not impossible finally to dispose of all these doubts? But from such an order of things I will surely not attempt to prove God's existence; and even if I began I would never finish, and would in addition have to live constantly in suspense, lest something so terrible should suddenly happen that my bit of proof would be demolished.|Søren Kierkegaard|Philosophical Fragments&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard" /&gt;}}

=== Argument from improbability ===
[[Richard Dawkins]] is harshly critical of intelligent design in his book ''[[The God Delusion]].'' In this book, he contends that an appeal to intelligent design can provide no explanation for biology because it not only [[begs the question]] of the designer's own origin but raises additional questions: an intelligent designer must itself be far more complex and difficult to explain than anything it is capable of designing.&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt; He believes the chances of life arising on a planet like the Earth are many orders of magnitude less probable than most people would think, but the [[anthropic principle]] effectively counters skepticism with regard to improbability. For example Astronomer [[Fred Hoyle#Rejection of chemical evolution|Fred Hoyle]] suggested that potential for life on Earth was no more probable than a [[Boeing 747]] being assembled by a hurricane from the scrapyard. Dawkins argues that a one-time event is indeed subject to improbability but once under way, natural selection itself is nothing like random chance. Furthermore, he refers to his counter argument to the argument from improbability by that same name:&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt;

{{quotation|The argument from improbability is the big one. In the traditional guise of the argument from design, it is easily today's most popular argument offered in favour of the existence of God and it is seen, by an amazingly large number of theists, as completely and utterly convincing. It is indeed a very strong and, I suspect, unanswerable argument—but in precisely the opposite direction from the theist's intention. The argument from improbability, properly deployed, comes close to proving that God does ''not'' exist. My name for the statistical demonstration that God almost certainly does not exist is the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit.

The creationist misappropriation of the argument from improbability always takes the same general form, and it doesn't make any difference ... [if called] 'intelligent design' (ID). Some observed phenomenon—often a living creature or one of its more complex organs, but it could be anything from a molecule up to the universe itself—is correctly extolled as statistically improbable. Sometimes the language of information theory is used: the Darwinian is challenged to explain the source all the information in living matter, in the technical sense of information content as a measure of improbability or 'surprise value'… However statistically improbable the entity you seek to explain by invoking a designer, the designer himself has got to be at least as improbable. God is the Ultimate Boeing 747.

... The whole argument turns on the familiar question 'Who made God?'... A designer God cannot be used to explain organized complexity because any God capable of designing anything would have to be complex enough to demand the same kind of explanation in his own right. God presents an infinite regress from which he cannot help us to escape. This argument… demonstrates that God, though not technically disprovable, is very very improbable indeed.&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt;|Richard Dawkins|The God Delusion}}

Dawkins considered the argument from improbability to be "much more powerful" than the teleological argument, or argument from design, although he sometimes implies the terms are used interchangeably. He paraphrases St. Thomas' teleological argument as follows: "Things in the world, especially living things, look as though they have been designed. Nothing that we know looks designed unless it is designed. Therefore there must have been a designer, and we call him God."&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |year=2006 |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |isbn=978-0-618-68000-9 |lccn=2006015506 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA103 |pages=103, 136–138, 162–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Edward Feser]] has accused Dawkins of misunderstanding the teleological argument, particularly Aquinas' version.&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, ''The Last Superstition'', St. Augustine Press 2008, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aei.org/publication/the-new-philistinism/ | title=The New Philistinism| date=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A flawed argument===
[[George H. Smith]], in his book ''Atheism: The Case Against God'', points out what he considers to be a flaw in the argument from design:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now consider the idea that nature itself is the product of design. How could this be demonstrated? Nature… provides the basis of comparison by which we distinguish between designed objects and natural objects. We are able to infer the presence of design only to the extent that the characteristics of an object differ from natural characteristics. Therefore, to claim that nature as a whole was designed is to destroy the basis by which we differentiate between artifacts and natural objects.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, GH., ''Atheism: The Case Against God'', Prometheus Books, 2003, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Perception of purpose in biology ===
{{main|Teleology in biology}}

The [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Michael Ruse]] has argued that Darwin treated the structure of organisms as if they had a purpose: "the organism-as-if-it-were-designed-by God picture was absolutely central to Darwin's thinking in 1862, as it always had been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Darwin and Design: Does Evolution Have a Purpose? | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Ruse, Michael | year=2003 | pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to this as "the metaphor of design ... Organisms give the appearance of being designed, and thanks to Charles Darwin's discovery of natural selection we know why this is true." In his review of Ruse's book, R.J. Richards writes, "Biologists quite routinely refer to the design of organisms and their traits, but properly speaking it's ''apparent'' design to which they refer – an 'as if' design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6/articles/Richards%20on%20Ruse.pdf | title=Michael Ruse's Design for Living | author=Richards, Robert J. | journal=Journal of the History of Biology | year=2004 | volume=37 | pages=25–38 | doi=10.1023/b:hist.0000020388.99933.5b}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Foley (academic)|Robert Foley]] refers to this as "the illusion of purpose, design, and progress". He adds, "there is no purpose in a fundamentally causative manner in evolution but that the processes of selection and adaptation give the illusion of purpose through the utter functionality and designed nature of the biological world."&lt;ref&gt;Foley, RA., in Morris, SC., ''The Deep Structure of Biology: Is Convergence Sufficiently Ubiquitous to Give a Directional Signal'', Templeton Foundation Press, 2008 p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Dawkins suggests that while biology can at first seem to be purposeful and ordered, upon closer inspection its true function becomes questionable. Dawkins rejects the claim that biology serves any designed function, claiming rather that biology only mimics such purpose. In his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', Dawkins states that animals are the most complex things in the known universe: "Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose." He argues that natural selection should suffice as an explanation of biological complexity without recourse to divine provenance.&lt;ref name="Dawkins1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |year=1986 |title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-31570-7 |lccn=96229669 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;pg=PA1 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, theologian [[Alister McGrath]] has pointed out that the fine-tuning of carbon is even responsible for nature's ability to tune itself to any degree.&lt;blockquote&gt;[The entire biological] evolutionary process depends upon the unusual chemistry of carbon, which allows it to bond to itself, as well as other elements, creating highly complex molecules that are stable over prevailing terrestrial temperatures, and are capable of conveying genetic information (especially DNA). ... Whereas it might be argued that nature creates its own fine-tuning, this can only be done if the primordial constituents of the universe are such that an evolutionary process can be initiated. The unique chemistry of carbon is the ultimate foundation of the capacity of nature to tune itself.&lt;ref name="biologos.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGrath|first1=Alister E.|title=A fine-tuned universe: the quest for God in science and theology|date=2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY.|isbn=978-0664233105|page=176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of [[intelligent design]] creationism, such as [[William A. Dembski]] question the philosophical assumptions made by critics with regard to what a designer would or would not do. Dembski claims that such arguments are not merely beyond the purview of science: often they are tacitly or overtly theological while failing to provide a serious analysis of the hypothetical objective's relative merit. Some critics, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggest that any purported 'cosmic' designer would only produce optimal designs, while there are numerous biological criticisms to demonstrate that such an ideal is manifestly untenable. Against these ideas, Dembski characterizes both Dawkins' and Gould's argument as a rhetorical [[straw man]].&lt;ref name="Dembski2004"/&gt; He suggests a principle of [[constrained optimization]] more realistically describes the best any designer could hope to achieve:

{{quotation|Not knowing the objectives of the designer, Gould was in no position to say whether the designer proposed a faulty compromise among those objectives… In criticizing design, biologists tend to place a premium on functionalities of individual organisms and see design as optimal to the degree that those individual functionalities are maximized. But higher-order designs of entire ecosystems might require lower-order designs of individual organisms to fall short of maximal function.&lt;ref name="Dembski2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=William A. |last=Dembski |year=2004 |title=The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design |publisher=InterVarsity Press |isbn=978-0-8308-3216-3 |lccn=2003020589 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKVqpXqE0VwC&amp;pg=PA58 |pages=58–59, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;|William A. Dembski|[[The Design Revolution]]: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design}}

===Fideism===
[[Fideism|Fideists]] may reject attempts to prove God's existence. For example, Calvinist theologian [[Karl Barth]] held that God can be known only through Jesus Christ, as revealed in scripture[https://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/media/Documents/RS/1-3_Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God_The_cosmological_argument.pdf], and that any such attempts should be considered idolotry.

=== Other criticisms ===
The teleological argument assumes that one can infer the existence of intelligent design merely by examination, and because life is reminiscent of something a human might design, it too must have been designed. However, considering "snowflakes and crystals of certain salts", "[i]n no case do we find intelligence". "There are other ways that order and design can come about" such as by "purely physical forces".&lt;ref&gt;Cornman, JW, Lehrer, K, Pappas, GS, ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophical_Problems_and_Arguments.html?id=cRHegYZgyfUC Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction]'', Hackett Publishing, 1992, pp. 245–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design claim can be challenged as an [[argument from analogy]]. Supporters of design suggest that natural objects and man-made objects have many similar properties, and man-made objects have a designer. Therefore, it is probable that natural objects must be designed as well. However, proponents must demonstrate that all the available evidence has been taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Cornman, JW, Lehrer, K, Pappas, GS, ''Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction'', Hackett Publishing, 1992, p. 239.

&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Rust argues that, when speaking of familiar objects such as watches, "we have a basis to make an inference from such an object to its designer". However, the "universe is a unique and isolated case" and we have nothing to compare it with, so "we have no basis for making an inference such as we can with individual objects. ... We have no basis for applying to the whole universe what may hold of constituent elements in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Rust, E., ''Religion, Revelation and Reason'', Mercer University Press, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AcSw6GDlLVwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=criticism+%22teleological+argument%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nUBRU9_IJMfxPOvkgNgN&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=criticism%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;f=false 96].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most professional biologists [[Level of support for evolution#Scientific support|support]] the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]], not merely as an alternative explanation for the complexity of life but a better explanation with more supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interacademies.net/10878/13901.aspx IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution] Joint statement issued by the national science academies of 67 countries, including the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society]] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; Living organisms obey the same physical laws as inanimate objects.

==Similar discussions in other civilizations==

===Hinduism===
[[Nyaya]], the Hindu school of logic, had a version of the argument from design. P.G. Patil writes that, in this view, it is not the complexity of the world from which one can infer the existence of a creator, but the fact that "the world is made up of parts". In this context, it is the Supreme Soul, [[Ishvara]], who created all the world.

The argument is in five parts:
# The ... world ... has been constructed by an intelligent agent.
# On account of being an effect.
# Each and every effect has been constructed by an intelligent agent, just like a pot.
# And the world is an effect.
# Therefore, it has been constructed by an intelligent agent.&lt;ref&gt;Patil, PG., ''Against a Hindu God: Buddhist Philosophy of Religion in India'', Columbia University Press, 2013, Chapter 2.[https://books.google.com/books?id=z88GAfvNGH0C&amp;pg=PT65&amp;dq=buddhism+%22argument+from+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uTNVU8_fJcHT7Aa4hYGACw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhism%20%22argument%20from%20design%22&amp;f=false] In a note, the author says that the Nyaya argument has been called a "cosmo-teleological argument".&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other Hindu schools, such as [[Samkhya]], deny that the existence of God can ever be proved, because such a creator can never be perceived. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]], in his ''Dialogues on the Hindu Philosophy'', has the Samkhya speaker saying, "the existence of God cannot be established because there is no proof. ... nor can it be proved by Inference, because you cannot exhibit an analogous instance."&lt;ref&gt;Banerjea, KM., ''Dialogues on the Hindu Philosophy Comprising the Nyaya, the Sankhya, the Vedanta'', Thacker Spink, 1861, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist criticism of Hindu Nyaya logic===
[[Buddhism]] denies the existence of a creator god, and rejects the Nyaya syllogism for the teleological argument as being "logically flawed". Buddhists argue that "the 'creation' of the world cannot be shown to be analogous to the creation of a human artifact, such as a pot."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, RR., ''Is Enlightenment Possible?: Dharmakīrti and RGyal Tshab Rje on Knowledge, Rebirth, No-self and Liberation'', Snow Lion Publications, 1993, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
The 18th century German philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] once thought that [[Confucius]] was a godless man, and that "the ancient Chinese had no natural religion, since they did not know the creator of the world". However, later, Wolff changed his mind to some extent. "On Wolff's reading, Confucius's religious perspective is thus more or less the weak deistic one of Hume's Cleanthes".&lt;ref&gt;Van Norden, BW., ''Confucius and the Analects'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
The Taoist writings of the 6th century BC philosopher [[Laozi]], also known as Lao Tzu, have similarities with modern naturalist science. B. Schwartz notes that, in [[Taoism]], "The processes of nature are not guided by a teleological consciousness ... the tao [dao] is not consciously providential.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B., Quoted in Lai, K., ''An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''text publication society''' is a [[learned society]] which publishes (either as its sole function, or as a principal function) scholarly editions of old works of historical or literary interest, or archival documents. In addition to full texts, a text publication society may publish translations, [[Calendar (archives)|calendar]]s and indexes.

Members of the society (private individuals or institutions) pay an annual [[Subscription business model|subscription]], in return for which they either automatically receive a copy of each volume as it is published, or (as in the case of, for example, the [[Royal Historical Society]]) are eligible to purchase volumes at favourable members' rates. Some societies attempt to keep to a regular cycle of publishing (generally one volume per year, as in the case of the [[London Record Society]] and the [[Canterbury and York Society]]: the [[Royal Historical Society]], exceptionally, aims for two volumes per year). Others, however, publish on an irregular and occasional basis, as the completion of editorial work allows. Volumes are usually also made available for sale to non-members, but the price is invariably higher than that paid (either as the retail price or through subscriptions) by members, thereby establishing an incentive for interested parties to join. The model originated and is most commonly found in the United Kingdom, but has also been adopted in other countries. 

In the 19th century, when many of the societies were founded, they were sometimes known as '''book clubs'''. They have also been termed '''printing clubs'''.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, pp. 16, 40-45, 178-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Those that publish exclusively [[Archive|archival]] material are often known as '''record societies''' or '''records societies'''.

==Historical development==
The principle of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] publishing – that is, of funding the publication of a volume by securing multiple advance subscriptions from individuals interested in buying the final product – was first established in the 17th century, and routinely adopted during the 18th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S.L.C. |last=Clapp |title=The Beginnings of subscription publication in the seventeenth century |journal=Modern Philology |volume=29 |year=1931 |pages=199–224 |doi=10.1086/387957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=F. B. |last=Williams |chapter=Scholarly publication in Shakespeare's day: a leading case |editor1-first=James G. |editor1-last=McManaway |editor2-first=Giles E. |editor2-last=Dawson |editor3-first=Edwin E. |editor3-last=Willoughby |title=Joseph Quincy Adams: memorial studies |place=Washington, DC |publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library |year=1948 |pages=755–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of extending the model to the membership of a society was initiated by the [[Roxburghe Club]], founded in 1812 as a convivial association of [[bibliophile]]s, but which rapidly introduced the principle that each member should sponsor the publication of an edition of a rare work of interest to members, and that other volumes would be published by the Club collectively. In both cases the volumes were intended for distribution to the entire membership. The Club's first publication, donated by Sir William Bolland and issued in 1814, was the [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]]'s translation of parts of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', originally printed in 1557.

One early Roxburghe Club member (from 1822) was [[Sir Walter Scott]], who was inspired by it to establish the [[Bannatyne Club]] to print works of interest for Scottish tradition, literature and history. Other special-interest societies followed. In contrast to the exclusive Roxburghe Club (which had an elite membership and issued its publications as luxurious limited editions), most had broad membership criteria, and had as their primary objective the dissemination of valuable historical texts as widely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, their activities tended to appeal to the "monied and educated" classes: in 1838, 20% of the [[Camden Society]]'s members were clergymen, 9% held legal qualifications, and 36% were [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, pp. 43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Success being dependent on fund-raising and the attraction of new members, the early societies often suffered from financial and organisational troubles. Controversy followed [[Frederick James Furnivall]], a prime mover in many of the early ventures. In the second half of the 19th century the government-sponsored [[Rolls Series]] took over some of the territory of the amateur societies, particularly in respect of the publication of [[chronicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The productions of several of the early societies included literary texts, but by the end of the 19th century the majority of societies were tending to focus instead on the publication of [[Archive|archival]] records. This continued to be the pattern in the 20th century.

The Durham-based [[Surtees Society]], founded in 1834 and modelled in part on the Scottish Bannatyne and [[Maitland Club|Maitland]] Clubs,&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first English society to adopt a specifically ''regional'' remit, in its case the elucidation of the history of the area constituting the ancient [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Its establishment was deeply rooted in local pride: in an early prospectus, [[James Raine]] (its principal founder and first secretary) drew attention to just a few unpublished manuscripts of Durham interest, "which, in these times, few individuals would incur the risk of printing at their own cost; but which nevertheless, afford even singly, how much more collectively, the most valuable materials to those who are anxious to study rightly the History of our forefathers under its different characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. Hamilton |last=Thompson |title=The Surtees Society, 1834–1934, including a catalogue of its publications with notes on their sources and contents, and a list of the members of the society from its beginning to the present day |series=Surtees Society |volume=150 |place=Durham |year=1939 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chetham Society]], founded in 1843, concerned itself in much the same way with the counties of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]]. From the 1880s onwards, many societies focused on a single county. A particularly energetic advocate was [[William Phillimore Watts Phillimore|W. P. W. Phillimore]], who was active in the foundation of the [[British Record Society]], [[Scottish Record Society]], [[Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire|Thoroton Society]], [[Canterbury and York Society]], and Irish Record Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Kate |last=Tiller |title=Phillimore [formerly Stiff], William Phillimore Watts (1853–1913) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online  |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/57556 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several county [[archaeology|archaeological]] and historical societies undertook text publication as just one among a broader range of activities, and in certain cases – for example, the [[Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society]] and the [[Kent Archaeological Society]] – continue to do so. In other cases, a new society has broken away from its parent archaeological society to become an independent body dedicated solely to text publication: examples include the [[Surrey Record Society]] and the [[Wiltshire Record Society]].

"'''The Battle of the Books'''" is the name of a short satire written by [[Jonathan Swift]] and published as part of the [[prolegomenon|prolegomena]] to his ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'' in 1704. It depicts a literal battle between books in the [[King's Library]] (housed in [[St James's Palace]] at the time of the writing), as ideas and authors struggle for supremacy. Because of the satire, "The Battle of the Books" has become a term for the [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]].

== Ancients vs. Moderns ==
In France at the end of the seventeenth century, a minor furore arose over the question of whether contemporary learning had surpassed what was known by those in Classical Greece and Rome. The "moderns" (epitomised by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]]) took the position that the modern age of science and reason was superior to the superstitious and limited world of Greece and Rome. In his opinion, modern man saw farther than the ancients ever could. The "ancients," for their part, argued that all that is necessary to be known was still to be found in [[Virgil]], [[Cicero]], [[Homer]], and especially [[Aristotle]].

This literary contest was re-enacted in miniature in England when Sir [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] published an answer to Fontenelle entitled ''Of Ancient and Modern Learning'' in 1690. His essay introduced two [[metaphor]]s to the debate that would be reused by later authors. First, he proposed that modern man was just a dwarf standing upon the "[[Standing on the shoulders of giants|shoulders of giants]]" (that modern man saw farther because he begins with the observations and learning of the ancients). They possessed a clear view of nature, and modern man only reflected/refined their vision. These metaphors, of the dwarf/giant and the reflecting/emanative light, would show up in Swift's satire and others. Temple's essay was answered by [[Richard Bentley]], the classicist and [[William Wotton]], the critic. Temple's friends/clients, sometimes known as the "Christ Church Wits," referring to their association with [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and the guidance of [[Francis Atterbury]], then attacked the "moderns" (and Wotton in particular). The debate in England lasted only for a few years.

[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] was by that point a retired minister, the Secretary of State for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] who had conducted peace negotiations with France. As a minister, it was beneath his station to answer common and ''professional'' (known then as "hack") authors, so most of the battle took place between Temple's enemies and Temple's proxies. Notably, Jonathan Swift was not among the participants, though he was working as Temple's secretary. Therefore, it is likely that the quarrel was more of a spur to Swift's imagination than a debate that he felt inclined to enter.

== The satire ==
[[Image:Swift-Battle.jpg|thumb|Woodcut from the ''Battle''.]]
Jonathan Swift worked for William Temple during the time of the controversy, and Swift's ''A Tale of a Tub'' (1703/1705) takes part in the debate. From its first publication, Swift added a short satire entitled "The Battle of the Books" to the ''Tale of a Tub.''  In this piece, there is an epic battle fought in a library when various books come alive and attempt to settle the arguments between moderns and ancients. In Swift's satire, he skilfully manages to avoid saying which way victory fell. He portrays the manuscript as having been damaged in places, thus leaving the end of the battle up to the reader.

The battle is told with great detail to particular authors jousting with their replacements and critics. The battle is not just between Classical authors and modern authors, but also between authors and critics. The prose is a parody of heroic poetry along the lines of [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s parody of battle in ''[[Hudibras]]''.

The combat in the "Battle" is interrupted by the interpolated allegory of the spider and the bee. A spider, "swollen up to the first Magnitude, by the Destruction of infinite Numbers of Flies" resides like a castle holder above a top shelf, and a bee, flying from the natural world and drawn by curiosity, wrecks the spider's web. The spider curses the bee for clumsiness and for wrecking the work of one who is his better. The spider says that his web is his home, a stately manor, while the bee is a vagrant who goes anywhere in nature without any concern for reputation. The bee answers that he is doing the bidding of nature, aiding in the fields, while the spider's castle is merely what was drawn from its own body, which has "a good plentiful Store of Dirt and Poison."  This allegory was already somewhat old before Swift employed it, and it is a [[digression]] within the ''Battle'' proper. However, it also illustrates the theme of the whole work. The bee is like the ancients and like authors:  it gathers its materials from nature and sings its drone song in the fields.  The spider is like the moderns and like critics:  it kills the weak and then spins its web (books of criticism) from the taint of its own body digesting the viscera.

In one sense, the ''Battle of the Books'' illustrates one of the great themes that Swift would explore in ''A Tale of a Tub'':  the madness of pride involved in believing one's own age to be supreme and the inferiority of derivative works.  One of the attacks in the ''Tale'' was on those who believe that being ''readers'' of works makes them the equals of the ''creators'' of works.  The other satire Swift affixed to the ''Tale'', "The Mechanical Operation of the Spirit," illustrates the other theme:  an inversion of the figurative and literal as a part of madness.

==Reuse of the trope==
Swift's ''Battle'' owed a great deal to [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s ''Le Lutrin,'' although it was not a translation. Instead, it was an English work based on the same premise. However, [[John Ozell]] attempted to answer Swift with his translation of ''Le Lutrin,'' where the battle sees Tory authors skewered by Whigs. This prompted a satire of Ozell by Swift and by [[Alexander Pope]]. Further, other "battles of the books" appeared after Swift's. Often, these were merely political attacks, as in the later ''Battel of the Poets'' (1729, by Edward Cooke), which was an attack on Alexander Pope. As a set piece or ''topos'' of 18th-century satire, the "Battle of the Books" was a standard shorthand for both the Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns and the era of Swift's battle with William Wotton.

The Book Thing was incorporated by a board of neighborhood volunteers. The Book Thing is open on weekends and is run by around 30 volunteers.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

On March 2, 2016, a fire broke out in the early morning, which was extinguished by the Baltimore Fire Department. The fire, which was confined to one room of the warehouse, did not destroy all the contents, but ruined approximately one-third of the books stored there; other rooms suffered smoke and soot deposition only. The Book Thing ceased accepting new book donations, but continues to accept monetary donations via their website. Volunteers assisted with cleanup of books both for disposal and for distribution the following Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jessica|title=Volunteers begin cleanup at The Book Thing|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-book-thing-update-20160305-story.html|accessdate=7 March 2016|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a period of cash donations, fundraisers, and new books, the place was reopened in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Hartman |date=November 10, 2017 |title=After fire, locals donate thousands of books to charity in Maryland |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-book-thing-baltimore-locals-donate-thousands-of-books/ |website=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=November 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The British Edda''''' is a [[1930 in literature|1930]] English, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Egypt]]ian [[linguistics]] and [[mythology]] book written by [[Laurence Waddell]] about the adventures of [[El (deity)|El]], [[Wodan]] and [[Loki]] forming an [[Eden Triad]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]. It also references [[Thor]] and [[King Arthur]] having adventures in Eden.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite book |title=The rise of man in the gardens of Sumeria: a biography of L.A.

==Background==

===Cover===
The spine of the book features a [[swastika]] "imprinted in gold color". The swastika was chosen because of it being a "Sun-cult symbol to the Phoenicians and Hittites", two subjects covered in the book.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; The front of the book features an image of the [[Snake Goddess]] from the Boston Goddess collection. According to Waddell the statuette was first created in 2700 B.C. as an example of "Eve or Ifo, Gunn-Ifo or Guen-Ever, as Serpent-Priestess of Eden before marriage with King Her-Thor, Arthur, or Adam". He also stated his belief that the Snake Goddess was from a representation of "prototypes" from Sumerian and Hittite gods, rather than from [[Crete]] as is commonly thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mysteries of the snake goddess: art, desire, and the forging of history |last=Lapatin |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=84–85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrJMse9cbYAC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22British+Edda%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iogdT4beEMTC2wW1ivn7Cw&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22British%20Edda%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title===
The title of the book, ''The British Edda'', was chosen because of Waddell's belief that the work upon which his translation was based, the [[Elder Edda]], was mistakenly believed by many to be written in [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]].&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; Waddell, meanwhile, objected to this, explaining that the language had been found to be from an [[Iceland]]ic family that had originally come from Scotland. Due to this, Waddell used the word British in the title to emphasize where the Elder Edda had come from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The islands of Scotland: Hebrides, Orkneys, and Shetlands |last=MacDiarmid |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh MacDiarmid |coauthors= |year=1939 |publisher=[[Anova Books|B.

Waddell also went on to state that many other Eddic poems had been written in the [[British Isles]] before and up to the 6th century, but that most of them had been eradicated in the 11th century by Christian missionaries, contributing to the confusion.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

==Content==
One of the subjects discussed in ''The British Edda'' is the "genesis of civilization", which, as stated by Waddell, was commonly believed in the "pagan days" in Britain to be in "Cappadocia and Eden", but was very broad due to the lack of knowledge about the region beyond mere stories and also no knowledge of specific place names. This oral tradition of stories was written down on "parchment by 'the Learned'", composed into what is known as the ''Elder Edda''. Waddell also explained that other works that copied down the stories were made, but all of these had been destroyed by Christian missionaries in Britain, leaving only the one work. These stories returned to the common populace in the 12th century by being melded into the "[[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]]", while the original sources of [[Cappadocia]], the [[Trojan people|Trojans]], and [[Sumerian people|Sumeria]] were lost.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Waddell's writings on the origins of civilization would soon after influence the poetry of [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] from 1937 on, impressing on him the belief that the "original impetus to civilization was an Ur-Gaelic initiative". This belief was later incorporated into his poems, such as in ''The Fingers of Baal Contract in the Communist Salute''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=MacDiarmid: Christopher Murray Grieve, a critical biography |last=Bold |first=Alan Norman |authorlink=Alan Bold |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]] |location= |isbn= |page=348 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58kw1l8MYjEC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=%22British+Edda%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iogdT4beEMTC2wW1ivn7Cw&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22British%20Edda%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hugh MacDiarmid, the poetry of self |last=Baglow |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's Press]] |location= |isbn= |page=112 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UZr8kVYtOYC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22British+Edda%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iogdT4beEMTC2wW1ivn7Cw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22British%20Edda%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two letters [[Charles Olson]] wrote to Frances Boldereff in July 1950, Olson discussed Waddell's works and specifically commented on ''The British Edda'', stating that, in it, Waddell "dances all over this thing, like some damned witch doctor, trying to squeeze out the old and lost history", referring to the discussion in the book on how the Sumerians were the origination of civilization. ''The British Edda'' and one of Waddell's other works, ''The Makers of Civilization in Race and History'', would go on to inspire Olson's essay titled "The Gate and the Center".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Charles Olson's reading: a biography |last=Maud |first=Ralph |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=[[SIU Press]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=83–84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGwzzm6q-0gC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22British+Edda%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yo4dT4aRKOahsgLY3bisCw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22British%20Edda%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Storming of the Winter Palace''''' was a 1920 [[Spectacle|mass spectacle]], based on historical events that took place in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] during the 1917 [[October Revolution]].
[[File:Stormningen av vinterpalatset.jpg|thumb|Heavily retouched scene from the spectacle of 1920. This photograph was presented from 1922 on in many publications as an authentic depiction of the events, both in Russia and internationally.]]
Taking place on the third anniversary of the revolution, it was directed by [[Nikolai Evreinov]] and was subtitled a "mass action." The sets were designed by [[Yuri Annenkov]]. The spectacle was staged outside the former Tsarist [[Winter Palace]] where the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] was meeting at the time of the [[Bolshevik]] revolution. Its performers included 125 ballet dancers, 100 circus people, 1,750 supernumeraries and students, 200 women, 260 secondary actors, and 150 assistants. There were also tanks and armoured cars involved.

The mass spectacle form took the pre-revolutionary [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] utopias of "ritual theatre" (whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 revolution]]), and recast their "people" as the [[proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleberg (1980, 44-64).&lt;/ref&gt; Performed on 7 November before 100,000 spectators, the action begins with the [[February Revolution]], follows the gradual organization of the workers (on a [[Red Army|red stage]] to the left, with [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] and the Provisional Government on a [[White movement|white stage]] to the right), until they are illuminated fully by searchlights, and crying "[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], Lenin" charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the "Whites." Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape, and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets, to the Palace. Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace, until the Red Army is finally successful, and red lights flash out. A cannon fired from the cruiser ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]'' and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution. 

==Influence==

Evreinov's dramatic creation was extremely influential in the commemoration of the deposition of the Provisional Government, which in reality took place at night and was much less dramatic than depicted either in Evreinov's spectacle or in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s feature film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' (1927). One of the over 100 surviving photographs from the spectacle, pictured above, was presented from 1922 on in many Soviet and also foreign publications as an authentic image from the events of 1917. For this purpose, the picture was heavily [[Photo manipulation|retouched]], with the spectators on the right and a tower-like construction for directing the participants removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturstiftung-des-bundes.de/cms/de/mediathek/magazin/magazin28/sasse/index.html Sylvia Sasse: Retusche=Attacke. Oder: Wie Geschichte durch Theater repariert wurde. ''Kulturstiftung des Bundes. Das Magazin #28. 2017/2.]&lt;/ref&gt; The image is sometimes also misinterpreted as a [[film still]] from ''October'', though the "storming" in the film is set (historically correctly) at night, not during the day as in the photograph.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10105">[[File:SirTheodoreDeMayerne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sir Théodore de Mayerne]]
'''Sir Théodore Turquet de Mayerne''' (28 September 1573 &amp;ndash; 22 March 1655) was a  [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]]-born physician who treated kings of France and England and advanced the theories of [[Paracelsus]].
==The Young Doctor==
Mayerne was born in a [[Huguenot]] family in [[Geneve]], Republic of Geneva. His father was a [[Huguenot|Protestant French]] historian who had fled [[Lyon]] following the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] and his godfather was [[Theodore Beza]]. Mayerne's first wife was Marguerite de Boetslaer and they had three children.

Mayerne studied first in [[Geneve]] and later moved to the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Later he moved to [[Montpellier]] to study [[medicine]], graduated 1596 and received his doctorate in 1597. His dissertation defended the use of chemical remedies in medicine, under the guidance of [[Joseph du Chesne]]; this was the first intimation of his interest in Paracelsian theories. In May 1599, Mayerne joined [[Henri de Rohan]], a Huguenot nobleman very powerful in Brittany, on his grand tour of Europe, visiting Germany, Italy, Bohemia, the Netherlands, England, and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; During their visit to London in October 1600, Rohan and Mayerne were received by Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court, and in November 1600, when they reached [[Edinburgh]], they were received by King [[James VI]], before returning to France in early 1601.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his austere Calvinism, Mayerne greatly admired the many works of art and architecture he saw in his travels in Germany and Italy, especially liking the paintings of [[Albrecht Dürer]] and the ''[[Kunstkammer]]'' in Munich of curios kept by the [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Paris Years==
Mayerne moved to Paris, lecturer on [[anatomy]] and [[pharmacy]] and founded a [[medical practice]]. By that time he had begun to support the views of Paracelsus and used many chemical remedies. He kept detailed notes about his patients, among them Armand du Plessis, later [[Cardinal Richelieu]], whom he treated for [[gonorrhea]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600 French [[royal physician]] [[Jean Ribit de la Rivière]] (1571–1605) sponsored him to become one of the personal physicians, physician in ordinary, of the king [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, « Paris, 1598 - 1601 »&lt;/ref&gt; His other pursuits were thwarted because he was not a Catholic and because most French physicians still followed the principles of [[Galen]]. In 1603 he tried to support his views to Medical Faculty of Paris, stating that his views were not opposed to Galenic and [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] principles.

Despite their opposition, he retained the favour of the King, who appointed him to travel with the [[Henri, Duc de Rohan|Duc de Rohan]] in his diplomatic missions to Germany and Italy. When the King intended to make Mayerne his first physician, the queen opposed the decision because Mayerne refused to convert to Catholicism. Mayerne continued in his lower post until 1606 when he sold it to another physician.

At this time he continued his association with du Chesne and the circle of [[Hermeticists]] that had grown up around him. These devotees of Paracelsus believed they were reviving the wisdom of the mythical pre-[[Platonism|Platonic]] natural philosophers - men known as the ''prisci theologi'' that included [[Zoroaster]] and [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. The [[alchemical]] nature of their experiments was greatly resented by Galenists at the [[University of Paris]].

In the same year he briefly visited England by invitation and met [[James I of England|James I]]. He became a physician of [[Anne of Denmark]] and was incorporated at [[Oxford]] on April 8, 1606. He probably spent the following years back in France.

==Life in England==
When Henri IV was murdered in 1610, Mayerne moved to England, again by invitation. In 1611 he became first physician of James I and his queen and also treated most members of the royal court, including Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. His inability to successfully treat those two individuals, together with his closeness to the scandal surrounding the murder of [[Thomas Overbury|Sir Thomas Overbury]] coloured his first years in England. Nevertheless, he was sometimes sent on diplomatic missions to France.

In 1616 Mayerne was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. He helped the [[Society of Apothecaries]] to obtain a [[royal charter]] separate from the Grocers and helped to found the [[Company of Distillers]]. King [[knighthood|knighted]] him in 1624. Next year he briefly visited Switzerland, where he had become Baron [[Aubonne, Switzerland|Aubonne]]. Mayerne retained his post as a first physician after the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625.

He successfully championed the effort to produce the first official [[pharmacopoeia]], which would specify treatments that [[apothecaries]] should provide for specific ailments. In this he included chemical remedies, which were easier to introduce in Protestant England than in Catholic France.

In 1628 his wife died and in 1630 he married Elizabeth Joachimi. They had five children but only one daughter survived. At about this time he treated [[Oliver Cromwell]] for a variety of physical and emotional symptoms, including a severe depression. In response to [[the Plague of 1630]], he suggested the institution of a centralized 'Office of Health', with free royal hospitals, trained officials, and regulatory power.

During the [[English Civil War]] Mayerne kept a low profile in his practice in London and retained the favour of the parliament. After the [[execution of Charles I]] in 1649, he became nominal physician to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] but soon retired to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].

Mayerne died at Chelsea on 22 March 1654 or 1655. He was buried in [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] with most of his family and his godson Sir Theodore des Vaux sponsored a monument for him. Des Vaux later published Mayerne's medical notes in the book ''Praxis Medica'' in 1690.

==Legacy==

Mayerne compiled the so-called 'de Mayerne manuscript' between 1620 and 1646 based on conversations with painters (and others). The manuscript includes contributions from [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Daniël Mijtens|Mytens]], [[Paul van Somer I|Paul van Somer]], and [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen|Cornelius Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/cornelis-jonson-van-ceulen-i-portrait-of-5666153-details.aspx?pos=3&amp;intObjectID=5666153&amp;sid=&amp;page=4 Christies Auction Catalogue; lot notes, lot 45]&lt;/ref&gt; His estate included copious amount of medical manuscripts, including detailed notes about his patients, most of it in Latin and French; his patients ranged from [[John Donne]] to [[Oliver Cromwell]]. His papers are kept in the [[Royal College of Physicians]].

His influence on the administration of medicine - including the first suggestion of [[socialized medicine]] in England, and the standardisation of chemical cures, has been widely recognised.

His 'Paracelsian' outlook, which viewed the world as 'abounding in chemical secrets waiting to be exploited', led him to devise projects to enhance Scottish coal mines, to reopen lead mines in Europe and to monopolize oyster beds. He made [[chemistry|chemical]] and physical experiments, created [[pigment]]s and [[cosmetics]], introduced [[calomel]] to medical use and created ''black-wash'' (lotio nigra). It also led him to an interest in cooking, and he grew obese in later years.

In 1634, he wrote the introduction for and edited one of the first treatises ever published on Insects (usually attributed to [[Thomas Muffet]]), under the title ''Insectorum, sive minimorum animalium Theatrum: Olim ab Edoardo Wottono, Conrado Gesnero, Thomaque Pennio inchoatum: Tandem Tho. Moufeti Londinâtis operâ sumptibusque maximis concinnatum, auctum, perfectum: Et ad vivum expressis Iconibus suprà quingentis illustratum. Londini ex Officinâ typographicâ Thom. Cotes. Et venales extant apud Benjam. Allen, in diverticulo, quod Anglicè dicitur Popes-head Alley.''

== Evolution of transgender terminology ==
Psychiatrist John F. Oliven of [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University]] coined the term ''transgender'' in his 1965 reference work ''Sexual Hygiene and Pathology'', writing that the term which had previously been used, ''[[transsexual]]ism'', "is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism' is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000441-196508000-00054 |title=Sexual Hygiene and Pathology |journal=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences |volume=250 |issue=2 |pages=235 |year=1965 |last1=Oliven |first1=John F. }}: "Where the compulsive urge reaches beyond female vestments, and becomes an urge for gender ("sex") change, transvestism becomes "transsexualism." The term is misleading; actually, "transgenderism" is what is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism.

The term ''transsexual'' was introduced to English in 1949 by [[David Oliver Cauldwell]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld]] coined the German term "Transsexualismus" in 1923, which Cauldwell translated into English.&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by [[Harry Benjamin]] in 1966, around the same time ''transgender'' was coined and began to be popularized.&lt;ref name="Bevan" /&gt; Since the 1990s, ''transsexual'' has generally been used to describe the subset of ''transgender'' people&lt;ref name="Bevan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TR2006"&gt;''Transgender Rights'' (2006, {{ISBN|0-8166-4312-1}}), edited by Paisley Currah, Richard M.

Alegria, ''Transgender identity and health care: Implications for psychosocial and physical evaluation'', in the ''Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners'', volume 23, issue 4 (2011), pages 175–182: "Transgender, Umbrella term for persons who do not conform to gender norms in their identity and/or behavior (Meyerowitz, 2002). Transsexual, Subset of transgenderism; persons who feel discordance between natal sex and identity (Meyerowitz, 2002)."&lt;/ref&gt; who desire to transition permanently to the gender with which they identify and who seek medical assistance (for example, [[sex reassignment surgery]]) with this. However, the concerns of the two groups are sometimes different; for example, transsexual men and women who can pay for medical treatments (or who have institutional coverage for their treatment) are likely to be concerned with [[medical privacy]] and establishing a durable legal status as their gender later in life.

Distinctions between the terms ''transgender'' and ''transsexual'' are commonly based on [[Sex and gender distinction|distinctions between ''gender'' (psychological, social) and ''sex'' (physical)]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Virginia Prince]] used ''transgender'' to distinguish cross-dressers from trans''sexual'' people ({{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/prince_vc.html |title=glbtq &gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Prince, Virginia Charles |publisher=glbtq.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211063223/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/prince_vc.html |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}), writing in ''Men Who Choose to Be Women'' (in ''Sexology'', February 1969) that "I, at least, know the difference between sex and gender and have simply elected to change the latter and not the former."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=81336 |title=Sex -- Medical Definition |publisher=medilexicon.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012037/http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=81336 |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}: defines sex as a biological or physiological quality, while gender is a (psychological) "category to which an individual is assigned by self or others...".&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, transsexuality may be said to deal more with physical aspects of one's sex, while transgender considerations deal more with one's psychological gender disposition or predisposition, as well as the related social expectations that may accompany a given gender role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.uncw.edu/etd/2006/swanstromn/novaswanstrom.pdf UNCW: Developing and Implementing a Scale to Assess Attitudes Regarding Transsexuality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221213319/http://dl.uncw.edu/etd/2006/swanstromn/novaswanstrom.pdf |date=2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many transgender people prefer the designation ''transgender'' and reject ''transsexual''.&lt;ref name="Polly"&gt;R Polly, J Nicole, ''Understanding the transsexual patient: culturally sensitive care in emergency nursing practice'', in the ''[[Advanced Emergency Nursing Journal]]'' (2011): "The use of terminology by transsexual individuals to self-identify varies.

In his 2007 book ''Transgender, an Ethnography of a Category'', anthropologist David Valentine asserts that ''transgender'' was coined and used by activists to include many people who do not necessarily identify with the term and states that people who do not identify with the term ''transgender'' should not be included in the transgender spectrum.&lt;ref name="Valentine" /&gt; [[Leslie Feinberg]] likewise asserts that ''transgender'' is not a self-identifier (for some people) but a category imposed by observers to understand other people.&lt;ref name="Stryker" /&gt; However, these assertions are contested by the Transgender Health Program (THP) at Fenway Health in Boston. It notes that there are no universally-accepted definitions, and terminology confusion is common because terms that were popular in at the turn of the 21st century may now be deemed offensive. The THP recommends that clinicians ask clients what terminology they prefer, and avoid the term ''transsexual'' unless they are sure that a client is comfortable with it.&lt;ref name="Fenway Health Glossary" /&gt;

[[Harry Benjamin]] invented a classification system for transsexuals and transvestites, called the [[Sex Orientation Scale]] (SOS), in which he assigned transsexuals and transvestites to one of six categories based on their reasons for cross-dressing and the relative urgency of their need (if any) for sex reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="benjaminscale"&gt;Benjamin, H. (1966). ''The transsexual phenomenon''. New York: Julian Press, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin considered a moderate intensity "true transsexual" to need either [[estrogen]] or [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] as a "substitute for or preliminary to operation";&lt;ref name="benjaminscale" /&gt; people who meet Benjamin's definition of a "true transsexual" but do not desire SRS include [[Miriam (entertainer)|Miriam Rivera]].

== Other categories ==
In addition to trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex, and who form the core of the ''transgender'' umbrella, being included in even the narrowest definitions of it, several other groups are included in broader definitions of the term. These include people whose gender identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine but may, for example, be [[androgynous]], [[bigender]], [[pangender]], or [[agender]]—often grouped under the alternative umbrella term ''[[genderqueer]]''&lt;ref name="Bilodeau" /&gt;—and [[third-gender]] people (alternatively, some references and some societies conceptualize transgender people as a third gender).&lt;ref name="Stryker3G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chrisler" /&gt; Although some references define ''transgender'' very broadly to include [[transvestism|transvestite]]s / [[cross-dressing|cross-dresser]]s,&lt;ref name="ReisnerEtAl" /&gt; they are usually excluded, as are [[transvestic fetishism|transvestic fetish]]ists (because they are considered to be expressing a [[paraphilia]] rather than a gender identification) and [[drag kings]] and [[drag queens]] (who are performers and cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining).

=== Drag kings and queens ===
{{See also|Drag king|Drag queen|Faux queen}}
''[[Drag (clothing)|Drag]]'' is a term applied to clothing and makeup worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. Drag performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by [[second-wave feminism]]. Drag artists have a long tradition in [[LGBT culture]]. Generally the term ''[[drag queen]]'' covers men doing female drag, ''[[drag king]]'' covers women doing male drag, and ''[[faux queen]]'' covers women doing female drag. Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community have embraced the pornographically-derived term ''tranny'' to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing; however, this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bilerico.com/2008/09/is_tranny_offensive.php |title=Is 'Tranny' Offensive? |work=The Bilerico Project |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213214/http://www.bilerico.com/2008/09/is_tranny_offensive.php |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersex ===
{{main|Intersex}}
[[Intersex]] people have genitalia or other physical sex characteristics that do not conform to strict definitions of male or female, but intersex people are not necessarily transgender because they do not necessarily disagree with their assigned sex. Transgender and intersex issues often overlap, however, because they may both challenge rigid definitions of sex and gender.

Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender, throughout history the [[LGBT|gay, lesbian, and bisexual]] subculture was often the only place where gender-variant people were socially accepted in the [[gender role]] they felt they belonged to; especially during the time when legal or medical [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] was almost impossible. This acceptance has had a complex history. Like the wider world, the gay community in Western societies did not generally distinguish between sex and [[gender identity]] until the 1970s, and often perceived gender-variant people more as homosexuals who behaved in a gender-variant way than as gender-variant people in their own right. Today, members of the transgender community often continue to struggle to remain part of the same movement as lesbian, gay, and bisexual people and to be included in rights protections. In addition, the role of the transgender community in the history of LGBT rights is often overlooked, as shown in Transforming History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Retro Report |title=Transforming History |url=http://www.retroreport.org/video/transforming-history/ |website=Retro Report |publisher=Retro Report |accessdate=15 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710160835/http://www.retroreport.org/video/transforming-history/ |archivedate=10 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual orientation of transgender people ===
In 2015, the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]] conducted a National Transgender Discrimination Survey. Of the 27,715 transgender and [[genderqueer|non-binary]] people who took the survey, 21% said the term "queer" best described their sexual orientation, 18% said "pansexual", 16% said "gay", "lesbian", or "same-gender-loving", 15% said "straight", 14% said "bisexual", and 10% said "asexual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey |url=http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF |website=National Center for Transgender Equality |accessdate=6 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209150153/http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF |archivedate=9 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental healthcare ===
Most mental health professionals recommend therapy for internal conflicts about gender identity or discomfort in an assigned gender role, especially if one desires to [[transitioning (transgender)|transition]]. People who experience discord between their gender and the expectations of others or whose gender identity conflicts with their body may benefit by talking through their feelings in depth; however, research on gender identity with regard to psychology, and scientific understanding of the phenomenon and its related issues, is relatively new.&lt;ref name="Brown&amp;Rounsley"&gt;Brown, M.L. &amp; Rounsley, C.A. (1996) ''True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism&amp;nbsp;– For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionals'' Jossey-Bass: San Francisco {{ISBN|0-7879-6702-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''transsexualism'', ''dual-role transvestism'', ''[[gender identity disorder]] in adolescents or adults,'' and ''gender identity disorder not otherwise specified'' are listed as such in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD)]] by the [[WHO]] or the American [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM)]] under codes F64.0, F64.1, 302.85, and 302.6 respectively.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV"&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of the diagnosis and its presence in the forthcoming ICD-11 is debated.

The ''[[DSM-5]]'' refers to the topic as ''[[gender dysphoria]]'' while reinforcing the idea that being transgender is not considered a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garloch|first1=Karen|title=What it means to be transgender: Answers to 5 key questions|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/health-family/article76580862.html|accessdate=18 December 2016|publisher=Charlotte Observer|date=9 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220182205/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/health-family/article76580862.html|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) "only if [being transgender] causes distress or disability."&lt;ref name="apatransgenderanswersdisorder"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/sexuality/transgender.aspx Answers to Your Questions About Transgender Individuals and Gender Identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615045832/http://apa.org/topics/sexuality/transgender.aspx |date=2010-06-15 }} report from the website of the American Psychological Association - "Is being transgender a mental disorder?"&lt;/ref&gt; This distress is referred to as ''gender dysphoria'' and may manifest as depression or inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that transgender people suffer from GID; this misinterpretation has greatly confused transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing inner frustration or impairing their functioning do not suffer from GID. Moreover, GID is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through therapy or transitioning.  Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviors of such others as legal entities does not indicate GID. GID does not imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GID is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but not always, consists of undergoing a [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]].&lt;ref name="Brown&amp;Rounsley" /&gt;

Clinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this population of individuals.&lt;ref name="L. Carroll, P.J. Gilroy, and J. Ryan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carroll |first1=L. |last2=Gilroy |first2=P.J. |last3=Ryan |first3=J. |title=Transgender issues in counselor education |journal=Counselor Education and Supervision |year=2002 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=233–242 |doi=10.1002/j.1556-6978.2002.tb01286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mental healthcare providers know little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these professionals often educate the professional without receiving help.&lt;ref name="Brown&amp;Rounsley" /&gt; Many therapists who profess to know about transgender issues believe that transitioning from one sex to another{{spaced ndash}}the standard transsexual model{{spaced ndash}}is the best or only solution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is not the solution for other transgender people, particularly [[genderqueer]] people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead, therapists can support their clients in whatever steps they choose to take to transition or can support their decision not to transition while also addressing their clients' sense of congruence between gender identity and appearance.&lt;ref name="10.1177/0361684312442161" /&gt;

Acknowledgment of the lack of clinical training has increased; however, research on the specific problems faced by the transgender community in mental health has focused on diagnosis and clinicians' experiences instead of transgender clients' experiences.&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benson |first1=Kristen E |title=Seeking support: Transgender client experiences with mental health services |journal=Journal of Feminist Family Therapy |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=17–40 |doi=10.1080/08952833.2013.755081 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08952833.2013.755081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy was not always sought by transgender people due to mental health needs. Prior to the seventh version of the [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SOC), an individual had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder in order to proceed with hormone treatments or sexual reassignment surgery.  The new version decreased the focus on diagnosis and instead emphasized the importance of flexibility in order to meet the diverse health care needs of transsexual, transgender, and all gender-nonconforming people.&lt;ref name=SOC&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people—7th version |url=http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care%20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH.pdf |website=The World Professional Association for Transgender Health |accessdate=30 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303035205/http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care%20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for seeking mental health services vary according to the individual. A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of dealing with stigma and experiencing [[transphobia]] pushes many transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life, as one trans woman reflected: "Transgendered individuals are going to come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do, specifically, with being transgendered. It has to do because they've had to hide, they've had to lie, and they've felt all of this guilt and shame, unfortunately usually for years!"&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson" /&gt; Many transgender people also seek mental health treatment for depression and anxiety caused by the stigma attached to being transgender, and some transgender people have stressed the importance of acknowledging their gender identity with a therapist in order to discuss other quality-of-life issues.&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson" /&gt; Others regret having undergone the procedure and wish to [[detransition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Problems still remain surrounding misinformation about transgender issues that hurt transgender people's mental health experiences. One trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training: "Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe that's it. I don’t think I've had any formal training just going through [clinical] programs . . . I don’t think most [therapists] know. Most therapists—Master's degree, PhD level—they've had . . . one diversity class on GLBT issues. One class out of the huge diversity training. One class. And it was probably mostly about gay lifestyle."&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson" /&gt; Many health insurance policies do not cover treatment associated with gender transition, and numerous people are under- or uninsured, which raises concerns about the insufficient training most therapists receive prior to working with transgender clients, potentially increasing financial strain on clients without providing the treatment they need.&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson" /&gt;  Many clinicians who work with transgender clients only receive mediocre training on gender identity, but introductory training on interacting with transgender people has recently been made available to health care professionals to help remove barriers and increase the level of service for the transgender population.&lt;ref name="Hanssman, Morrison, &amp; Russian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanssmann |first1=C. |last2=Morrison |first2=D. |last3=Russian |first3=E. |title=Talking, gawking, or getting it done: Providing trainings to increase cultural and clinical competence for transgender and gender-nonconforming patients and clients |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=5–23 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2008.5.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues around psychological classifications and associated stigma (whether based in paraphilia or not) of cross-dressers, transsexual men and women (and lesbian and gay children, who may resemble trans children early in life) have become more complex since [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health|CAMH]] (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) colleagues [[Kenneth Zucker]] and [[Ray Blanchard]] were announced to be serving on the [[DSM-V]]'s Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2008NewsReleases/dsmwg.aspx Newsroom | APA DSM-5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927024218/http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2008NewsReleases/dsmwg.aspx |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMH aims to "cure" transgender people of their "disorder", especially in children.

The acronyms "[[Gender reassignment surgery|GRS]]" and "[[Sex reassignment surgery|SRS]]" refer to genital surgery. The term "[[sex reassignment therapy]]" (SRT) is used as an umbrella term for physical procedures required for [[Transgender transition|transition]].

The bill also added "gender identity and expression" to the list of aggravating factors in sentencing, where the accused commits a criminal offence against an individual because of those personal characteristics. Similar transgender laws also exist in all the provinces and territories.

{{quote|Non-recognition of the identity of Hijras/transgender persons denies them equal protection of law, thereby leaving them extremely vulnerable to harassment, violence and sexual assault in public spaces, at home and in jail, also by the police. Sexual assault, including molestation, rape, forced anal and oral sex, gang rape and stripping is being committed with impunity and there are reliable statistics and materials to support such activities. Further, non-recognition of identity of Hijras /transgender persons results in them facing extreme discrimination in all spheres of society, especially in the field of employment, education, healthcare etc.}}

Hijras/transgender persons face huge discrimination in access to public spaces like restaurants, cinemas, shops, malls etc. Further, access to public toilets is also a serious problem they face quite often. Since there are no separate toilet facilities for Hijras/transgender persons, they have to use male toilets where they are prone to sexual assault and harassment. Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity, therefore, impairs equality before law and equal protection of law and violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

{{Main|Feminist views on transgender and transsexual people|Transfeminism}}

Some feminists and feminist groups are supportive of transgender people. Others are not. Though [[second-wave feminism]] argued for the [[sex and gender distinction]], some feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Many transgender feminists, however, view themselves as contributing to feminism by questioning and subverting gender norms. [[Third wave feminism|Third-wave]] and contemporary feminism are generally more supportive of transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hines |first1=Sally |title=TransForming Gender: Transgender Practices of Identity, Intimacy and Care |date=2007 |publisher=Policy Press |location=Bristol |isbn=1861349165 |pages=85–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America ===
In Latin American cultures, a [[travesti]] is a person who has been assigned male at birth and who has a feminine, transfeminine, or "femme" gender identity. Travestis generally undergo hormonal treatment, use female gender expression including new names and pronouns from the masculine ones they were given when assigned a sex, and might use breast implants, but they are not offered or do not desire sex-reassignment surgery. Travesti might be regarded as a gender in itself (a "third gender"), a mix between man and woman ("intergender/androgynes"), or the presence of both masculine and feminine identities in a single person ("bigender"). They are framed as something entirely separate from transgender women, who possess the same gender identity of people assigned female at birth.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Other transgender identities are becoming more widely known, as a result of contact with other cultures of the Western world.&lt;ref name="folha"&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/1231466-a-nova-geracao-gay-nas-universidades-dos-eua.shtml A nova geração gay nas Universidades dos EUA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222013956/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/1231466-a-nova-geracao-gay-nas-universidades-dos-eua.shtml |date=2014-02-22 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These newer identities, sometimes known under the umbrella use of the term "genderqueer",&lt;ref name="folha" /&gt; along with the older ''travesti'' term, are known as non-binary and go along with binary transgender identities (those traditionally diagnosed under the now obsolete label of "transsexualism") under the single umbrella of ''transgender'', but are distinguished from cross-dressers and drag queens and kings, that are held as nonconforming gender expressions rather than transgender gender identities when a distinction is made.

Deviating from the societal standards for sexual behavior, sexual orientation/identity, gender identity, and gender expression have a single umbrella term that is known as ''sexodiverso'' or ''sexodiversa'' in both Spanish and Portuguese, with its most approximate translation to English being "queer".

Among the ancient Middle Eastern [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] people, a ''salzikrum'' was a person who appeared biologically female but had distinct male traits. ''Salzikrum'' is a compound word meaning ''male daughter.'' According to the [[Code of Hammurabi]], ''salzikrūm'' had inheritance rights like that of priestesses; they inherited from their fathers, unlike regular daughters. A ''salzikrum's'' father could also stipulate that she inherit a certain amount.&lt;ref&gt;Code of Hammurabi §&amp;nbsp;178 and following, and §&amp;nbsp;184 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;

As more transgender people are represented and included within the realm of mass culture, the stigma that is associated with being transgender can influence the decisions, ideas, and thoughts based upon it. Media representation, [[culture industry]], and [[Social exclusion|social marginalization]] all hint at popular culture standards and the applicability and significance to mass culture as well. These terms play an important role in the formation of notions for those who have little recognition or knowledge of transgender people. Media depictions represent only a minuscule spectrum of the transgender group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=MTV to launch new channel for gay viewers in 2005&amp;nbsp;– May. 25, 2004 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/25/news/fortune500/mtv_gay_network |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2015-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211113528/http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/25/news/fortune500/mtv_gay_network/ |archivedate=2015-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which essentially conveys that those that are shown are the only interpretations and ideas society has of them.

=== Transgender Awareness Week ===
{{Main|Transgender Awareness Week}}
'''Transgender Awareness Week''', typically observed the second week of November, is a one-week celebration leading up to [[Transgender Day of Remembrance]]. The purpose of Transgender Awareness Week is to educate about transgender and gender non-conforming people and the issues associated with their transition or identity.

=== Transgender Day of Remembrance ===
{{Main|Transgender Day of Remembrance}}
'''Transgender Day of Remembrance''' (TDOR) is held every year on November 20 in honor of Rita Hester, who was killed on November 28, 1998, in an anti-transgender hate crime. TDOR serves a number of purposes:
* it memorializes all of those who have been victims of hate crimes and prejudice,
* it raises awareness about hate crimes towards the transgender community,
* and it honors the dead and their relatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transgenderdor.org/?page_id=4 |title=About TDOR at Transgender Day of Remembrance |publisher=Transgenderdor.org |date=1998-11-28 |accessdate=2011-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723151936/http://www.transgenderdor.org/?page_id=4 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trans March ===
{{Main|Trans March}}
'''Trans March''' describes annual marches, protests or gatherings that take place around the world, often taking place during the time of the local pride week. These events are frequently organized by transgender communities to build community, address human rights struggles, and create visibility.

== Pride symbols ==
{{Main||Transgender flags|LGBT symbols#Gender symbols}}
[[File:Transgender Pride flag.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|Transgender Pride flag]]

A common symbol for the transgender community is the [[Transgender flags#Transgender Pride flag|Transgender Pride flag]], which was designed by the American transgender woman Monica Helms in 1999, and was first shown at a pride parade in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States in 2000.

The flag consists of five horizontal stripes, two light blue, two pink, with a white stripe in the center.

Helms describes the meaning of the flag as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The light blue is the traditional color for baby boys, pink is for girls, and the white in the middle is for "those who are transitioning, those who feel they have a neutral gender or no gender", and those who are [[Intersexuality|intersex]]. The pattern is such that "no matter which way you fly it, it will always be correct. This symbolizes us trying to find correctness in our own lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ford |first=Zack |date=August 27, 2014 |title=Transgender Pride Flag Designer Applauds Smithsonian LGBT Artifacts Collection |url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/08/27/3476435/transgender-pride-flag/ |newspaper=ThinkProgress |location=United States of America |access-date=December 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032253/http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/08/27/3476435/transgender-pride-flag/ |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other transgender symbols include the butterfly (symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis), and a pink/light blue [[yin and yang]] symbol.

Several [[gender symbol]]s have been used to represent transgender people, including [[⚥]] and [[⚧]].

After it officially went into effect on January 1, 1994, U.S. public opinion on the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) has varied over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/north-american-free-trade-agreement-nafta|title=North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early public opinion on NAFTA was ambivalent, where a plurality of polled Americans was either unsure about NAFTA or did not have an opinion about NAFTA. As public opinion on NAFTA evolved, there were intermittent shifts in polls and surveys between support and opposition for NAFTA. However, support or opposition to NAFTA was frequently out of a plurality, as there was regularly a significant portion of respondents that were unsure about NAFTA and or did not have a substantial opinion on NAFTA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/trade.htm|title=International Trade|website=www.pollingreport.com|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, during the [[United States Presidential Election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], [[Donald Trump]] became a briefly polarizing force on public opinion about NAFTA, where negative views of NAFTA not only proliferated among Republican voters, but also the general population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blendon|first=Robert|date=|title=Public Opinion and Trump's Job and Trade Policies|url=|journal=Challenge|volume=|pages=228–244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, present public opinion on NAFTA is positive, with recent surveys finding that a majority of Americans viewing NAFTA as good for the U.S. economy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/pro-trade-views-rise-partisan-divisions-nafta-widen|title=Pro-Trade Views on the Rise, Partisan Divisions on NAFTA Widen {{!}} Chicago Council on Global Affairs|last=Affairs|first=Chicago Council on Global|website=www.thechicagocouncil.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/13/americans-generally-positive-about-nafta-but-most-republicans-say-it-benefits-mexico-more-than-u-s/|title=Americans generally positive about NAFTA, but most Republicans say it benefits Mexico more than U.S.|date=2017-11-13|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to note, public opinion towards NAFTA greatly fluctuated when survey data was organized into different categories (e.g. political party, level of education).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Currently, accessible public opinion scholarship on NAFTA is scarce with two studies done in the late 1990s. Each examined two different aspects about public opinion on NAFTA. On one hand, Jeffrey E. Cohen—a professor of political science at Fordham University—observed if NAFTA was a case of how well public opinion was taken into consideration by presidents.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.3998/mpub.14952|title=Presidential Responsiveness and Public Policy-Making: The Publics and the Policies that Presidents Choose|last=Cohen|first=Jeffrey E.|date=1997|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472108121|doi=10.3998/mpub.14952}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Eric M. Uslaner—a professor of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland—College Park—studied whether or not the case of NAFTA demonstrated that shifts in public opinion are in response to major events.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uslaner|first=Eric M.|date=1998|title=Trade Winds NAFTA and the Rational Public|jstor=586499|journal=Political Behavior|volume=20|issue=4|pages=341–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Public Opinion and Polling on NAFTA (1992-1993) ==

Although the proposed trilateral free trade agreement was one of the more hotly contested issues during the 1992 presidential election, early polling data from NBC/the Wall Street Journal demonstrated that an overall plurality of Americans either had no opinion or were unsure about the policy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

From the first administration of the NBC-''Wall Street Journal'' poll on September 12, 1992, 40% were either unsure or did not have an opinion on NAFTA, 27% supported NAFTA, and 34% opposed NAFTA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Likewise, this plurality of ambivalence towards NAFTA persisted until the final administration of the poll on November 14, 1993.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On the final poll, the plurality of poll respondents were in favor of NAFTA (36%).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The known cause of this shift was due to a televised debate on NAFTA that pitted the then Vice President Albert Gore against Ross Perot.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The debate was held on November 9, 1993.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In terms of positions, Ross Perot was a staunch opponent of NAFTA, stating that the policy would harm American workers (as the presumption was that American companies would outsource their labor to Mexico as soon as the agreement was put into effect); Albert Gore was in support of NAFTA, stating how beneficial the agreement would be for both the U.S. economy and its trade due to lower trade barriers (e.g. tariffs).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As indicated by the positive uptick in support for NAFTA on the last administration of the NBC-''Wall Street Journal'' poll, Albert Gore was perceived by the public as the winner of the debate, ultimately augmenting public support towards NAFTA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Evolution of Public Opinion on NAFTA (1999-2015) ==

In scope, the evolution of public opinion on NAFTA from 1999 to 2015 frequently switched between support and opposition to the policy. Results from a study done by the Program on International Policy Attitudes in the fall of 1999 illustrated that a plurality of Americans (44%) thought that NAFTA was good for the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, by 2004, a Newsweek Poll indicated that a plurality of Americans (35%) thought that NAFTA was bad for the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Oppositely, within a year or so, an international policy attitudes poll done in June 2005 revealed that 46% of respondents saw NAFTA as a policy that was good for the U.S.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7249/mg985rc.23|title=United States and Mexico|date=2012|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833051066|editor-last=Aguila|editor-first=Emma|edition=2|series=Ties That Bind, Issues That Divide|pages=143–148|doi=10.7249/mg985rc.23|editor-last2=Akhmedjonov|editor-first2=Alisher R.|editor-last3=Basurto-Davila|editor-first3=Ricardo|editor-last4=Kumar|editor-first4=Krishna B.|editor-last5=Kups|editor-first5=Sarah|editor-last6=Shatz|editor-first6=Howard J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in spring 2008, opinions shifted negatively, as a Pew Research Center/Council on Foreign Relations survey saw that 48% of respondents thought that NAFTA was bad for the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A Rasmussen Report apportions this particular shift in opinion towards rising oil and food prices, along with other economic factors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

By April 2015, an NBC-''Wall Street Journal'' poll found that a plurality of respondents (32%) thought that NAFTA did not have much of an impact on the U.S. and its economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Recent and Current Public Opinion on NAFTA (2016-present) ==

=== 2016 presidential election ===

During the 2016 election, Donald Trump—the Republican candidate for president—promulgated a view that was critical of free trade agreements like NAFTA, citing that such agreements affected the U.S. economy negatively and that these were only beneficial to other countries. In terms of influence on partisan voters, a recent study done by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health noted how registered Republican voters positively received Trump's view, with 68% of those voters opining that free trade agreements like NAFTA were "a bad thing" for the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, a Bloomberg National Poll that was conducted shortly after the inauguration of Donald Trump into office (from February 19 to February 22 of 2016) showed that proportionally, 29% of respondents thought that NAFTA was good for the U.S. economy, 44% of respondents thought that NAFTA was bad for the U.S. economy, and 27% of respondents were unsure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, when the same poll was conducted in 2017, the results demonstrated a positive shift in views on NAFTA, whereas 41% thought that NAFTA was good for the economy, 37% thought that NAFTA was bad for the economy, and 22% were unsure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== US public opinion on NAFTA Today ===

According to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, when prompted on whether or not NAFTA was good or bad for the U.S., 56% of all respondents viewed NAFTA as good for the U.S.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similar results were found in a survey run by the [[Chicago Council of Global Affairs]], where 53% of respondents thought that NAFTA was good for the U.S. (and its economy in particular).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Categorically, respondents with greater education had more pro-NAFTA views.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overwhelmingly, 70% of postgraduates viewed NAFTA as good for the U.S.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In contrast, 57% of college graduates, 52% with some college, and 54% with a high school education or less held the same view.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, along ideological (i.e. partisan) lines, conservative respondents were more likely to hold unfavorable views of NAFTA whereas liberal respondents were more likely to hold favorable views of NAFTA.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Numerically, a survey done by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that 71% of Democrats had a positive view on NAFTA and that 34% of Republicans had a positive view on NAFTA.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the Pew Research Center's survey, 74% of respondents who identified as "liberals" thought that NAFTA was good and that 31% of respondents who identified as "conservatives" had the same view as the liberals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Public Opinion Scholarship on NAFTA ===
As of now, there are two accessible studies about public opinion on NAFTA. One study by Jeffery E. Cohen investigated whether or not NAFTA was a case of presidential responsiveness to public opinion. The other study by Eric M. Uslaner inquired into whether or not the case of NAFTA was representative of how public opinion may shift in response to major events. Fundamentally, at its core, both studies attempt to validate whether or not—with different methods of examination—public opinion on NAFTA could be validated as a comparable case study.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both studies used data from early polls done by NBC/the Wall Street Journal from 1992 to 1993 to determine if their original hypothesis correlated with the evidence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, in the end, both scholars were unable to support their hypotheses as both found different results that were contrary to their original hypotheses. Jeffery E. Cohen suggested that NAFTA is not a case of presidential responsiveness to public opinion as "too many people had no opinion, and the rest (of the polling categories) were almost evenly divided."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Likewise, Eric M. Uslaner suggested that "people made up their minds on NAFTA on the basis of arguments about trade, not about their own self-interest."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Watkins Books''' is London's oldest esoteric bookshop specializing in [[esotericism]], [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], [[oriental religion]] and [[contemporary spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westendextra.com/news/2010/apr/us-film-producer-supplies-magic-save-occult-bookshop |title=US film producer supplies the magic to save occult bookshop |publisher=West End Extra |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book store was established by John M. Watkins, a friend of [[Madame Blavatsky]], in 1897 at 26 [[Charing Cross]]. John Watkins had already been selling books via a catalogue which he began publishing in March 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins Review, Issue 24, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The first biography of [[Aleister Crowley]] recounts a story of Crowley making all of the books in Watkins magically disappear and reappear.&lt;ref&gt;Page 268, 1952 edition of ''The Great Beast'' by John Symonds&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Watkins (1896–1981) owned and managed the store after his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/geoffrey-watkins |title=Geoffrey Watkins: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an author&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Watkins, Geoffrey (1896-1981) | encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology | publisher=The Gale Group Inc./[[Encyclopedia.com]] | accessdate=September 30, 2018 | year=2001 | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403804790.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publisher, with notable books including first publishing [[Carl Gustav Jung]]'s 1925 edition of ''[[Seven Sermons to the Dead|Septem Sermones ad Mortuos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/jung.html |title=The automatic writings of Jung |publisher=[[Philipcoppens.com]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Watkins Books moved to 21 [[Cecil Court]] where it has been continuously trading ever since. It publishes a magazine called the ''Watkins' Mind Body Spirit magazine'', which has featured leading authors from [[mind-body-spirit]] and esoteric fields. Watkins Books has been owned by [[Etan Ilfeld]] since March 2010.&lt;ref name="The Bookseller"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/deal-agreed-over-watkins-books.html | title=Deal agreed over Watkins Books | work=[[The Bookseller]] | date=March 15, 2010 | accessdate=September 30, 2018 | author=Gallagher, Victoria }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kindred Spirit, Issue 109&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a new website has been launched, and the store regularly hosts book launches and signings. Additionally, the Watkins website has integrated a spiritual map of London that everyone is invited to contribute to. Watkins Books has also published a free Mind Body Spirit app that is available on the iPhone/iPad and Android devices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mind-body-spirit-books-by/id463439169?mt=8 |title=App Store - Mind Body Spirit Books by Watkins |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2012-02-18 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watkins makes an annual list of "the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People," which is published online and in the spring issue of their magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-2012 |title=The Spiritual 100 - Watkins' annual list of the 100 most spiritually influential living people! |publisher=Watkinsbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main factors used to compile the list are that the person has to be alive, the person has to have made a unique and spiritual contribution on a global scale, and the person is frequently googled, appears in [[Nielsen Data]] and is actively talked about on the Internet.

'''William Scott-Elliot''' (sometimes incorrectly spelled Scott-Elliott) (1849-1919) was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] who elaborated [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s concept of [[root race]]s in several publications, most notably ''The Story of Atlantis'' (1896) and ''The Lost Lemuria'' (1904), later combined in 1925 into a single volume called ''The Story of Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria''. In 1893 he married Matilda (Maude) Louise Travers (1859-1929), daughter of Dr Robert Boyle Travers F.R.C.S., of Farsid Lodge, Rostellan, County Cork, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YUtNAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;ots=cS08bzIt1b&amp;dq=%22robert%20boyle%20travers%22&amp;pg=PA451#v=onepage&amp;q=%22robert%20boyle%20travers%22&amp;f=false Burke's Landed Gentry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophical writings==
Scott-Elliot was an East India Merchant and amateur anthropologist. An early member of the London Lodge of the Theosophical society, in 1893 he wrote ''The Evolution of Humanity'', issued as part of the Transactions of the London Lodge (issue 17).&lt;ref&gt;William Scott-Elliot, ''The evolution of humanity'', Issue 17 of Transactions of the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society, Theosophical Society (Great Britain). London Lodge, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, &amp; Co., 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scott-Elliot came into contact with theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] who said he received knowledge about ancient [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] from the Theosophical Masters by "astral clairvoyance." Leadbeater transmitted his clairvoyant findings to Scott-Elliot, who undertook scholarly research to back them up. Despite Leadbeater's contributions, Scott-Elliot was listed as the sole author of the resulting book ''The Story of Atlantis'', which was published with a preface by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Tillett, ''The Elder Brother: A Biography of Charles Webster Leadbeater'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1899 he was awarded the [[Tallapragada Subba Row|T. Subba Row]] Medal for his contributions to "esoteric science and philosophy". In 1904 he added detail on Lemuria in ''The Lost Lemuria'', attempting to use contemporary scientific evidence to back up Leadbeater's claims.

==Atlantean and Lemurian races==
[[File:Map of Lemuria.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Lemuria superimposed over the modern continents from ''The Story of Atlantis and Lost Lemuria''.]] 
Leadbeater and Scott-Elliot provided much more detail than Blavatsky on the lives of the supposed [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] and Lemurian root races. Scott-Elliot located Lemuria in the Pacific ocean, claiming that it was a gigantic landmass that eventually sank, leaving only small islands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ashe]], ''Encyclopedia of prophecy'', ABC-CLIO, 2001, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lemurians were around fifteen feet tall, with brown skins and flat faces, no foreheads and prominent jaws. They could see sideways like birds, and could walk backwards and forwards with equal ease. They reproduced with eggs, but interbred with animals to produce ape-like human ancestors.&lt;ref name = "mat"&gt;[[Martin Gardner]], ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'', Courier, 1957, p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the demise of Lemuria, new races emerged on [[Atlantis]] from the surviving ape-like creatures. This led to the Atlantean races, beginning with the black skinned "Rmoahal" and leading to the "copper coloured" Tlavatli, who were ancestor-worshippers, and then the "[[Toltec]]s", who had advanced technology including "airships". The Toltecs were succeeded by "First [[Turanian]]s" and then "Original [[Semitic people|Semite]]s". These later produced further sub-races, the [[Akkadians]] and [[Mongols|Mongolians]].&lt;ref name = "mat"/&gt; A group of Akkadians migrated to Britain 100,000 years ago, where they built [[Stonehenge]]. The crudity of the design in contrast to Atlantean architecture is explained by the fact that "the rude simplicity of Stonehenge was intended as a protest against the extravagant ornament and over-decoration of the existing temples in Atlantis, where the debased worship of their own images was being carried on by the inhabitants."&lt;ref name ="will"/&gt;

Scott-Elliot also claimed that Atlantis split into two linked islands, one called Daitya, and the other Ruta. Eventually only a remnant of Ruta remained, called Poseidonis, before that too disappeared.&lt;ref name ="will"&gt;William Scott-Elliot, ''The Story of Atlantis'', Theosophical Publishing Society, 1896, p.18, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scott-Elliot's ideas were mentioned by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in the essays later published as ''Atlantis and Lemuria'' (1904).

"'''Zidane y va marquer'''" is a song recorded by the [[France|French]] TV and radio host Sébastien Cauet and broadcast on radio from May 2006. Based on the music of [[Salif Keita]] and [[Martin Solveig]]'s hit single "Madân", this parody refers to [[Zinedine Zidane]] and other players of the [[France national football team|French football team]] competing in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

==Background and writing==
From May 2006, the song featured on the radio program hosted by Cauet every morning. The tone is humorous and refers to Zidane as a providential savior. The lyrics also mentioned the non-selection of [[Jérôme Rothen]] and [[Nicolas Anelka]] and the unexpected selection of [[Pascal Chimbonda]]. In the original version, Zidane was injured leaving the place to [[Claude Makélélé]], but after the match [[France]] - [[China]], the lyrics were changed to reflect [[Djibril Cissé]]'s real life injury.

The song gained in popularity with the victories of the [[France national football team]] at the World Cup, being sung in the streets during the after games celebrations. Thereafter, Cauet decided to record the song as a single, which was published by [[Universal Music]]. The refrain featured in advertising jingles on [[TF1]] before matches. The lyrics were changed in order to allow the release of the song (for example, the line mentioning Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] was deleted).

The music video was shot only a few days before the final match of the World Cup: devoted to karaoke, it shows Cauet's entire team of hosts singing the song in the streets. Even though France didn't win, Zidane, after having [[Zinédine Zidane#Confrontation with Marco Materazzi|rammed his head]] into [[Marco Materazzi]]'s chest and his expulsion, revived the song. Therefore, "Zidane y va marquer" became a hit in France.

==Cover versions==
The same day, the group La Plage immediately covered the song re-entitled "[[Coup de Boule]]" and dealing with the aggression of Zidane. Composed in a few hours and quickly leaked on the [[Internet]], it also became a hit and reached number 1 on the French and Belgian Singles Charts.

In 2007, [[Les Enfoirés]] recorded a medley of summer hits, including "Zidane y va marquer", performed by [[Jean-Baptiste Maunier]] and [[Pierre Palmade]] and available on the 2007 album ''[[La Caravane des Enfoirés]]''.

At the [[Rugby World Cup]] of 2007, Cauet adapted and sang the song re-entitled "Chabal va les manger" by modifying the lyrics.
