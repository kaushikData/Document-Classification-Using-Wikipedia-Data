{{Tort law}}
'''Breach of promise''' is a [[common law]] [[tort]], abolished in many jurisdictions. It was also called '''breach of contract to marry''',&lt;ref name=NYLaw&gt;N.Y. Civil Rights Act article 8, §§ 80-A to 84.  {{cite web|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=@SLCVR0A8+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=27541826+&amp;TARGET=VIEW |title=CAUSES OF ACTION FOR ALIENATION OF AFFECTIONS, CRIMINAL CONVERSATION, SEDUCTION AND BREACH OF CONTRACT TO MARRY ABOLISHED |publisher=[[New York State Assembly]] |date= |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remedy awarded was known as '''heart balm'''.

From at least the [[Middle Ages]] until the early 20th century, a man's promise of [[engagement]] to [[marry]] a woman was considered, in many jurisdictions, a legally binding [[contract]].  If the man were to subsequently change his mind, he would be said to be in "breach" of this promise and subject to litigation for damages.

The converse of this was seldom true; the concept that "it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind" had at least some basis in law (though a woman might pay a high social price for exercising this privilege, as explained below)—and unless an actual [[dowry]] of money or property had changed hands or the woman could be shown to have become engaged to a man only to be able to use large amounts of his money,&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Heart+Balm+Acts "breach of marriage promise"] in West's Encyclopedia of American Law &lt;/ref&gt; a man was only rarely able to recover in a "breach of promise" suit against a woman, were he even allowed to file one.

Changing social attitudes toward morals have led to the decline of this sort of action.  Most jurisdictions, at least in the [[English language|English]]-speaking, [[common law]] world, have become increasingly reluctant to intervene in cases of personal relationships not involving the welfare of children or actual violence.  Many have repealed all laws regarding such eventualities;&lt;ref name=NYLaw /&gt; whereas in others the statute allowing such an action may technically remain on the books but the action has become very rare and unlikely to be pursued with any probability of success. What is arising in its stead are judicial opinions and/or statutes permitting a breach of contract action for wedding expenses incurred when the nuptials are called off, or for loss of employment, moving and living expenses incurred by one party as a result of an engagement which is later broken.

==Cause of action==
A breach of promise suit required a legally valid marriage engagement.&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;  Under Nevada law, this need not be in writing (as a prenuptial agreement is required to be), but may have been made verbally by both parties.  All that is required is that each have promised the other to marry the other at some future time (no date certain is required). Generally, promises made by—but not to—people who had not reached the [[age of majority]] could be broken at any time, without penalty, as could the promise made by a married person (e.g., conditional upon the death of the current spouse), so long as the other party knew that the person was married at the time.  Similarly, an engagement between people who were not legally permitted to marry (e.g., because of [[consanguinity]] laws) was invalid.&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;

Valid engagements could be broken without penalty by either party upon discovery of significant and material facts, such as previously unknown financial state (if completely concealed, rather than partially revealed: the Shell case in Georgia in 2008 permitted a jury award to the woman of $150,000 although the man breaking the engagement stated that he did so after paying $30,000 of her debts when he discovered she still owed more), bad character, fraud, too-close blood relations, or the absolute physical or mental incapacity of the betrothed.&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;  In South Africa, engagements could be dissolved by mutual agreement. Impotence, sterility, criminality, and alcoholism also formed valid reasons to end an engagement.  Additionally, the person refusing to marry was unable to sue for breach of promise.

Some of the original theory behind this tort was based on the idea that a woman would be more likely to give up her [[virginity]] to a man if she had his promise to marry her.  If he seduced her and subsequently refused marriage, her lack of virginity would make her future search for a suitable husband more difficult or even impossible.&lt;ref name=Brinig /&gt;

However, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the main factors were compensation for the denial of the woman's expectations of becoming "established" in a household (supported by her husband's wealth) and possible damage to her social reputation, since there were a number of ways that the reputation of a young never-married woman of the genteel classes could be damaged by a broken engagement, or an apparent period of intimacy which did not end in a publicly announced engagement, even if few people seriously thought that she had lost her virginity.  She might be viewed as having broken the code of maidenly modesty of the period by imprudently offering up her affections without having had a firm assurance of future marriage.

During the early 20th century, social standards changed so that a woman who had pre-marital sex was no longer considered to be "ruined". During that time, half of American women lost their virginity during their marriage engagements.&lt;ref name=Brinig/&gt;  Compensation was based on emotional distress and the woman's reduced opportunity for a future marriage.  Damages were greatly increased if the couple had engaged in pre-marital sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=Brinig /&gt;

In 1915, [[Louis A. Merrilat]], an [[American football]] [[End (American football)|end]] and military officer active in the early 20th century, was sued by Helen Van Ness for breach of promise after breaking off an engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merillat, Former Army Eleven Captain, Is Sued for Breach of Promise|newspaper=Indianapolis Star|date=1915-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SHE SUES ARMY ATHLETE: Girl Claims Lieut. Merillat  Jilted Her and Asks $20,000; Miss Van Ness, of Ohio, Says Officer Wed Another — Met Him at West Point Social Function|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1915-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merrilat hired the noted Chicago attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] to defend him against the charges, which were eventually dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-football-star-and-the-wrath-of-his-would-be-bride-3622576/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ASKS $20,000 HEART BALM: GIRL SUES ARMY OFFICER; Miss Van Ness and Lieutenant Merillat, Jr.; Jilted Stenographer Seeks Redress When West Pointer Weds Another|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=1915-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws in different countries==
=== England ===
In England until 1970 a woman whose fiancé broke off their engagement could sue him for Breach of Promise, whilst a woman, historically regarded as the weaker sex, was permitted to change her mind without penalty.  The last prominent case was in 1969, when Eva Haraldsted sued [[George Best]], a prominent footballer, for Breach of Promise.  England and Wales undertook legal reforms in 1970 that generally made property disputes related to engagements to be handled like property disputes between married couples.&lt;ref name="Reform" /&gt;

===Asia===
In Hong Kong, similar to the situation in England, engagements to marry are not enforceable at law by legislation, damages for distress caused and reliance on the breach of promise are claimable, if the plaintiff suffers sufficiently serious consequences in light of the specific circumstances, for instance in ''Cheung Suk Man v So Shek Keung'' [1965] HKLR 485.

=== North America ===
In Canada, the common law action has been abolished in some provinces by legislation.  For example, in [[Saskatchewan]], the action for breach of promise was formally abolished by legislation in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/Chapters/2010/Chap-28.pdf ''The Queen's Bench Amendment Act, 2010''], Statutes of Saskatchewan 2010, ch. 28, s. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, most states repealed breach-of-promise laws or limited them, beginning in 1935.&lt;ref name="Brinig" /&gt;  Partly as a result, expensive diamond [[engagement ring]]s, previously uncommon, began to become commonplace, and formed a sort of financial security for the woman.&lt;ref name="Brinig" /&gt;

[[South Carolina]] is one of the states that still recognizes a breach of promise action: [https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar_case?case=16439775895686510622&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yunaU-GFE5fq8AXRp4H4Aw&amp;ved=0CB4QgAMoATAA ''Campbell v Robinson''], 398 S.C. 12, 726 S.E. 2d 221 (Ct. App. 2012).  However about one-half of U.S. states still permit such lawsuits, according to the [[National Paralegal College]]. Recent examples of suits include the jury award of $150,000 in the 2008 Shell case in Georgia, and $130,000 in the North Carolina jury trial December 17, 2010 in the case of Dellinger v. Barnes (No. 08 CVS 1006).  Laws vary by state.  In Illinois, for example, documented wedding expenses can be recovered, but damages for emotional distress are prohibited, and notice of an intent to sue must be provided within three months of the engagement being dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isba.org/sections/familylaw/newsletter/2011/06/brokenengagements|title=Broken engagements|last=Manzano|first=Kelly|date=June 2011|website=|publisher=Illinois State Bar Association|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-common-law jurisdictions===
France nominally did not permit breach of promise actions, holding that marriage must involve free consent from both parties, and if the engagement is legally binding, then free consent is not possible. However, any party may sue for losses as a result of improper behavior by an engaged person.&lt;ref name="Reform" /&gt;

In Scots law before 1812, damages were limited only to actual financial losses.&lt;ref name="Reform" /&gt;

After World War II, German, Spanish, and Italian law allowed for the recovery of actual damages incurred as a result of a failed engagement.&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;

==Determining damages==
Damages were generally permitted for expenses incurred on the expectation of a marriage, such as property transferred or wedding expenses.&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;  In some jurisdictions, emotional distress, loss of social standing, and loss of virginity were also possible sources of damages.&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;

Some countries also allowed the woman to sue for loss of future income, that is, for money that she would have had, if her very wealthy fiancé had not broken off the engagement.  In 20th-century reforms, this was generally abolished over fears of [[gold digging]].&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;

One challenge in settling disputes for breach of promise was determining whether a [[gift]] made during the engagement was an absolute gift—one given permanently, with no strings attached—or a conditional gift, given in the expectation of the marriage taking place.  If an engagement gift was given on a holiday, such as [[Valentine's Day]] or [[Christmas]], the gift could be considered to be non-contingent, and given partially for reasons other than marriage, and thus does not have to be returned.  Christmas presents are generally taken to be absolute gifts, and thus cannot be recovered if the engagement dissolves, but [[engagement ring]]s are generally taken to be conditional gifts, at least under most circumstances, which means that they must be returned if the recipient no longer chooses to go through with the marriage.&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;  Whether an engagement ring must be returned if the giver breaks off the engagement varies.&lt;ref name=Reform /&gt;

==Similar actions in law==

[[Criminal conversation]] or "seduction" was a similar tort, arising from [[adultery]], in which a married person could sue the person with whom his or her spouse had engaged in adultery.&lt;ref name=NYLaw /&gt;  [[Alienation of affections]] was another similar tort against a third party who encouraged the adultery, or who was otherwise responsible for the breakdown of the marriage.&lt;ref name=NYLaw /&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
The social damage from receiving attention from a man is discussed in a passage from the 1801 novel ''Belinda'' by [[Maria Edgeworth]], where an older woman is urging Miss Belinda Portman to give a suitor more time to attach her affections, though Belinda is worried that even by just passively accepting his attentions for a certain time, she might find herself "entangled, so as not to be able to retract", even "if it should not be in my power to love him at last":

:''"…after a certain time—after the world suspects that two people are engaged to each other, it is scarcely possible for the woman to recede: when they come within a certain distance, they are pressed to unite, by the irresistible force of external circumstances.  A woman is too often reduced to this dilemma: either she must marry a man she does not love, or she must be blamed by the world—either she must sacrifice a portion of her reputation, or the whole of her happiness.… A young woman is not in this respect allowed sufficient time for freedom of deliberation."''

Breach-of-promise actions were part of the standard stock-in-trade of comic writers of the 19th century (such as [[Charles Dickens]] in his ''[[Pickwick Papers]]'', or [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in ''[[Trial by Jury]]''), but most middle- and upper-class families were reluctant to use them except in rather extreme circumstances (such as when a daughter became pregnant by a man who then refused to marry her), since they led to wide publicity being given to a scrutiny of intimate personal concerns, something which was strongly repugnant to the family feeling of the period (especially where young women were concerned).

===Media===
''[[Trial by Jury]]'' is an 1875 [[Curtain raiser (drama)|curtain-raiser]] and [[comic opera]] that enacts a satirical trial for breach of promise.  The successful musical is credited with launching the careers of librettist [[W.S. Gilbert]] and composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].

''[[The Scales of Justice|The Scales of Justice - A Woman's Privilege]]'' recounts the unusual case of a man who sues a woman for breach of promise following a cruise ship romance engagement.

In the [[mockumentary]] film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', the character playing [[Paul McCartney]]'s grandfather is pursued by young women who wish to sue the older man for breach of promise.

In season 8 of the TV show ''[[Frasier]]'', Donny files a suit against Daphne for running away with Niles on the day of their wedding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8047">A '''bridge bank''' is an institution created by a [[financial regulator|national regulator]] or [[central bank]] to operate a [[bank failure|failed bank]] until a buyer can be found for its operations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Fitch, ''Barron's Dictionary of Banking Terms'' ([[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], 2006: {{ISBN|0-8120-9659-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], [http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/matrix/exhibit2.html Delegations of Authority: Enforcement Actions], accessed July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

While national laws vary, the bridge bank is usually established by a publicly backed [[deposit insurance]] organisation or [[financial regulator]] and may be instituted to avoid [[systemic risk]] and provide an orderly transition avoiding negative effects such as [[bank run]]s.

Typically, the tasks of a bridge bank are to ensure seamless continuity of banking operations by:
* Assuming the deposits of and honouring the commitments of the failed bank, so that service to retail clients is not disrupted
* Servicing adequately secured existing loans to avoid their premature interruption or termination
* Assuming other existing assets, liabilities or functions of the defunct bank at the discretion of the regulator

These tasks are carried out on a temporary basis (usually for no more than two or three years) to provide time to find a buyer for the bank as a going concern. If the bank cannot be sold as a going concern, its portfolio of assets are liquidated in an orderly fashion. Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the national deposit insurance corporation is appointed as the receiver of the bridge bank's assets.

==Operation by country==

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria the ([[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN) and the [[Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (NDIC) administer the deposits and liabilities of a failed bank. Under the arrangement, the  NDIC is authorized to operate a failed bank for a period until a buyer can be found for its operations.

When in the opinion of CBN, a NDIC-insured bank is in financial trouble, the CBN and NDIC may establish a bridge bank to;

* Assume the deposits of the closed bank;
* Assume such other liabilities of the closed bank as the Deposit Insurance Corporation may determine to be appropriate;
* Purchase such [[asset]]s of the closed bank as the Deposit Insurance Corporation may determine to be appropriate; and
* Perform any other temporary function which the Deposit Insurance Corporation may prescribe in accordance with this Act.

Bridge banks are authorized to seek to liquidate failed banks, either by finding buyers for the bank as a [[going concern]], or by liquidating its portfolio of assets, within two years, which can be extended by an additional year.  Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the bridge bank must notify the Governor of the CBN of its intent to dissolve the bridge bank. Under this situation, the NDIC is appointed as the [[Receivership|receiver]] of the bridge bank's assets.

====Historic example====
On August 5, 2011, Central Bank of Nigeria revoked the operating licenses of three banks including; [[Afribank]], [[Spring Bank]], and [[Bank PHB]], which according to it, did not show enough capacity and ability for [[recapitalization]].

In their place, the CBN through the NDIC established Bridge Banks and transferred the assets and liabilities of the three affected banks to the Bridge Banks as follows;

# [[Mainstreet Bank Limited]] (Afribank),
# [[Keystone Bank Limited]] (Bank PHB), and
# [[Enterprise Bank Limited]] (Spring Bank).

Under the arrangement, MainStreet Bank Limited took over the assets and liabilities of Afribank; Keystone Bank Limited assumed the assets and liabilities of Bank PHB, while Enterprise Bank Limited took over that of Spring Bank.

The Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) immediately acquired from the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), the three Bridge Banks. Accordingly, AMCON injected N679 billion into the Bridge Banks to meet the minimum capital base of N25 billion and the minimum [[capital adequacy ratio]] of 15 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/afribank-co-amcon-acquires-bridge-banks-injects-n679bn/ |title=Afribank &amp; Co: AMCON acquires Bridge Banks, injects N679bn |date=August 7, 2011 |publisher=Vanguard }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/01/bridge-banks-amcon-transfers-ownership-skye-heritage-banks/ |title=Bridge banks: AMCON transfers ownership to Skye, Heritage Banks |date=January 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States law]] of [[banking regulation]], a bridge bank is organized by federal bank regulators to administer the [[bank deposit|deposits]] and liabilities of a [[bank failure|failed bank]].&lt;ref&gt;CEBA, [http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt HR. 27 (1987)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028114326/http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt |date=October 28, 2014 }}, ss. 503.  Codified at 12 [[United States Code|USC]] ch. 16, ss. 1821(n).&lt;/ref&gt;Under the ''Competitive Equality Banking Act'' (CEBA) of 1987, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) is authorized to operate a failed bank for a period of up to three years, until a buyer can be found for its operations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Fitch, ''Barron's Dictionary of Banking Terms'' ([[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], 2006: {{ISBN|0-8120-9659-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], [http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/matrix/exhibit2.html Delegations of Authority: Enforcement Actions], accessed July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under CEBA, when a FDIC-insured bank is in financial trouble, the FDIC "may establish a bridge bank to &amp;mdash;
# assume the deposits of the closed bank;
# assume such other liabilities of the closed bank as the Corporation, in the Corporation's discretion, may determine to be  appropriate;
# purchase such assets of the closed bank as the Corporation, in the Corporation's discretion, may determine to be appropriate; and
# perform any other temporary function which the Corporation may prescribe in accordance with this Act."&lt;ref&gt;CEBA, [http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt HR. 27 (1987)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028114326/http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt |date=October 28, 2014 }}, ss. 503.  Codified at 12 [[United States Code|USC]] ch. 16, ss. 1821(n).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridge banks must be chartered as [[national bank]]s in accordance with [[US banking law]]. To the extent possible, bridge banks are required to honor the commitments of the failed bank to its customers, and not to interrupt or terminate adequately [[Collateral (finance)|secured]] [[loan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;12 USC ch. 16, ss. 1821(n)(3)(B)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridge banks are authorized to seek to liquidate failed banks, either by finding buyers for the bank as a going concern, or by liquidating its [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of assets, within two years, which can be extended for cause by an additional year. Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the bridge bank must notify the [[Comptroller of the Currency]] of its intent to [[dissolution (law)|dissolve]] the bridge bank. Under this situation, the FDIC is appointed as the [[receiver (legal)|receiver]] of the bridge bank's assets.&lt;ref&gt;12 USC ch. 16, ss. 1821(n)(12)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coalition for the Promotion of Damage Insurance Professions ==
In 2002, the Coalition for the Promotion of the Damage Insurance Professions (Coalition)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prosdelassurance.ca/ Job site "Pros delassurance.ca" promoting a career in damage insurance]&lt;/ref&gt; was set up on the initiative of the "Chambre de la sécurité financière". The entire insurance industry then mobilized by associating itself with this cause, its program and its activities. The mission of this coalition is to attract more candidates to career opportunities in property and casualty insurance and to enhance the image of the professionals who work there.

The Coalition's Board of Directors consists of 13 executive directors from various organizations or categories of members. Maya Raic, President and CEO of the "Damage Insurance Chamber", is a member of the Board of Directors.

== History ==
* Sept. 2017 - Bill 141 is tabled at the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], proposing the amalgamation of the mission of the CAD to the [[Autorité des marchés financiers (Québec)]] (AMF).
* June 13, 2018 - Adoption of Bill 141 amended at the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], after withdrawing the proposed amalgamation of CAD to the AMF.

== Price Marcel-Tassé ==
In 1999, the "Chambre de l'assurance de dommages" (ChAD) launched the Marcel-Tassé Prize with the objective of encouraging and honoring individuals of the next generation in damage insurance.

The Marcel-Tassé Prize consists of two parts:
• ''general'': addressing the next generation of a college or university program not specializing in damage insurance;
• ''specialized in property and casualty insurance'': intended for graduates of the DEC (collegial studies diploma) in insurance and financial services or an AEC (attestation of collegial studies) in property and casualty insurance.

For the insurance industry, the Marcel-Tassé Awards are an exceptional recognition and a remarkable distinction. The Marcel-Tassé Awards are each awarded with a $2,000 grant.

The '''Chancery Regulation Act 1862''' (25 &amp; 26 Vict., c. 42), also known as '''Rolt's Act''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] that was an important step in the [[fusion of law and equity]].

==Background==
From the 13th century in [[England and Wales]], [[equity (law)|equity]] developed as a system of [[justice]] in parallel with and complementary to the [[common law]]. By the 19th century, with the rise of [[capitalism]] in [[Victorian Britain]], equity had become very important. The [[remedy (law)|remedies]] available to the common law were limited to [[damages]] and those disputes demanding an [[injunction]] or [[specific performance]] of a [[contract]] needed to be heard in equity which was administered in [[Courts of Chancery]], separate from the common law courts. Moreover, procedure in equity was better able to handle complex disputes involving the relationship between several parties such as [[partnership]]s and [[trust (law)|trust]]s.&lt;ref name="lobban1"&gt;Lobban (2004a)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the dual jurisdiction of law and equity caused problems for [[litigant]]s. In equity, all parties had to be represented at all hearings and if one died or married complex procedures were needed to maintain the action. The rate of progress of the action was in the hands of the parties and would tend to be determined by the slowest. Many uncontroversial administrative actions, such as appointing a new [[trustee]], were dealt with as though they were contentious, adding further delay. There were many inefficiencies in procedure with high [[costs (English law)|costs]] and a certain amount of [[Political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name="lobban1"/&gt; Further, cases that involved questions of both law and equity would be hampered, shuttling between the courts of Chancery and common law courts for years, as in ''[[Wood v. Scarth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1855) 2 K&amp;J 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chancery commission]] (1824–26) made recommendations on streamlining procedure but the commissioners concluded that the Chancery courts themselves had the powers to improve matters.&lt;ref name="lobban1"/&gt;  Over the following decades there was much debate leading to legislation including the [[Improvement of the Jurisdiction of Equity Act 1852]] which allowed Chancery judges to decide [[questions of fact]] rather than remitting them to the common law courts. However, by 1862, Chancery judges were still reluctant to make use of these powers so [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[John Rolt]] introduced a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] to make determination of facts by Chancery judges mandatory.&lt;ref name="lobban2"&gt;Lobban (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Act==
In the end, the Act was weakened from its initial intentions, allowing matters of fact to be decided by the [[assize]]s.&lt;ref name="lobban2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;Hansard [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1862/mar/26/committee-1 HC Deb 26 March 1862 vol 166 cc114-22 114]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act applied to the [[High Court of Chancery]] of England and Wales and also to the [[Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Lancaster]] which had an independent jurisdiction in equity.&lt;ref&gt;Rickards (1862)&lt;/ref&gt; A further Act brought a similar reform to [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Chancery Regulation (Ireland) Act 1862, c. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
The fusion of law and equity was finally effected in the 1870s by the [[Judicature Acts]].&lt;ref name="lobban2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4322">{{for|the usage in computer science|Data commingling}}
In law, '''commingling''' is a [[position of trust|breach of trust]] in which a [[fiduciary]] mixes funds held in care for a client with their own funds, making it difficult to determine which funds belong to the fiduciary and which belong to the client. This raises particular concerns where the funds are invested, and gains or losses from the investments must be allocated. In such circumstances, the law usually presumes that any gains run to the client and any losses run to the fiduciary who is guilty of commingling. As one source puts it, "[i]n a pejorative sense, commingling is the special vice of fiduciaries (trustee, agents, lawyers, etc.) in failing to keep a beneficiary's money separate from the fiduciary's own money".&lt;ref&gt;David Mellinkoff, ''Mellinkoff's Dictionary of American Legal Usage'' (2009), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commingling is particularly an issue in case of [[bankruptcy]] of the fiduciary. Funds held in care are not the fiduciary's property, and the client is not a creditor. So in case of bankruptcy, if the funds have been properly kept separate, they can easily be returned to the client. If, however, the funds have been commingled, the client is potentially subject to becoming entangled in the bankruptcy proceedings, and there may not be sufficient funds to pay the client back.

==Examples==

===Tenant deposits===
For example, a tenant who deposits money with a landlord has not lent money to the landlord – the tenant is not a creditor – and is entitled to their deposit back even in case that the landlord declares bankruptcy, assuming property is in good condition – the tenant is responsible for the ''property,'' but is not undertaking [[credit risk]].&lt;ref&gt;John W. Reilly, ''The Language of Real Estate'' (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment funds===
Similarly, a client who invests with a fund or broker is investing, not lending, so the fiduciary must keep the client money separate and not use it for their own purposes, but only for approved investment purposes: the client is subject to ''investment'' risk on their money, but not credit risk regarding the fiduciary.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred M. Pollard and Joseph P. Daly, ''Banking Law in the United States - Fourth Edition'' (2014), 14-58 to 14-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawyers and brokers===
The problem of commingling is of particular concern in the legal profession. [[Lawyer|Attorneys]] are strictly prohibited from commingling their clients' funds with their own, and such activity is grounds for [[disbarment]] in virtually every jurisdiction, because of the ease of [[embezzlement]] and the difficulty of detection.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Traina Donnes, ''Practical Law Office Management'' (2016), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rules apply for licensed [[real estate broker]]s handling [[earnest money]] and other professionals who hold deposits as agents for clients ''in absentia''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mettling, David Cusic, ''Principles of Real Estate Practice'' (2014), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporations ===
Commingling is also evidence that may be used in "[[piercing the corporate veil]]" of a sham corporation, where a person shields himself from personal liability through "incorporation", yet fails to observe strict separation of corporate and personal property or accounts, among other improprieties.

For [[small business]], strict separation of corporate and personal property is a particular issue, notably in tax and divorce law.

==Community property==
In [[community property]] states of the [[United States]], "commingling" non-marital property with marital property can make it community property.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Pivar, Robert Bruss, ''California Real Estate Law'' (2002), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, depositing money received by an individual through [[inheritance]] – ordinarily considered non-marital, individual property – into a joint [[bank account]] may transform the money into community property.  Most community property states apply a [[presumption]] of community property; where there is any commingling the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the party disputing the classification to "trace" the property back to individual property, and demonstrate an intent to keep it separated.

The '''Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty''' ('''CTBT''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] that bans all [[nuclear explosion]]s, for both civilian and military purposes, in all environments. It was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 September 1996, but has not entered into force, as eight specific states have not ratified the treaty.

==History==
The movement for international control of [[nuclear weapon]]s began in 1945, with a call from [[Canada]] and [[United Kingdom]] for a conference on the subject.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=56}} In June 1946, [[Bernard Baruch]], an emissary of President [[Harry S. Truman]], proposed the [[Baruch Plan]] before the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]], which called for an international system of controls on the production of atomic energy. The plan, which would serve as the basis for [[United States]] nuclear policy into the 1950s, was rejected by the [[Soviet Union]] as a US ploy to cement its nuclear dominance.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=7}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|pp=57–58}}

Between the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] of 16 July 1945 and the signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] (PTBT) on 5 August 1963, 499 nuclear tests were conducted.&lt;ref name=delcoigne&gt;{{cite web |title=The Test Ban Treaty |last=Delcoigne |first=G.C. |publisher=IAEA |page=18 |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |access-date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the PTBT, the precursor to the CTBT, was rising public concern surrounding the size and resulting [[nuclear fallout]] from underwater and atmospheric nuclear tests, particularly tests of powerful [[thermonuclear weapons]] (hydrogen bombs). The [[Castle Bravo]] test of 1 March 1954, in particular, attracted significant attention as the detonation resulted in fallout that spread over inhabited areas and sickened a group of Japanese fishermen.&lt;ref name=atomicheritage&gt;{{cite web |title=Limited or Partial Test Ban Treaty (LTBT/PTBT) |publisher=[[Atomic Heritage Foundation]] |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/history/limited-or-partial-test-ban-treaty-ltbtptbt |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsarchive&gt;{{cite web |title=The Making of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1958–1963 |last1=Burr |first1=William |last2=Montford |first2=Hector L. |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |date=3 August 2003 |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB94/ |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-banning-nuclear-test-atmosphere-outer-space-and-under-water-partial-test-ban-treaty-ptbt/|title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water (Partial Test Ban Treaty) (PTBT)|date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]|access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rhodes|2005|p=542}}{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=31}} Between 1945 and 1963, the US conducted 215 atmospheric tests, the Soviet Union conducted 219, the UK conducted 21, and [[France]] conducted three.&lt;ref name=nrdc&gt;{{cite web |title=Archive of Nuclear Data |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab15.asp |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010072829/http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab15.asp |archive-date=10 October 2007 |access-date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, following the Castle Bravo test, Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] of [[India]] issued the first appeal for a "standstill agreement" on testing, which was soon echoed by the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=247}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=58}}&lt;ref name=bravo&gt;{{cite web |title=1 March 1954 – Castle Bravo |publisher=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization |url=https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/1-march-1954-castle-bravo/ |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations on a comprehensive test ban, primarily involved the US, UK, and Soviet Union, began in 1955 following a proposal by Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=72}}{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=121}} Of primary concern throughout the negotiations, which would stretch with some interruptions to July 1963, was the system of verifying compliance with the test ban and detecting illicit tests. On the Western side, there were concerns that the Soviet Union would be able to circumvent any test ban and secretly leap ahead in the [[nuclear arms race]].{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=305}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=457–458}}{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=8–9}} These fears were amplified following the US [[Operation Plumbbob|''Rainier'']] shot of 19 September 1957, which was the first contained underground test of a nuclear weapon. Though the US held a significant advantage in underground testing capabilities, there was worry that the Soviet Union would be able to covertly conduct underground tests during a test ban, as underground detonations were more difficult to detect than above-ground tests.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=9}}{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|pp=85–86}} On the Soviet side, conversely, the on-site compliance inspections demanded by the US and UK were seen as amounting to espionage.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=79}} Disagreement over verification would lead to the Anglo-American and Soviet negotiators abandoning a comprehensive test ban (i.e., a ban on all tests, including those underground) in favor of a partial ban, which would be finalized on 25 July 1963. The PTBT, joined by 123 states following the original three parties, banned detonations for military and civilian purposes underwater, in the atmosphere, and in outer space.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=905–906, 910}}&lt;ref name=siglist&gt;{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty &amp; Partial Test Ban Treaty Membership |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/apmctbt_10.pdf |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=11 August 2016 |date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unoda&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water |publisher=[[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]] |access-date=11 August 2016 |url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/test_ban/text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTBT had mixed results. On the one hand, enactment of the treaty was followed by a substantial drop in the atmospheric concentration of radioactive particles.&lt;ref name=radiocarbon&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiocarbon Dating |publisher=[[Utrecht University]] |url=http://web.science.uu.nl/AMS/Radiocarbon.htm |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Technical Details: The Bomb Spike |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/bombspike.html |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[nuclear proliferation]] was not halted entirely (though it may have been slowed) and nuclear testing continued at a rapid clip. Compared to the 499 tests from 1945 to the signing of the PTBT, 436 tests were conducted over the ten years following the PTBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Test Ban Treaty |last=Delcoigne |first=G.C. |publisher=IAEA |page=18 |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |access-date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=72}} Furthermore, US and Soviet underground testing continued "venting" radioactive gas into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=nsa2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Limited Test Ban Treaty – 50 Years Later: New Documents Throw Light on Accord Banning Atmospheric Nuclear Testing |last=Burr |first=William |publisher=National Security Archive |date=2 August 2013 |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb433/ |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, though underground testing was generally safer than above-ground testing, underground tests continued to risk the leaking of [[radionuclide]]s, including [[plutonium]], into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Overview of the Effects of Nuclear Testing |publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission |url=https://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/the-effects-of-nuclear-testing/general-overview-of-theeffects-of-nuclear-testing/ |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Report on the Health Consequences to the American Population from Nuclear Weapons Tests Conducted by the United States and Other Nations |chapter=Fallout from Nuclear Weapons |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |date=May 2005 |pages=20–21 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2003_10/LTBT|work=Arms Control Association|author=Daryl Kimball and Wade Boese|date= June 2009|access-date=21 May 2012|title=Limited Test Ban Treaty Turns 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 through 1996, the year of the CTBT's adoption, an estimated 1,377 underground nuclear tests were conducted. The final non-underground (atmospheric or underwater) test was conducted by [[China]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=sipritally&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Sipri_table12b.pdf |title=Armaments, Disarmament and International Security |author=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |pages=555–556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nuclear&gt;{{cite web|work=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization|year=2012|url= http://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/history-of-nuclear-testing/world-overview/page-1-world-overview/ |title= Nuclear testing world overview |access-date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTBT has been seen as a step towards the [[Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) of 1968, which directly made reference to the PTBT.&lt;ref name=faschron&gt;{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Chronology |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |url=http://fas.org/nuke/control/ctbt/chron1.htm |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the NPT, non-nuclear weapon states were prohibited from possessing, manufacturing, and acquiring nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. All signatories, including nuclear weapon states, were committed to the goal of total [[nuclear disarmament]]. However, India, [[Pakistan]], and [[Israel]] have declined to sign the NPT on grounds that such a treaty is fundamentally discriminatory as it places limitations on states that do not have nuclear weapons while making no efforts to curb weapons development by declared nuclear weapons states.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 1974, a step towards a comprehensive test ban was made with the [[Threshold Test Ban Treaty]] (TTBT), ratified by the US and Soviet Union, which banned underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.&lt;ref name=nsa2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Flawed Test Ban Treaty |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |date=27 March 1984 |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1984/03/the-flawed-test-ban-treaty |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1976, the two states reached agreement on the [[Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty]] (PNET), which concerns nuclear detonations outside the weapons sites discussed in the TTBT. As in the TTBT, the US and Soviet Union agreed to bar [[peaceful nuclear explosions]] (PNEs) at these other locations with yields above 150 kilotons, as well as group explosions with total yields in excess of 1,500 kilotons. To verify compliance, the PNET requires that states rely on [[national technical means of verification]], share information on explosions, and grant on-site access to counterparties. The TTBT and PNET did not enter into force for the US and Soviet Union until 11 December 1990.&lt;ref name=pnetreaty&gt;{{cite web |title=Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty (PNET) |url=https://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/pne1.html#1 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |access-date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gorbachev and Reagan 1987-9.jpg|thumb|250px|Reagan and Gorbachev, December 1987]]

In October 1977, the US, UK, and Soviet Union returned to negotiations over a test ban. These three nuclear powers made notable progress in the late 1970s, agreeing to terms on a ban on all testing, including a temporary prohibition on PNEs, but continued disagreements over the compliance mechanisms led to an end to negotiations ahead of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration as President in 1981.&lt;ref name=faschron /&gt; In 1985, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced a unilateral testing moratorium, and in December 1986, Reagan reaffirmed US commitment to pursue the long-term goal of a comprehensive test ban. In November 1987, negotiations on a test ban restarted, followed by a joint US-Soviet program to research underground-test detection in December 1987.&lt;ref name=faschron /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Remotest Nevada, a Joint U.S. and Soviet Test |last=Blakeslee |first=Sandra |date=18 August 1988 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/18/world/in-remotest-nevada-a-joint-us-and-soviet-test.html |access-date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations==
Given the political situation prevailing in the subsequent decades, little progress was made in nuclear disarmament until the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991. Parties to the PTBT held an amendment conference that year to discuss a proposal to convert the Treaty into an instrument banning all nuclear-weapon tests. With strong support from the UN General Assembly, negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty began in 1993.

===Adoption===
Extensive efforts were made over the next three years to draft the Treaty text and its two annexes. However, the [[Conference on Disarmament]], in which negotiations were being held, did not succeed in reaching consensus on the adoption of the text. Under the direction of Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]], [[Australia]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} then sent the text to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in [[New York City|New York]], where it was submitted as a draft resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty: draft resolution|url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=X204697124L65.19785&amp;profile=bibga&amp;uri=full=3100001~!396802~!33&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon#focus|access-date=3 December 2011|date=6 September 1996|work=[[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 1996, the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was adopted by a large majority, exceeding two-thirds of the General Assembly's Membership.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/50/ares50-245.htm|title=Resolution adopted by the general assembly:50/245.

==Monitoring==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--first two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
[[geophysics|Geophysical]] and other technologies are used to monitor for compliance with the Treaty: [[forensic seismology]], [[hydrophone|hydroacoustics]], [[infrasound]], and [[radionuclide]] monitoring. The technologies are used to monitor the underground, the waters and the atmosphere for any sign of a nuclear explosion. Statistical theories and methods are integral to CTBT monitoring providing confidence in verification analysis. Once the Treaty enters into force, on-site inspection will be provided for where concerns about compliance arise.

The [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission|Preparatory Commission]] for the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO), an international organization headquartered in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], was created to build the verification regime, including establishment and provisional operation of the network of monitoring stations, the creation of an international data centre, and development of the On Site Inspection capability.

The monitoring network consists of 337 facilities located all over the globe. As of May 2012, more than 260 facilities have been certified. The monitoring stations register data that is transmitted to the international data centre in Vienna for processing and analysis. The data are sent to states that have signed the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2009/us-nuclear-security-administrator-dagostinovisits-the-ctbto/|title=US nuclear security administrator dagostino visits the CTBTO|access-date=4 December 2011|date=15 September 2009|work=[[CTBTO Preparatory Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent nuclear testing===
Three countries have tested nuclear weapons since the CTBT opened for signature in 1996. India and Pakistan both carried out two sets of tests in 1998. North Korea carried out six announced tests, one each in 2006, 2009, 2013, two in 2016 and one in 2017. All six North Korean tests were picked up by the International Monitoring System set up by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission. A North Korean test is believed to have taken place in January 2016, evidenced by an "artificial earthquake" measured as a magnitude 5.1 by the U.S. Geological Survey. The first successful North Korean hydrogen bomb test supposedly took place September 2017. It was estimated to have an explosive yield of 120 kilotons .&lt;ref name=highlight&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]]|year=2012|url= http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/highlights/2007/the-ctbt-verification-regime-put-to-the-test-the-event-in-the-dprk-on-9-october-2006/page-1/?Fsize=atextonly%3D1 |title= Highlight 2007: The CTBT Verification Regime Put to the Test – The Event in the DPRK on 9 October 2006 |access-date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]]|year=2012|url= http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/highlights/2009/experts-sure-about-nature-of-the-dprk-event/?Fsize=atextonly%3D1|title= Press Release June 2009: Experts Sure About Nature of the DPRK Event|access-date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=North Korea announces it conducted nuclear test |publisher=CNN |last=McKirdy |first=Euan |date=6 January 2016 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/asia/north-korea-seismic-event/ |access-date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=North Korea claims successful hydrogen bomb test |publisher=CNBC |date=3 September 2017 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/03/north-korea-claims-successful-hydrogen-bomb-test.html |access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Competition law}}

'''Conscious parallelism''' is a term used in [[competition law]] to describe pricing strategies among competitors in an [[oligopoly]] that occurs without an actual agreement between the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eui.eu/RSCAS/Research/Competition/2006(pdf)/200610-COMPed-Allendesalazar.pdf |title=Oligopolies, Conscious Parallelism and Concertatio |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, one competitor will take the lead in raising or lowering prices. The others will then follow suit, raising or lowering their prices by the same amount, with the understanding that greater profits result.

This practice can be harmful to consumers who, if the market power of the firm is used, can be forced to pay monopoly prices for goods that should be selling for only a little more than the cost of production. Nevertheless, it is very hard to prosecute because it may occur without any collusion between the competitors. Courts have held that no violation of the antitrust laws occurs where firms independently raise or lower prices, but that a violation can be shown when "plus factors" occur, such as firms being motivated to collude and taking actions against their own economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;
Kevin Scott Marshall, Stephen H. Kalos, ''The Economics of Antitrust Injury and Firm-specific Damages'' (2008), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used to describe industry-wide assumption of terms other than price. For example, all competitors in an industry might make only long-term leases of products such as heavy machinery, leaving lessors with no opportunity to make a short-term lease of that product from any competitor.

is a nascent movement in real estate development that preserves and invests in agricultural land use.  As farmland is lost due to the challenging economics of farming and the pressures of the real estate industry, DSA attempts to reconcile the need for development with the need to preserve agricultural land. The overall goal of DSA is to incubate small-scale organic farms that co-exist with residential land development, providing benefits to farmers, residents, the local community, and the environment.

A related term, ''agricultural urbanism'', refers to agricultural operations located in proximity to and integrated with urban areas.  The term of agricultural urbanism was coined by Mark Holland and Janine de la Salle, and is based on their book by the same name, published by Green Frigate Press in 2010 (De la Salle and Holland et al.).  The term and concept of Agricultural Urbanism was originally developed in British Columbia in 2008 during a planning process for a development project called Southlands in South Delta, Metro Vancouver and was introduced to planner, real estate developer, and founder of the New Urbanism movement, Andres Duany, as part of the preparation for a design charrette which Duany and his team were involved in. 

Two academics who authored a chapter (Patrick Condon from UBC and Kent Mulnix from Kwantlen Polytechnic) posited the original idea of using development to support agriculture by using mechanisms such as transferring density rights from agricultural land onto adjacent areas and preserving the agricultural land through covenants while harvesting the development land value in the adjacent area that received the transferred development rights. 

Andres Duany has been a significant proponent of the idea as well as the author of a similar stream of thought called Agrarain Urbanism.  Duany’s adoption of the concept has given it a higher profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawley|first=Steve|title=Agricultural Urbanism:Transects and Food Planning|url=http://www.houstontomorrow.org/initiatives/story/agricultural-urbanism/|publisher=HoustonTomorrow|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The term ''development-supported agriculture'' (DSA) was coined to describe the Harvest project. A variety of individuals collaborated on the project, including planner Duane Verner, developer Nathan Wieler, members of Piedmont Biofuels, participants in the Sustainable Agriculture program at Central Carolina Community College, and others. The group set out to determine the best usage for an existing farm that was being sold by the owner, a career farmer named Paul McCoy. It became clear that the group had an opportunity to create a unique residential community where farmers and residents have a symbiotic relationship. This relationship would benefit all involved, while also improving the general state of residential development and helping to reduce the ecological destruction associated with typical residential development models. Reynolds &amp; Jewell Landscape Architecture was retained to design the master plan for the community, and the team grew to include experienced organic farmers, experts on native plants, and others. As of July 2008, the developer is actively implementing the master plan, and response to the concept has been overwhelmingly positive.

==DSA and CSA==

Development-supported agriculture has its roots in the [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) movement. However, whereas CSA typically focuses on establishing a direct business relationship between consumers and farmers, DSA builds on a [[barter]] approach first and foremost, while also ensuring that products from DSA farms are integrated into the local economy. On a more general level, DSA is a response to concerns about the urbanization of agricultural land and an attempt to preserve existing farms. Another goal of DSA is to establish a new generation of farmers by using the revenue from real estate development to establish small-scale organic farms that are protected in perpetuity by conservation easements and property covenants.

== Five points of DSA ==

Development-supported agriculture is based on the concept of a master-planned residential development with farming as the central amenity. This model provides residents with the benefits of, and the opportunity to experience, small-scale organic farming. Property owners have the option of participating in the farming or leasing their land to a farmer; in either case, the farmland is protected from development. Homesites are restricted to certain areas and continuous areas of open space are maintained across multiple properties.

In the spirit of [[Le Corbusier| Le Corbusier's]] "Five Points of a New Architecture," DSA focuses on five core principles:

# Preservation of farmland through limited development and continuity of previous farming uses.
# Agreements between developers and farmers (development provides farm infrastructure, farmers provide farm products to residents and the local community).
# Low-impact development techniques, sustainable architecture, and careful ecological/environmental planning.
# Establishment of wildlife corridors and animal habitats, promotion of native plant species, and protection of water quality.
# Utilization of an open-source development model that provides a framework for master-planned farm communities and integrated local food systems.

== Examples ==

=== Developments in the urban-rural fringe ===

'''Harvest, North Carolina'''

Harvest&lt;ref&gt;http://wieler.com/communities/harvest/overview/&lt;/ref&gt; is a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} development introduced in 2008, sited in the [[New Hope River Valley]] in [[Chatham County, North Carolina]].  The development consists of 20 individual properties with an organic farm as the literal and metaphorical center of the community.  A farmbelt easement protects farmland and preserves rural views.

According to Paul McCoy, the previous owner of the land, the Harvest property had been used for farming since the American Revolution.  During the middle of the 20th century, the primary use of the farm was for growing tobacco.  In the late 20th century, the farm was used to grow a typical rotation of tobacco, corn, and soybeans. In 2008, the developer of Harvest began transitioning the farm from conventional operations to organic certification. The change from commercial (i.e. using pesticides) to organic farming will help protect the water quality of nearby Jordan Lake and the Haw River. 

'''Serenbe, Georgia'''

Another example of an urban-rural fringe project that fits into the DSA framework is [[Serenbe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serenbecommunity.com/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; This community is located on one of the last undeveloped parcels of land in the [[Atlanta]] area. The founders of Serenbe realized that their largely untouched {{convert|900|acre|km2}} presented a window of opportunity for creating a unique type of residential development. A {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} organic farm is located at Serenbe that provides organic produce throughout Atlanta and The Chattahoochee Hill Country. The {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of Serenbe lie in the heart of {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} protected with a master plan that calls for 80% green space. Building sites are limited to 220 structures, including live/work spaces and commercial buildings.

'''Middle Green Valley, Solano County, CA'''

One of the largest and most recent examples of development-supported agriculture is in Middle Green Valley in southwestern Solano County, California.  
The City of Fairfield to the south, and unincorporated Solano County to the north, have continued to entitle subdivisions while Green Valley has remained largely undeveloped agricultural land and open space.  Like many places at the edge of suburban boundaries, there has been a longstanding conflict between the open space desired by neighbors and development rights desired by landowners.  The landowners in this part of Green Valley have been under pressure to preserve the rural culture, even as the basic economics of agriculture have eroded the financial viability of their lands.  Usually, the only viable choice was to develop their property to realize economic benefit.  Many of the landowners, some whose families have cultivated the land for over 150 years, wished to realize the development value while at the same time maintain the integrity of the open space, agricultural productivity and the farming legacy.

In 2010, at significant cost and with no guarantee of success, the Solano County Board of Supervisors – with meaningful participation from landowners AND neighborhood groups – approved a Specific Plan for Middle Green Valley.  The final plan includes more than 1,400 acres of protected agricultural and open space and a small village of about 400 clustered homes that are shielded from the main views from Green Valley Road.  Over 15 different land owners covering almost 200 acres signed the Master Development Agreement putting this plan into place.  The entire Specific Plan can be obtained at: 

http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/rm/documents/eir/middle_green_valley_specific_plan.asp

Preserving the rural beauty and cultural legacy of the Green Valley area is the guiding vision in crafting a long term, equitable, and sustainable development plan. The Specific Plan celebrates and perpetuates the tradition of the working landscapes that characterize this part of Solano County for over 150 years. A core component is the promotion of sustainable food and agriculture systems as a means to connect agricultural lands, the built and natural environments, community health and natural resource stewardship.

The Green Valley Agricultural Conservancy

To provide assurances for the long-term preservation and management of the open space, the Middle Green Valley Specific Plan envisioned the creation of a non-profit Conservancy (the GVAC) to oversee the ±1,490 acres of productive agricultural land, pastures, and natural areas. The Conservancy has three primary areas of responsibility:

* Assisting and encouraging the farms in Green Valley;
* Overseeing the management, stewardship, enhancement, restoration and access easements for conservation lands; and
* Managing and developing a design review process for the community 

One of the first tangible initiatives by the Conservancy to promote and support local farmers and artisans has been the creation of Totally Local - a new Certified Farmers' Market (CFM) - that was started in July 2011. The Green Valley Farmers' Market provides a community gathering place to share a cup of coffee, meet the local farmers, taste some great local food, and simply have some conversation with neighbors. The Conservancy’s goal is not to compete with, but rather compliment the already established food stands and local artisans in the region to help provide a stable platform for featuring LOCAL agricultural and artisan products.

=== Urban agricultural developments ===

East Lake Commons&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagehabitat.com/project_menu/east_lake/east_lake.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} cohousing community planned by Village Habitat Design located {{convert|4|mi|km}} from downtown Atlanta.

Southeast False Creek and Olympic Village&lt;ref&gt;http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/&lt;/ref&gt; is an {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} sustainable development project near downtown [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] that includes an urban agriculture component.

=== Future possibilities: vertical farming ===

[[Vertical farming]], also known as skyfarming, is a conceptual form of agriculture done in urban high-rises. In these high-rises, food such as fruit, vegetables, fish, and livestock can be raised by using greenhouse growing methods and recycled resources year-round, allowing cities of the future to become self-sufficient. The concept of the vertical farm remains mostly hypothetical; however, many people believe that this type of development will become necessary as a result of increased [[urban density]] and rising energy costs.

The '''Constitution of Dáil Éireann''' ({{lang-ga|Bunreacht Dála Éireann}}), more commonly known as the '''Dáil Constitution''', was the constitution of the 1919–22 [[Irish Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the First Dáil|url=http://www.firstdail.com/?page_id=51/?page_id=51|publisher=www.firstdail.com|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted by the [[First Dáil]] at its first meeting on 21 January 1919 and remained in force for four years. As adopted it consisted of only five short articles. Article 1 declared that the Dáil had "full powers to legislate" and would consist of representatives elected in elections conducted by the British government. For the exercise of [[executive (government)|executive power]] it created a cabinet, answerable to the Dáil, called the [[Aireacht]] (or Ministry), headed by a prime minister called the "Príomh Aire" (in practice also known as the [[President of Dáil Éireann]]). The constitution made no reference to a [[judiciary]] but this did not prevent the Dáil from establishing a system of [[Dáil Courts]]. The final article of the constitution declared that it was intended to be a provisional document, in the sense that it was subject to amendment. As adopted the constitution came to only around 370 words. In comparison, the modern [[Constitution of Ireland]] has approximately 16,000 words. Overall, the structure of the document was roughly as follows:

*'''Article 1:''' [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|Dáil Éireann]]
*'''Article 2:''' [[Aireacht|Ministry]]
*'''Article 3:''' [[Ceann Comhairle|Chairman of the Dáil]]
*'''Article 4:''' Finance
*'''Article 5:''' Amendments

As first adopted the Dáil Constitution made no provision for a [[head of state]]. Some deputies believed that the Dáil did not have authority to elect a President of the Republic and that there should be a direct election for the post. It was also the case that [[Sinn Féin]] had almost split between monarchists and republicans at its 1917 [[Ardfheis]]. However, in August 1921 the constitution was amended to state, vaguely, that the cabinet would be headed by "the President who shall also be Prime Minister". This allowed the then head of government, [[Éamon de Valera]], to begin using the title ''President of the Republic''. However, after de Valera left office in 1922 leaders resumed the practice of using the lesser title ''President of Dáil Éireann''. The constitution provided that it could be amended in the same way it had been adopted, by a simple resolution of the Dáil. Changes were made to the document on two dates:

*'''1 April 1919''': Five amendments were made to the constitution on this day. These included adding provision for a deputy president called the "President-Substitute" and for the appointment of Minister-Substitutes. The cabinet was also increased from four members to "not more than nine". A minor change was made to the dates for the auditing of government accounts in Article 4.
*'''25 August 1921''': A single constitutional amendment was adopted, which altered the title of the head of government, so he could be referred to as the 'President of the Republic', and reduced the cabinet to six members. The amendment also made further changes to the dates mentioned in Article 4.

The constitution's close modelling of its institutional system on the [[Westminster system]] of government, specifically with the inclusion of a parliament from whom a ministry was both chosen and to whom it was answerable, has been noted by [[Ireland|Irish]] political scientists and historians, notably Professor [[Brian Farrell (broadcaster)|Brian Farrell]], who suggested that the leaders of the new state stuck to a system that, through Irish participation in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the new Irish political elite had close experience of, and identification with, notwithstanding their radical [[republicanism|republican]] rhetoric.

In 1922 after the ratification of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the institutions mentioned in the Dáil Constitution began to operate in parallel with a rival set of structures. In order to implement the Treaty the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] adopted the [[Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922|Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922]]. This provided for an executive, called the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government]], and a "house of parliament" to which it would be accountable. However, in practice the two systems of government were eventually merged. When the "house of parliament" was convened in 1922 it was treated by those in attendance as the [[Third Dáil]], and its first act was to merge the Provisional Government and the Ministry of the Dáil into a single cabinet. The Dáil Constitution finally became defunct when the new [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] came into force on 6 December 1922.

[[File:ETicketAirline.png|thumb|250px|A sample itinerary for an [[open jaw]] electronic ticket from Montreal to Amsterdam, and returning from Munich]]

An '''electronic ticket''' (commonly abbreviated as '''e-ticket''') is the [[digital ticket]] equivalent of a paper ticket. The term is most commonly associated with airline issued tickets. Electronic ticketing for urban or rail [[public transport]] is usually referred to as [[travel card]] or [[transit pass]]. It is also used in ticketing in the entertainment industry.

An electronic ticket system is a more efficient method of ticket entry, processing and marketing for companies in the airline, railways and other transport and entertainment industries.

==Airline ticket==
E-tickets in the airline industry were devised in about 1994,&lt;REF&gt;{{cite web|title=IATA Press Release No.: 25, Date: 31 May 2008|URL=https://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2008-31-05-01.aspx}}&lt;/REF&gt; and have now largely replaced the older multi-layered paper ticketing systems. Since 1 June 2008, it has been mandatory for [[IATA]] members to use e-ticketing. Where paper tickets are still available, some airlines charge a fee for issuing paper tickets.

When a reservation is confirmed, the airline keeps a record of the booking in its [[computer reservations system]]. Customers can print out or may be provided with a copy of a e-ticket itinerary receipt which contains the [[record locator]] or reservation number and the e-ticket number. It is possible to print multiple copies of an e-ticket itinerary receipt.

Besides providing itinerary details, an e-ticket itinerary receipt also contains:
* An official ticket number (including the airline's 3-digit ticketing code,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kovrik.com/sib/travel/airline-codes.txt Airline codes and ticketing codes]&lt;/ref&gt; a 4-digit form number, a 6-digit serial number, and sometimes a check digit).
* Carriage terms and conditions, (or at least a reference to them)
* Fare and tax details, including fare calculation details and some additional data such as tour codes. The exact cost might not be stated, but a "fare basis" code will always identify the fare used.
* A short summary of fare restrictions, usually specifying only whether change or refund are permitted but not the penalties to which they are subject.
* Form of payment.
* Issuing office.
* Baggage allowance.

===Checking in with an e-ticket===
Passengers with e-tickets are required to [[Airport check-in|check-in at the airport]] for a flight in the usual manner, except that they may be required to present an e-ticket itinerary receipt or [[personal identification]], such as a  passport, or credit card. Producing a print-out of an e-ticket itinerary receipt may be required to enter the terminal of some airports or to satisfy immigration regulations in some countries.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The introduction of e-tickets has allowed for various enhancements to checking-in processes.

====Self-service and remote check-in====
* online/telephone/self-service kiosk [[Airport check-in|check-in]] (if the airline makes this option available)
* early check-in
* printing boarding passes at airport kiosks and at locations other than an airport
* delivery of boarding pass bar-codes via SMS or email to a mobile device

Several websites assist people holding e-tickets to check in online in advance of the twenty-four-hour airline restriction. These sites store a passenger's flight information and then when the airline opens up for online check-in the data is transferred to the airline and the boarding pass is emailed back to the customer. With this e-ticket technology, if a passenger receives his boarding pass remotely and is travelling without check-in luggage, he may bypass traditional counter check-in.

===E-ticket limitations===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2007}}
The ticketing systems of most airlines are only able to produce e-tickets for itineraries of no more than 16 segments, including surface segments. This is the same limit that applied to paper tickets.

Another critical limitation is that at the time e-tickets were initially designed, most airlines still practiced [[product bundling]]. By the time the industry began 100% e-ticket implementation, more and more airlines began to unbundle previously included services (like checked baggage) and add them back in as optional fees ([[ancillary revenue]]). However, the e-ticket standard did not anticipate and did not include a standardized mechanism for such optional fees.

IATA later implemented the [[Electronic Miscellaneous Document]] (EMD) standard for such information.  This way, airlines could consistently expose and capture such fees at time of booking through travel reservation systems, rather than having to surprise passengers with them at check-in.

===IATA mandated transition===
As part of the [[IATA Simplifying the Business]] initiative, the association instituted a program to switch the industry to 100% electronic ticketing. The program concluded on June 1, 2008, with the association saying that the resulting industry savings were approximately US$3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/stb/Pages/e-ticketing.aspx|title=IATA - E-Ticketing|first=|last=IATA|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] Board of Governors set the end of 2007 as the deadline for airlines to make the transition to 100% electronic ticketing for tickets processed through the IATA billing and settlement plan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/events/agm/2004/newsroom/fact3.htm|title=IATA - Page not found|first=|last=IATA|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2007, the deadline was extended to May 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/fact_sheets/et-deadline-extension.htm|title=100% Electronic Ticketing Deadline Extension to 31 May 2008|publisher=IATA|accessdate=2009-06-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210094053/http://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/fact_sheets/et-deadline-extension.htm|archivedate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 1, 2008 paper tickets can no longer be issued on neutral stock by agencies reporting to their local [[Billing and Settlement Plan|BSP]]. Agents reporting to the [[Airlines Reporting Corporation|ARC]] using company-provided stock or issuing tickets on behalf of an airline ([[General Sales Agent|GSAs]] and ticketing offices) are not subject to that restriction.

The industry was unable to comply with the IATA mandate and paper tickets remain in circulation as of February 2009.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Train tickets==
[[Amtrak]] started offering electronic tickets on all train routes on 30 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrak.com/eticketing-your-ride-is-just-a-barcode-away|title=eTickets Available on All Train Routes - Amtrak|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tickets can be ordered over the internet and printed (as a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file), printed at a Quik-Trak kiosk, or at the ticket counter at the station. Electronic tickets can also be held in a smart phone and shown to the conductor using an app. Mobile tickets are common with operators of US commuter train networks (e.g. MTA LIRR and Metro North) but they are usually only offered on the US version of the App Store and only accept US-issued credit cards as the app's payment page asks the user for the credit card's [[ZIP code]] to complete the purchase.   

Several European train operators also offer self-printable or downloadable tickets. Often tickets can also be delivered by SMS or MMS. Railway operators in other countries also issue electronic tickets. The national operators of Denmark and Netherlands have a nationwide system where [[RFID]] [[smartcard]]s are used as train tickets.  In the UK, the issuance of printable or mobile tickets  is at the discretion of train operators and is often available for advanced tickets only (i.e. valid only on a specific train).  This is very common in Europe for local urban rail, such as [[rapid transit]]/metros.{{cn|date=January 2017}}  

In [[India]], an [[text message|SMS]] sent by the [[Indian Railways]], along with a valid [[proof of identity]] is considered equivalent to a ticket.&lt;ref name="irctc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Now, SMS from IRCTC is equivalent to e-ticket |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/now-sms-from-irctc-is-equivalent-to-eticket/article2936651.ece |date=27 February 2012 |location=Hubli |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate=Dec 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport, concert, and cinema tickets==
Many sport, concert venues, and cinemas use electronic ticketing for their events. Electronic tickets, or "eTickets" as they are sometimes referred, are often delivered as PDFs or another downloadable format that can be received via email or through a mobile app. Electronic tickets allow spectators to download their tickets, as opposed to waiting for physical tickets to arrive in the mail. A printed copy of these tickets or a digital copy on a mobile phone should be presented on coming to the venue. These tickets now normally also have a [[barcode]], which may be scanned on entry into the venue to streamline crowd processing. Electronic tickets have become increasingly prevalent in the entertainment industry over the last decade.  

In some cases, spectators who want to see a match may not need a printable electronic ticket. If someone with a membership to a football team books a ticket online, the member can just verify his/her reservation with a membership card at the entrance. This is common with teams in the English Premiership League.

== Implementations ==&lt;!--alternative title/approach: == Unified ticket ==--&gt;
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}
In January 2017 it was reported that Germany's [[Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure|Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure]], [[Alexander Dobrindt]] wants to create an electronic ticket to connect public bus and train services as well as parking spaces and potentially [[car-sharing]] services across all cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany plans nationwide e-ticket for all city transport|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20170106/germany-plans-nationwide-e-ticket-for-all-cities|publisher=The Local|accessdate=6 January 2017|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Öffentlicher Nahverkehr: Dobrindt plant digitale Fahrkarte für alle Städte|url=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2017-01/verkehrsminister-alexander-dobrindt-eticket-oepnv|publisher=Die Zeit|accessdate=6 January 2017|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Extradition}}
'''[[Extradition]] law in [[Australia]]''' is the formal process by which a [[fugitive]] found outside a [[jurisdiction]] is surrendered to the jurisdiction where an alleged offence has taken place for trial or punishment, under [[Australian law]]. This may include a process done within the country or one between Australia and another country.

==Interstate extradition==
The power to [[Extradition|extradite]] between and among the [[states and territories of Australia]] is conferred by s 51(xxiv) of the [[Australian Constitution]] which says that the [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]] shall, subject to the Constitution, have the power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the [[Commonwealth of Australia|Commonwealth]] with respect to (inter alia):
&lt;blockquote&gt;the service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States.&lt;ref name="s44"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|51}} Legislative powers of the Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interstate extradition procedures are governed by the ''Service and Execution of Process Act 1992'' (Cth), Part 5. Under the Act, a person named in an extradition warrant issued in any State may be arrested in accordance to that warrant in another State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|saeopa1992325|Service and Execution of Process Act 1992|82}}) Persons subject to warrants may be apprehended.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon apprehension, that person must be brought before a Magistrate of the State in which they were apprehended along with the warrant or a copy of the warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|saeopa1992325|Service and Execution of Process Act 1992|83}}) Procedure after apprehension.&lt;/ref&gt; The local jurisdiction has priority in respect of offences in that jurisdiction, so that a person charged or in prison in the jurisdiction must be processed and serve time before extradition to the other state.

==Extradition to and from Australia==
{{see also|List of Australian bilateral treaties on extradition and criminal matters}}
The ''Extradition Act 1988''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00794 ''Extradition Act 1988'']&lt;/ref&gt; governs the extradition to other countries of [[Fugitive|fugitives]] found in Australia. The law ratifies a series of [[Treaty|treaties]] to which Australia is a party with other countries, either in the right of the Commonwealth of Australia, by being bound by treaties which the [[United Kingdom]] executed on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, or multilateral treaties to which Australia is a signatory.

The absence of an extradition treaty does not, in theory, prevent the arrest or extradition to or from another country e.g. through the London Scheme for [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] member states, or through regulation (eg., [[Cambodia]]).&lt;ref name=extradlist&gt;[https://www.ag.gov.au/Internationalrelations/Internationalcrimecooperationarrangements/Documents/alphabetical-country-index.pdf ALPHABETICAL COUNTRY INDEX – AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CRIME COOPERATION RELATIONSHIPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Extradition between Australia and [[New Zealand]] is governed by a separate and distinct regime, known as the 'backing of warrants' system.

[[File:DifferingApportionment.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Different ways to apportion electoral districts]]
{{Elections}}

'''Gerrymandering''' is a practice intended to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating [[boundary delimitation|district boundaries]]. The resulting district is known as a '''gerrymander''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛr|i|ˌ|m|æ|n|d|ər|,_|ˈ|ɡ|ɛr|i|-}}); however, that word is also a verb for the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elster|first=Charles|title=The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|year=2005|page=224|isbn=9780618423156|oclc=317828351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict | gerrymander}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''gerrymandering'' has negative connotations. Two principal tactics are used in gerrymandering: "cracking" (i.e. diluting the voting power of the opposing party's supporters across many districts) and "packing" (concentrating the opposing party's voting power in one district to reduce their voting power in other districts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redistrictinggame.org/learnaboutmission2.php|title=The ReDistricting Game|last=|first=|date=|website=www.redistrictinggame.org|publisher=USCAnnenbergCenter|language=en|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third tactic, shown in the top-left diagram in the diagrams to the right, is that of [[homogenisation|homogenization]] of all districts.

In addition to its use achieving desired electoral results for a particular party, gerrymandering may be used to help or hinder a particular [[demographic]], such as a political, ethnic, racial, linguistic, religious, or class group, such as in U.S. federal voting district boundaries that produce a majority of constituents representative of African-American or other racial minorities, known as "[[majority-minority districts]]". Gerrymandering can also be used to protect [[incumbent]]s.

==Difference from malapportionment==

Gerrymandering should not be confused with [[malapportionment]], whereby the number of eligible voters per elected representative can vary widely without relation to how the boundaries are drawn. Nevertheless, the ''-mander'' suffix has been applied to particular malapportionments. Sometimes political representatives use both gerrymandering and malapportionment to try to maintain power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering {{!}} politics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/the-twisted-history-of-gerrymandering-in-american-politics/262369/|title=The Twisted History of Gerrymandering in American Politics|last=Barasch|first=Emily|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|250px|Printed in March 1812, this political cartoon was drawn in reaction to the newly drawn state senate election district of South Essex created by the Massachusetts legislature to favor the Democratic-Republican Party candidates of Governor Elbridge Gerry over the Federalists. The caricature satirizes the bizarre shape of a district in [[Essex County, Massachusetts]], as a dragon-like "monster". Federalist newspaper editors and others at the time likened the district shape to a salamander, and the word ''gerrymander'' was a blend of that word and Governor Gerry's last name.]]

The word gerrymander (originally written Gerry-mander) was used for the first time in the Boston Gazette (not to be confused with the original ''[[Boston Gazette]]'') on 26 March 1812. The word was created in reaction to a redrawing of [[Massachusetts]] state senate election districts under Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]]. In 1812, Gerry signed a bill that redistricted Massachusetts to benefit his [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. When mapped, one of the contorted districts in the Boston area was said to resemble the shape of a mythological [[salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]].&lt;ref name="Griffith 1907 72–73"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Elmer|title=The Rise and Development of the Gerrymander |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=6o2HAAAAMAAJ |page=73 }} |pages=72–73|location=Chicago |publisher=Scott, Foresman and Co |year=1907 |oclc=45790508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original gerrymander, and original 1812 gerrymander cartoon, depict the Essex South state senatorial district for the legislature of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Martis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martis |first=Kenneth C. |title=The Original Gerrymander |journal=[[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]] |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=833–839 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---and not a US congressional district--&gt;

Gerrymander is a [[portmanteau]] of the governor's last name and the word ''salamander''.

The redistricting was a notable success for Gerry's Democratic-Republican Party. Although in the 1812 election both the Massachusetts House and governorship were won by Federalists by a comfortable margin and cost Gerry his job, the redistricted state senate remained firmly in Democratic-Republican hands.&lt;ref name="Griffith 1907 72–73"/&gt;{{clarify|This doesn't relate the above statement that the gerrymandering was done to Congressional districts. The state senate is not mentioned there and the U.S. House is not mentioned here.|date=January 2015}}

The author of the term gerrymander may never be definitively established. Historians widely believe that the [[Federalist]] newspaper editors [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]], and Benjamin and John Russell coined the term, but the historical record does not have definitive evidence as to who created or uttered the word for the first time.&lt;ref name=Martis/&gt;

Appearing with the term, and helping spread and sustain its popularity, was a [[political cartoon]] depicting a strange animal with claws, wings and a dragon-like head satirizing the map of the oddly shaped district. This cartoon was most likely drawn by [[Elkanah Tisdale]], an early 19th-century painter, designer, and engraver who was living in Boston at the time.&lt;ref&gt;There is no evidence that the famous American portrait painter [[Gilbert Stuart]] had any involvement with either the design, drawing, or naming of the cartoon, or with the coining of the term. Detailed biographies and academic journal articles about Stuart make no reference to gerrymandering. The myth of Stuart's association with the original gerrymander has been reproduced and spread without verification or sources, from one reference book and Internet site to another. Modern scholars of Stuart agree that no proof exists to credit him with the term or cartoon and that he tended not to be involved with such issues. {{cite journal |first=Kenneth C. |last=Martis |title=The Original Gerrymander |journal=Political Geography |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=833–839 |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tisdale had the engraving skills to cut the woodblocks to print the original cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Brien |first=D. C. |title=Elkanah Tisdale: Designer, Engraver and Miniature Painter |journal=Connecticut Historical Bulletin |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=1984 |pages=83–96 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These woodblocks survive and are preserved in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. Original woodblocks for printing "Gerrymander" political cartoon. Geography and Map Reading Room. LCCN Permalink: http://lccn.loc.gov/2003620165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''gerrymander'' was reprinted numerous times in Federalist newspapers in Massachusetts, New England, and nationwide during the remainder of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;The word ''gerrymander'' was used again in two Boston-area papers the next day. The first usage outside of the immediate Boston area appeared in the ''[[Newburyport Herald]]'' (Massachusetts) on 31 March, and the first use outside of Massachusetts came in the ''Concord Gazette'' (New Hampshire) on 14 April 1812.

The first use outside of New England was published in the ''New York Gazette &amp; General Advertiser'' on 19 May. What may be the first use of the term to describe the [[redistricting]] in another state (Maryland) occurred in the ''Federal Republican'' (Georgetown, D.C.)&lt;!-- Georgetown was technically distinct from the city of Washington until 1871. --&gt; on 12 October 1812. All in all, there are at least 80 known citations of the word from March through December 1812 in American newspapers. {{cite journal |first=Kenneth C. |last=Martis |title=The Original Gerrymander |journal=Political Geography |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=833–839 |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests some organized activity of the Federalists to disparage Governor Gerry in particular, and the growing Democratic-Republican party in general. ''Gerrymandering'' soon began to be used to describe not only the original Massachusetts example, but also other cases of district shape manipulation for partisan gain in other states. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' the word's acceptance was marked by its publication in a dictionary (1848) and in an encyclopedia (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J. A., Weiner, E. S. C.  "Gerrymander",  ''Oxford English Dictionary.''  New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the letter ''g'' of the eponymous ''Gerry'' is pronounced with a hard g {{IPA|/ɡ/}} as in ''get'', the word ''gerrymander'' was originally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɛr|i|m|æ|n|d|ər}}. However, pronunciation as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛr|i|m|æ|n|d|ər}}, with a soft g {{IPA|/dʒ/}} as in ''gentle,'' has become the accepted pronunciation.

From time to time, other names are given the "-mander" suffix to tie a particular effort to a particular politician or group. These include the 1852 [[Andrew Johnson#Congressman (1843–1853)|"Henry-mandering"]], "Jerrymander" (referring to California Governor [[Jerry Brown]]),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hofeller, "[http://www.politico.com/pdf/PPM116_rnc_hofeller_memo_051010.pdf The Looming Redistricting Reform; How will the Republican Party Fare?]", ''Politico'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; "Perrymander" (a reference to Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=David Wasserman |date=19 August 2011 |title='Perrymander': Redistricting Map That Rick Perry Signed Has Texas Hispanics Up in Arms |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/-perrymander-redistricting-map-that-rick-perry-signed-has-texas-hispanics-up-in-arms-20110819 |magazine=National Journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509195817/http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/-perrymander-redistricting-map-that-rick-perry-signed-has-texas-hispanics-up-in-arms-20110819 |archive-date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Gersh |date=21 September 2011 |title=Redistricting Journal: Showdown in Texas—reasons and implications for the House, and Hispanic vote |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20109665-503544.html |work=CBS News |access-date= 2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "[[Tullymander]]" (after the Irish politician [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Voting systems==
Gerrymandering is used most often in favor of ruling incumbents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michel Balinski]] |date=2008 |title=Fair Majority Voting (or How to Eliminate Gerrymandering) |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=115 |doi=10.1080/00029890.2008.11920503 |pages=97 |quote=Incumbent candidates, in tailored districts, are almost certain of reelection (over 98% in 2002, over 94% in 2006).}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a specific political party—the one drawing the map. Societies whose legislatures use a single-winner [[electoral system]] are the most likely to have political parties that gerrymander for advantage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Most notably, gerrymandering is particularly effective in non-proportional systems that tend towards fewer parties, such as ''[[first past the post]]''.

In [[Proportional representation|proportional-election systems]], where political parties are represented in proportion to the total numbers of votes they receive, gerrymandering has little or less significance.  In voting systems where an electorate is not divided into individual constituencies, but is instead polled as one district (for instance, elections to the Israeli [[Knesset]], or to the [[European Parliament]] in [[Germany]]) gerrymandering is entirely irrelevant.  Note, however, that it is possible to gerrymander the result of an election to a national/electorate-wide office where that election's electoral system is not based on a direct suffrage, but instead operates some form of constituent-parts voting system; for example national elections in the [[Roman Republic]] (consular etc.) saw voters placed into "tribes" (constituent voting blocks), with each tribe voting as a unit to endorse particular candidates.  The poor voters tended to be huddled together in a few tribes whilst the rich interest was spread out across many.  The effect was a structure which explicitly benefited the [[Optimates]] (traditionalist) faction over the more progressive [[Populares]] alignment, since the former tended to draw more of its support from the Roman aristocracy and equestrian classes, whilst candidates for the latter drew their strength from the lower plebeian orders.

Some countries, such as Australia, [[Canada]], and the UK, authorize non-partisan organizations to set constituency boundaries in an attempt to prevent gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is most common in countries where elected politicians are responsible for defining constituency boundaries. They have an obvious and immediate interest in the outcome of the process.

===Introduction of inadvertent bias in voting systems over time===

Where an electoral system has not changed over time, it is possible that the interplay between a static voting structure and changing demographics will introduce disproportionality into the system.  Most obviously, this can manifest itself by a simple transfer of the population; for instance in Japan the constituencies for the [[National Diet]] have failed to reflect the growth in urban areas in recent decades; in a circumstance such as this the boundaries will need to be re-homogenised to effect equal voting power across electors.

A more complicated example is where a system is specifically designed (even on a good faith basis) to ensure that it has modifications to the principle of one person, one (equal) vote: for instance by granting multiple votes to a certain demographic, or to certain geographical areas.  If the circumstances which led to such rules being adopted have changed, it can inadvertently prejudice the outcome.  A real world illustration of this is the system for electing the [[President of the United States]], which unlike most other directly-elected heads of state (such as the [[President of France|Presidency]] of [[France]]) operates through an electorate college rather than simple suffrage by the voting population.  The American [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] grants a disproportionate benefit in favour of rural voters because each [[US State|state]] is entitled to a minimum proportion of votes in the electoral college total.  Note that this example is inadvertent, having arisen by the forces of history and not design, since the relevant [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|constitutional provision]] was adopted prior to the [[Industrial Revolution in the United States|industrial revolution]] in that country, which altered the demographics to create the bias.

It should, however, be noted that where a system is created on a good faith basis to have modifications to a basic one person one vote structure, it is possible that changing circumstances will inadvertently (from the basis of the structure's designers) lead to gerrymandering. For example, in Northern Ireland local government elections prior to the 1960s, the voting system was designed to allow those who paid higher amounts of [[Rates in the United Kingdom|rates]] to have more than one vote, with additional votes per amount paid (up to a cap). This system was designed with a bias in mind: to advance the interests of the wealthy. The system's originator, (the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]), which was by background and inclination primarily an upper middle-class party, was quite open about this and were of the view that it was a proper goal in and of itself (the thinking being that those who contributed more had more of a stake). In this sense, though politically contentious, the system was introduced on a good faith basis - in such sense not being a true gerrymander.  However, by the 1960s changing demographics through movement of sectarian minorities into previously uniform districts, coupled with rising minority awareness in Northern Ireland, had revealed a more latent bias: that [[Protestantism|Protestants]] tended to be wealthier (in part, possibly, due to wider discrimination in society), and thus had more votes per capita. The result was that Catholics had reduced influence on local government elections, even in those districts where they might be expected to exert control. As such, they were de facto discriminated against, though this was not the primary intention ab initio.

Both the American and Northern Irish examples show that, as a system becomes biased as a passive process, such changes have the capacity to alter the attitude of operatives within it from good to bad faith actors. In America, factions approve the outsized voting strength of rural voters, because they tend to be more conservative which suits the inclination of some Republicans. In Northern Ireland, the system which kept Protestants in a position of advantage was defended on that basis, though it was known to be for discriminatory purposes only.

==Gerrymandering tactics==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Elkanah Tisdale, The Gerry-Mander Map, 1813 Cornell CUL PJM 1034 01.jpg|thumbnail|This satirical map reflects the origin of the word "gerrymander", by Elkanah Tisdale in 1813.]]
The primary goals of gerrymandering are to maximize the effect of supporters' votes and to minimize the effect of opponents' votes.  A partisan gerrymander's main purpose is to influence not only the districting statute but the entire corpus of legislative decisions enacted in its path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuck|first=Peter H.|date=1987|title=The Thickest Thicket: Partisan Gerrymandering and Judicial Regulation of Politics|jstor=1122527|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=87|issue=7|pages=1325–1384|doi=10.2307/1122527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These can be accomplished through a number of ways:&lt;ref name="ProP201111022"&gt;{{cite web

* "Cracking" involves spreading voters of a particular type among many districts in order to deny them a sufficiently large [[voting bloc]] in any particular district.&lt;ref name="ProP201111022"/&gt; Political parties in charge of redrawing district lines may create more "cracked" districts as a means of retaining, and possibly even expanding, their legislative power. By "cracking" districts, a political party would be able to maintain, or gain, legislative control by ensuring that the opposing party's voters are not the majority in specific districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/packing-cracking-supreme-court-takes-partisan-gerrymandering-090050994.html?_tsrc=jtc_news_index|title=Packing and cracking: The Supreme Court takes up partisan gerrymandering|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.policymap.com/2017/08/a-deeper-look-at-gerrymandering/|title=A Deeper Look at Gerrymandering {{!}} PolicyMap|date=2017-08-01|work=PolicyMap|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be to split the voters in an urban area among several districts wherein the majority of voters are suburban, on the presumption that the two groups would vote differently, and the suburban voters would be far more likely to get their way in the elections.
* "Packing" is to concentrate as many voters of one type into a single electoral district to reduce their influence in other districts.&lt;ref name="ProP201111022" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some cases, this may be done to obtain representation for a community of common interest (such as to create a [[majority-minority district]]), rather than to dilute that interest over several districts to a point of ineffectiveness (and, when minority groups are involved, to avoid likely lawsuits charging racial discrimination). When the party controlling the districting process has a statewide majority, packing is usually not necessary to attain partisan advantage; the minority party can generally be "cracked" everywhere. Packing is therefore more likely to be used for partisan advantage when the party controlling the districting process has a statewide minority, because by forfeiting a few districts packed with the opposition, cracking can be used in forming the remaining districts.
* "Hijacking" redraws two districts in such a way as to force two incumbents to run against each other in one district, ensuring that one of them will be eliminated.&lt;ref name="ProP201111022" /&gt;
* "Kidnapping" moves an incumbent's home address into another district.&lt;ref name="ProP201111022" /&gt; Reelection can become more difficult when the incumbent no longer resides in the district, or possibly faces reelection from a new district with a new voter base. This is often employed against politicians who represent multiple urban areas, in which larger cities will be removed from the district in order to make the district more rural.

These tactics are typically combined in some form, creating a few "forfeit" seats for packed voters of one type in order to secure more seats and greater representation for voters of another type. This results in candidates of one party (the one responsible for the gerrymandering) winning by small majorities in most of the districts, and another party winning by a large majority in only a few of the districts.

==Effects==

Gerrymandering is effective because of the [[wasted vote|wasted vote effect]]. ''Wasted votes'' are votes that did not contribute to electing a candidate, either because they were in excess of the bare minimum needed for victory or because the candidate lost. By moving geographic boundaries, the incumbent party packs opposition voters into a few districts they will already win, wasting the extra votes. Other districts are more tightly constructed with the opposition party allowed a bare minority count, thereby wasting all the minority votes for the losing candidate. These districts constitute the majority of districts and are drawn to produce a result favoring the incumbent party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/231865/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering - politics|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quantitative measure of the effect of gerrymandering is the [[wasted vote#Efficiency gap|efficiency gap]], computed from the difference in the wasted votes for two different political parties summed over all the districts. When the parties win district elections in rough proportion to their electoral popularity, the efficiency gap is near zero.&lt;ref name="82UofCLawReview"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stephanopoulos |first=Nicholas |last2=McGhee |first2=Eric |year=2014 |title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap |ssrn=2457468 |journal=University of Chicago Law Review |volume=82 |page=831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewRepublic20140702"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Stephanopoulos |first=Nicholas |date=July 2, 2014 |title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering |magazine=The New Republic |access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing in part an efficiency gap of 11.69% to 13%, a U.S. District Court in 2016 ruled against the 2011 drawing of Wisconsin legislative districts. In the 2012 election for the state legislature, that gap in wasted votes meant that one party had 48.6% of the two-party votes but won 61% of the 99 districts.&lt;ref name="nyt20161121"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/wisconsin-redistricting-found-to-unfairly-favor-republicans.html |title=Judges Find Wisconsin Redistricting Unfairly Favored Republicans |last=Wines |first=Michael |newspaper=New York Times |publication-date=Nov 21, 2016 |access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the wasted vote effect is strongest when a party wins by narrow margins across multiple districts, gerrymandering narrow margins can be risky when voters are less predictable. To minimize the risk of demographic or political shifts swinging a district to the opposition, politicians can create more packed districts, leading to more comfortable margins in unpacked ones.

===Effect on electoral competition===

[[File:Gerrymandering 9-6.png|thumb|How gerrymandering can influence electoral results on a [[Voting system#Nonproportional and semiproportional methods|non-proportional system]]. For a state with 3 equally sized districts, 15 voters and 2 parties: ''Plum'' (squares) and ''Orange'' (circles).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(a)''', creating 3 mixed-type districts yields a 3–0 win to ''Plum''—a disproportional result considering the statewide 9:6 ''Plum'' majority.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(b)''', ''Orange'' wins the urban district while ''Plum'' wins the rural districts—the 2–1 result reflects the statewide vote ratio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(c)''', gerrymandering techniques ensure a 2–1 win to the statewide minority ''Orange'' party.]]
&lt;!-- We should mention the claim that contention over districts creates a major distraction for the legislature --&gt;

Some political science research suggests that, contrary to common belief, gerrymandering does not decrease electoral competition, and can even increase it. Some say that, rather than packing the voters of their party into uncompetitive districts, party leaders tend to prefer to spread their party's voters into multiple districts, so that their party can win a larger number of races.&lt;ref&gt;Seth E. Masket, Jonathan Winburn and Gerald C. Wright, [https://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8469145&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1049096511001703 The Gerrymanderers Are Coming! Legislative Redistricting Won't Affect Competition or Polarization Much, No Matter Who Does It].&lt;/ref&gt; (See scenario '''(c)''' in the box.) This may lead to increased competition. Instead of gerrymandering, some researchers find that other factors, such as partisan polarization and the incumbency advantage, have driven the recent decreases in electoral competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forgette|first1=Richard|last2=Winkle|first2=John W.|title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Voting Rights Act*|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=March 2006|volume=87|issue=1|pages=155–173|doi=10.1111/j.0038-4941.2006.00374.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2009 study found that "congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarty|first1=Nolan|last2=Poole|first2=Keith T.|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Howard|title=Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization?|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=July 2009|volume=53|issue=3|pages=666–680|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~miaryc/PEW/Nolan_McCarty_PEWCaltech.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings are, however, a matter of some dispute. While gerrymandering may not decrease electoral competition in all cases, there are certainly instances where gerrymandering does reduce such competition.

One state in which gerrymandering has arguably had an adverse effect on electoral competition is California. In 2000, a bipartisan redistricting effort redrew congressional district lines in ways that all but guaranteed incumbent victories; as a result, California saw only one congressional seat change hands between 2000 and 2010. In response to this obvious gerrymandering, a 2010 referendum in California gave the power to redraw congressional district lines to the [[California Citizens Redistricting Commission]], which had been created to draw California State Senate and Assembly districts by another referendum in 2008. In stark contrast to the redistricting efforts that followed the 2000 census, the redistricting commission has created a number of the most competitive congressional districts in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |date=14 February 2012 |title=New Faces Set For California in the Capitol  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/us/california-congressional-delegation-braces-for-change.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased incumbent advantage and campaign costs===
The effect of gerrymandering for incumbents is particularly advantageous, as incumbents are far more likely to be reelected under conditions of gerrymandering. For example, in 2002, according to political scientists [[Norman Ornstein]] and [[Thomas E. Mann|Thomas Mann]], only four challengers were able to defeat incumbent members of the U.S. Congress, the lowest number in modern American history.&lt;ref name="7_buck_trust.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html |title=Iowa's Redistricting Process: An Example of the Right Way to Draw Legislative |publisher=Centrists.Org |date=22 July 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107114029/http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html |archivedate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incumbents are likely to be of the majority party orchestrating a gerrymander, and incumbents are usually easily renominated in subsequent elections, including incumbents among the minority.

Mann, a Senior Fellow of Governance Studies at the [[Brookings Institution]], has also noted that "Redistricting is a deeply political process, with incumbents actively seeking to minimize the risk to themselves (via bipartisan gerrymanders) or to gain additional seats for their party (via partisan gerrymanders)".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas E. "Redistricting Reform." The Brookings Institution. Brookings.edu, 1 June 2005. Web. 5 February 2013. &lt;http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2005/06/01politics-mann&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The bipartisan gerrymandering that Mann mentions refers to the fact that legislators often also draw distorted legislative districts even when such redistricting does not provide an advantage to their party.

Gerrymandering of state legislative districts can effectively guarantee an incumbent's victory by 'shoring up' a district with higher levels of partisan support, without disproportionately benefiting a particular political party. This can be highly problematic from a governance perspective, because forming districts to ensure high levels of partisanship often leads to higher levels of partisanship in legislative bodies. If a substantial number of districts are designed to be polarized, then those districts' representation will also likely act in a heavily partisan manner, which can create and perpetuate partisan gridlock.

This demonstrates that gerrymandering can have a deleterious effect on the principle of democratic accountability. With uncompetitive seats/districts reducing the fear that incumbent politicians may lose office, they have less incentive to represent the interests of their constituents, even when those interests conform to majority support for an issue across the electorate as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Incumbent politicians may look out more for their party's interests than for those of their constituents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Gerrymandering can affect campaign costs for district elections. If districts become increasingly stretched out, candidates must pay increased costs for transportation and trying to develop and present [[campaign advertising]] across a district.{{Citation needed|reason=April 2008|date=April 2008}} The incumbent's advantage in securing campaign funds is another benefit of his or her having a gerrymandered secure seat.

===Less descriptive representation===
Gerrymandering also has significant effects on the [[representation (politics)|representation]] received by voters in gerrymandered districts. Because gerrymandering can be designed to increase the number of wasted votes among the electorate, the relative representation of particular groups can be drastically altered from their actual share of the voting population. This effect can significantly prevent a gerrymandered system from achieving proportional and [[descriptive representation]], as the winners of elections are increasingly determined by who is drawing the districts rather than the preferences of the voters.

Gerrymandering may be advocated to improve representation within the legislature among otherwise underrepresented minority groups by packing them into a single district. This can be controversial, as it may lead to those groups' remaining marginalised in the government as they become confined to a single district. Candidates outside that district no longer need to represent them to win elections.

As an example, much of the redistricting conducted in the United States in the early 1990s involved the intentional creation of additional "majority-minority" districts where racial minorities such as African Americans were packed into the majority. This "maximization policy" drew support by both the Republican Party (who had limited support among African Americans and could concentrate their power elsewhere) and by minority representatives elected as Democrats from these constituencies, who then had safe seats. &lt;!-- cite a famous politician or political scientist that has a good quote of this here --&gt;

The 2012 election provides a number of examples as to how partisan gerrymandering can adversely affect the descriptive function of states' congressional delegations. In Pennsylvania, for example, Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives received 83,000 more votes than Republican candidates, yet the Republican-controlled redistricting process in 2010 resulted in Democrats losing to their Republican counterparts in 13 out of Pennsylvania's 18 districts.&lt;ref&gt;Ting, Jan C. "Boehner and House Republicans Lack Mandate to Oppose Obama." NewsWorks. NewsWorks.Org, 14 December 2012. Web. 5 February 2013.
[https://whyy.org/articles/boehner-and-house-republicans-lack-mandate-to-oppose-obama/]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seven states where Republicans had complete control over the redistricting process, Republican House candidates received 16.7 million votes and Democratic House candidates received 16.4 million votes. The redistricting resulted in Republican victories in 73 out of the 107 affected seats; in those 7 states, Republicans received 50.4% of the votes but won in over 68% of the congressional districts.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Sam. "The Great Gerrymander of 2012." The New York Times. 2 February 2013. Web. 5 February 2013.
[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html]
&lt;/ref&gt; While it is but one example of how gerrymandering can have a significant effect on election outcomes, this kind of disproportional representation of the public will seems to be problematic for the legitimacy of democratic systems, regardless of one's political affiliation.

In [[Michigan]], redistricting was constructed by a Republican Legislature in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Michigan|title=Redistricting in Michigan|work=ballotpedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal congressional districts were so designed that cities such as [[Battle Creek]], [[Grand Rapids]], [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], [[Kalamazoo]], [[Lansing]], and [[East Lansing]] were separated into districts with large conservative-leaning hinterlands that essentially diluted the Democratic votes in those cities in Congressional elections.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Since 2010 not one of those cities is within a district in which a Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives has a reasonable chance of winning, short of Democratic [[Landslide victory|landslide]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{clarify|reason=needs rewording. If only a Democratic landslide were needed, why wouldn't a majority vote do the trick? I think editor means "landslide in the respective cities to offset the outlying vote."|date=December 2014}}

===Incumbent gerrymandering===
Gerrymandering can also be done to help incumbents as a whole, effectively turning every district into a packed one and greatly reducing the potential for competitive elections. This is particularly likely to occur when the minority party has significant obstruction power—unable to enact a partisan gerrymander, the legislature instead agrees on ensuring their own mutual reelection.

In an unusual occurrence in 2000, for example, the two dominant parties in the state of California [[Redistricting in California|cooperatively redrew]] both state and Federal legislative districts to preserve the status quo, ensuring the electoral safety of the politicians from unpredictable voting by the electorate. This move proved completely effective, as no State or Federal legislative office changed party in the [[U.S. House election, 2004|2004 election]], although 53 congressional, 20 state senate, and 80 state assembly seats were potentially at risk.

In 2006, the term "70/30 District" came to signify the equitable split of two evenly split (i.e. 50/50) districts. The resulting districts gave each party a guaranteed seat and retained their respective power base.

===Prison-based gerrymandering===
Prison-based gerrymandering occurs when prisoners are counted as residents of a particular district, increasing the district's population with non-voters when assigning political apportionment. This phenomenon violates the principle of [[one person, one vote]] because, although many prisoners come from (and return to) urban communities, they are counted as "residents" of the rural districts that contain large prisons, thereby artificially inflating the political representation in districts with prisons at the expense of voters in all other districts without prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prison-Based Gerrymandering |url=http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2006/05/20/NYT-gerrymandering |newspaper=The New York Times |type=Editorial |date=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend that prisoners should not be counted as residents of their original districts when they do not reside there and are [[disenfranchisement|not legally eligible to vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Bill|first=Prison Policy|last=Initiative|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A11597.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Technical Amendment|first=Prison Policy|last=Initiative|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes to achieve competitive elections==
[[File:map22007.gif|thumb|250px|Electoral divisions in the Sydney area, drawn by the politically independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]]]]
Due to the perceived issues associated with gerrymandering and its effect on competitive elections and democratic accountability, numerous countries have enacted reforms making the practice either more difficult or less effective. Countries such as the U.K., Australia, Canada and most of those in Europe have transferred responsibility for defining constituency boundaries to neutral or cross-party bodies. In Spain, they are constitutionally fixed since 1978.&lt;ref name="ES_Const" /&gt;

In the United States, however, such reforms are controversial and frequently meet particularly strong opposition from groups that benefit from gerrymandering. In a more neutral system, they might lose considerable influence.

=== Redistricting by neutral or cross-party agency ===
The most commonly advocated electoral reform proposal targeted at gerrymandering is to change the redistricting process. Under these proposals, an independent and presumably objective commission is created specifically for redistricting, rather than having the legislature do it.

This is the system used in the United Kingdom, where the independent [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary commissions]] determine the boundaries for [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved legislatures]], subject to ratification by the body in question (almost always granted without debate). A similar situation exists in Australia where the independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]] and its state-based counterparts determine electoral boundaries for federal, state and local jurisdictions.

To help ensure neutrality, members of a redistricting agency may be appointed from relatively apolitical sources such as retired judges or longstanding members of the civil service, possibly with requirements for adequate representation among competing political parties. Additionally, members of the board can be denied access to information that might aid in gerrymandering, such as the demographic makeup or voting patterns of the population.

As a further constraint, [[consensus]] requirements can be imposed to ensure that the resulting district map reflects a wider perception of fairness, such as a requirement for a supermajority approval of the commission for any district proposal. Consensus requirements, however, can lead to deadlock, such as occurred in [[Missouri]] following the 2000 census. There, the equally numbered partisan appointees were unable to reach consensus in a reasonable time, and consequently the courts had to determine district lines.

In the U.S. state of [[Iowa]], the nonpartisan Legislative Services Bureau (LSB, akin to the U.S. [[Congressional Research Service]]) determines boundaries of electoral districts. Aside from satisfying federally mandated contiguity and population equality criteria, the LSB mandates unity of counties and cities. Consideration of political factors such as location of incumbents, previous boundary locations, and political party proportions is specifically forbidden. Since Iowa's counties are chiefly regularly shaped [[polygons]], the LSB process has led to districts that follow county lines.&lt;ref name="7_buck_trust.html"/&gt;

In 2005, the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] had a ballot measure to create an independent commission whose first priority was competitive districts, a sort of "reverse gerrymander". A complex mathematical formula was to be used to determine the competitiveness of a district. The measure failed voter approval chiefly due to voter concerns that communities of interest would be broken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2005/11/08/oh/state/issue/4/ |title=Issue 4: Independent Redistricting Process – Ohio State Government |publisher=Smartvoter.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[Open Our Democracy Act of 2017]] was submitted to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] by [[John Delaney (Maryland politician)|Rep. Delaney]] as a means to implement non-partisan redistricting.

===Transparency regulations===
When a single political party controls both legislative houses of a state during redistricting, both Democrats and Republicans have displayed a marked propensity for couching the process in secrecy; in May 2010, for example, the Republican National Committee held a redistricting training session in Ohio where the theme was "Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/12/13/study-of-gop-maps-points-to-politics.html|title= Study of GOP Maps Points to Politics|publisher= Dispatch.com|last1=Siegel|first1= Jim|date= 13 December 2011|access-date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for increased transparency in redistricting processes is clear; a 2012 investigation by The Center for Public Integrity reviewed every state's redistricting processes for both transparency and potential for public input, and ultimately assigned 24 states grades of either D or F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kusnetz |first=Nicholas |date=1 November 2012 |title=Behind Closed Doors: GOP and Dems Alike Cloaked Redistricting in Secrecy |url=http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/01/14839356-behind-closed-doors-gop-and-dems-alike-cloaked-redistricting-in-secrecy |work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these types of problems, redistricting transparency legislation has been introduced to US Congress a number of times in recent years, including the Redistricting Transparency Acts of 2010, 2011, and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr4918|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2010 (2010; 111th Congress H.R. 4918) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr419|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2011 (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 419) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr337|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2013 (2013; 113th Congress H.R. 337) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such policy proposals aim to increase the transparency and responsiveness of the redistricting systems in the US. The merit of increasing transparency in redistricting processes is based largely on the premise that lawmakers would be less inclined to draw gerrymandered districts if they were forced to defend such districts in a public forum.

===Changing the voting system===
Because gerrymandering relies on the [[wasted vote|wasted-vote effect]], the use of a different voting system with fewer wasted votes can help reduce gerrymandering. In particular, the use of [[multimember district|multi-member districts]] alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation such as [[Single Transferable Voting|single transferable voting]] can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering. Semi-proportional voting systems such as [[single non-transferable vote]] or [[cumulative voting]] are relatively simple and similar to ''first past the post'' and can also reduce the proportion of wasted votes and thus potential gerrymandering. Electoral reformers have advocated all three as replacement systems.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Richard L. Engstrom, The Single Transferable Vote: An Alternative Remedy for Minority Vote Dilution, 27 U.S.F.L.Rev. 781, 806 (1993) (arguing that the Single Transferable Voting systems maintain minority electoral opportunities); Steven J. Mulroy, Alternative Ways Out: A Remedial Road Map for the Use of Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Act Remedies, 77 N.C.L.Rev. 1867, 1923 (1999) (concluding that ranked-ballot voting systems avoid minority vote dilution); Steven J. Mulroy, The Way Out: A Legal Standard for Imposing Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Remedies, 33 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 333, 350 (1998) (arguing that preferential voting systems enhance minority representation); and Alexander Athan Yanos, Note, Reconciling the Right to Vote With the Voting Rights Act, 92 Colum.L.Rev. 1810, 1865–66 (1992) (arguing that Single Transferable Voting serves to preserve the minority party's right to representation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Electoral systems with various forms of proportional representation are now found in nearly all European countries, resulting in multi-party systems (with many parties represented in the parliaments) with higher voter attendance in the elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Electoral systems with election of just one winner in each district (i.e., "winner-takes-all" electoral systems) and no proportional distribution of extra mandates to smaller parties tend to create two-party systems ([[Duverger's law]]). In these, just two parties effectively compete in the national elections and thus the national political discussions are forced into a narrow two-party frame, where loyalty and forced statements inside the two parties distort the political debate.{{According to whom|date=October 2013}}

===Changing the size of districts and the elected body===
If a proportional or semi-proportional voting system is used then increasing the number of winners in any given district will reduce the number of wasted votes. This can be accomplished both by merging separate districts together and by increasing the total size of the body to be elected. Since gerrymandering relies on exploiting the wasted vote effect, increasing the number of winners per district can reduce the potential for gerrymandering in proportional systems. Unless all districts are merged, however, this method cannot eliminate gerrymandering entirely.

In contrast to proportional methods, if a nonproportional voting system with multiple winners (such as [[plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]) is used, then increasing the size of the elected body while keeping the number of districts constant will not reduce the amount of wasted votes, leaving the potential for gerrymandering the same. While merging districts together under such a system can reduce the potential for gerrymandering, doing so also amplifies the tendency of block voting to produce [[landslide victory|landslide victories]], creating a similar effect to gerrymandering by concentrating wasted votes among the opposition and denying them representation.

If a system of single-winner elections is used, then increasing the size of the elected body will implicitly increase the number of districts to be created. This change can actually make gerrymandering easier when raising the number of single-winner elections, as opposition groups can be more efficiently packed into smaller districts without accidentally including supporters, further increasing the number of wasted votes amongst the opposition.

===Using fixed districts===
Another way to avoid gerrymandering is simply to stop redistricting altogether and use existing political boundaries such as state, county, or provincial lines. While this prevents future gerrymandering, any existing advantage may become deeply ingrained. The [[United States Senate]], for instance, has more competitive elections than the House of Representatives due to the use of existing state borders rather than gerrymandered districts—Senators are elected by their entire state, while Representatives are elected in legislatively drawn districts.

The use of fixed districts creates an additional problem, however, in that fixed districts do not take into account changes in population. Individual voters can come to have very different degrees of influence on the legislative process. This [[malapportionment]] can greatly affect representation after long periods of time or large population movements. In the United Kingdom during the [[Industrial Revolution]], several constituencies that had been fixed since they gained representation in the Parliament of England became so small that they could be won with only a handful of voters (''[[rotten borough]]s''). Similarly, in the U.S. the state legislature of Alabama refused to redistrict for more than 60 years, despite major changes in population patterns. By 1960 less than a quarter of the state's population controlled the majority of seats in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael McDonald, U.S. Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary [http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm Dept. of Public and International Affairs George Mason University]. Retrieved 6 April 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624024455/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |date=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this practice of using fixed districts for state legislatures was effectively banned in the United States after the ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' Supreme Court decision in 1964, establishing a rule of [[one man, one vote]].

===Objective rules to create districts===
Another means to reduce gerrymandering is to create objective, precise criteria to which any district map must comply. Courts in the United States, for instance, have ruled that congressional districts must be contiguous in order to be constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Reynolds v. Sims|Reynolds v. Sims]] states that "a state legislative apportionment scheme may properly give representation to various political subdivisions and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory if substantial equality among districts is maintained." See also [[Reynolds v. Sims|the Wikipedia article]].&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not a particularly binding constraint, as very narrow strips of land with few or no voters in them may be used to connect separate regions for inclusion in one district, as is the case in [[Illinois's 4th congressional district]].

Depending on the distribution of voters for a particular party, metrics that maximize compactness can be opposed to metrics that minimize the efficiency gap.  For example, in the United States, voters registered with the Democratic Party tend to be concentrated in cities, potentially resulting in a large number of "wasted" votes if compact districts are drawn around city populations.  Neither of these metrics take into consideration other possible goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/|title=Hating Gerrymandering Is Easy. Fixing It Is Harder.|first=David|last=Wasserman|date=25 January 2018|website=fivethirtyeight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as proportional representation based on other demographic characteristics (such as race, ethnicity, gender, or income), maximizing competitiveness of elections (the greatest number of districts where party affiliation is 50/50), avoiding splits of existing government units (like cities and counties), and ensuring representation of major interest groups (like farmers or voters in a specific transportation corridor), though any of these could be incorporated into a more complicated metric.

====Minimum district to convex polygon ratio====
One method is to define a minimum district to [[convex polygon]] ratio {{Definition needed|date=July 2016}} . To use this method, every proposed district is circumscribed by the smallest possible convex polygon (similar to the concept of a [[convex hull]]; think of stretching a rubberband around the outline of the district). Then, the area of the district is divided{{elucidate|date=December 2015}} by the area of the polygon; or, if at the edge of the state, by the portion of the area of the polygon within state boundaries.

The advantages of this method are that it allows a certain amount of human intervention to take place (thus solving the Colorado problem of [[#Shortest splitline algorithm|splitline districting]]); it allows the borders of the district to follow existing jagged subdivisions, such as neighbourhoods or voting districts (something isoperimetric rules would discourage); and it allows concave coastline districts, such as the Florida gulf coast area. It would mostly eliminate bent districts, but still permit long, straight ones. However, since human intervention is still allowed, the gerrymandering issues of packing and cracking would still occur, just to a lesser extent.

====Shortest splitline algorithm====
The [[Center for Range Voting]] has proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/GerryExamples.html |title=Gerrymandering and a cure—shortest splitline algorithm |publisher=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a way to draw districts by a simple [[algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org|title=RangeVoting.org – Center for Range Voting}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm uses only the shape of the state, the number N of districts wanted, and the population distribution as inputs. The algorithm (slightly simplified) is:
# Start with the boundary outline of the state.
# Let N=A+B where N is the number of districts to create, and A and B are two whole numbers, either equal (if N is even) or differing by exactly one (if N is odd). For example, if N is 10, each of A and B would be 5. If N is 7, A would be 4 and B would be 3.
# Among all possible straight lines that split the state into two parts with the population ratio A:B, choose the ''shortest''. If there are two or more such shortest lines, choose the one that is most north-south in direction; if there is still more than one possibility, choose the westernmost.
# We now have two hemi-states, each to contain a specified number (namely A and B) of districts. Handle them recursively via the same splitting procedure.
# Any human residence that is split in two or more parts by the resulting lines is considered to be a part of the most north-eastern of the resulting districts; if this doesn't decide it, then of the most northern.
This district-drawing algorithm has the advantages of simplicity, ultra-low cost, a single possible result (thus no possibility of human interference), lack of intentional bias, and it produces simple boundaries that do not meander needlessly. It has the disadvantage of ignoring geographic features such as rivers, cliffs, and highways and cultural features such as tribal boundaries. This landscape oversight causes it to produce districts different from those a human would produce. Ignoring geographic features can induce very simple boundaries.

While most districts produced by the method will be fairly compact and either roughly rectangular or triangular, some of the resulting districts can still be long and narrow strips (or triangles) of land.

Like most automatic redistricting rules, the shortest splitline algorithm will fail to create majority-minority districts, for both ethnic and political minorities, if the minority populations are not very compact. This might reduce minority representation.

Another criticism of the system is that splitline districts sometimes divide and diffuse the voters in a large metropolitan area. This condition is most likely to occur when one of the first splitlines cuts through the metropolitan area. It is often considered a drawback of the system because residents of the same agglomeration are assumed to be a community of common interest. This is most evident in the splitline allocation of [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rangevoting.org/SSHR/co_final.png&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2007, shortest-splitline redistricting pictures, based on the results of the 2000 census, are available for all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/SplitLR.html |title=Splitline districtings of all 50 states + DC + PR |publisher=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minimum isoperimetric quotient====
{{See also|Compactness measure of a shape|Polsby-Popper Test}}
It is possible to define a specific minimum [[Isoperimetric inequality|isoperimetric quotient]],&lt;ref name="siam.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/1237.pdf |title=James Case "Flagrant Gerrymandering: Help from the Isoperimetric Theorem?" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proportional to the ratio between the area and the square of the perimeter of any given congressional voting district. Although technologies presently exist to define districts in this manner, there are no rules in place mandating their use, and no national movement to implement such a policy. One problem with the simplest version of this rule is that it would prevent incorporation of jagged natural boundaries, such as rivers or mountains; when such boundaries are required, such as at the edge of a state, certain districts may not be able to meet the required minima. One way of avoiding this problem is to allow districts which share a border with a state border to replace that border with a polygon or semi-circle enclosing the state boundary as a kind of virtual boundary definition, but using the actual perimeter of the district whenever this occurs inside the state boundaries. Enforcing a minimum isoperimetric quotient would encourage districts with a high ratio between area and perimeter.&lt;ref name="siam.org"/&gt;

====Efficiency Gap calculation====
{{see also|Wasted vote#Efficiency gap}}
The efficiency gap is a simply-calculable measure that can show the effects of gerrymandering.&lt;ref name=The New Republic: "Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering |title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All |author=Nicholas Stephanopoulas |date= |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures wasted votes for each party: the sum of votes cast in losing districts (losses due to cracking) and excess votes cast in winning districts (losses due to packing).  The difference in these wasted votes are divided by total votes cast, and the resulting percentage is the efficiency gap.

==Use of databases and computer technology==
{{See also|Geographic information system}}
The introduction of modern computers alongside the development of elaborate [[voter database]]s and special districting software has made gerrymandering a far more precise science. Using such databases, political parties can obtain detailed information about every household including political party registration, previous campaign donations, and the number of times residents voted in previous elections and combine it with other predictors of voting behavior such as age, income, race, or education level. With this data, gerrymandering politicians can predict the voting behavior of each potential district with an astonishing degree of precision, leaving little chance for creating an accidentally competitive district.

On the other hand, the introduction of modern computers would let the United States Census Bureau to calculate more equal populations in every voting district that are based only on districts being the most compact and equal populations.  This could be done easily using their Block Centers based on the Global Positioning System rather than street addresses.  With this data, gerrymandering politicians will not be in charge, thus allowing competitive districts again.

Online web apps such as [[Dave's Redistricting]] have allowed any citizen to redistrict [[U.S. state|states]] into legislative districts as they wish &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bradlee |first1=Dave |title=Dave Bradlee |url=http://gardow.com/davebradlee/default.html |website=Gardow.com |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Sam |title=The Great Gerrymander of 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bradlee, the software was designed to "put power in people's hands," and so that they "can see how the process works, so it's a little less mysterious than it was 10 years ago." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Korte |first1=Gregory |title=Technology allows citizens to be part of redistricting process |url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-03-21-redistricting21_ST_N.htm |website=USA Today |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International examples of gerrymandering==
Several western democracies, notably [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] employ an electoral system with only one (nationwide) voting district for election of national representatives. This virtually precludes gerrymandering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/how-do-other-countries-handle-redistricting|title=How do other countries handle redistricting?|author=|date=15 April 2014|website=vox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_beh.htm|title=The Electoral System in Israel|author=|accessdate=8 October 2018|website=Official Website of the Knesset}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries such as [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]] or [[Sweden]], among many others, have electoral districts with fixed boundaries (usually one district for each administrative division). The number of representatives for each district can change after a census due to population shifts, but their boundaries do not change. This also effectively eliminates gerrymandering.

Additionally, many countries where the president is directly elected by the citizens (e.g. [[France]], [[Poland]], among others) use only one electoral district for presidential election, despite using multiple districts to elect representatives.

===Australia===
Gerrymandering has not typically been considered a problem in the [[Electoral system of Australia|Australian electoral system]] largely because drawing of electoral boundaries has typically been done by non-partisan [[Australian Electoral Commission|electoral commissions]]. There have been historical cases of [[malapportionment]], whereby the distribution of electors to electorates was not in proportion to the population [[Electoral system of Australia#Gerrymandering and malapportionment|in several states]]. For example, [[Thomas Playford IV|Sir Thomas Playford]] was [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]] of [[South Australia]] from 1938 to 1965 as a result of a system of malapportionment, which became known as the [[Playmander]], despite it not strictly speaking involving a gerrymander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Tilby Stock|first = Jenny|year = 1996|chapter = The 'Playmander': its origins, operations and effect on South Australia|editor1-last = O'Neil|editor1-first = Bernard|editor2-last = Raftery|editor2-first = Judith|editor3-last = Round|editor3-first = Kerrie|title = Playford's South Australia: Essays on the History of South Australia, 1933–1968|publisher = Association of Professional Historians|pages = 73–90|isbn = 0646290924}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the nominally independent South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission has been accused of favouring the [[Australian Labor Party]], as the party has been able to form government in four of the last seven elections, despite receiving a lower two-party preferred vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nocookies |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/liberals-blocked-by-unfair-boundaries-says-downer/story-e6frgczx-1226856356689 |work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Queensland]], malapportionment combined with a gerrymander under Premier Sir [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] became nicknamed the [[Bjelkemander]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Graham D.|last2=Levy|first2=Ron|title=Electoral Malapportionment: Partisanship, Rhetoric and Reform in the Shadow of the Agrarian Strong-Man|journal=[[Griffith Law Review]]|year=2009|volume=18|issue=18|pages=638–665|ssrn=1579826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the system, electoral boundaries were drawn so that rural electorates had as few as half as many voters as metropolitan ones and regions with high levels of support for the opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] were concentrated into fewer electorates, allowing Bjelke-Petersen's [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] (later National Party) led Coalition government to remain in power despite attracting substantially less than 50% of the vote. In the [[Queensland state election, 1986|1986 election]], for example, the National Party received 39.64% of the first preference vote and won 49 seats (in the 89 seat legislature) whilst the Labor Opposition received 41.35% but won only 30 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=801|title=Parliament of Queensland, Assembly election, 1 November 1986|author=Australian Government and Politics Database|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Liberals/Nationals still received a greater combined share of the vote than the Labor opposition because the system also worked against the Liberal representation.

===Canada===
Early in [[Canada|Canadian]] history, both the federal and provincial levels used gerrymandering to try to maximise partisan power. When [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] were admitted to Confederation in 1905, their original district boundaries were set forth in the respective [[Alberta Act|Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan Act]]s. These boundaries had been devised by federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members to ensure the election of provincial Liberal governments.

Since responsibility for drawing federal and provincial electoral boundaries was handed over to independent agencies, this problem has largely been eliminated at these levels of government. [[Manitoba]] was the first province to authorise a non-partisan group to define constituency boundaries in the 1950s. In 1964, the federal government delegated the drawing of boundaries for national seats to the "arm's length" [[Elections Canada]].

As a result, gerrymandering is not generally a major issue in Canada except at the civic level. Although city wards are recommended by independent agencies, city councils occasionally overrule them. This is much more likely where the city is not homogenous and different neighbourhoods have sharply different opinions about city policy direction.

In 2006, a controversy arose in [[Prince Edward Island]] over the provincial government's decision to throw out an electoral map drawn by an independent commission. Instead they created two new maps. The government adopted the second of these, designed by the [[caucus]] of the governing party. Opposition parties and the media attacked Premier [[Pat Binns]] for what they saw as gerrymandering of districts. Among other things, the government adopted a map that ensured that every current [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from the premier's party had a district to run in for re-election, whereas in the original map, several had been redistricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Christmas election: Binns |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2006/11/16/binns-fall.html? |work=[[cbc.ca]] |date=16 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702191517/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2006/11/16/binns-fall.html? |archive-date=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in the [[Prince Edward Island general election, 2007|2007 provincial election]] only seven of 20 incumbent Members of the Legislative Assembly were re-elected (seven did not run for re-election), and the government was defeated.

===Chile===

The military government which ruled [[Chile]] from 1973 to 1990 was ousted in a [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|national plebiscite]] in October 1988. Opponents of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] voted NO to remove him from power and to trigger democratic elections, while supporters (mostly from the right-wing) voted YES to keep him in office for another eight years.

Five months prior to the plebiscite, the regime published a law regulating future elections and referendums, but the configuration of electoral districts and the manner in which Congress seats would be awarded were only added to the law seven months after the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30082&amp;tipoVersion=0 |title=LEY-18700 06-MAY-1988 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=18799 |title=LEY-18799 26-MAY-1989 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] (lower house), [[Electoral division of Chile|60 districts]] were drawn by grouping (mostly) neighboring [[Communes of Chile|communes]] (the smallest administrative subdivision in the country) within the same [[Regions of Chile|region]] (the largest). It was established that two deputies would be elected per district, with the most voted coalition needing to outpoll its closest rival by a margin of more than 2-to-1 to take both seats. The results of the 1988 plebiscite show that neither the "NO" side nor the "YES" side outpolled the other by said margin in any of the newly established districts. They also showed that the vote/seat ratio was lower in districts which supported the "YES" side and higher in those where the "NO" was strongest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flacsochile.org/biblioteca/pub/memoria/1989/000261.pdf Documento de trabajo. Programa FLACSO-Chile. Número 428, septiembre 1989]. FLACSO Chile Biblioteca.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-090X2005000200004&amp;script=sci_arttext|title=Representación y tamaño de los distritos electorales en Chile, 1988-2002|author=Rojas, Priscilla and Patricio Navia|language=Spanish|date=2005|publisher=Revista de ciencia política (Santiago)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, at the 1989 parliamentary election, the center-left opposition was able to capture both seats (the so-called ''doblaje'') in twelve out of 60 districts, winning control of 60% of the Chamber.

[[Senate of Chile|Senate]] constituencies were created by grouping all lower-chamber districts in a region, or by dividing a region into two constituencies of contiguous lower-chamber districts. The 1980 Constitution allocated a number of seats to appointed senators, making it harder for one side to change the Constitution by itself. The opposition won 22 senate seats in the 1989 election, taking both seats in three out of 19 constituencies, controlling 58% of the elected Senate, but only 47% of the full Senate. The unelected senators were eliminated in the 2005 constitutional reforms, but the electoral map has remained largely untouched (two new regions were created in 2007, one of which altered the composition of two senatorial constituencies; the first election to be affected by this minor change took place in 2013).

===France===
France is one of the few countries to let legislatures redraw the map with no check.&lt;ref&gt;Balinski &amp; Baïou (2002), ''Découpage électoral'', Pour la science&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the legislature sets up an executive commission. Districts called ''arrondissements'' were used in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] and under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] they are called ''circonscriptions''. During the Third Republic, some reforms of arrondissements, which were also used for administrative purposes, were largely suspected to have been arranged to favour the kingmaker in the Assembly, the [[Parti radical]].

The dissolution of [[Seine (department)|Seine]] and [[Seine-et-Oise]] départements was seen as a case of Gerrymandering to counter communist's influence around Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://21maps.com/quand-la-politique-decoupe-la-geographie|title=Quand la politique découpe la géographie • 21Maps|author=|date=15 March 2018|website=21maps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern regime, there were three designs: in 1958 (regime change), 1987 (by [[Charles Pasqua]]) and 2010 (by [[Alain Marleix]]), three times by conservative governments. Pasqua's drawing was known to have been particularly good at gerrymandering, resulting in 80% of the seats with 58% of the vote in [[French legislative election, 1993|1993]], and forcing Socialists [[French legislative election, 1997|in the 1997 snap election]] to enact multiple pacts with smaller parties in order to win again, this time as a coalition. In 2010, the Sarkozy government created 12 districts for expats.

The [[Conseil Constitutionnel|Constitutional council]] was called twice by the opposition to decide about gerrymandering, but it never considered partisan disproportions. However, it forced the Marleix committee to respect an 80–120% population ratio, ending a tradition dating back to the Revolution in which ''départements'', however small in population, would send at least two MPs.

Gerrymandering in France is also done against regionalist parties. ''Départements'' are always used even if they split urban areas or larger identity territories, and smaller identity divisions are avoided.

===Germany===
When the electoral districts in Germany were redrawn in 2000, the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) was accused of gerrymandering to marginalise the left-wing [[Left Party (Germany)|PDS]] party. The SPD combined traditional PDS strongholds in eastern Berlin with new districts made up of more populous areas of western Berlin, where the PDS had very limited following.

After having won four seats in Berlin in the 1998 national election, the PDS was able to retain only two seats altogether in the 2002 elections. Under German electoral law, a political party has to win either more than five percent of the votes, or at least three directly elected seats, to qualify for top-up seats under the [[Additional Member System]]. The PDS vote fell below five percent thus they failed to qualify for top-up seats and were confined to just two members of the [[Bundestag]], the German federal parliament (elected representatives are always allowed to hold their seats as individuals). Had they won a third constituency, the PDS would have gained at least 25 additional seats, which would have been enough to hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the Bundestag.

In the election of 2005, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (successor of the PDS) gained 8.7% of the votes and thus qualified for top-up seats.

&lt;!--Ugly paragraph and very confusing—needs more explanation--&gt;The number of Bundestag seats of parties which traditionally get over 5% of the votes cannot be affected very much by gerrymandering, because seats are awarded to these parties on a proportional basis. However, when a party wins so many districts in any one of the 16 federal states that those seats alone count for more than its proportional share of the vote in that same state does the districting have some influence on larger parties—those extra seats, called "[[Overhang seat|Überhangmandate]]", remain. In the Bundestag election of 2009, Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU gained 24 such extra seats, while no other party gained any; this skewed the result so much that the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued two rulings declaring the existing election laws invalid and requiring the Bundestag to pass a new law limiting such extra seats to no more than 15. In 2013, Germany's Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of Überhangmandate, which from then on have to be added in proportion to the second vote of each party thereby making it impossible that one party can have more seats than earned by the proportionate votes in the election.

===Greece===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Gerrymandering has been rather common in [[Greece|Greek]] history since organised parties with national ballots only appeared after the 1926 Constitution.{{clarify|reason=Why was it common if there were no parties? Also, why was there then only one case BEFORE it?|date=October 2013}} The only case before that was the creation of the Piraeus electoral district in 1906, in order to give the Theotokis party a safe district.

The most infamous case of gerrymandering{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} was in the [[Greek legislative election, 1956|1956 election]]. While in previous elections the districts were based on the [[prefecture]] level (νομός),{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for 1956 the country was split in districts of varying sizes, some being the size of prefectures, some the size of sub-prefectures (επαρχία) and others somewhere in between. In small districts the winning party would take all seats, in intermediate size it would take most and there was proportional representation in the largest districts. The districts were created in such a way that small districts were those that traditionally voted for the right while large districts were those that voted against the right.

This system has become known as the three-phase (τριφασικό) system or the [[baklava]] system (because, as baklava is split into full pieces and corner pieces, the country was also split into disproportionate pieces). The opposition, being composed of the center and the left, formed a coalition with the sole intent of changing the electoral law and then calling new elections, despite the fact that only seven years earlier the center and the left had fought each other in the [[Greek Civil War]]. Even though the centrist and leftist opposition won the popular vote (1,620,007 votes against 1,594,992), the right wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]] won the majority of seats (165 to 135) and was to lead the country for the next two years.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]], functional constituencies are demarcated by the government and defined in statutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org|title=''Legislative Council Ordinance''|work=hklii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them prone to gerrymandering. The functional constituency for the information technology sector was particular criticised for gerrymandering and voteplanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a%3Do%26d%3D5000859099 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525081357/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5000859099 |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In 2011, [[Fidesz]] politician [[János Lázár]] has proposed a redesign to Hungarian voting districts; considering the territorial results of previous elections, this redesign would favor right-wing politics according to the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2011/11/28/igy_lesz_jobboldali_magyarorszag/ |title=Index – Belföld – Így lesz jobboldali Magyarország |publisher=Index.hu |date= |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policysolutions.hu/userfiles/elemzesek/PID_Hungarian%20Politics%20In-Depth_2011_Week48.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070629/http://www.policysolutions.hu/userfiles/elemzesek/PID_Hungarian%20Politics%20In-Depth_2011_Week48.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the law has been passed by the Fidesz-majority Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2011/12/23/elfogadtak_az_uj_valasztojogi_torvenyt/ |title=Index – Belföld – Elfogadták az új választójogi törvényt |publisher=Index.hu |date= |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formerly it took twice as many votes to gain a seat in some election districts as in some others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hornyák József: |url=http://www.vg.hu/kozelet/vg_online/kozelet_-_belfold/090112_capital_255559 |title=Fellebbez a Political Capital a választókerületi aránytalanságok miatt &amp;#124; Közélet &amp;#124; Világgazdaság Online |publisher=Vg.hu |date= |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Until the 1980s [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] boundaries in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] were drawn not by an independent commission but by government ministers. Successive arrangements by governments of all political characters have been attacked as gerrymandering. Ireland uses the [[single transferable vote]] and as well as the actual boundaries drawn the main tool of gerrymandering has been the number of seats per constituency used, with three-seat constituencies normally benefiting the strongest parties in an area, whereas four-seat constituencies normally help smaller parties.

In 1947 the rapid rise of new party [[Clann na Poblachta]] threatened the position of the governing party [[Fianna Fáil]]. The government of [[Éamon de Valera]] introduced the [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947]], which increased the size of the Dáil from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by the journalist and historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] as "a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no [[Northern Ireland|Six County]] Unionist could have bettered."&lt;ref name="coogan637"&gt;Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' (Hutchinson, London, 1993) hardback. page 637 {{ISBN|0-09-175030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following February the [[Irish general election, 1948|1948 general election]] was held and Clann na Poblachta secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote.&lt;ref name="coogan637" /&gt;

In the mid-1970s, the Minister for Local Government, [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], attempted to arrange the constituencies to ensure that the governing [[Fine Gael]]–[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Government of the 20th Dáil|National Coalition]] would win a parliamentary majority. The [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974]] was planned as a major reversal of previous gerrymandering by Fianna Fáil (then in opposition). Tully ensured that there were as many as possible three-seat constituencies where the governing parties were strong, in the expectation that the governing parties would each win a seat in many constituencies, relegating Fianna Fáil to one out of three.

In areas where the governing parties were weak, four-seat constituencies were used so that the governing parties had a strong chance of still winning two. The election results created substantial change, as there was a larger than expected collapse in the vote. Fianna Fáil won a landslide victory in the [[Irish general election, 1977]], two out of three seats in many cases, relegating the National Coalition parties to fight for the last seat. Consequently, the term "[[Tullymandering]]" was used to describe the phenomenon of a failed attempt at gerrymandering.

===Kuwait===
From the years 1981 until 2005, Kuwait was divided into 25 electoral districts in order to over-represent the government's supporters (the 'tribes').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kias/pdf/kb4_1and2/08hiramatsu.pdf|title=The Changing Nature of the Parliamentary System in Kuwait|page=63 &amp; 70|quote=Due to the gerrymandering on the part of the government, the "tribes" from the 1980s onwards, came to occupy a significant number of seats in the National Assembly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, a new law for electoral reforms was approved which prevented electoral gerrymandering by cutting the number of electoral districts from 25 to 5. 
The government of Kuwait found that 5 electoral districts resulted in a powerful parliament with the majority representing the opposition. A new law was crafted by the government of Kuwait and signed by the Amir to gerrymander the districts to 10 allowing the government's supporters to regain the majority.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Malaysia===
{{see also|List of Malaysian electoral districts}}
The practice of gerrymandering has been around in the country since its independence in 1957. The ruling coalition at that time, ''[[Barisan Nasional]]'' (BN; English: "National Front"), has been accused of controlling the election commission by revising the boundaries of constituencies. For example, during the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|13th General Election in 2013]], Barisan Nasional won 60% of the seats in the Malaysian Parliament despite only receiving 47% of the popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 August 2014|title=What's Malay for gerrymandering?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21611139-years-delineation-electoral-boundaries-will-determine-future-malaysian-politics-whats|newspaper=The Economist|location=Kuala Lumpur|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malapportionment has also been used at least since 1974, when it was observed that in one state alone (Perak), the parliamentary constituency with the most voters had more than ten times as many voters as the one with the fewest voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ongkianming.com/2013/07/19/press-statement-malaysia-among-the-most-malapportioned-countries-in-the-world/ |title=Malaysia among the most malapportioned countries in the world |last=Yang Berhomat Dr. Ong |first=Kiang Ming MP|date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2016-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices finally failed BN in the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|14th General Election]] on May 9, 2018, when the opposing ''[[Pakatan Harapan]]'' (PH; English: "Alliance of Hope") won despite perceived efforts of gerrymandering and malapportionment from the incumbent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/malaysia-election-results-details-who-won-2018-5/|title=In a historic election, Malaysia's allegedly corrupt prime minister lost to his 92-year-old former mentor who ran on behalf of a man he put in jail|date=2018-05-10|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
The Labour Party that won in 1981, even though the Nationalist Party got the most votes, did so because of its gerrymandering. A 1987 constitutional amendment prevented that situation from reoccurring.

===Nepal===
After the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali politics has well exercised the practice of gerrymandering with the view to take advantage in the election. It was often practised by [[Nepali Congress]], which remained in power in most of the time. Learning from this, the reshaping of constituency was done for constituent assembly and the opposition now wins elections.

===Philippines===
[[Legislative districts of the Philippines|Congressional districts in the Philippines]] were originally based on an ordinance from the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]], which was created by the Constitutional Commission, which was ultimately based on legislative districts as they were drawn in 1907. The same constitution gave [[Congress of the Philippines]] the power to legislate new districts, either through a national redistricting bill or piecemeal redistricting per province or city. Congress has never passed a national redistricting bill since the approval of the 1987 constitution, while it has incrementally created 34 new districts, out of the 200 originally created in 1987.

This allows Congress to create new districts once a place reaches 250,000 inhabitants, the minimum required for its creation. With this, local dynasties, through congressmen, can exert influence in the district-making process by creating bills carving new districts from old ones. In time, as the population of the Philippines increases, these districts, or groups of it, will be the basis of carving new provinces out of existing ones.

An example was in [[Camarines Sur]], where two districts were divided into three districts which allegedly favors the Andaya and the Arroyo families; it caused Rolando Andaya and [[Dato Arroyo]], who would have otherwise run against each other, run in separate districts, with one district allegedly not even surpassing the 250,000-population minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/558593/noynoy-hits-creation-camarines-sur-district-dato |title= Noynoy hits creation of Camarines Sur district for Dato |date=18 March 2010 |first=Aurea |last=Calica |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] later ruled that the 250,000 population minimum does not apply to an additional district in a province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/564542/supreme-court-ruling-camsur-clears-senate |title=  'Supreme Court ruling on Camsur clears Senate' |date=9 April 2010 |first=Christina |last=Mendez |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting splits would later be the cause of another gerrymander, where the province would be split into a new province called [[Nueva Camarines]]; the bill was defeated in the Senate in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/06/08/13/senate-fails-pass-nueva-camarines-measure |title=Senate fails to pass Nueva Camarines measure |date=8 June 2013 |first=Christina |last=Mendez |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |publisher=ABS-CBNnews.com |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Singapore]] --&gt;
In recent decades, critics have accused the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) of unfair electoral practices to maintain significant majorities in the [[Parliament of Singapore]]. Among the complaints are that the government uses gerrymandering.&lt;ref&gt;[[Channel NewsAsia]], "More detailed explanation needed to fend off gerrymandering claims: Analysts", August 3, 2015. http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-detailed-explanation/2007228.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Elections Department]] was established as part of the executive branch under the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister of Singapore]], rather than as an independent body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmo.gov.sg/AboutPMOffice/OurDepartments/ Prime Minister's Office], Our Departments {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607102642/http://www.pmo.gov.sg/AboutPMOffice/OurDepartments/ |date=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused it of giving the ruling party the power to decide polling districts and polling sites through electoral engineering, based on poll results in previous elections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ve4vY9ZosRMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Electoral+engineering+in+Singapore&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Electoral Engineering: Voting Rules and Political Behavior], Pippa Norris&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of opposition parties claim that the [[Group Representation Constituency]] system is "synonymous to gerrymandering", pointing out examples of [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency|Cheng San GRC]] and [[Eunos Group Representation Constituency|Eunos GRC]] which were dissolved by the Elections Department with voters redistributed to other constituencies after opposition parties gained ground in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Lydia |last2=Hussain |first2=Zakir |date=2 August 2008 |title=Insight: GRCs: 20 years on |url=https://wpsn.wordpress.com/2008/08/02/st-02-08-2008/ |newspaper=Straits Times |location=Singapore |access-date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
Until the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in [[1931]], [[Spain]] used both single-member and multi-member constituencies in general elections. Multi-member constituencies were only used in some big cities. Some gerrymandering examples included the districts of [[Vilademuls]] or [[Torroella de Montgrí]] in [[Catalonia]]. These districts were created in order to prevent the [[Federal Democratic Republican Party]] to win a seat in [[Figueres]] or [[La Bisbal]] and [[Turno|to secure a seat to the dynastic parties]]. Since [[Second Spanish Republic|1931]], the constituency boundaries match the [[Provinces of Spain|province]] boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Balcells |first1=Albert |last2=B.

{{main|Elections in Spain}}

After the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist dictatorship]], during the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], these fixed provincial constituencies were reestablished in Section 68.2 of the current [[Constitution of Spain|1978 Spanish Constitution]],&lt;ref name="ES_Const"&gt;{{cite book |title=Constitution of Spain in English |date=1978 |publisher=Government of Spain |location=Madrid |page=35 |url=http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Hist_Normas/Norm/const_espa_texto_ingles_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; so gerrymandering is impossible in general elections. There are not ''[[Single-member district|winner-takes-all]]'' elections in Spain except for the tiny territories of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] (which only have one representative each); everywhere else the number of representatives assigned to a constituency is [[proportional representation|proportional]] to its population and calculated according to a national law, so tampering with under- or over-representation is difficult too.

[[Spain (European Parliament constituency)|European]], [[Autonomous communities of Spain|regional]] and municipal elections are held under single, [[at-large]] multi-member constituencies with [[proportional representation]] and gerrymandering is not possible either.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka's new [[Local government in Sri Lanka|Local Government]] elections process has been the talking point of gerrymandering since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=138097|title=The Island|last=|first=|date=|website=www.island.lk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though that talk was more about the ward-level, it is also seen in some local council areas too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lgpc.gov.lk/downloads/2017Feb_WardMaps/VAVUNIYA/05_Vavuniya_VavuniyaSouth(Sinhala)PS.pdf|title=Ward Map of Vavuniya South (Sinhala) Pradeshiya Sabha - Vavuniya District|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lgpc.gov.lk/downloads/2017Feb_WardMaps/VAVUNIYA/04_Vavuniya_VavuniyaSouth(Tamil)PS.jpg|title=Ward Map of Vavuniya South (Tamil) Pradeshiya Sabha - Vavuniya District|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
In the most recent election of 2010, there were numerous examples of gerrymandering throughout the entire country of [[Sudan]]. A report from the Rift Valley Institute uncovered violations of Sudan's electoral law, where constituencies were created that were well below and above the required limit. According to Sudan's National Elections Act of 2008, no constituency can have a population that is 15% greater or less than the average constituency size. The Rift Valley Report uncovered a number of constituencies that are in violation of this rule. Examples include constituencies in Jonglei, Warrap, South Darfur, and several other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riftvalley.net/resources/file/Electoral%20Designs%20-%20Report%20on%20elections%20in%20Sudan.pdf |title=Rift Valley Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426171620/http://www.riftvalley.net/resources/file/Electoral%20Designs%20-%20Report%20on%20elections%20in%20Sudan.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
Turkey has used gerrymandering in İstanbul in 2009 municipal elections. Just before the election İstanbul is divided in new counties. Large low income boroughs are bundled with rich boroughs to win municipal elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/akp-redraws-turkey-despite-opposition-ire-34521|title=AKP redraws Turkey despite opposition ire|last=|first=|date=2012|work=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=16 January 2018|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Northern Ireland====
Gerrymandering (Irish: ''Claonroinnt'') is widely considered to have been introduced after the establishment of [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1921, favouring [[Irish unionism|Unionists]] who tended to be Protestant, to the detriment of [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalists]] who were mostly [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Some critics and supporters spoke at the time of  "[[A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People]]". This passed also into local government. [[Stephen Gwynn]] had noted as early as 1911 that since the introduction of the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In [[County Armagh|Armagh]] there are 68,000 Protestants, 56,000 Catholics. The County Council has twenty-two Protestants and eight Catholics. In [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], Catholics are a majority of the population, 82,000 against 68,000; but the electoral districts have been so arranged that Unionists return sixteen as against thirteen Nationalists (one a Protestant). This Council gives to the Unionists two to one majority on its Committees, and out of fifty-two officials employs only five Catholics. In [[County Antrim|Antrim]], which has the largest Protestant majority (196,000 to 40,000), twenty-six Unionists and three Catholics are returned. Sixty officers out of sixty-five are good Unionists and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn S.L. ''The Case for Home Rule'' (1911) pp. 104–105. (http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/E900030.html book text here; accessed August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] created new electoral boundaries for the [[Londonderry County Borough Council]] to ensure election of a [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]] council in a city where [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] had a large majority and had won [[Londonderry County Borough Council election, 1920|previous elections]].&lt;ref name="whyte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |title=CAIN: Issues – Discrimination: John Whyte, 'How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968?' |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially local parties drew the boundaries, but in the 1930s the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|province-wide government]] redrew them to reinforce the gerrymander.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt; However, in the 1967 election, Unionists won 35.5% of the votes and received 60% of the seats, while Nationalists got 27.4% of the votes but received 40% of the seats. This meant that both the Unionist and Nationalist parties were over-represented, while the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent politician|Independents]] (amounting to more than 35% of the votes cast) were severely under-represented.

From the outset, Northern Ireland had installed the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system in order to secure fair elections in terms of proportional representation in its [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]]. After two elections under that system, [[House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929|in 1929]] Stormont changed the electoral system to be the same as the rest of the [[United Kingdom]]: a single-member [[first past the post]] system. The only exception was for the election of four Stormont MPs to represent the [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University of Belfast]]. Some scholars believe that the boundaries were gerrymandered to under-represent Nationalists.&lt;ref name="coogan637"/&gt; Other geographers and historians, for instance Professor [[John H. Whyte]], disagree.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/hnihoc.htm |title=Northern Ireland House of Commons, 1921–1972 |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have argued that the electoral boundaries for the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] were not gerrymandered to a greater level than that produced by any single-winner election system, and that the actual number of Nationalist MPs barely changed under the revised system (it went from 12 to 11 and later went back up to 12). Most observers have acknowledged that the change to a single-winner system was a key factor, however, in stifling the growth of smaller political parties, such as the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent Unionist]]s.

After Westminster reintroduced direct rule in 1973, it restored the single transferable vote (STV) for elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] in the following year, using the same definitions of constituencies as for the Westminster Parliament. Currently in Northern Ireland, all elections use STV except those for positions in the [[Westminster Parliament]], which follow the pattern in the rest of the United Kingdom by using "first past the post."

====Boundary Review====
The number of electors in a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|United Kingdom constituency]] can vary considerably, with the smallest constituency currently (2017 electoral register) having fewer than a fifth of the electors of the largest (Scotland's Na h-Eileanan an Iar (21,769 constituents) and Orkney and Shetland (34,552), compared to England's North West Cambridgeshire (93,223) and Isle of Wight (110,697)). This variation has resulted from:
* [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] being favoured in the Westminster Parliament with deliberately smaller electoral quotas (average electors per constituency) than those in [[England]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. This inequality was initiated by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958, which eliminated the previous common electoral quota for the whole United Kingdom and replaced it with four separate national quotas for the respective Boundaries commissions to work to: England 69,534; Northern Ireland 67,145, Wales 58,383 and in Scotland only 54,741 electors.
* Current rules historically favouring geographically "natural"{{clarify|date=April 2014}} districts, this continues to give proportionally greater representation to Wales and Scotland.
* Population migrations, due to [[white flight]] and [[deindustrialization]] tending to decrease the number of electors in inner-city districts.

Under the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]], the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition government]] planned to review and redraw the parliamentary constituency boundaries for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. The review and redistricting was to be carried out by the [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|four UK boundary commissions]] to produce a reduction from 650 to 600 seats, and more uniform sizes, such that a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] was to have no fewer than 70,583 and no more than 80,473 electors. The process was intended to address historic [[malapportionment]], and be complete by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19166125 | title=Q&amp;A: Boundary changes | publisher=BBC | date=29 January 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/election2010/results/default.stm | title=Election 2010 Results | publisher=BBC | date=6 May 2010 | accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary reports suggesting the areas set to lose the fewest seats historically tended to vote [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], while other less populous and deindustrialized regions, such as [[Wales]], which would lose a larger proportion of its seats, tending to have more [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] voters, partially correcting the existing malapportionment. An opposition (Labour) motion to suspend the review until after the next general election was tabled in the House of Lords and a vote called in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons]], in January 2013. The motion was passed with the help of the Liberal Democrats, going back on an election pledge. {{as of|2016|October|}}, a new review is in progress and a draft of the new boundaries has been published.

===United States===

In 2003, the majority of Republicans in the Texas legislature [[2003 Texas redistricting|redistricted the state]], diluting the voting power of the heavily Democratic county by parcelling its residents out to more Republican districts.]]
[[File:North Carolina 12th Congressional District (National Atlas).gif|thumb|''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[redistricting]] and racial gerrymandering of [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district]] ''(pictured)''.]]

The United States, among the first with an elected representative government, eventually named the practice. Incidents precede the 1789 election of the [[1st United States Congress|First U.S. Congress]]. In 1788, [[Patrick Henry]] and his [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalist]] allies were in control of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]]. They drew the boundaries of [[Virginia's 5th congressional district]] in an unsuccessful attempt to keep [[James Madison]] out of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Labunski, Richard. ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of gerrymandering the borders of new states continued past the Civil War and into the late 19th century. The Republican Party used its control of Congress to secure the admission of more states in territories friendly to their party—the admission of [[Dakota Territory]] as two states instead of one being a notable example. By the rules for representation in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], each new state carried at least three electoral votes regardless of its population.&lt;ref&gt;Compare a map of the United States in 1860 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1860.jpg] with a map from 1870 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1870.jpg]. &lt;!-- These images need to be put in wikimedia commons, rather than external links--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

All redistricting in the United States has been contentious because it has been controlled by political parties vying for power. As a consequence of the decennial [[census]] required by the [[United States Constitution]], districts for members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] typically need to be redrawn whenever the number of members in a state changes. In many states, state legislatures redraw boundaries for state legislative districts at the same time.

State legislatures have used gerrymandering along racial lines both to decrease and increase minority representation in state governments and congressional delegations. In Ohio, a conversation between Republican officials was recorded that demonstrated that redistricting was being done to aid their political candidates. Furthermore, the discussions assessed the race of voters as a factor in redistricting, on the premise that African-Americans tend to back Democratic candidates. Republicans apparently removed approximately 13,000 African-American voters from the district of [[Jim Raussen]], a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives, in an attempt to tip the scales in what was once a competitive district for Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |title=Republican Party Politics (Part II) |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[WCPO]] |date=29 April 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112805/http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Civil Rights Movement and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], federal enforcement and protections of suffrage for all citizens were enacted. Gerrymandering for the purpose of reducing the political influence of a racial or ethnic minority group was prohibited. After the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, some states created "majority-minority" districts to enhance minority voting strength. This practice, also called "affirmative gerrymandering", was supposed to redress historic discrimination and ensure that ethnic minorities would gain some seats and representation in government. In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm. State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Virginia, an incumbent protection plan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-virginia-an-incumbent-protection-plan/2013/09/27/0e08acfc-27c0-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan [[redistricting commission]]s. The states of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;[[Washington State Redistricting Commission]] {{cite web|url=http://www.redistricting.wa.gov |title=Washington State Redistricting Commission |publisher=Redistricting.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;[[Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission]] {{cite web|url=http://www.azredistricting.org |title=Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission |publisher=Azredistricting.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and California&lt;ref&gt;[[California Proposition 11 (2008)|Proposition 11]], passed in 2008, and [[California Proposition 20 (2010)|Proposition 20]], passed in 2010&lt;/ref&gt; have created [[standing committee]]s for redistricting following the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It has been argued however that in California's case, gerrymandering still continued despite this change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/how-democrats-fooled-californias-redistricting-commission|title=How Democrats Fooled California's Redistricting Commission — ProPublica|author=|date=21 December 2011|website=ProPublica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhode Island&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071018002452/http://riredistricting.org/ Rhode Island Reapportionment Commission] Archived 18 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[[New Jersey Redistricting Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; have developed ''[[ad hoc]]'' committees, but developed the past two decennial reapportionments tied to new census data. Florida's amendments 5 and 6, meanwhile, established rules for the creation of districts but did not mandate an independent commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.palmbeachpost.com/yourvote/ballot_question/florida/2010/amendment-5-and-6-2010/ |title=Election 2010: Palm Beach County &amp; Florida Voting, Candidates, Endorsements &amp;#124; The Palm Beach Post |publisher=Projects.palmbeachpost.com |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208155829/http://projects.palmbeachpost.com/yourvote/ballot_question/florida/2010/amendment-5-and-6-2010/ |archivedate=8 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International election observers from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, who were invited to observe and report on the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 national elections]], expressed criticism of the U.S. congressional redistricting process and made a recommendation that the procedures be reviewed to ensure genuine competitiveness of Congressional election contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/14028 |title=XI |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an analyst reported that the two major parties differ in the way they redraw districts. The Democrats construct coalition districts of liberals and minorities together with conservatives which results in Democratic-leaning districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#Dem |title=The Atlas of Redistricting: Gerrymander districts to favor Democrats |last1=Bycoffe |first1=Aaron |last2=Koeze |first2=Ella |last3=Wasserman |first3=David |last4=Wolfe |first4= Julia |date=25 January 2018 |website=FiveThirtyEight |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republicans tend to place liberals all together in a district, conservatives in others, creating clear partisan districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#GOP |title=The Atlas of Redistricting: Gerrymander districts to favor Republicans |last1=Bycoffe |first1=Aaron |last2=Koeze |first2=Ella |last3=Wasserman |first3=David |last4=Wolfe |first4= Julia |date=25 January 2018 |website=FiveThirtyEight |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Ledyard | last=King | title=Democrats face long house odds | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/25/democrats-face-long-wait-reclaim-house-majority/76325436/| newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida| pages= 1B | date=November 28, 2015 | id= | accessdate=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---hard copy and soft copy differ in source but are duplicate articles---&gt;

===Venezuela===
Prior to the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2010|26 September 2010 legislative elections]], gerrymandering took place via an [[addendum]] to the electoral law by the [[National Assembly of Venezuela]]. In the subsequent election, [[Hugo Chávez]]'s political party, the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] drew 48% of the votes overall, while the opposition parties (the [[Democratic Unity Roundtable]] and the [[Fatherland for All]] parties) drew 52% of the votes. However, due to the re-allocation of electoral legislative districts prior to the election, Chávez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela was awarded over 60% of the spots in the National Assembly (98 deputies), while 67 deputies were elected for the two opposition parties combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first= | last= | title=The WP: Parliament election was an unmistakable rebuff to Chávez | url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2010/10/01/en_pol_esp_the-wp-parliament-e_01A4549411.shtml | newspaper=El Universal| location=Caracas| pages= | date=October 1, 2010 | id= | accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Get Online Week''' is an annual campaign that takes place in the UK and Europe.

== UK ==
In 2007, UK online centres first marked out a date in October to bring digital inclusion to national attention. Since then the campaign has grown into a week-long annual celebration, with thousands of events taking place each year in centres and more unusual locations, bringing digital skills and know-how to everyone.

The 2010 event took place on 18–24 October 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010_Wired" /&gt; In 2014, Get Online week took place on 13–19 October, with 1,103 locations running 5,000 events, with 80,000 participants.&lt;ref name="getonline_about" /&gt; In 2015, the campaign took place on 12–18 October, organised by [[Tinder Foundation]]. It claims to be the biggest UK digital inclusion campaign.&lt;ref name="getonlineweek" /&gt;

It is organised by [[Tinder Foundation]] a UK-based charity.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

2013 was the 7th annual October event from UK online centres. Previously 'Get online week' was called 'Get online day' &lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p004vw1x/Connect_Get_Online_Day_23rd_October_2009/ Get online day]'&lt;/ref&gt; but the decision was made to change the name for 2010 and stretch the campaign over a week. This was due to the natural growth of the campaign and previous feedback that a day wasn't enough time to fit in all the activities that were arranged. Typically, Get online week's many events and promotional activities now happen throughout the whole month of October.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

UK online centres teamed up with a range of external partners who generated huge amounts of publicity for Get online week. They include the [[BBC]], [[BT Group|BT]], [[Hutchison 3G|Three]], [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]], [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]], [[Facebook]], [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]] and [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council|MLA]] amongst many others. Partners also hold their own events or direct people to one of the 3,800 UK online centres which are situated around England.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

== Europe ==
The first European Get Online Day took place on 4 March 2010.&lt;ref name="EU_2010" /&gt; It was inspired by the UK event, and it later became an annual campaign lasting a week, run by [[Telecentre Europe]].&lt;ref name="EU_week" /&gt;

The European Get Online Week was inspired by the campaign with the same name ran by UK online centres (now Tinder Foundation) in the UK.
Telecentre Europe extended it to the European level, to get new computer users online by helping them to get through the doors of their local ICT learning centres, enabling the staff to build people’s confidence to move on into a more structured learning. Since its take-off in 2010, the Get Online Week campaign has reached more than 600.000 Europeans in more than 20.000 learning centres across Europe. Thanks to the campaign, more than 100.000 people have use the Internet for the very first time.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

The '''Guildford Four''' and the '''Maguire Seven''' were the collective names of two groups whose convictions in [[English courts]] in 1975 and 1976 for the [[Guildford pub bombings]] of 5 October 1974 were eventually quashed after long campaigns for justice.  The Guildford Four were wrongly convicted of bombings carried out by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), and the Maguire Seven were wrongly convicted of handling explosives found during the investigation into the bombings.  Both groups' convictions were eventually declared "unsafe and unsatisfactory"&lt;ref name="guardian-pallister"&gt;{{Cite news

No one else was charged with the bombings, or supplying the material; three police officers were charged with conspiracy to [[pervert the course of justice]], and found not guilty.

==Guildford Four==
The '''Guildford Four''' were charged with direct involvement with the IRA attacks. They were:

Conlon argues in his autobiography that a key factor in his purportedly coerced confession was the fact that strengthened anti-terrorism laws passed in the early 1970s allowed the police to hold suspects without charges for up to a week, rather than the previous limit of 48 hours, and that he might have been able to withstand the treatment he had received had the original time limit been in effect.&lt;ref name="conlon-bio"&gt;{{Cite book

At the time, the normal practice was for judges to be consulted by the Home Secretary when considering release from a life sentence, rather than giving a [[Tariff (criminal law)|tariff]] at trial, but the judge, believing he might be dead by the time they were released, recommended 30 years for Conlon, 35 for Armstrong and until "great age" for Hill.

The Guildford Four did not "fit the bill" of IRA involvement in terms of their lifestyles. Paddy Armstrong and Carole Richardson, an Englishwoman, lived in a [[squatter|squat]], and were involved with drugs and petty crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Alibis===
On the night of the attacks, Richardson was in London seeing the band [[Jack the Lad]] at the [[South Bank Polytechnic]]. She was unable to recall this upon being arrested, but witnesses came forward. However, the prosecution put together a version of events in which she left for Guildford at high speed by car. Hill and Armstrong also presented alibis, with Hill's placing him in Southampton. A witness named Charles Burke placed Conlon in a London park, specifically on a bench where Burke was accustomed to sleeping as a tramp; however, his evidence was not presented at trial due to a miscarriage of justice{{vague|date=January 2018}} forced by a trio of detectives.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Robert King, a local journalist, went to Guildford police station to verify that one of the defendants "had been up north"; he was detained there and threatened for several hours, until he promised not to divulge his information to anyone. He remained silent for many years until he eventually told his father, and later spoke of this in an interview with the Surrey Advertiser.{{cn|date=January 2018}} King was the first journalist on the scene of the bombings.

==Maguire Seven==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2017}}
The '''Maguire Seven''' were charged with possessing [[nitroglycerine]] allegedly passed to the IRA to make bombs after the police raided the [[West Kilburn]] house of Anne Maguire on 3 December 1974.

They were tried and convicted on 4 March 1976 and received the following sentences:

Giuseppe Conlon had travelled from [[Belfast]] to help his son, Gerry Conlon, in the Guildford Four trial. Conlon, who had troubles with his lungs for many years, died in prison in January 1980, while the other six served their sentences and were released.

==Appeals==
The Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven sought leave to appeal their convictions immediately and were refused. Despite this, a growing body of disparate groups pressed for a re-examination of the case.

In February 1977, during the trial of the [[Balcombe Street Siege|Balcombe Street ASU]], the four IRA men instructed their lawyers to "draw attention to the fact that four totally innocent people were serving massive sentences", referring to the Guildford Four.&lt;ref name="Searcweb"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite claims to the police that they were responsible they were never charged with these offences and the Guildford Four remained in prison for another twelve years.&lt;ref name="Searcweb"/&gt;

The Guildford Four tried to obtain from the Home Secretary a reference to the Court of Appeal under Section 17 of the [[Criminal Appeal Act 1968]] (later repealed), but were unsuccessful. In 1987, the [[Home Office]] issued a memorandum recognising that it was unlikely they were terrorists, but that this would not be sufficient evidence for appeal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Campaigns===
Following the failure of the 1977 court appeal a number of 'lone voices' publicly questioned the conviction; among them David Martin in ''[[The Leveller]]'', [[Gavin Esler]] and [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' and [[David McKittrick]] in the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1989/oct/18/guildford-four-northernireland|title=Trial and error|first=Ros|last=Franey|date=17 October 1989|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On 26th February 1980, BBC One Northern Ireland aired ‘’Spotlight: Giuseppe Conlon and the Bomb Factory’’ which contained an interview by Patrick Maguire and the BBC's Gavin Esler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hv7w4|title=Patrick Maguire recalls his arrest, Giuseppe Conlon and the Bomb Factory, Spotlight - BBC One|author=|date=|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quashing of the Guildford Four verdict===
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--only one citation in section--&gt;
In 1989, detectives from [[Avon and Somerset Constabulary]], investigating the handling of the case, found three significant pieces of evidence in relation to Surrey Police's handling of the Guildford Four and their statements.

Firstly, typed notes from Patrick Armstrong's police interviews, which had been heavily edited. Deletions and additions had been made, and the notes had been rearranged. These notes, and their amendments, were consistent with hand-written and typed notes presented at the trial, which suggested that the hand-written notes were made after the interviews had been conducted.  The notes presented had been described in court as contemporaneous records.

Secondly, a series of manuscript notes relating to an interview with Hill, which showed that Hill's fifth statement was taken in breach of [[Judges' Rules]], and may well have been inadmissible as evidence.  The information was not made available to the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|DPP]] or the prosecution.  Further, the officers involved had denied under oath that such an interview had happened.

Thirdly, detention records were inconsistent with the times and durations of the claimed interviews, reported by the Surrey police.

An appeal was already under way on the basis of other evidence. [[Anthony Maurice Gifford, 6th Baron Gifford|Lord Gifford QC]] represented Paul Hill, and others were represented by human rights solicitor, [[Gareth Peirce]].&lt;!-- Amlot was also present rep Crown perhaps?--&gt;

The appeal hearing had been adjourned to January 1990 at the request of the Guildford Four, but once the findings of the Somerset and Avon report were available, the hearing was resumed, with the Crown stating that they did not wish to support the convictions.

The [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]], concluded that, regardless of the impact of the content of the material discovered by Somerset and Avon, or indeed the alibis or additional evidence the appellants wished to introduce, the level of duplicity meant that all the police evidence was suspect, and hence the case for the prosecution was unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quote=
If they were prepared to tell this sort of lie, then the whole of their evidence becomes suspect and, I repeat, on their evidence depended the prosecution case.|author=Geoffrey Lane|work=R. v. Richardson, Conlon, Armstrong and Hill EWCA Crim |title=Judgement of the Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane remarked :

{{Block quote|We have no doubt that these events make the convictions of all of these four appellants in respect of the Guildford and the Woolwich events unsafe, even though the latest revelations have no direct bearing on the evidence relating to the Woolwich bombing.}}

The Four were released on 19 October 1989, after having their convictions quashed.

Paul Hill had also been convicted of the murder of a British soldier, Brian Shaw, based on his confession while in the custody of [[Surrey Police]]. This did not fall under the ambit of the Lane appeal.  He was released on bail, pending his appeal against this conviction. In 1994, Her Majesty's Court of Appeal in Belfast quashed Hill's conviction for Shaw's murder.

===Quashing of the Maguire verdicts===
On 12 July 1990, the [[Home Secretary]] [[David Waddington, Baron Waddington|David Waddington]] published the ''Interim Report on the Maguire Case: The Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the convictions arising out of the bomb attacks in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard

which criticised the trial judge [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Mr Justice Donaldson]] and unearthed improprieties in the handling of scientific evidence, declaring the convictions unsound and recommending referral back to the Court of Appeal. The report "strongly criticise[d] the decision by the prosecution at the Guildford Four's trial not to disclose to the defence a statement supporting Mr Conlon's alibi."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The convictions of the Maguire Seven were quashed in 1991.

==Aftermath==
Neither the bombings nor the wrongful imprisonment resulted in convictions. The bombings were most likely the work of the [[Balcombe Street Siege]] gang, who claimed responsibility. They were already serving life sentences, but were released under the terms of the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. Three British police officers—Thomas Style, John Donaldson, and Vernon Attwell—were charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

On 9 February 2005, [[Tony Blair]], then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], issued an apology to the families of the 11 people imprisoned for the bombings in [[Guildford]] and [[Woolwich]], and those related to them who were still alive. He said, in part, "I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice... they deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Gerry Conlon's autobiography ''Proved Innocent'' was adapted into the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|Bafta award]]-nominated 1993 drama ''[[In the Name of the Father (1993 film)|In the Name of the Father]]'', starring [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Emma Thompson]], and [[Pete Postlethwaite]]. The film depicts Conlon's attempt to rebuild his shattered relationship with his father, but is partly fictional – for example, Conlon never shared a cell with his father. He is reported to have settled with the government for a final payment of compensation in the region of [[Pound sterling|£]]500,000.&lt;ref name="guardian-pallister"/&gt; His mother [[Sarah Conlon]], who had spent 16 years campaigning to have the names of her husband and son cleared and helped secure the apology, died on 20 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7515960.stm |title= Guildford bomb campaigner dies|accessdate=20 July 2008|date=20 July 2005|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conlon gave support to [[Tommy Sheridan]] in relation to the charges brought against him.

Gerry Conlon later joined a campaign to free the "Craigavon Two" – Brendan McConville and John Paul Wootton – convicted of the murder of a police officer in Northern Ireland. Conlon died at home in Belfast on 21 June 2014. His family issued a statement: &amp;nbsp;"He brought life, love, intelligence, wit and strength to our family through its darkest hours. He helped us to survive what we were not meant to survive. We recognise that what he achieved by fighting for justice for us had a far, far greater importance – it forced the world's closed eyes to be opened to injustice; it forced unimaginable wickedness to be acknowledged; we believe it changed the course of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gerry-conlon-dies-guildford-four-member-who-never-gave-up-his-fight-for-justice-9553797.html | title=Gerry Conlon dies: Guildford Four member who never gave up his fight for justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of a legal aftermath, Sir John Donaldson went on to an illustrious judicial career and became [[Master of the Rolls]], Head of the Appeal Court. The appeal case itself for ''[[R v Maguire 1981]]'', is now the leading [[case law|case]] for disclosure to the defence.

In November 2018 the BBC broadcast a documentary ''A Great British Injustice: The Maguire Story'', with the involvement of surviving members of the Maguire family. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bs2v31|title=A Great British Injustice: The Maguire Story|date=25 November 2018|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|right|Under the homestead principle a [[farmer]] putting unowned [[Land (economics)|land]] to use gains [[ownership]] over it.]]
{{Libertarianism sidebar |expanded=Concepts}}

The '''homestead principle''' is the principle by which one gains ownership of an unowned [[natural resources|natural resource]] by performing an act of original [[Appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]. Appropriation could be enacted by putting an unowned resource to active use (as with using it to [[Production (economics)|produce]] a [[Product (business)|product]]), joining it with previously acquired property or by marking it as owned (as with [[livestock branding]]). Proponents of [[intellectual property]] hold that ideas can also be homesteaded by originally creating a [[Virtuality|virtual]] or [[tangible]] representation of them. Others however argue that since tangible manifestations of a single idea will be present in many places, including within the minds of people, this precludes their being owned in most or all cases. Homesteading is one of the foundations of [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbardian]] [[anarcho-capitalism]].

==In philosophy==

===John Locke===
{{main article|Labor theory of property}}
[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[John Locke]] in his work [[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|''Second Treatise of Government'']], published in 1690 advocated the [[Lockean proviso]], which allows for homesteading. Locke famously sees the "mixing of labour" with land as the source of ownership via homesteading. He writes:
{{quote
| Though the earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men, yet every man has a ''property'' in his own ''person.'' This nobody has any right to but himself. The ''labour'' of his body and the ''work'' of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes out of the state that Nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed his ''labour'' with it, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his ''property''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=John |title=The Two Treatises of Government, Bk II, Chap 25, Sect 27 |date=1689 |publisher=A. Millar, et al. |location=London |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/222 |accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

However, Locke held that individuals have a right to homestead private property from nature only so long as "there is enough, and as good, left in common for others".&lt;ref&gt;Second Treatise of Government, Chapter V, paragraph 33&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lockean proviso]] maintains that appropriation of unowned resources is a diminution of the rights of others to it, and would only be acceptable if it does not make anyone else worse off.

===Murray Rothbard===
Libertarian philosopher and [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] argues that homesteading includes all the rights needed to engage in the homesteading action, including nuisance and [[pollution]] rights. He writes:
{{quote|Most of us think of homesteading unused resources in the old-fashioned sense of clearing a piece of unowned land and farming the soil. … Suppose, for example, that an airport is established with a great deal of empty land around it. The airport exudes a noise level of, say, X decibels, with the sound waves traveling over the empty land. A housing development then buys land near the airport. Some time later, the homeowners sue the airport for excessive noise interfering with the use and quiet enjoyment of the houses.&lt;br /&gt;
Excessive noise can be considered a form of aggression but in this case the airport has already homesteaded X decibels worth of noise. By its prior claim, the airport now "owns the right" to emit X decibels of noise in the surrounding area. In legal terms, we can then say that the airport, through homesteading, has earned an easement right to creating X decibels of noise. This homesteaded easement is an example of the ancient legal concept of "prescription," in which a certain activity earns a prescriptive property right to the person engaging in the action.&lt;ref name="rothbard-law"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title=Applications and criticism from the Austrian school. |year=1997 |publisher=Elgar |location=Cheltenham [u.a.] |isbn=1-85898-570-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rothbard interprets the physical extent to which a homesteading act establishes ownership in terms of the relevant "technological unit", which is the minimal amount necessary for the practical use of the resource. He writes:
{{quote|If A uses a certain amount of a resource, how much of that resource is to accrue to his ownership? Our answer is that he owns the technological unit of the resource. The size of that unit depends on the type of good or resource in question, and must be determined by judges, juries, or arbitrators who are expert in the particular resource or industry in question.&lt;ref name="rothbard-law" /&gt;}}

===Anthony de Jasay===
[[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Anthony de Jasay]] argued that a homesteader, having a claim prior to any other, must be [[prima facie]] considered the owner of the resource, in accordance with the principle "let ownership stand". He writes:
{{quote|[if] taking first possession of a thing is a feasible act of his that is admissible if it is not a tort (in this case not trespass) and violates no right; but this is the case by definition, i.e., by the thing being identified as “unowned.” Taking exclusive possession of it is, in terms of our classification of possible acts, a liberty, and as such only a contrary right can obstruct or oppose it. 14 The opponent of this simple thesis is trying to have it both ways: he is both asserting that the thing has no legitimate first owner from whom  a  second  or  nth  owner  could  have  legitimately  obtained  it  by  agreed transfer,  and  that  there  is  nevertheless  somebody  who  has  been  and  still  is entitled to use the thing and therefore can validly object to being excluded from it. But an entitlement to use the thing is an at least partial antecedent ownership claim needing an owner, or the permission of an owner, before it can be made; ownership cannot both exist yet not exist. If, on the other hand,  the  objectors  have  been  using  the  thing  without  being  entitled  to  it, because  no  third  party  had  excluded  them  by  taking  first  possession,  and because  they  were  unable,  unwilling,  or  uninterested  to  perform  the  act  of taking  first  possession  themselves  (whatever  that  act  may  consist  of),  their enjoyment of the thing was precarious, not vested. Its appropriation by a third party may have deprived them of an uncovenanted advantage, but it did not violate their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeJasay |first=Anthony |title=Against politics : on government, anarchy, and order |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=London [u.a.] |isbn=0-415-17067-2 |pages=173 |edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hans Hermann Hoppe===
{{main article|Argumentation ethics}}
Similarly to de-Jasay, [[Hans Hermann Hoppe]] argues that the denial of the homesteading rule entails a [[performative contradiction]]. That is because honest argumentation must presuppose an [[intersubjective verifiability|intersubjectively ascertainable]] [[Norm (philosophy)|norm]] (i.e. justifiable), and all norms not relying on the original establishment of a physical (and therefore evident) link to the owner are [[Subjectivity|subjective]] in nature, and therefore contradict the presuppositions of argumentation. He writes:
{{quote|Further, if one were not allowed to appropriate other resources through homesteading action, i.e., by putting them to use before anybody else does, or if the range of objects to be homesteaded were somehow limited, this would only be possible if ownership could be acquired by mere decree instead of by action. However, this does not qualify as a solution to the problem of ethics, i.e., of conflict-avoidance, even on purely technical grounds, for it would not allow one to decide what to do if such declarative claims happened to be incompatible. More decisive still, it would be incompatible with the already justified self-ownership, for if one could appropriate resources by decree, this would imply that one could also declare another person’s body to be one’s own. Thus, anyone denying the validity of the homesteading principle—whose recognition is already implicit in arguing two persons’ mutual respect for each other’s exclusive control over his own body—would contradict the content of his proposition through his very act of proposition making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoppe |first=Hans-Hermann |title=The economics and ethics of private property : studies in political economy and philosophy |year=2006 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |location=Auburn, Ala. |isbn=0-945466-40-4 |pages=199 |url=https://mises.org/books/economicsethics.pdf |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ayn Rand===
[[Ayn Rand]] has not elaborated on the characteristics of homesteading, but had expressed support for compatible laws, such as favourably citing the [[Homestead Act]] (1862). She writes:
{{quote|A notable example of the proper method of establishing private ownership from scratch, in a previously ownerless area, is the Homestead Act of 1862, by which the government opened the Western frontier for settlement and turned "public land" over to private owners. The government offered a 160-acres farm to any adult citizen who would settle on it and cultivate it for five years, after which it would become his property. Although that land was originally regarded, in law, as "public property," the method of its allocation, in fact, followed the proper principle (in fact, but not in explicit ideological intention). The citizens did not have to pay the government as if it were an owner; ownership began with them, and they earned it by the method which is the source and root of the concept of "property": by working on unused material resources, by turning a wilderness into a civilized settlement. Thus, the government, in this case, was acting not as the owner but as the custodian of ownerless resources who defines objectively impartial rules by which potential owners may acquire them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=The Property Status of Airwaves |journal=The Objectivist Newsletter |year=1964 |volume=3 |url=http://www.criminalgovernment.com/docs/aynrand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Linda and Morris Tannehill===
Linda and Morris Tannehill argue in ''[[The Market for Liberty]]''  that physically claiming the land (e.g. by fencing it in or prominently staking it out) should be enough to obtain good title:

{{quote|An old and much respected theory holds that for a man to come into possession of a previously unowned value it is necessary for him to "mix his labor with the land" to make it his own. But this theory runs into difficulties when one attempts to explain what is meant by "mixing labor with land." Just how much labor is required, and of what sort? If a man digs a large hole in his land and then fills it up again, can he be said to have mixed his labor with the land? Or is it necessary to effect a somewhat permanent change in the land? If so, how permanent?...Or is it necessary to effect some improvement in the economic value of the land? If so, how much and how soon?...Would a man lose title to his land if he had to wait ten months for a railroad line to be built before he could improve the land?...And what of the naturalist who wanted to keep his land exactly as it was in its wild state to study its ecology?...[M]ixing one's labor with the land is too ill-defined a concept and too arbitrary a requirement to serve as a ''criterion'' of ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Market for Liberty |pages=57–58 |author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In law==

===Common law===
[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|right|thumb|Under the [[ad coelum]] doctrine land ownership extends in a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] from the [[Inner core|earth's core]] up to the [[exosphere]].]]
[[Common law]] provides the [[ad coelum]] [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] by which [[landlord]]s own everything below and above the land, up to the sky and below the earth to its core, with the exception of volatile minerals such as [[natural gas]]. The rules governing what constitutes [[homesteading]] were not specified by common law but by the local [[statutory law]]. Common law also recognizes the concept of [[adverse possession]] ("squatters' rights").&lt;ref&gt;http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/homesteading ''West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] criticized this doctrine as incompatible with his own homestead principle, as a literal application prevent aircraft from traveling over someone's land. Further:
{{Quote|But is the practical problem of aviation the only thing wrong with the ad coelum rule? Using the homesteading principle, the ad coelum rule never made any sense, and is therefore overdue in the dustbin of legal history. If one homesteads and uses the soil, in what sense is he also using all the sky above him up into heaven? Clearly, he isn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothbard |first=Murray |title=Law, Property Rights and Air Pollution |journal=Cato Journal |year=1982 |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/lawproperty.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} So long as the aircraft did not damage or disturb the land, the owner would not have a claim. By the same principle, ownership of mineral and water resources on or under the land would also require homesteading, otherwise being left unowned.

===Statutory law===
In the 19th century, a number of [[government]]s formalized the homestead principle by passing laws that would grant property of land plots of certain standardized size to people who would settle on it and "improve" it in certain ways (typically, built their residence and started to farm at least a certain fraction of the land). Typically, such laws would apply to territories recently taken from their [[indigenous inhabitants]], and which the state would want to have populated by farmers. Examples:
* United States: [[Armed Occupation Act|Florida Armed Occupation Act]] (1842), [[Homestead Act]] (1862)
* Canada: [[Dominion Lands Act]] (1872)
* Australia: [[Robertson Land Acts|Crown Lands Acts]] (1861)

He drew a parallel to the [[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant|Copernican revolution]] in his proposition that worldly objects can be intuited ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' ("beforehand"), and that [[intuition]] is therefore independent from [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective reality]].&lt;ref&gt;"We here propose to do just what [[Copernicus]] did in attempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried the experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved... We may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects. If the intuition must conform to the nature of the objects, I do not see how we can know anything of them ''a priori''. If, on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our faculty of intuition, I can then easily conceive the possibility of such an ''a priori'' knowledge." Kant, Immanuel. Translated by [[John Meiklejohn|J. M. D. Meiklejohn]], ''Critique of Pure Reason''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant believed that [[reason]] is the source of [[morality]], and that [[aesthetics]] arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant's views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially the fields of [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political theory]], and [[Aesthetics#Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis|post-modern aesthetics]].

In one of Kant's major works, the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|last2=Kitcher|first2=Patricia (intro.)|last3=Pluhar|first3=W. (trans.)|title=Critique of Pure Reason|publisher=Hackett|year=1996|location=Indianapolis |page=xxviii |isbn= |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; he attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond the failures of traditional philosophy and [[metaphysics]]. Kant wanted to put an end to an era of futile and speculative theories of human experience, while resisting the [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] of thinkers such as [[David Hume]]. Kant regarded himself as showing the way past the impasse between [[rationalists]] and [[empiricists]] which philosophy had led to,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanzo|first1=Alberto|title=Kant on Empiricism and Rationalism|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=30|issue=1|pages=53–74|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/59913}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely held to have synthesized both traditions in his thought.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

Kant was an exponent of the idea that [[perpetual peace]] could be secured through universal [[democracy]] and [[international cooperation]]. He believed that this would be the eventual outcome of [[universal history]], although it is not rationally planned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]].&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of Kant's religious ideas continues to be the subject of philosophical dispute, with viewpoints ranging from the impression that he was an initial advocate of [[atheism]] who at some point developed an [[ontological argument]] for God, to more critical treatments epitomized by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], who claimed that Kant had "theologian blood"&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, [[The Antichrist (book)|''The Anti-Christ'']] (1895), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DcVl57jzP2gC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22theologian+blood%22+the+antichrist#v=onepage&amp;q=%22theologian%20blood%22%20the%20antichrist para. 10].&lt;/ref&gt; and was merely a sophisticated [[apologist]] for traditional [[Christian]] faith.{{efn|Nietzsche wrote that "Kant wanted to prove, in a way that would dumbfound the common man, that the common man was right: that was the secret joke of this soul."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche (trans. [[Walter Arnold Kaufmann]]), ''The Portable Nietzsche'', 1976, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These include the ''[[Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens|Universal Natural History]]'' (1755), the ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (1788), the ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797), and the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (1790), which looks at aesthetics and [[teleology]].

==Biography==
Kant's mother, Anna Regina Reuter&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url=http://www.koenigsberg-is-dead.de/I_Cosmopolis.html| title=Cosmopolis| publisher=Koenigsberg-is-dead.de| date=23 April 2001| accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1697–1737), was born in [[Königsberg]] (since 1946 the city of [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]]) to a father from [[Nuremberg]]. (Her surname is sometimes erroneously given as Porter.) Kant's father, Johann Georg Kant (1682–1746), was a German harness maker from [[Klaipėda|Memel]], at the time Prussia's most northeastern city (now [[Klaipėda]], [[Lithuania]]). Immanuel Kant believed that his paternal grandfather Hans Kant was of Scottish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen, Hans and Gertrud, ''Kants väterliche Ahnen und ihre Umwelt, Rede von 1952 in Jahrbuch der Albertus-Universität zu Königsberg'', Pr., Holzner-Verlag, Kitzingen, Main 1953, Vol. 3, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars of Kant's life long accepted the claim, there is no evidence that Kant's paternal line was Scottish; it is more likely that the Kants got their name from the village of Kantwaggen (today part of [[Priekulė, Lithuania|Priekulė]]) and were of [[Curonians|Curonian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Kant was born on April 22, 1724 into a [[Prussia]]n [[Germans|German]] family of [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] faith in Königsberg, East Prussia. Baptized 'Emanuel', he later changed his name to 'Immanuel'&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; after learning [[Hebrew]]. He was brought up in a [[Pietism|Pietist]] household that stressed religious devotion, humility, and a literal interpretation of the [[Bible]].{{Citation needed |date=June 2017}} His education was strict, punitive and disciplinary, and focused on [[Latin]] and religious instruction over mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 2001, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant maintained [[Christianity|Christian]] ideals for some time, but struggled to reconcile the faith with his belief in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kant-rel/|title=Immanuel Kant: Philosophy of Religion – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', he reveals a belief in immortality as the necessary condition of humanity's approach to the highest morality possible.&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equip.org/article/immanuel-kant/|title=Immanuel Kant - Christian Research Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Kant was skeptical about some of the arguments used prior to him in defence of [[theism]] and maintained that human understanding is limited and can never attain knowledge about God or the [[soul]], various commentators have labelled him a philosophical [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;"While this sounds skeptical, Kant is only agnostic about our knowledge of metaphysical objects such as God. And, as noted above, Kant's agnosticism leads to the conclusion that we can neither affirm nor deny claims made by traditional metaphysics." Andrew Fiala, [[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]], ''Critique of Pure Reason'' – Introduction, page xi.

Common myths about Kant's personal mannerisms are listed, explained, and refuted in Goldthwait's introduction to his translation of ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is often held that Kant lived a very strict and disciplined life, leading to an oft-repeated story that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. He never married, but seemed to have a rewarding social life — he was a popular teacher and a modestly successful author even before starting on his major philosophical works. He had a circle of friends with whom he frequently met, among them [[Joseph Green (merchant)|Joseph Green]], an English merchant in Königsberg.

A common myth is that Kant never traveled more than {{convert|16|km}} from Königsberg his whole life.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Rick. 2005. [https://philosophynow.org/issues/49/Kant_200_Years_On 'Kant 200 Years On']. ''Philosophy Now''. No. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, between 1750 and 1754 he worked as a tutor (''Hauslehrer'') in Judtschen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vorländer|first=Karl|url=http://www.textlog.de/35594.html|title=Immanuel Kant: Bei Pfarrer Andersch in Judtschen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now Veselovka, [[Russia]], approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km) and in Groß-Arnsdorf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vorländer|first=Karl|url=http://www.textlog.de/35593.html|title=Immanuel Kant: Bei Major von Hülsen in Arnsdorf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[Jarnołtowo]] near [[Morąg]] (German: Mohrungen), [[Poland]], approximately 145&amp;nbsp;km).

===Young scholar===
Kant showed a great aptitude for study at an early age. He first attended the [[Collegium Fridericianum]] from which he graduated at the end of the summer of 1740. In 1740, aged 16, he enrolled at the [[University of Königsberg]], where he spent his whole career.&lt;ref&gt;''The American International Encyclopedia'' (New York: J.J. Little &amp; Ives, 1954), Vol. IX.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the philosophy of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] under [[Martin Knutzen]] (Associate Professor of Logic and Metaphysics from 1734 until his death in 1751), a [[rationalism|rationalist]] who was also familiar with developments in British philosophy and science and introduced Kant to the new mathematical physics of [[Isaac Newton]]. Knutzen dissuaded Kant from the theory of [[pre-established harmony]], which he regarded as "the pillow for the lazy mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What the Tortoise Taught Us: The Story of Philosophy|last=Porter|first=Burton|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2010|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dissuaded Kant from [[idealism]], the idea that reality is purely mental, which most philosophers in the 18th century regarded in a negative light. The theory of [[transcendental idealism]] that Kant later included in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' was developed partially in opposition to traditional idealism.

His father's stroke and subsequent death in 1746 interrupted his studies. Kant left Königsberg shortly after August 1748&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 2001, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;—he would return there in August 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a private tutor in the towns surrounding Königsberg, but continued his scholarly research. In 1749, he published his first philosophical work, ''[[Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces]]'' (written in 1745–47).&lt;ref&gt;Eric Watkins (ed.), ''Immanuel Kant: Natural Science'', Cambridge University Press, 2012: [http://assets.cambridge.org/97805213/63945/excerpt/9780521363945_excerpt.pdf "Thoughts on the true estimation..."].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early work===
Kant is best known for his work in the philosophy of ethics and metaphysics,&lt;ref name=iep&gt;{{cite web|title=Immanuel Kant: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he made significant contributions to other disciplines. He won the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] Prize in 1754 for his argument that the Moon's gravity would eventually cause its [[tidal locking]] to [[orbital resonance|coincide]] with the Earth's rotation.&lt;ref name="nebulous"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brush|first= Stephen G.|title=A History of Modern Planetary Physics: Nebulous Earth|date=28 May 2014|isbn=0521441714|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he expanded this reasoning to the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] in his ''[[Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens]]''.&lt;ref name="nebulous"/&gt;

[[File:Kant wohnhaus 2.jpg|thumb|Kant's house in Königsberg]]
In the ''Universal Natural History'', Kant laid out the [[Nebular hypothesis]], in which he deduced that the [[Solar System]] had formed from a large cloud of gas, a [[nebula]]. Kant also correctly deduced that the [[Milky Way]] was a [[galaxy|large disk of stars]], which he theorized formed from a much larger spinning gas cloud. He further suggested that other distant "nebulae" might be other galaxies. These postulations opened new horizons for astronomy, for the first time extending it beyond the Solar System to galactic and intergalactic realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamow|first=George|title=[[One Two Three... Infinity]]|location=New York|publisher=Viking P.|date=1947|pages=300ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]] (1867), Kant also made contributions to geology in his ''Universal Natural History'', and according to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (1897), he made contributions useful to mathematicians and astronomers.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

From then on, Kant turned increasingly to philosophical issues, although he continued to write on the sciences throughout his life. In the early 1760s, Kant produced a series of important works in philosophy. ''[[The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures]]'', a work in logic, was published in 1762. Two more works appeared the following year: ''Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into Philosophy'' and ''[[The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God]]''. In 1764, Kant wrote ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'' and then was second to [[Moses Mendelssohn]] in a Berlin Academy prize competition with his ''Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality'' (often referred to as "The Prize Essay"). In 1766 Kant wrote ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'' which dealt with the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. The exact influence of Swedenborg on Kant, as well as the extent of Kant's belief in [[mysticism]] according to ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'', remain controversial.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment" /&gt; On 31 March 1770, aged 45, Kant was finally appointed Full Professor of Logic and Metaphysics (''Professor Ordinarius der Logic und Metaphysic'') at the University of Königsberg. In defense of this appointment, Kant wrote his [[inaugural dissertation]] (''Inaugural-Dissertation'') ''De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis Forma et Principiis'' (''On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World)''.&lt;ref name="RGT"&gt;Since he had written his last [[habilitation thesis]] 14 years earlier, a new habilitation thesis was required (see S. J. McGrath, Joseph Carew (eds.), ''Rethinking German Idealism'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, p. 24).&lt;/ref&gt; This work saw the emergence of several central themes of his mature work, including the distinction between the faculties of intellectual thought and sensible receptivity. To miss this distinction would mean to commit the error of [[subreption]], and, as he says in the last chapter of the dissertation, only in avoiding this error does metaphysics flourish.

The issue that vexed Kant was central to what 20th-century scholars called "the [[philosophy of mind]]". The flowering of the natural sciences had led to an understanding of how data reaches the brain. Sunlight falling on an object is reflected from its surface in a way that maps the surface features (color, texture, etc.). The reflected light reaches the human eye, passes through the cornea, is focused by the lens onto the retina where it forms an image similar to that formed by light passing through a pinhole into a [[camera obscura]]. The retinal cells send impulses through the [[optic nerve]] and then they form a mapping in the brain of the visual features of the object. The interior mapping is not the exterior object, and our belief that there is a meaningful relationship between the object and the mapping in the brain depends on a chain of reasoning that is not fully grounded. But the uncertainty aroused by these considerations, by optical illusions, misperceptions, delusions, etc., are not the end of the problems.

Kant saw that the mind could not function as an empty container that simply receives data from outside. Something must be giving order to the incoming data. Images of external objects must be kept in the same sequence in which they were received. This ordering occurs through the mind's intuition of time. The same considerations apply to the mind's function of constituting space for ordering mappings of visual and tactile signals arriving via the already described chains of physical causation.

It is often claimed that Kant was a late developer, that he only became an important philosopher in his mid-50s after rejecting his earlier views. While it is true that Kant wrote his greatest works relatively late in life, there is a tendency to underestimate the value of his earlier works. Recent Kant scholarship has devoted more attention to these "pre-critical" writings and has recognized a degree of continuity with his mature work.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Susan Shell, ''The Embodiment of Reason'' (Chicago, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work hiatus===
At age 46, Kant was an established scholar and an increasingly influential philosopher, and much was expected of him.

In correspondence with his ex-student and friend [[Markus Herz]], Kant admitted that, in the inaugural dissertation, he had failed to account for the relation between our sensible and intellectual faculties. He needed to explain how we combine what is known as sensory knowledge with the other type of knowledge{{mdash}}i.e. reasoned knowledge{{mdash}}these two being related but having very different processes.

Kant also credited [[David Hume]] with awakening him from a "dogmatic slumber".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'', p 57 (Ak. 4:260)&lt;/ref&gt; Hume had stated that experience consists only of sequences of feelings, images or sounds. Ideas such as "cause", goodness, or objects were not evident in experience, so why do we believe in the reality of these? Kant felt that reason could remove this skepticism, and he set himself to solving these problems. He did not publish any work in philosophy for the next 11 years.

[[File:Immanuel Kant 3.jpg|thumb|Immanuel Kant]]

Although fond of company and conversation with others, Kant isolated himself, and resisted friends' attempts to bring him out of his isolation. It has been noted that in 1778, in response to one of these offers by a former pupil, Kant wrote:
{{quote|
Any change makes me apprehensive, even if it offers the greatest promise of improving my condition, and I am persuaded by this natural instinct of mine that I must take heed if I wish that the threads which the Fates spin so thin and weak in my case to be spun to any length. My great thanks, to my well-wishers and friends, who think so kindly of me as to undertake my welfare, but at the same time a most humble request to protect me in my current condition from any disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Kul-Want and Andrzej Klimowski, ''Introducing Kant'' (Cambridge: Icon Books, 2005).{{page needed|date=October 2011}} {{ISBN|1-84046-664-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Kant emerged from his silence in 1781, the result was the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Although now uniformly recognized as one of the greatest works in the history of philosophy, this ''Critique'' was largely ignored upon its initial publication. The book was long, over 800 pages in the original German edition, and written in a convoluted style. It received few reviews, and these granted it no significance. Kant's former student, [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] criticized it for placing reason as an entity worthy of criticism instead of considering the process of reasoning within the context of language and one's entire personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Copleston|Copleston, Frederick Charles]]. ''The Enlightenment: Voltaire to Kant''. 2003. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[Christian Garve]] and [[Johann Georg Heinrich Feder]], he rejected Kant's position that space and time possessed a form that could be analyzed. Additionally, Garve and Feder also faulted Kant's Critique for not explaining differences in perception of sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Brigitte. ''Kant's Early Critics: The Empiricist Critique of the Theoretical Philosophy''. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Its density made it, as Herder said in a letter to [[Johann Georg Hamann]], a "tough nut to crack", obscured by "all this heavy gossamer".&lt;ref&gt;''Ein Jahrhundert deutscher Literaturkritik'', vol. III, ''Der Aufstieg zur Klassik in der Kritik der Zeit'' (Berlin, 1959), p. 315; as quoted in Gulyga, Arsenij. ''Immanuel Kant: His Life and Thought.'' Trans., Marijan Despaltović. Boston: Birkhäuser, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Its reception stood in stark contrast to the praise Kant had received for earlier works, such as his ''Prize Essay'' and shorter works that preceded the first Critique. These well-received and readable tracts include one on the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake in Lisbon]] that was so popular that it was sold by the page.&lt;ref&gt;Gulyga, Arsenij. ''Immanuel Kant: His Life and Thought.'' Trans., Marijan Despaltović. Boston: Birkhäuser, 1987 pp. 28–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the change in course documented in the first Critique, his books sold well, and by the time he published ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'' in 1764 he had become a notable popular author.&lt;ref&gt;Gulyga, Arsenij. ''Immanuel Kant: His Life and Thought.'' Trans., Marijan Despaltović. Boston: Birkhäuser, 1987, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was disappointed with the first Critique's reception. Recognizing the need to clarify the original treatise, Kant wrote the ''[[Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics]]'' in 1783 as a summary of its main views. Shortly thereafter, Kant's friend Johann Friedrich Schultz (1739–1805) (professor of mathematics) published ''Erläuterungen über des Herrn Professor Kant Critik&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; der reinen Vernunft'' (Königsberg, 1784), which was a brief but very accurate commentary on Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason''.

Kant's reputation gradually rose through the latter portion of the 1780s, sparked by a series of important works: the 1784 essay, "[[What is Enlightenment?|Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]"; 1785's ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (his first work on moral philosophy); and, from 1786, ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science]].'' But Kant's fame ultimately arrived from an unexpected source. In 1786, [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] published a series of public letters on Kantian philosophy. In these letters, Reinhold framed Kant's philosophy as a response to the central intellectual controversy of the era: the [[Pantheism Dispute]]. [[Friedrich Jacobi]] had accused the recently deceased [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (a distinguished dramatist and philosophical essayist) of [[Spinozism]]. Such a charge, tantamount to atheism, was vigorously denied by Lessing's friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]], leading to a bitter public dispute among partisans. The [[scandal|controversy]] gradually escalated into a debate about the values of the Enlightenment and the value of reason.

Reinhold maintained in his letters that Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' could settle this dispute by defending the authority and bounds of reason. Reinhold's [[Letter (message)|letters]] were widely read and made Kant the most famous philosopher of his era.

===Later work and death===
Kant published a second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (''Kritik der reinen Vernunft'') in 1787, heavily revising the first parts of the book. Most of his subsequent work focused on other areas of philosophy. He continued to develop his moral philosophy, notably in 1788's ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (known as the second ''Critique'') and 1797's ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]''. The 1790 ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (the third ''Critique'') applied the Kantian system to aesthetics and [[teleology]]. It was in this critique where Kant wrote one of his most popular statements, ''"it is absurd to hope that another Newton will arise in the future who will make comprehensible to us the production of a blade of grass according to natural laws"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=861|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, Kant's attempt to publish the Second of the four Pieces of ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason]]'', in the journal ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', met with opposition from the King's [[censorship]] commission, which had been established that same year in the context of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"/&gt; Kant then arranged to have all four pieces published as a book, routing it through the philosophy department at the University of Jena to avoid the need for theological censorship.&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"&gt;Derrida ''Vacant Chair'' p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; This insubordination earned him a now famous reprimand from the King.&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"/&gt; When he nevertheless published a second edition in 1794, the censor was so irate that he arranged for a royal order that required Kant never to publish or even speak publicly about religion.&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"/&gt; Kant then published his response to the King's reprimand and explained himself, in the preface of ''The Conflict of the Faculties''.&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"/&gt;

[[File:Kant doerstling2.jpg|thumb|Kant with friends, including [[Christian Jakob Kraus]], [[Johann Georg Hamann]], [[Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder|Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel]] and [[Karl Gottfried Hagen]]]]
He also wrote a number of semi-popular essays on history, religion, politics and other topics. These works were well received by Kant's contemporaries and confirmed his preeminent status in 18th-century philosophy. There were several journals devoted solely to defending and criticizing Kantian philosophy. Despite his success, philosophical trends were moving in another direction. Many of Kant's most important disciples and followers (including [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold|Reinhold]], [[Jakob Sigismund Beck|Beck]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]) transformed the Kantian position into increasingly radical forms of idealism. The progressive stages of revision of Kant's teachings marked the emergence of [[German Idealism]]. Kant opposed these developments and publicly denounced Fichte in an open letter in 1799.&lt;ref name = "Fichte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa12/370.html|title=Open letter by Kant denouncing Fichte's Philosophy (in German)|publisher=Korpora.org|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of his final acts expounding a stance on philosophical questions. In 1800, a student of Kant named Gottlob Benjamin Jäsche (1762–1842) published a manual of logic for teachers called ''Logik'', which he had prepared at Kant's request. Jäsche prepared the ''Logik'' using a copy of a textbook in logic by [[Georg Friedrich Meier]] entitled ''Auszug aus der Vernunftlehre'', in which Kant had written copious notes and annotations. The ''Logik'' has been considered of fundamental importance to Kant's philosophy, and the understanding of it. The great 19th-century logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] remarked, in an incomplete review of [[Thomas Kingsmill Abbott]]'s English translation of the introduction to ''Logik'', that "Kant's whole philosophy turns upon his logic."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v.1, (HUP, 1960), 'Kant and his Refutation of Idealism' p. 15
&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Robert Schirokauer Hartman]] and Wolfgang Schwarz, wrote in the translators' introduction to their English translation of the ''Logik'', "Its importance lies not only in its significance for the ''Critique of Pure Reason'', the second part of which is a restatement of fundamental tenets of the ''Logic'', but in its position within the whole of Kant's work."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''Logic'', G.B. Jäsche (ed), R.S. Hartman, W. Schwarz (translators), Indianapolis, 1984, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's health, long poor, worsened and he died at Königsberg on 12 February 1804, uttering "''Es ist gut'' (It is good)" before expiring.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Vorländer, ''Immanuel Kant: Der Mann und das Werk'', Hamburg: Meiner, 1992, p. II 332.&lt;/ref&gt; His unfinished final work was published as ''Opus Postumum''.

Kant wrote a book discussing his theory of virtue in terms of independence which he believed was "a viable modern alternative to more familiar Greek views about virtue". This book is often criticized for its hostile tone and for not articulating his thoughts about autocracy comprehensibly. In the self-governance model of Aristotelian virtue, the non-rational part of the soul can be made to listen to reason through training. Although Kantian self-governance appears to involve "a rational crackdown on appetites and emotions" with lack of harmony between reason and emotion, Kantian virtue denies requiring "self-conquest, self-suppression, or self-silencing". They dispute that "the self-mastery constitutive of virtue is ultimately mastery over our tendency of will to give priority to appetite or emotion unregulated by duty, it does not require extirpating, suppressing, or silencing sensibility in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McAleer|first1=Sean|title=Kant's Theory of Virtue: The Value of Autocracy.

In Kant's essay "[[What is Enlightenment?|Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]",
Kant defined the Enlightenment as an age shaped by the [[Latin]] motto ''[[Sapere aude]]'' ("Dare to be wise"). Kant maintained that one ought to think autonomously, free of the dictates of external [[authority]]. His work reconciled many of the differences between the [[rationalism|rationalist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] traditions of the 18th century. He had a decisive impact on the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[German Idealism|German Idealist]] philosophies of the 19th century. His work has also been a starting point for many 20th century philosophers.

Kant asserted that, because of the limitations of argumentation in the absence of irrefutable [[Evidence#Evidence in Problems|evidence]], no one could really know whether there is a God and an afterlife or not. For the sake of morality and as a ground for reason, Kant asserted, people are justified in believing in God, even though they could never know God's presence empirically. He explained:

{{quote|text=All the preparations of reason, therefore, in what may be called pure philosophy, are in reality directed to those three problems only [God, the soul, and freedom]. However, these three elements in themselves still hold independent, proportional, objective weight individually. Moreover, in a collective relational context; namely, to know ''what ought to be done'': if the will is free, if there is a God, and if there is a future [[world (philosophy)|world]]. As this concerns our actions with reference to the highest aims of life, we see that the ultimate intention of nature in her wise provision was really, in the constitution of our reason, directed to moral interests only.&lt;ref name = "CPR A801"&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A801.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Kant017.jpg|thumb|Immanuel Kant by [[Carle Vernet]] (1758–1836)]]

The sense of an enlightened approach and the [[scientific method|critical method]] required that "If one cannot prove that a thing ''is,'' he may try to prove that it is ''not.'' If he fails to do either (as often occurs), he may still ask whether it is in his ''interest'' to ''accept'' one or the other of the alternatives hypothetically, from the theoretical or the practical point of view. Hence the question no longer is as to whether [[perpetual peace]] is a real thing or not a real thing, or as to whether we may not be deceiving ourselves when we adopt the former alternative, but we must ''act'' on the supposition of its being real."&lt;ref name = "SoR Concl"&gt;''The Science of Right,'' Conclusion.&lt;/ref&gt; The presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was then a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams... ."&lt;ref name = "CPR A811"&gt;''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant drew a parallel between the [[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant|Copernican revolution]] and the epistemology of his new [[transcendental philosophy]]. He never used the "Copernican revolution" phrase about himself, but it has often been applied to his work by others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rockmore]], ''Marx After Marxism: The Philosophy of Karl Marx'' (2002), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's Copernican revolution involved two interconnected foundations of his "[[critical philosophy]]":
* the [[epistemology]] of [[transcendental idealism]] and
* the [[moral philosophy]] of the autonomy of practical reason.

These teachings placed the active, rational human [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] at the center of the cognitive and moral worlds. Kant argued that the rational order of the world as known by science was not just the accidental accumulation of sense perceptions.

Conceptual unification and integration is carried out by the mind through [[concept]]s or the "categories of the [[Understanding (Kant)|understanding]]" operating on the perceptual manifold within [[space and time]]. The latter are not concepts,&lt;ref&gt;In the first edition of the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' Kant refers to space as "no discursive or...general conception of the relation of things, but a pure intuition" and maintained that "We can only represent to ourselves one space". The "general notion of spaces...depends solely upon limitations" (Meikeljohn trans., A25). In the second edition of the CPR, Kant adds, "The original representation of space is an ''a priori'' intuition, not a concept" (Kemp Smith trans., B40). In regard to time, Kant states that "Time is not a discursive, or what is called a general concept, but a pure form of sensible intuition. Different times are but parts of one and the same time; and the representation which can be given only through a single object is intuition" (A31/B47). For the differences in the discursive use of reason according to concepts and its intuitive use through the construction of concepts, see ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (A719/B747 ff. and A837/B865). On "One and the same thing in space and time" and the mathematical construction of concepts, see A724/B752.&lt;/ref&gt; but are forms of sensibility that are ''a priori'' necessary conditions for any possible experience. Thus the objective order of nature and the causal necessity that operates within it depend on the mind's processes, the product of the rule-based activity that Kant called, "[[A priori and a posteriori|synthesis]]." There is much discussion among Kant scholars about the correct interpretation of this train of thought.

The 'two-world' interpretation regards Kant's position as a statement of epistemological limitation, that we are not able to transcend the bounds of our own mind, meaning that we cannot access the "[[thing-in-itself]]". However, Kant also speaks of the thing in itself or ''transcendental object'' as a product of the (human) understanding as it attempts to conceive of objects in abstraction from the conditions of sensibility. Following this line of thought, some interpreters have argued that the thing in itself does not represent a separate ontological domain but simply a way of considering objects by means of the understanding alone{{spaced ndash}}this is known as the two-aspect view.

The notion of the "[[thing in itself]]" was much discussed by philosophers after Kant. It was argued that because the "thing in itself" was unknowable, its existence must not be assumed. Rather than arbitrarily switching to an account that was ungrounded in anything supposed to be the "real," as did the German Idealists, another group arose to ask how our (presumably reliable) accounts of a coherent and rule-abiding universe were actually grounded. This new kind of philosophy became known as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], and its founder was [[Edmund Husserl]].

With regard to [[morality]], Kant argued that the source of the [[Goodness and value theory|good]] lies not in anything outside the [[human]] subject, either in [[nature]] or given by [[God]], but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanity{{spaced ndash}}understood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as others{{spaced ndash}}as an [[end in itself]] rather than (merely) as [[means (philosophy)|means]] to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.

These ideas have largely framed or influenced all subsequent philosophical discussion and analysis. The specifics of Kant's account generated immediate and lasting controversy. Nevertheless, his theses{{spaced ndash}}that the [[mind]] itself necessarily makes a constitutive contribution to its [[knowledge]], that this contribution is transcendental rather than psychological, that philosophy involves self-critical activity, that morality is rooted in human freedom, and that to act autonomously is to act according to rational moral principles{{spaced ndash}}have all had a lasting effect on subsequent philosophy.

===Theory of perception===
{{Main|Critique of Pure Reason}}

Kant defines his theory of perception in his influential 1781 work the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', which has often been cited as the most significant volume of metaphysics and [[epistemology]] in modern philosophy. Kant maintains that our understanding of the external world had its foundations not merely in experience, but in both experience and [[A priori knowledge|''a priori'' concepts]], thus offering a ''non-empiricist critique of rationalist philosophy'', which is what has been referred to as his [[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant|Copernican revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Kant%2c+Immanuel |title=Kant, Immanuel definition of Kant, Immanuel in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, Kant [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|distinguishes between analytic and synthetic propositions]]:

# '''Analytic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept; ''e.g.'', "All bachelors are unmarried," or, "All bodies take up space."
# '''Synthetic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept; ''e.g.'', "All bachelors are alone," or, "All bodies have weight."

An analytic proposition is true by nature of the meaning of the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. [[David Hume|Hume]]) and rationalists (cf. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.

Kant contests this assumption by claiming that elementary mathematics, like arithmetic, is synthetic ''a priori'', in that its statements provide new knowledge not derived from experience. This becomes part of his over-all argument for [[transcendental idealism]]. That is, he argues that the possibility of experience depends on certain necessary conditions — which he calls ''a priori'' forms — and that these conditions structure and hold true of the world of experience. His main claims in the "[[Critique of Pure Reason#I. Transcendental Doctrine of Elements|Transcendental Aesthetic]]" are that mathematic judgments are synthetic ''a priori'' and that [[space]] and [[time]] are not derived from experience but rather are its preconditions.

Once we have grasped the functions of basic arithmetic, we do not need empirical experience to know that 100 + 100 = 200, and so it appears that arithmetic is analytic. However, that it is analytic can be disproved by considering the calculation 5 + 7 = 12: there is nothing in the numbers 5 and 7 by which the number 12 can be inferred. Thus "5 + 7" and "the cube root of 1,728" or "12" are not analytic because their reference is the same but their sense is not — the statement "5 + 7 = 12" tells us something new about the world. It is self-evident, and undeniably ''a priori'', but at the same time it is synthetic. Thus Kant proved that a proposition can be synthetic and a priori.

Kant asserts that experience is based on the perception of external objects and ''a priori'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;The German word ''Anschauung'', which Kant used, literally means 'looking at' and generally means what in philosophy in English is called "perception". However it sometimes is rendered as "intuition": not, however, with the vernacular meaning of an indescribable or mystical experience or sixth sense, but rather with the meaning of the direct perception or grasping of sensory phenomena. In this article, both terms, "perception" and "intuition" are used to stand for Kant's ''Anschauung''.&lt;/ref&gt; The external world, he writes, provides those things that we sense. But our mind processes this information and gives it order, allowing us to comprehend it. Our mind supplies the conditions of space and time to experience objects. According to the "transcendental unity of apperception", the concepts of the mind (Understanding) and perceptions or intuitions that garner information from phenomena (Sensibility) are synthesized by comprehension. Without concepts, perceptions are nondescript; without perceptions, concepts are meaningless — thus the famous statement, "Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions (perceptions) without concepts are blind."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason [1781], trans. Norman Kemp Smith (N.Y.: St. Martins, 1965), A 51/B 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant also claims that an external environment is necessary for the establishment of the self. Although Kant would want to argue that there is no empirical way of observing the self, we can see the logical necessity of the self when we observe that we can have different perceptions of the external environment over time. By uniting these general representations into one global representation, we can see how a transcendental self emerges. "I am therefore conscious of the identical self in regard to the manifold of the representations that are given to me in an intuition because I call them all together my representations."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Ed. [[Paul Guyer]] and [[Allen W. Wood]]. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1998. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant deemed it obvious that we have some objective knowledge of the world, such as, say, Newtonian physics. But this knowledge relies on [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]], ''a priori'' laws of nature, like causality and substance. How is this possible? Kant's solution was that the [[Subject (philosophy)#The subject in German idealism|subject]] must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are synthetic, ''a priori'' laws of nature that apply to all objects before we experience them. To deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the mind from what is supplied by the given intuitions. This is commonly called a transcendental deduction.&lt;ref name="Prolegomena"&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'', pages 35 to 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

To begin with, Kant's distinction between the ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' being [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and particular knowledge, and the ''a priori'' being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. If we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived ''a posteriori,'' when what is desired is for the knowledge to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions to refer to the object and hold good of it for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. What else is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the ''a priori,'' (universal and necessary knowledge)? Before knowledge can be objective, it must be incorporated under an ''a priori'' category of ''understanding''.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=66&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=2 Deleuze on Kant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114091656/http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=66&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=2 |date=14 November 2007 }}, from where the definitions of ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' were obtained.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a subject says, "The sun shines on the stone; the stone grows warm," all he perceives are phenomena. His judgment is contingent and holds no necessity. But if he says, "The sunshine causes the stone to warm," he subsumes the perception under the category of causality, which is not found in the perception, and necessarily synthesizes the concept sunshine with the concept heat, producing a necessarily universally true judgment.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

To explain the categories in more detail, they are the preconditions of the construction of objects in the mind. Indeed, to even think of the sun and stone presupposes the category of subsistence, that is, substance. For the categories synthesize the random data of the sensory manifold into intelligible objects. This means that the categories are also the most abstract things one can say of any object whatsoever, and hence one can have an ''a priori'' cognition of the totality of all objects of experience if one can list all of them. To do so, Kant formulates another transcendental deduction.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

Judgments are, for Kant, the preconditions of any thought. Man thinks via judgments, so all possible judgments must be listed and the perceptions connected within them put aside, so as to make it possible to examine the moments when ''the understanding'' is engaged in constructing judgments. For the categories are equivalent to these moments, in that they are concepts of intuitions in general, so far as they are determined by these moments universally and necessarily. Thus by listing all the moments, one can deduce from them all of the categories.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

One may now ask: How many possible judgments are there? Kant believed that all the possible propositions within Aristotle's [[syllogism|syllogistic]] logic are equivalent to all possible judgments, and that all the logical operators within the propositions are equivalent to the moments of the understanding within judgments. Thus he listed Aristotle's system in four groups of three: quantity (universal, particular, singular), quality (affirmative, negative, infinite), relation (categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive) and modality (problematic, assertoric, apodeictic). The parallelism with Kant's categories is obvious: quantity (unity, plurality, totality), quality (reality, negation, limitation), relation (substance, cause, community) and modality (possibility, existence, necessity).&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

The fundamental building blocks of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, and then there is the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what we see and hear.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

===Transcendental schema doctrine===
{{See also|Schema (Kant)}}

Kant ran into a problem with his theory that the mind plays a part in producing objective knowledge. Intuitions and categories are entirely disparate, so how can they interact? Kant's solution is the (transcendental) schema: a priori principles by which the transcendental imagination connects concepts with intuitions through time. All the principles are temporally bound, for if a concept is purely a priori, as the categories are, then they must apply for all times. Hence there are principles such as ''substance is that which endures through time'', and ''the cause must always be prior to the effect''.&lt;ref name="Prolegomena"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hackett&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Judgment'', the Introduction to the Hackett edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
[[File:Immanuel Kant.jpg|thumb|Immanuel Kant]]
Kant developed his moral philosophy in three works: ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'' (1785), ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (1788), and ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797).

In ''Groundwork'', Kant' tries to convert our everyday, obvious, rational&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between rational and philosophical knowledge is given in the Preface to the ''Groundwork'', 1785.&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge of morality into philosophical knowledge. The latter two works used "practical reason", which is based only on things about which reason can tell us, and not deriving any principles from experience, to reach conclusions which can be applied to the world of experience (in the second part of ''The Metaphysic of Morals'').

Kant is known for his theory that there is a single [[moral obligation]], which he called the "[[Categorical Imperative]]", and is derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kant defines the demands of moral law as "categorical imperatives". Categorical imperatives are principles that are intrinsically valid; they are good in and of themselves; they must be obeyed in all situations and circumstances, if our behavior is to observe the moral law. The Categorical Imperative provides a test against which moral statements can be assessed. Kant also stated that the moral means and ends can be applied to the categorical imperative, that rational beings can pursue certain "ends" using the appropriate "means". Ends based on physical needs or wants create [[hypothetical imperative]]s. The categorical imperative can only be based on something that is an "end in itself", that is, an end that is not a means to some other need, desire, or purpose.&lt;ref name="Beck 421"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant believed that the moral law is a principle of [[reason]] itself, and is not based on contingent facts about the world, such as what would make us happy, but to act on the moral law which has no other motive than "worthiness of being happy".&lt;ref name = "CPR A806 B834"&gt;''Critique of Pure Reason'', A806/B834.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he believed that moral obligation applies only to rational agents.&lt;ref name="Beck 408"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a hypothetical imperative, a categorical imperative is an unconditional obligation; it has the force of an obligation regardless of our will or desires&lt;ref name="Beck 420-1"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp. 420–1.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'' (1785) Kant enumerated three formulations of the categorical imperative that he believed to be roughly equivalent.&lt;ref name="Beck 436"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, Kant stated:

:Act only according to that [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |translator-first=James W. |translator-last=Ellington |orig-year=1785 |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett |year=1993 |pages=30 |isbn=0-87220-166-X |ref=harv}}. It is standard to also reference the ''Akademie Ausgabe'' of Kant's works. The ''Groundwork'' occurs in the fourth volume.The above citation is taken from 4:421.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant, one cannot make exceptions for oneself. The philosophical maxim on which one acts should always be considered to be a universal law without exception.  One cannot allow oneself to do a particular action unless one thinks it appropriate that the reason for the action should become a universal law. For example, one should not steal, however dire the circumstances{{mdash}}because, by permitting oneself to steal, one makes stealing a universally  acceptable act. This is the first formulation of the categorical imperative, often known as the universalizability principle.

Kant believed that, if an action is not done with the motive of duty, then it is without moral value. He thought that every action should have pure intention behind it; otherwise, it is meaningless. The final result is not the most important aspect of an action;  rather, how the person feels while carrying out the action is the time when value is attached to the result.

In ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'', Kant also posited the "counter-[[utilitarian]] idea that there is a difference between preferences and values, and that considerations of individual rights temper calculations of aggregate utility", a concept that is an axiom in economics:&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2003) ''Ecosystems and Well-being: A Framework for Assessment''. Washington DC: Island Press, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everything has either a ''price'' or a ''dignity''. Whatever has a price can be replaced by something else as its equivalent; on the other hand, whatever is above all price, and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a dignity. But that which constitutes the condition under which alone something can be an end in itself does not have mere relative worth, i.e., price, but an intrinsic worth, i.e., a dignity. (p. 53, italics in original).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A phrase quoted by Kant, which is used to summarize the counter-utilitarian nature of his moral philosophy, is ''[[Fiat justitia, pereat mundus]]'', ("Let justice be done, though the world perish"), which he translates loosely as "Let justice reign even if all the rascals in the world should perish from it". This appears in his 1795 ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' ("''[[:de:Zum ewigen Frieden|Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf]]''"), Appendix 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/kant/append1.htm|title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch: Appendix 1|publisher=Constitution.org|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LykHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=pereat+mundus+inauthor:Kant|title=Project for a Perpetual Peace, p. 61|publisher=Books.google.com|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009|year=1796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QskIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA456&amp;dq=pereat+mundus+inauthor:Kant|title=Immanuel Kant's Werke, revidirte Gesammtausg, p. 456|publisher=Books.google.com|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009|year=1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First formulation====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|In his ''Metaphysics,'' Immanuel Kant introduced the [[categorical imperative]]: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."]]
The first formulation (Formula of Universal Law) of the moral imperative "requires that the maxims be chosen as though they should hold as universal [[natural law|laws of nature]]" .&lt;ref name="Beck 436" /&gt; This formulation in principle has as its supreme law the creed "Always act according to that maxim whose universality as a law you can at the same time will" and is the "only condition under which a will can never come into conflict with itself [....]"&lt;ref name="Beck 437"&gt;Kant, Foundations, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

One interpretation of the first formulation is called the "universalizability test".&lt;ref&gt;"Kant and the German Enlightenment" in "History of Ethics". ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Vol. 3, pp. 95–96. MacMillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; An agent's maxim, according to Kant, is his "subjective principle of human actions": that is, what the agent believes is his reason to act.&lt;ref name="Beck 400 429"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp. 400, 429.&lt;/ref&gt; The universalisability test has five steps:

# Find the agent's maxim (i.e., an action paired with its motivation). Take, for example, the declaration "I will lie for personal benefit". Lying is the action; the motivation is to fulfill some sort of desire. Together, they form the maxim.
# Imagine a possible world in which everyone in a similar position to the real-world agent followed that maxim.
# Decide if contradictions or irrationalities would arise in the possible world as a result of following the maxim.
# If a contradiction or irrationality would arise, acting on that maxim is not allowed in the real world.
# If there is no contradiction, then acting on that maxim is permissible, and is sometimes required.

(For a modern parallel, see [[John Rawls]]' hypothetical situation, the [[original position]].)

====Second formulation====
The second formulation (or Formula of the End in Itself) holds that "the rational being, as by its nature an end and thus as an end in itself, must serve in every maxim as the condition restricting all merely relative and arbitrary ends".&lt;ref name="Beck 436" /&gt; The principle dictates that you "[a]ct with reference to every rational being (whether yourself or another) so that it is an end in itself in your maxim", meaning that the rational being is "the basis of all maxims of action" and "must be treated never as a mere means but as the supreme limiting condition in the use of all means, i.e., as an end at the same time".&lt;ref name="Beck 437-8"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp. 437–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Third formulation ====
The third formulation (i.e. Formula of Autonomy) is a synthesis of the first two and is the basis for the "complete determination of all maxims". It states "that all maxims which stem from autonomous legislation ought to harmonize with a possible realm of ends as with a realm of nature".&lt;ref name="Beck 436"/&gt;

In principle, "So act as if your maxims should serve at the same time as the universal law (of all rational beings)", meaning that we should so act that we may think of ourselves as "a member in the universal realm of ends", [[legislating]] universal laws through our maxims (that is, a universal [[code of conduct]]), in a "possible realm of ends".&lt;ref name="Beck 438-9"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp. 438–9. See also [[Kingdom of Ends]]&lt;/ref&gt; No one may elevate themselves above the universal law, therefore it is one's duty to follow the maxim(s).

====''Religion Within the Limits of Reason''====
Commentators, starting in the 20th century, have tended to see Kant as having a strained relationship with religion, though this was not the prevalent view in the 19th century. [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], whose letters first made Kant famous, wrote "I believe that I may infer without reservation that the interest of religion, and of Christianity in particular, accords completely with the result of the Critique of Reason.".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Letters on the Kantian Philosophy (1786), 3rd Letter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Schultz]], who wrote one of the first Kant commentaries, wrote "And does not this system itself cohere most splendidly with the Christian religion? Do not the divinity and beneficence of the latter become all the more evident?"&lt;ref&gt;Johann Schultz, Exposition of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1784), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This view continued throughout the 19th century, as noted by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who said "Kant's success is merely a theologian's success."&lt;ref&gt;"The Protestant pastor is the grandfather of German philosophy...German philosophy is at bottom-a cunning theology...Why the rejoicing heard through the German academic world--three-quarters composed of the sons of pastors and teachers-at the appearance of Kant? Why the Germans' conviction, which still find echo even today, that with Kant things were taking a turn of the better? Kant's success is merely a theologian's success". Nietzsche, The Antichrist, 10&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for these views was Kant's moral theology, and the widespread belief that his philosophy was the great antithesis to [[Spinozism]], which had been convulsing the European academy for much of the 18th century. Spinozism was widely seen as the cause of the [[Pantheism controversy]], and as a form of sophisticated pantheism or even atheism. As Kant's philosophy disregarded the possibility of arguing for God through pure reason alone, for the same reasons it also disregarded the possibility of arguing against God through pure reason alone. This, coupled with his moral philosophy (his argument that the existence of morality is a rational reason why God and an afterlife do and must exist), was the reason he was seen by many, at least through the end of the 19th century, as a great defender of religion in general and Christianity in particular.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Kant articulates his strongest criticisms of the organization and practices of religious organizations to those that encourage what he sees as a religion of counterfeit service to God.&lt;ref name="Immanuel Kant 1793"&gt;Immanuel Kant. ''Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone'' (1793), Book IV, Part 1, Section 1, "The Christian religion as a natural religion."&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major targets of his criticism are external ritual, superstition and a hierarchical church order. He sees these as efforts to make oneself pleasing to God in ways other than conscientious adherence to the principle of moral rightness in choosing and acting upon one's maxims. Kant's criticisms on these matters, along with his rejection of certain theoretical proofs grounded in pure reason (particularly the [[ontological argument]]) for the existence of God and his philosophical commentary on some Christian doctrines, have resulted in interpretations that see Kant as hostile to religion in general and Christianity in particular (e.g., Walsh 1967). Nevertheless, other interpreters consider that Kant was trying to mark off defensible from indefensible Christian belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-religion/|title=Kant's Philosophy of Religion (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=Plato.stanford.edu|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant sees in [[Jesus Christ]] the affirmation of a "pure moral disposition of the heart" that "can make man well-pleasing to God".&lt;ref name="Immanuel Kant 1793"/&gt; Regarding Kant's conception of religion, some critics have argued that he was sympathetic to deism.&lt;ref&gt;For example Peter Byrne, who wrote about Kant's relationship with deism. Byrne, Peter (2007), ''Kant on God'', London: Ashgate, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have argued that Kant's moral conception moves from deism to theism (as moral theism), for example Allen W. Wood&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Allen W. (1970), ''Kant's moral religion'', London and Ithaca: Cornell University Press, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and Merold Westphal.&lt;ref&gt;Westphal, Merold (2010),''The Emerge of Modern Philosophy of Religion'', in Taliaferro, Charles, Draper, Paul and Quinn, Philip (editors), ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion'', Oxford: Blackwell, page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; As for Kant's book ''Religion within the Boundaries of bare Reason'', it was emphasized that Kant reduced religiosity to rationality, religion to morality and Christianity to ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2004), ''Dumnezeu şi religia în concepţia lui Immanuel Kant din Religia în limitele raţiunii'', in Boboc, Alexandru and Mariş, N. I. (editors), ''Studii de istoria filosofiei universale'', volume 12, Bucharest: Romanian Academy.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Idea of freedom====
In the ''Critique of Pure Reason'',&lt;ref&gt;The Norman Kemp Smith translation has been used for this section, with citation noting the pagination of the first and second editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant distinguishes between the transcendental idea of freedom, which as a psychological concept is "mainly empirical" and refers to "the question whether we must admit a power of spontaneously beginning a series of successive things or states" as a real ground of necessity in regard to causality,&lt;ref name="CPR A448 B476"&gt;Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A448/B476.&lt;/ref&gt; and the practical concept of freedom as the independence of our will from the "coercion" or "necessitation through sensuous impulses". Kant finds it a source of difficulty that the practical idea of freedom is founded on the transcendental idea of freedom,&lt;ref name = "CPR A534 B562"&gt;Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A534/B562.&lt;/ref&gt; but for the sake of practical interests uses the practical meaning, taking "no account of... its transcendental meaning," which he feels was properly "disposed of" in the Third Antinomy, and as an element in the question of the freedom of the will is for philosophy "a real stumbling-block" that has "embarrassed speculative reason".&lt;ref name="CPR A448 B476" /&gt;

Kant calls practical "everything that is possible through freedom", and the pure practical laws that are never given through sensuous conditions but are held analogously with the universal law of causality are moral laws. Reason can give us only the "pragmatic laws of free action through the senses", but pure practical laws given by reason ''a priori''&lt;ref&gt;the same distinction of transcendental and practical meaning can be applied to the idea of God, with the ''proviso'' that the practical concept of freedom can be experienced (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A801-804/B829-832).&lt;/ref&gt; dictate "''what ought to be done''".&lt;ref name = "CPR A800-802 B828-830"&gt;Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A800–2/B828–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The concept of freedom is also handled in the third section of the ''Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals''. In the ''Critique of Practical Reason'' see § VII and § VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Categories of freedom====
In the ''Critique of Practical Reason'', at the end of the second Main Part of the ''Analytics'',&lt;ref&gt;5:65–67&lt;/ref&gt; Kant introduces the categories of freedom, in analogy with the categories of understanding their practical counterparts. Kant's categories of freedom apparently function primarily as conditions for the possibility for actions (i) to be free, (ii) to be understood as free and (iii) to be morally evaluated. For Kant, although actions as theoretical objects are constituted by means of the theoretical categories, actions as practical objects (objects of practical use of reason, and which can be good or bad) are constituted by means of the categories of freedom. Only in this way can actions, as phenomena, be a consequence of freedom, and be understood and evaluated as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]], 'Die Kategorien der Freiheit bei Kant', in ''Kant: Analysen, Probleme, Kritik'' Vol. 1, 1988, 193–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic philosophy===
Kant discusses the subjective nature of aesthetic qualities and experiences in ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'' (1764). Kant's contribution to [[aesthetics|aesthetic theory]] is developed in the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (1790) where he investigates the possibility and logical status of "judgments of taste." In the "Critique of Aesthetic Judgment," the first major division of the ''Critique of Judgment'', Kant used the term "aesthetic" in a manner that, according to Kant scholar W.H. Walsh, differs from its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Critique of Judgment in "Kant, Immanuel" ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol 4. Macmillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Critique of Pure Reason'', to note essential differences between judgments of taste, moral judgments, and scientific judgments, Kant abandoned the term "aesthetic" as "designating the critique of taste," noting that judgments of taste could never be "directed" by "laws ''a priori''."&lt;ref name = "CPR A22 B36"&gt;Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, A22/B36.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|A. G. Baumgarten]], who wrote ''Aesthetica'' (1750–58),&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, Monroe. "History of Aesthetics". ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 1, section on "Toward a unified aesthetics", p. 25, Macmillan 1973. Baumgarten coined the term "aesthetics" and expanded, clarified, and unified Wolffian aesthetic theory, but had left the ''Aesthetica'' unfinished (See also: Tonelli, Giorgio. "Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten". ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 1, Macmillan 1973). In Bernard's translation of the ''Critique of Judgment'' he indicates in the notes that Kant's reference in § 15 in regard to the identification of perfection and beauty is probably a reference to Baumgarten.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was one of the first philosophers to develop and integrate aesthetic theory into a unified and comprehensive philosophical system, utilizing ideas that played an integral role throughout his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;German Idealism in "History of Aesthetics" ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol 1. Macmillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter "Analytic of the Beautiful" in the ''Critique of Judgment'', Kant states that beauty is not a property of an artwork or natural phenomenon, but is instead consciousness of the pleasure that attends the 'free play' of the imagination and the understanding. Even though it appears that we are using reason to decide what is beautiful, the judgment is not a cognitive judgment,&lt;ref&gt;Kant's general discussions of the distinction between "cognition" and "conscious of" are also given in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (notably A320/B376), and section V and the conclusion of section VIII of his Introduction in ''Logic''.&lt;/ref&gt; "and is consequently not logical, but aesthetical" (§ 1). A pure judgement of taste is subjective since it refers to the emotional response of the subject and is based upon nothing but esteem for an object itself: it is a disinterested pleasure, and we feel that pure judgements of taste (i.e. judgements of beauty), lay claim to universal validity (§§20–22). It is important to note that this universal validity is not derived from a determinate concept of beauty but from ''common sense'' (§40). Kant also believed that a judgement of taste shares characteristics engaged in a moral judgement: both are disinterested, and we hold them to be universal. In the chapter "Analytic of the Sublime" Kant identifies the sublime as an aesthetic quality that, like beauty, is subjective, but unlike beauty refers to an indeterminate relationship between the faculties of the imagination and of reason, and shares the character of moral judgments in the use of reason. The feeling of the sublime, divided into two distinct modes (the mathematical and the dynamical sublime), describes two subjective moments that concern the relationship of the faculty of the imagination to reason. Some commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clewis |first=Robert |year= 2009 |title=The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom |location= Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item2326741/?site_locale=en_US}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that Kant's critical philosophy contains a third kind of the sublime, the moral sublime, which is the aesthetic response to the moral law or a representation, and a development of the "noble" sublime in Kant's theory of 1764. The mathematical sublime results from the failure of the imagination to comprehend natural objects that appear boundless and formless, or appear "absolutely great" (§ 23–25). This imaginative failure is then recuperated through the pleasure taken in reason's assertion of the concept of infinity. In this move the faculty of reason proves itself superior to our fallible sensible self (§§ 25–26). In the dynamical sublime there is the sense of annihilation of the sensible self as the imagination tries to comprehend a vast might. This power of nature threatens us but through the resistance of reason to such sensible annihilation, the subject feels a pleasure and a sense of the human moral vocation. This appreciation of moral feeling through exposure to the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] helps to develop moral character.

Kant developed a distinction between an object of art as a material value subject to the conventions of society and the transcendental condition of the judgment of taste as a "refined" value in the propositions of his ''Idea of A Universal History'' (1784). In the Fourth and Fifth Theses of that work he identified all art as the "fruits of unsociableness" due to men's "antagonism in society"&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Idea for a Universal History''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (20, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the Seventh Thesis, asserted that while such material property is indicative of a civilized state, only the ideal of morality and the universalization of refined value through the improvement of the mind "belongs to culture".&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Idea for a Universal History''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (26).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political philosophy===
{{Main|Political philosophy of Immanuel Kant}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
In ''Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch'',&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]'' (1795)&lt;/ref&gt; Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace.'' Trans. Lewis White Beck (377).&lt;/ref&gt; His [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] theory was extended in the ''Science of Right'', the first part of the [[Metaphysics of Morals]] (1797).&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Riedel ''Between Tradition and Revolution: The Hegelian Transformation of Political Philosophy'', Cambridge 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Kant believed that [[universal history]] leads to the ultimate world of republican states at peace, but his theory was not pragmatic. The process was described in "Perpetual Peace" as natural rather than rational:
{{quote|
The guarantee of perpetual peace is nothing less than that great artist, nature...In her mechanical course we see that her aim is to produce a harmony among men, against their will, and indeed through their discord. As a necessity working according to laws we do not know, we call it destiny. But, considering its designs in universal history, we call it "providence," inasmuch as we discern in it the profound wisdom of a higher cause which predetermines the course of nature and directs it to the objective final end of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;''On History'', (ed. L. W. Beck, New York: Bobbs Merill, 1963, p 106).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant's political thought can be summarized as republican government and international organization. "In more characteristically Kantian terms, it is doctrine of the state based upon the law (''[[Rechtsstaat]]'') and of eternal peace. Indeed, in each of these formulations, both terms express the same idea: that of legal constitution or of 'peace through law'. Kant's political philosophy, being essentially a legal doctrine, rejects by definition the opposition between moral education and the play of passions as alternate foundations for social life. The state is defined as the union of men under law. The state is constituted by laws which are necessary a priori because they flow from the very concept of law. "A regime can be judged by no other criteria nor be assigned any other functions, than those proper to the lawful order as such." &lt;ref&gt;History of Political Philosophy, edited by Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, The University of Chicago Press, 1987, pp. 581–582, 603&lt;/ref&gt;

He opposed "democracy," which at his time meant [[direct democracy]], believing that majority rule posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, "...democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which 'all' decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, 'all,' who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace.'' Trans. Lewis White Beck (352).&lt;/ref&gt; As with most writers at the time, he distinguished three forms of government i.e. democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with [[mixed government]] as the most ideal form of it.

==Anthropology==
[[File:German 5 DM 1974 D Silver Coin Immanuel Kant.jpg|right|thumb|5 DM 1974 D silver coin commemorating the 250th birthday of Immanuel Kant in [[Königsberg]]]]

Kant lectured on anthropology for over 25 years. His ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' was published in 1798. (This was the subject of [[Michel Foucault]]'s secondary dissertation for his [[State doctorate]], ''[[Introduction to Kant's Anthropology]]''.) Kant's Lectures on Anthropology were published for the first time in 1997 in German.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis Verlag, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Introduction to Kant's Anthropology'' was translated into English and published by the Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy series in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'', ed. Robert B. Louden, introduction by Manfred Kuehn, Cambridge University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant was among the first people of his time to introduce anthropology as an intellectual area of study long before the field gained popularity. As a result, his texts are considered to have advanced the field. Kant's point of view also influenced the works of philosophers after him such as Martin Heidegger, Paul Ricoeur, and Jean Greisch.

Kant viewed anthropology in two broad categories. One category was the physiological approach which he referred to as "what nature makes of the human being". The other category was the pragmatic approach which explored the things a human "can and should make of himself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gregor|first1=Brian|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. By Immanuel Kant. Translated and edited by Robert B. Louden.|volume=Heythrop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Kant's influence on Western thought has been profound.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Oliver A. Johnson claims that, "With the possible exception of Plato's Republic, (Critique of Pure Reason) is the most important philosophical book ever written." Article on Kant within the collection "Great thinkers of the Western World", Ian P. McGreal, Ed., HarperCollins, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Over and above his influence on specific thinkers, Kant changed the framework within which philosophical inquiry has been carried out. He accomplished a [[paradigm shift]]; very little philosophy is now carried out in the style of pre-Kantian philosophy. This shift consists in several closely related innovations that have become foundational in philosophy itself and in the social sciences and humanities generally:
* Kant's "Copernican revolution", that placed the role of the human subject or knower at the center of inquiry into our knowledge, such that it is impossible to philosophize about things as they are independently of us or of how they are for us;&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Palmquist, "The Architectonic Form of Kant's Copernican Logic", ''Metaphilosophy'' 17:4 (October 1986), pp. 266–288; revised and reprinted as Chapter III of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 Kant's System of Perspectives]: An architectonic interpretation of the Critical philosophy (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
* His invention of critical philosophy, that is of the notion of being able to discover and systematically explore possible inherent limits to our ability to know through philosophical reasoning;
* His creation of the concept of "conditions of possibility", as in his notion of "the conditions of possible experience"{{spaced ndash}}that is that things, knowledge, and forms of consciousness rest on prior conditions that make them possible, so that, to understand or to know them, we must first understand these conditions;
* His theory that objective experience is actively constituted or constructed by the functioning of the human mind;
* His notion of moral autonomy as central to humanity;
* His assertion of the principle that human beings should be treated as ends rather than as means.

Kant's ideas have been incorporated into a variety of schools of thought. These include [[German Idealism]], [[Marxism]], [[positivism]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[critical theory]], [[linguistic philosophy]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[deconstructionism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Historical influence===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}

During his own life, there was much critical attention paid to his thought. He had an influence on [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold|Reinhold]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Novalis]] during the 1780s and 1790s. The school of thinking known as [[German Idealism]] developed from his writings. The German Idealists Fichte and Schelling, for example, tried to bring traditional "metaphysically" laden notions like "the Absolute", "God", and "Being" into the scope of Kant's [[critical thought]].&lt;ref&gt;There is much debate in the recent scholarship about the extent to which Fichte and Schelling actually overstep the boundaries of Kant's critical philosophy, thus entering the realm of dogmatic or pre-Critical philosophy. Beiser's ''German Idealism'' discusses some of these issues. Beiser, Frederick C. ''German Idealism: The Struggle against Subjectivism, 1781–1801.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, the German Idealists tried to reverse Kant's view that we cannot know what we cannot observe.

[[File:Kant Kaliningrad.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Immanuel Kant in [[Kaliningrad]] ([[Königsberg]]), Russia. Replica by {{Interlanguage link multi|Harald Haacke|de}} of the original by [[Christian Daniel Rauch]] lost in 1945.]]

Hegel was one of Kant's first major critics. In response to what he saw as Kant's abstract and formal account, Hegel brought about an ethic focused on the "ethical life" of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, ''Natural Law: The Scientific Ways of Treating Natural Law, Its Place in Moral Philosophy, and Its Relation to the Positive Sciences.'' trans. T. M. Knox. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1975. Hegel's mature view and his concept of "ethical life" is elaborated in his ''Philosophy of Right.'' Hegel, ''Philosophy of Right.'' trans. T. M. Knox. Oxford University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; But Hegel's notion of "ethical life" is meant to subsume, rather than replace, [[Kantian ethics]]. And Hegel can be seen as trying to defend Kant's idea of freedom as going beyond finite "desires", by means of reason. Thus, in contrast to later critics like Nietzsche or Russell, Hegel shares some of Kant's most basic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pippin's ''Hegel's Idealism'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989) emphasizes the continuity of Hegel's concerns with Kant's. Robert Wallace, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) explains how Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' defends Kant's idea of freedom as going beyond finite "inclinations", contra skeptics such as David Hume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's thinking on religion was used in Britain to challenge the decline in religious faith in the nineteenth century. British Catholic writers, notably [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], followed this approach. [[Ronald Englefield]] debated this movement, and Kant's use of language. See Englefield's article,&lt;ref&gt;Englefield, Ronald, ''Kant as Defender of the Faith in Nineteenth-century England", ''Question'', 12, 16–27, (Pemberton, London)&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted in Englefield.&lt;ref&gt;Englefield, Ronald, Critique of Pure Verbiage, Essays on Abuses of Language in Literary, Religious, and Philosophical Writings, edited by G. A. Wells and D. R. Oppenheimer, Open Court, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of Kant were common in the realist views of the new positivism at that time.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was strongly influenced by Kant's [[transcendental idealism]]. He, like [[G. E. Schulze]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], and Fichte before him, was critical of Kant's theory of the thing in itself. Things in themselves, they argued, are neither the cause of what we observe nor are they completely beyond our access. Ever since the first ''Critique of Pure Reason'' philosophers have been critical of Kant's theory of the thing in itself. Many have argued, if such a thing exists beyond experience then one cannot posit that it affects us causally, since that would entail stretching the category 'causality' beyond the realm of experience. For a review of this problem and the relevant literature see ''The Thing in Itself and the Problem of Affection'' in the revised edition of Henry Allison's ''Kant's Transcendental Idealism''. For Schopenhauer things in themselves do not exist outside the non-rational will. The world, as Schopenhauer would have it, is the striving and largely unconscious will. Michael Kelly, in the preface to his 1910 book ''Kant's Ethics and Schopenhauer's Criticism'', stated: "Of Kant it may be said that what is good and true in his philosophy would have been buried with him, were it not for Schopenhauer...."

With the success and wide influence of Hegel's writings, Kant's influence began to wane, though there was in Germany a movement that hailed a return to Kant in the 1860s, beginning with the publication of ''Kant und die Epigonen'' in 1865 by [[Otto Liebmann]]. His motto was "Back to Kant", and a re-examination of his ideas began (See [[Neo-Kantianism]]). During the turn of the 20th century there was an important revival of Kant's theoretical philosophy, known as the [[Marburg School]], represented in the work of [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Paul Natorp]], [[Ernst Cassirer]],&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Lewis White. "Neo-Kantianism". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 5–6. Macmillan, 1973. Article on Neo-Kantianism by a translator and scholar of Kant.&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-Neo-Kantian [[Nicolai Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Cerf, Walter. "Nicolai Hartmann". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 3–4. Macmillan, 1973. Nicolai was a realist who later rejected the idealism of Neo-Kantianism, his anti-Neo-Kantian views emerging with the publication of the second volume of ''Hegel'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's notion of "Critique" has been quite influential. The Early German Romantics, especially [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in his "Athenaeum Fragments", used Kant's self-reflexive conception of criticism in their Romantic theory of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, Friedrich. "Athenaeum Fragments", in ''Philosophical Fragments''. Trans. Peter Firchow. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1991. See especially fragments Nos. 1, 43, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in [[Aesthetics]], [[Clement Greenberg]], in his classic essay "Modernist Painting", uses Kantian criticism, what Greenberg refers to as "immanent criticism", to justify the aims of [[Abstract Art|Abstract painting]], a movement Greenberg saw as aware of the key limitiaton—flatness—that makes up the medium of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Clement. "Modernist Painting", in ''The Philosophy of Art'', ed. Alex Neill and Aaron Ridley, McGraw-Hill, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] was also greatly influenced by Kant's notion of "Critique" and wrote several pieces on Kant for a re-thinking of the Enlightenment as a form of "critical thought". He went so far as to classify his own philosophy as a "critical history of modernity, rooted in Kant".&lt;ref&gt;See "Essential Works of Foucault: 1954–1984 vol.2: Aesthetics, Method, and Epistemology." Ed. by James Faubion, Trans. Robert Hurley et al. New York City, New York: The New Press, 1998 (2010 reprint). See "Foucault, Michel, 1926 –" entry by Maurice Florence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant believed that mathematical truths were forms of [[synthetic a priori]] knowledge, which means they are necessary and universal, yet known through intuition.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion and qualified defense of this position, see Stephen Palmquist, "A Priori Knowledge in Perspective: (I) Mathematics, Method and Pure Intuition", ''The Review of Metaphysics'' 41:1 (September 1987), pp. 3–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's often brief remarks about [[mathematics]] influenced the mathematical school known as [[intuitionism]], a movement in [[philosophy of mathematics]] opposed to [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], and [[Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[logicism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephan Körner|Körner, Stephan]], ''The Philosophy of Mathematics'', Dover, 1986. For an analysis of Kant's writings on mathematics see, Friedman, Michael, ''Kant and the Exact Sciences'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Francois Lyotard, however, emphasized the indeterminacy in the nature of thought and language and has engaged in debates with Habermas based on the effects this indeterminacy has on philosophical and political debates.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. (2984) Habermas and Lyotard on postmodernity. Praxis International (32-44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's influence also has extended to the social, behavioral, and physical sciences, as in the sociology of [[Max Weber]], the psychology of [[Jean Piaget]], and the linguistics of [[Noam Chomsky]]. Kant's work on mathematics and synthetic a priori knowledge is also cited by theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] as an early influence on his intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;Issacson, Walter. "Einstein: His Life and Universe." p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the thoroughness of the Kantian paradigm shift, his influence extends to thinkers who neither specifically refer to his work nor use his terminology.

==Personal legacy==

Kant always cut a curious figure in his lifetime for his modest, rigorously scheduled habits, which have been referred to as clocklike. But [[Heinrich Heine]] noted the magnitude of "his destructive, world-crushing thoughts" and considered him a sort of philosophical "executioner", comparing him to [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] with the observation that both men "represented in the highest the type of provincial bourgeois. Nature had destined them to weigh coffee and sugar, but Fate determined that they should weigh other things and placed on the scales of the one a king, on the scales of the other a god."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/resources/files/On%20Kant.pdf |title=Heine on Immanuel Kant |access-date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his body was transferred to a new burial spot, his skull was measured during the exhumation and found to be larger than the average German male's with a "high and broad" forehead.&lt;ref&gt;''Examined Lives, From Socrates to Nietzsche'', James Miller p.284&lt;/ref&gt; His forehead has been an object of interest ever since it became well-known through his portraits: "In Döbler's portrait and in Kiefer's faithful if expressionistic reproduction of it — as well as in many of the other late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century portraits of Kant — the forehead is remarkably large and decidedly retreating. Was Kant's forehead shaped this way in these images because he was a philosopher, or, to follow the implications of Lavater's system, was he a philosopher because of the intellectual acuity manifested by his forehead? Kant and Johann Kaspar Lavater were correspondents on theological matters, and Lavater refers to Kant in his work "Physiognomic Fragments, for the Education of Human Knowledge and Love of People" (Leipzig &amp; Winterthur, 1775-1778).&lt;ref&gt;''Immanuel Kant and the Bo(a)rders of Art History'' Mark Cheetham, in The Subjects of Art History: Historical Objects in Contemporary Perspectives, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomb and statue==
[[File:Kant kaliningrad2.png|upright|thumb|Kant's tomb in [[Kaliningrad]], Russia]]

Kant's [[mausoleum]] adjoins the northeast corner of [[Königsberg Cathedral]] in [[Kaliningrad]], Russia. The mausoleum was constructed by the architect [[Friedrich Lahrs]] and was finished in 1924 in time for the bicentenary of Kant's birth. Originally, Kant was buried inside the cathedral, but in 1880 his remains were moved to a [[neo-Gothic]] chapel adjoining the northeast corner of the cathedral. Over the years, the chapel became dilapidated and was demolished to make way for the mausoleum, which was built on the same location.

The tomb and its mausoleum are among the few artifacts of German times preserved by the [[Soviets]] after they conquered and annexed the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/architectural-competition-held-to-rebuild-koenigsberg-city-center-a-980260.html|title=Resurrecting Königsberg: Russian City Looks to German Roots|last=Beyer|first=Susanne|date=2014-07-25|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many newlyweds bring flowers to the mausoleum.

Artifacts previously owned by Kant, known as ''Kantiana'', were included in the [[Königsberg City Museum]]. However, the museum was destroyed during [[World War II]].

A replica of the statue of Kant that stood in German times in front of the main [[University of Königsberg]] building was donated by a German entity in the early 1990s and placed in the same grounds.

After the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion]] of [[Königsberg]]'s German population at the end of [[World War II]], the University of Königsberg where Kant taught was replaced by the Russian-language Kaliningrad State University, which appropriated the campus and surviving buildings. In 2005, the university was renamed [[Immanuel Kant State University of Russia]]. The name change was announced at a ceremony attended by President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia and Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of Germany, and the university formed a Kant Society, dedicated to the study of [[Kantianism]].

===Collected works in German===
[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] inaugurated the Academy edition (the ''Akademie-Ausgabe'' abbreviated as ''AA'' or ''Ak'') of Kant's writings (''Gesammelte Schriften'', [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften]], Berlin, 1902–38) in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Notes and Fragments'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its first editor. The volumes are grouped into four sections:
* I. Kant's published writings (vols. 1–9),
* II. Kant's correspondence (vols. 10–13),
* III. Kant's literary remains, or ''[[Nachlass]]'' (vols. 14–23), and
* IV. Student notes from Kant's lectures (vols. 24–29).

In Germany, one important contemporary interpreter of Kant and the movement of [[German Idealism]] he began is [[Dieter Henrich]], who has some work available in English. [[P. F. Strawson]]'s ''[[The Bounds of Sense]]'' (1966) played a significant role in determining the contemporary reception of Kant in England and America. More recent interpreters of note in the English-speaking world include [[Lewis White Beck]], [[Jonathan Bennett (philosopher)|Jonathan Bennett]], Henry Allison, [[Paul Guyer]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], Stephen Palmquist, [[Robert B.

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
An '''indispensable party''' (also called a '''required party''', '''necessary party''', or '''necessary and indispensable party''') is a [[Party (law)|party]] in a [[lawsuit]] whose participation is required for [[jurisdiction]] or the purpose of rendering a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]. In reality, a party may be "necessary" but not indispensable.  For example, if s/he claims an interest in the litigation, that interest may be impeded if s/he is not joined. That doesn't transform him or her into an indispensable party unless her absence threatens some other party's interest. Often, an indispensable party is any party whose rights are directly affected by disposition of the case. Many [[jurisdiction]]s have rules which provide for an indispensable party to be [[joinder|joined]] (brought into the case as a party) at the [[Judicial discretion|discretion]] of the [[judge]]. In some cases, the inability to join such a party means that the case must be dismissed. This is outlined in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 19. 

==Identifying an indispensable party==
The indispensable party is often a prudential [[Standing (law)|standing]] requirement.  That is, while the parties currently involved in litigation have an actual [[case or controversy]], judges will not proceed without the indispensable party. This avoids potential double litigation and possibly inequitable outcomes. In determining whether a party is indispensable, courts generally look to three factors:
# Will the missing party's interests be harmed in some direct way by the outcome of the case?
# Does the missing party have an interest which would cause another party to the case to be subjected to multiple obligations?
# Can the court provide complete relief to the plaintiff without the presence of the missing party?

In patent law, for example, a [[patent]] owner is an indispensable party to a [[patent infringement]] suit brought by an exclusive [[license]]e against an alleged infringer. The patent owner's rights would be directly affected by a finding of invalidity or unenforceability of the [[claim (patent)|patent claim]]s. At the same time, if the patent owner is not a party to the case, the alleged infringer could be sued separately by the patent owner, and could end up having to pay two judgments for the same act of infringement.

==Determining the feasibility of joining an indispensable party==
Once it has been determined that a missing party is indispensable, the court must determine whether it is feasible to join that party to the case. In making this determination, the court will use the same analysis that it uses to determine whether it has jurisdiction over any party. First, it must determine whether it can exercise [[personal jurisdiction]] over the party. Second, it must determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction will affect its [[subject matter jurisdiction]]. In [[Diversity (law)|diversity]] cases, which brought in federal court on the basis of all plaintiffs coming from different states as all defendants, joinder will not be deemed feasible if it destroys diversity.

Where the missing party can not be brought into the case, the court must determine whether it is possible to proceed without joining that party. If it is not possible to proceed, the case will be dismissed.

In some jurisdictions, the failure to join an indispensable party does not hinder the case. For example, the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]] does not recognize the doctrine of indispensable parties; although a defendant may argue that the plaintiff has improperly failed to join a party that would conventionally be deemed indispensable, and may seek to have the court ''attempt'' to join the missing party, if it is not feasible to join the missing party then the case will simply go on without them.

The '''Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture''' ('''IACPPT''') is an [[International human rights instruments|international human rights instrument]], created in 1985 within the Western Hemisphere [[Organization of American States]] and intended to prevent [[torture]] and other similar activities.  

The Inter-American Convention entered into force on February 28, 1987, and, as of 2013, 18 nations are party to it, with another two having signed but not yet ratified.&lt;ref&gt;OAS, [http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/Sigs/a-51.html Signatories and Ratifications]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Inter-American Convention defines torture more expansively than the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], including "the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish." The Convention is one of a series of OAS agreements that seek to protect [[human rights]], within the framework of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which bans torture in less detail. 

The Convention also requires states to take effective measures to prevent torture within their borders, and creates an ability to extradite persons accused of torture.

== Signatory States ==
Before the 24 Articles of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture are listed, the American States signatories are to state their awareness of the purpose of the convention, affirming that the convention is actually necessary, and concur that torture or cruel and inhuman treatment of any kind is inherently wrong and an act against human rights. This serves as a springboard for the rest of the convention, proving that all signatory states are in agreement about the main purpose of the Convention. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Prohibition of Torture and Ill-treatment in the Inter-American Human Rights System.|last=Rodriguez-Pinzón|first=Diego|publisher=|year=|isbn=2-88477-115-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Commission has also stated multiple times that it is a signatory state's duty to prevent incommunicado detention, and to strive to be aware and knowledgeable of what happens to its prisoners and those stripped of their liberties to ensure that they are not tortured. Failure to do so would be an infringement against the Torture Conventions Article Five which ensures that a State creates conditions that prevents an individual from undergoing torture and punishes those who initiate or instigate such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty|last=n.a.|first=|publisher=Netherlands Quarterly on Human Rights 10|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optional Protocol of 2002 ==
On December 18th of 2002, the optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was adopted and sponsored by the United Nations. An optional protocol adds to or elaborates upon the treaty it is associated with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/whatis.htm|title=What Is An Optional Protocol?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture, this protocol issued that places where people are stripped of their liberties be visited by other independent international and national bodies. This would ultimately address the countries in violation of the Convention to work toward a consensus regarding said issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-V-cAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=inter+american+convention+on+torture&amp;ots=lz41-sT5Pd&amp;sig=hz7CGvye_5xqH9SeIurg_mg1wmI#v=onepage&amp;q=inter%20american%20convention%20on%20torture&amp;f=false|title=Browlie's Document on Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== American Convention on Human Rights of 1969 ==
The Organization of American States' (O.A.S.) main convention, '''t'''he American Convention on Human Rights, has a small section within its chapters skimming over the issue of torture. The American Convention on Human Rights was adopted at the Inter-American Specialized Conference on Human Rights in Costa Rica on November 22, 1969. Within Article Five of its second chapter on civil and political rights the convention states that no person shall be tortured and that people deprived of their liberty, such as those who are imprisoned, shall not be subject to such treatment either.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/basicos/english/basic3.american%20convention.htm|title=Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|last=Organization of American States|first=|date=|website=OAS.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UN Convention to Prevent Torture Comparison ===
Like the Inter-American Convention to Prevent Torture, the UN Convention outlines that its goal is not to outlaw all torture everywhere, but to make sure that the countries under the UN follow the Articles agreed upon during the convention. The Convention'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''''s main purpose is to strengthen opposition and prohibition of torture globally through its support of allied countries and states. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The United Nations Convention Against Torture: A Handbook on the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|last=Burgers|first=J.

[[File:Photograph of Mrs. Reagan speaking at a "Just Say No" Rally in Los Angeles - NARA - 198584.jpg|thumb|upright|First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] speaking at a "Just Say No" rally in [[Los Angeles]], 1987.]] 
"'''Just Say No'''" was an [[advertising]]  campaign, part of the [[United States|U.S.]] "[[War on Drugs]]", prevalent during the 1980s and early 1990s, to discourage children from engaging in illegal [[recreational drug use]] by offering various ways of saying ''no''. The slogan was created and championed by [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] during her [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|husband's presidency]].&lt;ref name="nrc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mrs. Reagan's Crusade|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427235046/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/just_say_no.asp|archivedate=April 27, 2006|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/just_say_no.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiation==
The campaign emerged from a substance abuse prevention program supported by the [[National Institutes of Health]], pioneered in the 1970s by [[University of Houston]] Social Psychology Professor Richard I. Evans. Evans promoted a [[Inoculation theory|social inoculation model]], which included teaching student skills to resist peer pressure and other social influences. The campaign involved University projects done by students across the nation. Jordan Zimmerman, then a student at [[University of South Florida|USF]], and later an advertising entrepreneur,&lt;ref name="jzpromo"&gt;Zimmerman, Jordan (2015-01-25). Who Is Jordan Zimmerman? Blog, 25 January 2015. Retrieved from http://www.jzleadingfearlessly.com/who-is-jordan-zimmerman/.&lt;/ref&gt; won the campaign. The anti-drug movement was among the resistance skills recommended in response to low [[peer pressure]], and Nancy Reagan's larger campaign proved to be a useful dissemination of this social inoculation strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, R.I. (in press). Just say no. In Breslow, L., Encyclopedia of Public Health (p. 1354). New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Reagan first became involved during a campaign trip in 1980 to [[Daytop]] Village, [[New York (state)|New York]]. She recalls feeling impressed by a need to educate the youth about drugs and drug abuse.&lt;ref name="nrc"/&gt; Upon her husband's election to the presidency, she returned to Daytop Village and outlined how she wished to help educate the youth.&lt;ref name="nrc"/&gt; She stated in 1981 that her best role would be to bring awareness about the dangers of drug abuse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Understanding what drugs can do to your children, understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is ... the first step in solving the problem.&lt;ref name="nrc"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Address to the Nation on Drug Abuse Campaign, September 14, 1986.webm|thumb|right|200px|Address to the Nation on Drug Abuse Campaign, September 14, 1986]]
The "Just Say No" slogan was the creation of Robert Cox and David Cantor, advertising executives at the New York office of Needham, Harper &amp; Steers/USA in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/business/media/robert-cox-man-behind-the-just-say-no-antidrug-campaign-dies-at-78.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the phrase "Just Say No" first emerged when Nancy Reagan was visiting Longfellow Elementary School in Oakland, California.&lt;ref&gt;Loizeau, Pierre-Marie. ''Nancy Reagan: The Woman Behind the Man'' (1984). Nova Publishers, pp. 104-105. {{ISBN|978-1-59033-759-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by a schoolgirl what to do if she was offered drugs, the First Lady responded: "Just say no."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1989/010489a.htm|title=Remarks at the Nancy Reagan Drug Abuse Center Benefit Dinner in Los Angeles, California|accessdate=2007-10-03|publisher=Ronald Reagan Foundation|date=January 4, 1989|quote= ... in Oakland where a schoolchild in an audience Nancy was addressing stood up and asked what she and her friends should say when someone offered them drugs. And Nancy said, "Just say no." And within a few months thousands of Just Say No clubs had sprung up in schools around the country.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just Say No club organizations within schools and school-run anti-drug programs soon became common, in which young people were making pacts not to experiment with drugs.&lt;ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan"/&gt;

When asked about her efforts in the campaign, Nancy Reagan said: "If you can save just one child, it's worth it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=May 2005|title=Tribute to Nancy Reagan|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZM0ioS1g58|medium= Motion picture|publisher=Motion Picture Association, Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|accessdate=2008-11-07|time=3:08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled throughout the United States and several other nations, totaling over {{convert|250000|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=41|title=First Lady Biography: Nancy Reagan|accessdate=2008-11-09|publisher=National First Ladies Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Reagan visited [[drug rehabilitation]] centers and abuse prevention programs; with the media attention that the first lady receives, she appeared on television talk shows, recorded public service announcements, and wrote guest articles.&lt;ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan"/&gt; By the autumn of 1985, she had appeared on 23 talk shows, co-hosted an October 1983 episode of ''[[Good Morning America]]'',&lt;ref name=pressoffice&gt;[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/textual/smof/flpress.htm First Lady, Press Office: Records, 1981-1989]. [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] Collections.&lt;/ref&gt; and starred in a two-hour [[PBS]] documentary on drug abuse.&lt;ref name="jb62"&gt;Benze, James G. (2005), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign and the phrase "Just Say No" made their way into popular American culture when TV shows like ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' and ''[[Punky Brewster]]'' produced episodes centered on the campaign. In 1983, Nancy Reagan appeared as herself in the television programs ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' and ''Diff'rent Strokes'' to garner support for the anti-drug campaign.&lt;ref name="Dynasty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0560083/|title='Diff'rent Strokes': The Reporter (1983)|accessdate=2007-10-18|publisher=The Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in a 1985 rock music video "[[Stop the Madness]]" as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Brian L. Dyak (Executive Producer), William N. Utz (Executive Producer)|date=December 11, 1985|title=Stop the Madness|medium=Music Video|publisher=E.I.C.|location=Hollywood, California and The White House, Washington, D.C.|accessdate=2007-11-19|time=3:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Toya Jackson]] became spokesperson for the campaign in 1987 and recorded a song titled "Just Say No" with British hit producers [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock/Aitken/Waterman]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 1985, Nancy Reagan expanded the campaign internationally. She invited the [[First Lady|First Ladies]] of thirty various nations to the White House in Washington, D.C. for a conference entitled the "First Ladies Conference on Drug Abuse".&lt;ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan"/&gt; She later became the first First Lady invited to address the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations]].&lt;ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan"/&gt;

She enlisted the help of the [[Girl Scouts of the United States of America]], Kiwanis Club International, and the National Federation of Parents for a Drug-Free Youth to promote the cause;&lt;ref name="jb62"/&gt; the Kiwanis put up over 2000 billboards with Nancy Reagan's likeness and the slogan.&lt;ref name="jb62"/&gt; Over 5000 Just Say No clubs were founded in schools and youth organizations in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref name="jb62"/&gt; Many clubs and organizations remain in operation around the country, where they aim to educate children and teenagers about the effects of drugs.&lt;ref name="nrc"/&gt;

Just Say No crossed over to the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1980s, where it was popularized by the [[BBC]]'s 1986 "Drugwatch" campaign, which revolved around a [[heroin]]-[[Substance dependence|addiction]] storyline in the popular children's TV drama serial ''[[Grange Hill (TV series)|Grange Hill]]''. The cast's cover of the original U.S. campaign song, with an added rap, reached the UK top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malvern|first=Jack|title=Just say no|work=The Daily Summit|publisher=British Council|date=December 12, 2003|url=http://www.dailysummit.net/english/archives/2003/12/12/just_say_no.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Wood (born 1980)|The death of Anna Wood]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] teen [[Leah Betts]] from [[Essex]] in the mid-1990s sparked a media firestorm across both the UK and Australia over the use of illegal drugs. Wood's parents even released her school photograph on a badge with the saying "Just say no to drugs" placed on it to warn society on the dangers of illicit drug use. The photograph was widely circulated in the media. A photo of Betts in a coma in her hospital bed was also circulated in British media. Both teenagers died due to [[water intoxication]] as they drank too much water after ingesting [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Effects==
[[File:Just Say No.jpg|thumb|"Just Say No" memorabilia at the Reagan Library (2008 photo).]]
Nancy Reagan's related efforts increased public awareness of drug use, but a direct relationship between reduced drug use and the Just Say No campaign cannot be established. Although the use and abuse of illegal recreational drugs significantly declined during the Reagan presidency,&lt;ref name="jb63"&gt;Benze, James G. (2005), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/HSYouthtrends.html|title=NIDA InfoFacts: High School and Youth Trends|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIH|accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbsdrugs"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/kleber.html|title=Interview: Dr. Herbert Kleber|accessdate=2007-06-12|publisher=PBS|quote=The politics of the Reagan years and the Bush years probably made it somewhat harder to get treatment expanded, but at the same time, it may have decreased initiation and use. For example, marijuana went from thirty-three percent of high-school seniors in 1980 to twelve percent in 1991.}}&lt;/ref&gt; this may be a [[spurious correlation]]: a 2009 analysis of 20 [[controlled studies]] on enrollment in one of the most popular "Just Say No" programs, [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]], showed no effect on drug use.&lt;ref name=SciAm14&gt;Scott O. Lilienfeld and Hal Arkowitz, [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-just-say-no-doesnt-work/ Why "Just Say No" Doesn't Work], ''Scientific American'' (January 1, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign did draw some criticism. Nancy Reagan's approach to promoting drug awareness was labeled simplistic by critics who argued that the solution was reduced to a catch phrase.&lt;ref name="NR American"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande03.html|author=Wolf, Julie|title=The American Experience: Nancy Reagan|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, two studies suggested that enrollees in DARE-like programs were actually ''more'' likely to use alcohol and cigarettes.&lt;ref name=SciAm14/&gt;  Critics have also suggested that inflamed fears from "Just Say No" exacerbated [[mass incarceration]] and prevented youth from receiving accurate information about dealing with drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McGrath,
 [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/08/nancy-reagan-drugs-just-say-no-dare-program-opioid-epidemic Nancy Reagan and the negative impact of the 'Just Say No' anti-drug campaign], ''The Guardian'' (8 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also think that "Just Say No" contributed towards the well seasoned stigma about people who use drugs being labelled as "bad", and the stigma toward those people who are addicted to drugs being labelled as making a cognizant amoral choice to engage in drug use.

The '''Legal Practice Course''' ('''LPC'''){{spaced ndash}}also known as the '''Postgraduate Diploma in Legal Practice'''{{spaced ndash}}is the final vocational stage for becoming a [[solicitor]] in [[England and Wales]].  The course is designed to provide a bridge between academic study and training in a [[law firm]]. It is a one-year, full-time (or two-year, part-time) course, and tuition fees range from £8,000-£16,200 a year. A small proportion of students may have their fees and some living expenses paid for by future employers under a [[training contract]].

The course is usually taken after a law degree, but a large minority take the course after studying a different subject at university and taking a conversion course called the [[Common Professional Examination|Graduate Diploma in Law]] (GDL/CPE). The LPC is regulated through the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] and replaced the [[Law Society’s Final Examination]] (LSF) in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-transforming-knowledge-into-knowhow-the-law-societys-finals-are-to-be-replaced-with-a-oneyear-training-scheme-that-will-emphasize-practical-skills-writes-sharon-wallach-1541673.html The Independent Newspaper, 21 August 1992] Retrieved on 12 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Graduate Diploma in Law|GDL]]/[[Common Professional Examination|CPE]], the LPC can be applied to through the [[Central Applications Board]].

The LPC is also offered to LLB graduates at some [[Australian universities]], as an alternative to an [[articled clerk]]ship.

In Scotland, the equivalent is the [[Diploma in Professional Legal Practice]].

== Course content ==

The course content can be broadly classified into three phases of learning.  These are (a) "Core" compulsory modules, (b) "Elective" modules and (c) practical skills. Skills comprise [[advocacy]], [[interviewing]] and [[Legal advice|advising]], [[writing]], [[wikt:draft|drafting]] and [[research]], solicitors' accounts, [[wills]] and [[Administrative law|administration]] and [[Tax law|taxation]].

Generally taught in the first (and longest) part of the course, the compulsory modules are generally [[Criminal law|Criminal Litigation]], [[Business Law]] and Practice, [[Property Law]] and Practice, and [[Civil litigation]]. In the shorter second part of the course, students select their "Elective" modules from a list chosen by the providing institution.

Topics vary from institution to institution, but those widely available include advanced courses in the compulsory modules, along with: [[personal injury]], [[family law]], [[employment law]], [[housing law]], [[immigration law]], [[probate]] and private client, [[commercial law]], [[welfare law]] and commercial [[property law]]. Some topics recur throughout the teaching of all course topics and can come up in all examinations. These include: professional conduct, restricted activities under the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], [[Business account|business accounts]] and taxation.

== Eligibility and length ==

Different institutions require different grades before accepting candidates onto their course. Institutions will often interview students with third class degrees before accepting them while only some will interview before accepting a candidate with a lower second.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The course generally lasts nine months and has substantially less holiday than an undergraduate course. Emphasis is placed on class room teaching alongside independent study.
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}

== Prestige of different institutions ==

LPC providers are rigorously inspected by the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]], commonly referred to as the SRA with the intention of maintaining high standards throughout the sector. Some providers are notably more expensive than others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://l2b.thelawyer.com/3026504.article#/|title=Lawyer 2B Law School Comparison Tool - Lawyer 2B|author=|date=|website=l2b.thelawyer.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will often be able to spend more money on both staff and facilities.

== Pass rates ==

In 2005, a total of 6,554 people passed the LPC, an overall rate of 84%, representing a 3% rise from the previous year.  It is possible to sit all LPC exams three times before failing the course. It is necessary to pass all subjects.

9,337 students enrolled on the LPC in 2008/09. Quite a few deferred their exams or dropped out altogether, leaving 7,759 to take the exam; 5,824 of those passed the exams that year (75% of those who entered), just over the number of training contracts on offer (5,809).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-art-of-law.co.uk/?cat=15 The Job Market: Solicitors &amp;#124; The Art of Law]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that training contracts with big firms tend to start recruitment 2 years in advance i.e. 2 years before completion of the LPC.

== Funding ==

The Law Society has a bursary scheme, this is available for some candidates who have already taken the LPC. Upon securing and commencing a training contract the recipient individual gets their fees paid through Law Society funds.

It is not uncommon for law firms to provide sponsorship to LPC students&lt;ref&gt;[http://targetjobs.co.uk/career-sectors/law-solicitors/305519-which-law-firms-will-fund-your-lpc-and-gdl-course-fees-and-pay-maintenance-costs LPC Sponsorship] Retrieved on 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a job offer. Generally sponsorship is only offered by wealthy commercial practices, although a limited number of legal aid sponsorship packages (funded by the [[Law Society of England and Wales]]) do exist.

Banks do offer preferential bank loans to post-graduate students in employment. This is an expensive option with loans of up to £25,000 being available. Alternatively, information on professional career development loans run by the National Careers Service&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/career-development-loans/overview Professional Career Development loan on gov.uk] Retrieved on 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; can be found on the [https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/courses/funding/Pages/loans.aspx National Careers Service website],&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/courses/funding/Pages/loans.aspx Professional Career Development loan on National Career Development Loan] Retrieved on 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; or in Job Centres.

== Negative criticism ==

* '''Relevancy''': The LPC has been criticised by some professionals as being too broad. All students have to take the compulsory subjects detailed above; regardless of whether they want a 'high street' career, or a 'commercial' one. The broad basis of the course could be seen as bringing increased [[legal awareness]] to future professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spr-consilio.com/artlpc1.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411234053/http://www.spr-consilio.com/artlpc1.html |date=11 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Redundant Components''': Certain components, such as the Interviewing and Advising skill assessment, have been criticised as being redundant. The Interviewing and Advising skill assessment creates a highly artificial scenario in which a trainee solicitor interviews a client and then proceeds to render impromptu legal advice. This is highly unlikely to occur in practice, if at all, but remains a compulsory component of the course due to antiquated SRA requirements.
* '''Length''': The process of becoming a solicitor has been described as, 'lengthy, demanding and academically difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.he.courses-careers.com/law.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822043510/http://www.he.courses-careers.com/law.htm |date=22 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LPC adds an extra year (or 7 months, if one is on an "Accelerated" course) onto the process of qualifying.
* '''Commercial bias''': A further controversy surrounds the fact that commercial legal practices are far more likely to be able to provide financial sponsorship for the LPC, this means that students from disadvantaged backgrounds have a strong financial incentive not to go into [[legal aid]] work such as crime, family and civil liberties - as legal aid firms cannot afford to sponsor the LPC. Commentators such as Clare Dyer (journalist at ''[[The Guardian]]'') have spoken of a legal aid 'crisis' in regard to trainees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brennancenter.org/programs/lse/pages/view_elerts.php?elert_id=&amp;s_date=&amp;e_date=&amp;category_id=28&amp;end_date=&amp;page=4&amp;search_text= Oops, Looks like we found a bad link &amp;#124; Brennan Center for Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216095010/http://www.brennancenter.org/programs/lse/pages/view_elerts.php?elert_id=&amp;s_date=&amp;e_date=&amp;category_id=28&amp;end_date=&amp;page=4&amp;search_text= |date=16 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Elective element''': The elective element of the LPC has been criticised as 'unnecessary' - as it lengthens the course and burdens students with extra costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927141038/http://www.citysolicitors.org.uk/_word/trnqualsol.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=27 September 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elective element is the part of the course that allows students to specialise in line with their future career.
* '''Number of places''': There have been criticisms that the number of places offered each year by LPC Providers massively outstrips the number of vacancies for training contracts (According to the latest Law Society Annual Statistical report there were 5,411 new training contracts registered and just over 8,000 students sitting the LPC). Taking the LPC results for many students in massive debt and no return on investment whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/199|title=Newsletter - Chambers Student Guide|author=|date=|website=Chambers Student|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.younglegalaidlawyers.org/file/Releases_ResponsesYLALResponsetoLSConsultationonMinimumSalary-170107.pdf Young Legal Aid Lawyers] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4127">The '''Li–Lobanov Treaty''' or the '''Sino-Russian Secret Treaty''' ({{zh|中俄密约}} {{lang-ru| Союзный договор между Российской империей и Китаем }}) was a [[secret treaty|secret]] and [[unequal treaty|unequal]] treaty signed on June 3, 1896 in [[Moscow]] by foreign minister [[Alexey Lobanov-Rostovsky]] on behalf of the [[Russian Empire]] and viceroy [[Li Hongzhang]] on behalf of [[Qing China]]. The contents of the agreement were made public only in 1922.

==Background==
Following the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] ending the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Triple Intervention]], China was forced to pay a large [[indemnity]] to the [[Empire of Japan]]. In order to raise the funds for this payment, China approached [[France]] and Russia for loans. Taking advantage of this situation, Russian finance minister [[Sergei Witte]] established the [[Russo-Chinese Bank]], which was controlled by the Russian government, and agreed to facilitate the loans.&lt;ref name= Kowner&gt;{{cite book | last = Kowner| first =  Rotem|authorlink=Rotem Kowner| coauthors =  | year = 2006 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War| publisher = The Scarecrow Press | location = {{ISBN|0-8108-4927-5}} | pages = 209–210}}

Kowner, '' Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War'', p. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Meeting with Li Hongzhang in Moscow during the coronation ceremonies for [[Tsar Nicholas II]], Witte promised to maintain Chinese territorial integrity and suggested a secret military alliance against possible future aggression by the [[Empire of Japan]]. In exchange, Russia would be allowed to use Chinese ports for its warships, and to build a [[Russian gauge]] railway through [[Heilongjiang]] and [[Jilin]] to [[Vladivostok]] on the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of the Russo-Japanese War|first=Ian|last=Nish|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the railway concession, Russian personnel and police received [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial jurisdiction]] over large portions of [[Northeast China]] and the permission to station troops to protect the railway.&lt;ref name= Kowner /&gt; China was also not allowed to interfere with Russian troop movements or munitions and also had to grant Russia decreased tariff rates.
To avoid diplomatic issues with the other [[major powers]], Li insisted that the concession be granted to the Russo-Chinese Bank, rather than directly to the Russian government,&lt;ref name= Kowner /&gt; making the railway nominally a joint project, although it was in reality completely financed and controlled by Russia.

==Consequences==
The terms of the treaty were tantamount to the annexation of northeast China by Russia in all but name.&lt;ref name= Kowner /&gt; Rather than protecting China from Japanese territorial ambitions, the treaty opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of the [[Convention for the Lease of the Liaotung Peninsula|Russia–Qing Convention of 1898]], in which China was forced to lease the southern tip of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] to Russia and allow [[South Manchurian Railway|a southern extension]] of Russia's [[China Eastern Railway]] to be built from northern [[Harbin]] to the port city of [[Dalian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Industrialization of Japan and Manchukuo, 1930-1940|volume=8|first=Elizabeth Boody|last=Schumpeter|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1940|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These events increased anti-foreign sentiment in China, which came to a head in the [[Boxer Uprising]] of 1900.

A '''mechanic's [[lien]]''' is a [[security interest]] in the [[Title (property)|title]] to [[property]] for the benefit of those who have supplied labor or materials that improve the property. The lien exists for both [[real property]] and [[personal property]].  In the realm of [[real property]], it is called by various names, including, generically, '''construction lien'''.  It is also called a '''materialman's lien''' or '''supplier's lien''' when referring to those supplying materials, a '''laborer's lien''' when referring to those supplying labor, and a '''design professional's lien''' when referring to architects or designers who contribute to a work of improvement.  In the realm of [[personal property]], it is also called an '''artisan's lien'''.  The term "lien" comes from a French root, with a meaning similar to [[wiktionary:link|link]]; it is related to "liaison".  Mechanic's liens on property in the United States date from the 18th century.

==History and reasons for existence==

Mechanic's liens in their modern form were first conceived by [[Thomas Jefferson]], to encourage construction in the new [[Capital districts and territories#United States|capital city]] of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. They were established by the [[Maryland General Assembly]], of which the city of Washington was then a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYUaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=jefferson+%22mechanic's+lien%22+washington#v=onepage&amp;q=jefferson%20%22mechanic's%20lien%22%20washington&amp;f=false|title=The Mechanic's Lien Law of Illinois: A Lawyer's Brief on the Topic|page=6|author=Chas. E. Davidson|publisher=The Greenville Illinois Bar|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not likely that Jefferson single-handedly dreamed up the idea.

At the time Jefferson promoted the law, a lien-like privilege already existed in civil law countries like France, the Dutch Republic and Spain, with some laws even tracing their roots to the Roman Empire. And since control of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] had passed between the French and Spaniards, and had largely adopted the French [[Napoleonic Code]], there was a similar privilege concept in that territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Samual%20L.%20Phillips%201883%20Mechanic%20Lien%20Book&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Treatise on the Law of Mechanics' Liens on Real and Personal Property|pages=10–11|author=Samual L. Phillips|publisher=Boston: Little, Brown and Company|year=1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems highly likely that the legislators working on the first U.S. Mechanic Lien laws had knowledge of, and referenced these civil law concepts. Nevertheless, the United States version was original, as it gave builders a more robust right into the land itself (versus just the improvement’s value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://constructionlienblog.com/2010/11/a-short-history-of-the-mechanic-lien/|title=A Short History of the Mechanic's Lien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to real property, mechanic's liens are purely statutory devices that exist in every state (although in [[California]], as noted below, they have a constitutional foundation). The reason they exist is a legislative [[public policy]] to protect [[General contractor|contractors]]. More specifically, the state legislatures have determined that, due to the economics of the construction business, contractors and subcontractors need greater remedy for non-payment for their work than merely the right to sue on their contracts. In particular, without the mechanics' lien, subcontractors providing either labor or materials may have no effective remedy if their general contractor is not sufficiently financially responsible, because their only contractual right is with that general contractor.

Without the mechanic's lien, the contractor would have a limited number of options to enforce payment of the amounts owed. Further, there is usually a long list of claimants on any failed project. To avoid the specter of various trades, materialmen and suppliers attempting to remove the improvements they have made, and to maintain a degree of equality between the various lienors on a project, the statutory lien scheme was created. Without it, Tradesperson A may try to "race" Supplier B to the courthouse, the project site or the construction lender to obtain payment. Most lien statutes instead mandate strict compliance with the formalized process they create in return for the timely resolution and balancing of claims between all parties involved - both owners and lien claimants.

In the state of California, mechanic's liens are a ''constitutional'' right guaranteed to contractors by the [[California Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[California Constitution]], [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_14 Article XIV, Section 3].&lt;/ref&gt; This right has been implemented in detail by statutes enacted by the [[California State Legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;''Solit v. Tokai Bank'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/68CA4t1435.htm 68 Cal. App. 4th 1435] (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Texas]], the [[Texas Constitution]] gives builders the right to lien and sub contractors are given the right under Chapter 53 of the Texas State Property Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PR/htm/PR.53.htm Chapter 53 of the Texas State Property code].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicular definition of a lien sale==
A lien against a vehicle that is asserted by an auto mechanic is technically an "artisan's lien" rather than a "mechanic's lien", but it operates in a similar fashion to a mechanic's lien.  A mechanic's lien can only arise against real property i.e., land or buildings.
If a person (licensed repair facility) has repaired, furnished supplies or materials, towed or stored a vehicle and has not been paid for the services rendered, that person has a lien against the vehicle. The lien arises at the time the registered owner is presented with a written statement of charges for completed work or services. Although if services were performed that were not agreed upon and no written and signed estimate was issued beforehand, a mechanic has no right to keep the title owner from reclaiming the vehicle. If a mechanic asserts a fee that is not reasonably related to the work performed, and refuses to return the vehicle until that price is paid, the owner of the vehicle will be able to recoup a storage fee from the mechanic, as the mechanic is in the wrong for refusing to return the vehicle. In doing so the mechanic would commit the crime of [[Criminal conversion|conversion]], or [[embezzlement]].

On the other hand, the mechanic can assess certain expenditures from the owner that are related to the work performed.  These expenditures are normally, towing, storage fees, and the cost of filing the lien.

If the vehicle is towed by a public agency or private towing company, the lien arises when the vehicle is towed or transported. The lien may be satisfied by selling the vehicle through the lien sale process.

To conduct a lien sale, the person/lienholder must have possession of the vehicle and may require lien sale authorization from the State's [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], depending on the State and or value of the vehicle. Interested parties, including the registered and legal owners of record will be notified, by Registered Mail, before the sale occurs.

==Creation==

Mechanic's liens exist to secure payment for services, labor and material on both personal and real property.  However, the creation and enforcement mechanisms differ depending on whether real or personal property is involved.  The law of mechanic's liens on real property governs the creation and enforcement of these liens on items of personal property that have been attached to real property in such a way as to be a [[Fixture (property law)|fixture]].

==Creation and enforcement – personal property==

The English [[common law]] recognized mechanic's liens respecting only personal property.  The lien was created by [[operation of law]] by the fact of the artisan working on the personal property item or attaching additional material to it. However, to maintain the lien, the artisan had to retain possession of the article until he or she was paid. If the property were returned to the owner before that time, the lien was lost.  The lien was enforced by a "[[Self-help (law)|self-help]]" sale of the property and applying the sale proceeds to payment of the amount owed for the workmanship.  The sales were non-judicial, i.e., they were held in the same way as a sale of property pawned for a debt.

In America, 34 states now appear to have statutes providing for mechanic's liens on personal property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Automotive Service Association| title = Mechanic Lien Laws| work = Taking the Hill| accessdate = 2018-05-22| date = April 2, 2004
| url = https://takingthehill.com/reports/mechanic-lien-laws/}} [https://takingthehill.com/wp-content/uploads/lien.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; These statutes tend to modify the common law rules. For example, in [[Virginia]], a mechanic's lien can only be enforced up to the amount of $625, and if the property is valued at over $5,000, it must be sold at a [[sheriff's auction]] ordered by the court of appropriate jurisdiction.

==Creation, perfection, priority and enforcement – real property==

Mechanic's liens on the title to real property are exclusively the result of [[legislation]].  Each state has its own laws regarding the creation and enforcement of these liens, but, overall, there are some similar elements among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.keglerbrown.com/content/uploads/2018/03/FASA-Lien-Bond-Claims-in-the-50-States-2018.pdf |title=Lien and Bond Claims in the 50 States: 2018|website=Kegler Brown|publisher=Foundation of the American Subcontractors Association, Inc.|accessdate=May 21, 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many States distinguish between the types of real property upon which a mechanics lien can be filed.

Under the principle of [[sovereign immunity]], real property of the government (public property) is ordinarily not subject to the claims of private parties. Therefore, unless the state specifically so provides, mechanic's liens do not attach to the title owned by the state or its administrative subdivisions, such as cities.  Similarly, mechanic's liens under state law are invalid on federal construction projects.  To protect subcontractors and suppliers working on federal projects where the contract price exceeds $100,000.00 the [[Miller Act]] requires general contractors to provide a [[payment bond]] which guarantees payment for work done in accordance with the terms of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/payment-bond.html|title=Payment Bond Definition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sio.org/html/why_bonds_reqd.html|title=Why Bid, Performance &amp; Payment Bonds Are Required For Public Construction Projects|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020504234233/http://www.sio.org/html/why_bonds_reqd.html|archivedate=2002-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many state and municipal governments similarly require contractors on public works projects to be bonded under so-called "[[Little Miller Act]]s." Theoretically, the payment bond under the Miller Act or Little Miller Act stands in place of the government's property, and qualified claimants make claims against that bond similar to how they would file an ordinary mechanic's lien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://constructionlienblog.com/2012/02/how-lien-and-bond-claims-against-state-projects-work/|title=How Lien and Bond Claims Against State Projects Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states, the legislature has created extra procedures in order for a mechanics lien to be placed on residential property. In New Jersey, which enacted the strictest of these regulations, a mechanics lien can only be placed on residential property after a Notice of Unpaid Balance and Right to File Lien has been filed within 60 days of the lienor's last date of work and an arbitration award has been issued by an American Arbitration Association arbitrator permitting a mechanics lien to be filed.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2010/Bills/A0500/410_R1.PDF New Jersey Construction Lien Law Revisions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The act itself of filing a mechanics lien can be difficult. Most States simply require the filing of the mechanics lien with a county or court clerk within a defined amount of time from a triggering event.  However, Maryland requires an application to the Court in order to file a mechanics liens. In Maryland, corporations must hire an attorney to make an application to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maryland Mechanics Lien Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://lienitnow.com/maryland-faq.asp|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and perfection===

Under the statutes, the lien is usually created by the performance of labor or the supplying of material that improves the property. Just what type of contribution counts as a valid basis for a mechanics lien varies, depending on the particular state statute that applies.  Some common examples are:
* [[laborer]]s, [[carpenter]]s, [[electrician]]s, mechanical/HVAC contractors and [[plumber]]s working on the project site;
* [[lumber yard]]s, plumbing supply houses and electrical suppliers;
* [[architect]]s and [[civil engineer]]s who drew up the construction plans and specifications; and
* offsite fabricators of specialty items that are ultimately incorporated into the project.

Often, there is no simple dividing line that is useful in every state, or even in every case, for determining this eligibility.  Deciding whether a party has a legitimate lien right may depend on examining court cases that have either upheld or rejected lien claims in the same state.

Unlike other security interests, in most states, mechanic's liens are given to contractors and material suppliers who may or may not have a direct contractual agreement with the owner of the land.  In fact, this is often the norm because in most cases, the owner of the land contracts only with a general contractor (often called a "prime contractor").  The general contractor, in turn, hires subcontractors ("subs") and material suppliers ("suppliers") to perform the work.  These subs and suppliers are entitled to liens on the owner's property to secure their payment from the general contractor.

However, to have an enforceable lien, it usually must be "[[perfection (law)|perfected]]."  This means that the holder of the lien must comply with the statutory requirements for maintaining and enforcing the lien.  These requirements, which contain time limits, are generally as follows:
*Providing the required [[Preliminary Notice|preliminary notice]] to the property owner disclosing the entitlement to the lien (some states).
*Filing notices of commencement of work (some states).
*Filing notices in the required public records offices of the intention to file a lien if unpaid (some states).
*Filing the notice or claim of lien in the required public records offices within a specified period of time after the materials have been supplied or the work completed (all states).  The law varies from state-to-state on both the triggering event and the timing of this.  Some states require the filing within a period measured from the time when the claimant completes its work, while others specify the event as being after all work on the project has been completed. The filing time periods after the triggering event vary.

Because of the difficulty often associated with the filing of mechanics liens and compliance with mechanics lien laws, many lienors use attorneys or mechanics lien filing services to ensure that their mechanics lien is filed correctly.

===Priority respecting other interests===

The statutes creating mechanic's liens usually give them a higher priority with respect to other interests in the title than the law gives most real property security interests.  Among other things, priority is the attribute that determines which of several competing security claims will have the first claim to the funds of a [[foreclosure sale]].  In this context, the priority of a mechanic's lien is determined either by the time the lien attaches to the title to the property or by the point in time to which it "relates back."  With some exceptions, the lien attaches or relates back to a time prior to the time that any notice of it appears in the public records. In many states, this is specified as the time when the first visible construction commences on the building site.  In others, it is when the contract is executed for the work to be done.  In still others, each contractor or supplier's lien attaches at the time when it commences its own work.  Therefore, persons dealing with the owner of the title to the property risk having their interests unexpectedly subject to mechanic's liens of which they had no knowledge.

Special provisions are made in some states for determining the priority between a mechanic's lien and the lien of a mortgage that is financing the construction on the land.  For instance, in the State of [[New York (state)|New York]], the appearance of specified language in the mortgage to the effect that it is a [[construction loan]] preserves its priority over mechanic's liens arising out of the construction, as long as subsequently filed lien claims that are legitimate are not ignored.  In other states, such as [[Florida]], it is an all or nothing proposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelienzone.com/not-everyone-can-do-it-preparing-and-signing-a-claim-of-lien/ Article: Not Everyone Can Do It: Preparing and Signing a Claim of Lien]&lt;/ref&gt;  There, the recording of the construction mortgage before the filing of a statutory notice of commencement of construction provides the mortgage with absolute priority over mechanic's liens arising out of the construction.  Still other states, such as [[California]], provide priority for a construction loan mortgage recorded before the visible commencement of construction where the lender is obligated to disburse the funds.  In the State of [[Illinois]], there is a statutory funds disbursing scheme that, if followed, provides construction loan mortgage priority.  In other states, there are still other arrangements and some states, such as [[Colorado]], provide almost no practical means for a construction loan mortgage to obtain priority at all.

===Enforcement===

Mechanic's liens are enforced exclusively through judicial foreclosure sales, i.e., through court proceedings similar to mortgage foreclosures. The court must determine whether the requirements of the statute have been met and, if so, the priority of the mechanic's lien being foreclosed relative to the other liens or encumbrances on the title.  Once that is determined, the court will order the property sold and the proceeds of the sale applied to the liens in the order of their priority.

===Limitations===
States may have various limitations on mechanic's liens. In California Law a contractor must wait to take advantage of the lien rights until any of the following conditions occur; otherwise the lien will be considered premature:
:a) The work is completed according to the contracted scope of work, 
:b) the project has stopped (cessation), or 
:c) the person is prevented from finishing the work (terminated).
Each of these required events occur at the end of the project life-cycle (or at the end of the scope of work for the subcontractor, the project may be far from completed). The end of the project may not be remotely close to the actual time when the work was performed (and the time at which labor and materials were paid out of pocket for the work by the contractor).

Also, the work must go directly toward the work of improvement of the property. This may seem obvious, but there are numerous construction costs that are not subject to mechanics' liens.  A portion of construction costs may not qualify for a mechanic's lien because the work did not improve the property.  A good example are items that are not intended to be permanent, but nevertheless, necessary in the course of construction. A temporary construction fence may be required, may serve a valuable function in safety and security, but is never expected to become part of the realty, so therefore is not a cost that is permitted under a mechanic's lien.

The attractive nature of the mechanic's lien is that the lien is secured by real property and the property can be sold in order to pay the lien. This is powerful tool, but not always efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.construction-laws.com/art.ml.pwrfl.not.eff.3.10.08.html Mechanics’ liens — powerful, but not always efficient] Mechanics’ liens — powerful, but not always efficient&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, this is a drawn out process that is not very efficient. However, given the economic conditions, and that lenders' usually have priority, the sale of the property may not be sufficient to pay for the value of the lien.

What is often overlooked is that the contractor is now financing the project when they perform work and do not receive prompt payment for that work. The contractor is now tying up valuable capital that could be used elsewhere while waiting for the end of a project. In addition, the contractor must bear the cost of litigation in order to enforce their mechanic's lien rights. For disputes of a minor value, a mechanic's lien is not going to be a cost-effective method of obtaining payment for services.

===Releases of Lien===
A ''lien release'', also known as a ''release of lien'' or a ''cancellation of lien'', is a document that may be voluntarily provided by a lien claimant, such as a subcontractor, in exchange for payment or a promise of payment from a general contractor or a property owner. Negotiations may be tricky, as lien claimants generally want to be paid before they release a lien, while the owner of the property subject to the lien will generally want the lien released before they make payment. Unlike a lien waiver that negates the right to file a lien in the future, a lien release cancels a lien that has already in effect.

Prior to making any payment, the property owner should request a release of lien from every supplier, contractor and subcontractor, which covers the materials used and the work performed on the project.  A release of lien is a written statement that releases the property from the threat of lien. If the contract requires partial payments be made before the work is completed in full, then the property owner may request a partial release of lien covering all labor and materials used up to the time of payment.

Before final payment, a property owner should obtain an affidavit from the contractor that lists all unpaid parties who performed labor or services, or provided materials to the property. The property owner should make sure the contractor obtains releases from all of these parties before making final payment.

==Protection from liens==
{{advice|section|date=December 2016}}
Often a mechanic’s lien is discovered long after it has been filed in the public records, but by taking a few proactive measures, property owners can ensure their properties are protected from the burdens imposed by such mechanic’s liens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federaltitle.com/blog/how-to-avoid-settlement-delays-due-to-a-mechanics-lien Article: How to avoid settlement delays due to a mechanic's lien]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notice of commencement===
File a Notice of Commencement before beginning any home construction or remodeling project. Record the form with the Clerk of the Circuit Court in the county where the property being improved is located. Post a certified copy at the job site, too. The Notice notes the property owner’s intent to begin improvements, the location of the property, description of the work and the amount of bond (if any). It also identifies the property owner, contractor, surety, lender and other pertinent information.

A property owner who fails to record a Notice of Commencement or incorrect information on the Notice could result in having to pay twice for the same work or materials. Request a list of all subcontractors and suppliers who have a contract with the contractor to provide services or materials to the property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelienzone.com/file-construction-claim-lien-florida-notice-owner-recording-video Article: How to File a Construction Claim of Lien in Florida – From Notice to Owner to Recording]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the project and after the contractor is paid in full and obtained all of the necessary Releases of Lien and affidavits as described above are obtained, file a Notice of Termination of Notice of Commencement with the Clerk of the Circuit Court in the county where the property being improved is located.

===Challenging a lien===
States typically have a process by which the land owner may challenge the claimant's [[prima facie]] entitlement to the liens on grounds such as proper identification of the property, compliance with notice requirements, and timing.  If the lien claim survives those challenges, the owner may "bond off" the lien by filing a [[surety bond]] with the court in which the lien action has been initiated.  This, in effect, frees the property from the lien and allows for sale of the property.  The ability to bond off the lien is especially crucial where developers desire to proceed with the sale of newly built homes, which would otherwise remain unsold and unoccupied during the lien litigation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.findlaw.com/1996/Nov/1/128555.html

==Outside the United States==

Countries that recognize mechanic's liens often provide for very different rights and procedures than those of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pierson|first=George J.|author2=Zicherman, Michael S.|title=Mechanics’ Liens — An International Perspective|pages=|work=Construction Update|date=August 2005|url=http://www.lorman.com/newsletter/article.php?article_id=180&amp;newsletter_id=35&amp;category_id=3|publisher=Lorman Education Services|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some provinces of Canada (including [[Quebec]]) and [[New Zealand]] recognize a process somewhat analogous to a mechanic's lien.  The Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] allows for liens similar to those of the United States.

With the exception of Mexico, mechanic's liens are generally not recognized throughout Latin America. 
 
Some countries, such as the [[United Arab Emirates]], specifically prohibit the lien, except where voluntarily undertaken.

The '''ministerial exception''' is a [[legal doctrine]] in the [[United States]] intended to protect the [[freedom of religion]] by exempting religious institutions from anti-discrimination laws in hiring employees.  
The exception bars the application of civil rights laws to churches' employment relationships with [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] as the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] protects a "church's right to decide matters of governance and internal organization" and the [[Establishment Clause]] forbids "excessive government entanglement with religion."  For example, the US government cannot force the [[Catholic]] church to hire homosexual or female priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is the focus of the [[DeMarco v. Holy Cross High School]] and [[Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC]] court cases. The Hosanna-Tabor decision broadened the ministerial exception to allow the firing of a teacher with narcolepsy from a religious school where her religious duties consumed only 45 minutes of each workday, and who otherwise taught secular subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &amp; Sch. v. E.E.O.C., 132 S. Ct. 694, 708 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[Fifth Circuit]] held that the Music Director and pianist at a church was also covered by the exception. The panel reasoned that by playing the piano at services, the pianist served an integral role at services and assisted in conveying the church's message to its congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Cannata v. Catholic Diocese of Austin, 700 F.3d 169, 177 (5th Cir. 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">__NOTOC__
The '''National Board for Prices and Incomes''' was created by the government of [[Harold Wilson]] in 1965 in an attempt to solve the problem of [[inflation]] in the British economy by [[prices and incomes policy|managing wages and prices]].

The Board's chairman was [[Aubrey Jones]], formerly a [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, who resigned his seat to take the position.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the other members was the academic [[Hugh Clegg (industrial relations)|Hugh Clegg]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board's initial topics, given by the Government, were to deal with the pricing of soap, bread  and road haulage. Its first report (July 1965) attacked [[price-fixing]] by the British [[Road Haulage Association]]. The Association's combative response was to prove a typical reaction to most of the Board's findings throughout its existence. Recommendations on wages were no more effective, especially as the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] was opposed from an early stage to the government's attempts at wage control. From 1966 onwards, the Government introduced a series of [[Prices and Incomes Act 1966|Prices and Incomes Orders]] to limit price and wage increases by law. This was in effect the end of the voluntary policy which had been envisaged. [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]], the [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs]] responsible for the Board, was moved later that year to become [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;Broadway (1970), pp. 48-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the failure of Brown's national economic plans, and especially after [[devaluation]] in 1967, wage control was more consistently opposed by British trades unions, and eventually in 1970 Wilson proposed to merge the Board with the [[Monopolies Commission]], with Jones at its head. In the event the 1970 General Election was won by the Conservatives, who scrapped the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Clegg wrote a book on his experience entitled ''How to Run an Incomes Policy, and Why We Made Such a Mess of the Last One''. (1971).&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently in 1972 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Edward Heath]] revived the idea with a [[Prices Commission]] and a Pay Board, which were similarly unpopular, although the Prices Commission was retained (and the Pay Board abolished) by the returning Wilson government in 1974.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4458">The '''New Jersey stormwater management rules''' were organized in 1983 and updated in 2004. The rules restrict building within 300-foot of "high quality water"; and [[stormwater]] and [[parking lot]] runoff at new developments must be diverted to a [[retention basin]] or a [[detention basin]] that are used for [[groundwater recharge]] to replenish the [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name=conserve&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Jersey's stormwater policy is groundbreaking. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118379899.html |quote=New Jersey's governor says the new stormwater rules they have in place are the most comprehensive in the nation. He is correct that no other state has required a statewide 300-foot buffer around high quality water. New Jersey has more than 6,000 miles of high quality waterways. Governor James McGreevey through two sets of stormwater rules is trying to minimize the impact of new development projects by encouraging recharge of rainwater and controlling development near waterways.  |work=[[Journal of Soil and Water Conservation]] |date= May 1, 2004|accessdate=2009-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[detention basin]]s have the added effect of filtering [[urban runoff]] from [[parking lots]] of [[motor oil]] and other chemicals that would end up in storm sewers and eventually [[river]]s and [[streams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.gov/dep/watershedmgt/basicinfo2.htm#NPS |title=Watershed Management |accessdate=2009-07-01 |quote=Another way people affect ground water is by adding potential pollution sources. How the land above ground water is used by people, whether it is farms, houses or shopping centers, has a direct impact on ground water quality. As rain washes over a parking lot, it might pick up road salt and motor oil and carry these pollutants to a local aquifer. On a farm or suburban lawn, snow melt might soak fertilizers and pesticides into the ground. |publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
New Jersey receives an average of 44 inches of precipitation each year. About 15 to 39 inches of that rain recharge the reservoirs and [[aquifers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nj.usgs.gov/gw/aquifer.html |title=Major aquifers in New Jersey |accessdate=2009-06-30 |quote= |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original stormwater management rules were passed in 1983 and changes were first proposed in 2002 by the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Alex|last= Nussbaum|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=DEP Clean-Water Proposals in New Jersey Aim to Protect Runoff. |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8915345_ITM |quote=New Jersey proposed new rules for dealing with storm-water runoff on Monday that could permanently change the state's landscape in the name of protecting water supplies and open space. |work=[[Bergen Record]] |date=December 11, 2002 |accessdate=2009-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Governor [[James McGreevey]] signed into law two new stormwater rules.

The '''North Korean Human Rights Act''' ('''NKHRA''')&lt;ref name="NationalLawInformationCenter"&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korean Human Rights Act|url=https://www.law.go.kr/eng/engLsSc.do?menuId=2&amp;query=NORTH%20KOREAN%20HUMAN%20RIGHTS%20ACT#liBgcolor0|website=National Law Information Center|publisher=Ministry of Government Legislation|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed on March 3, 2016 by the Seoul [[Government of South Korea|National Assembly]] in the Republic of Korea. The act sets clear guidelines for the protection and advancement of human rights for current and former North Korean citizens in accordance with the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The North Korea Human Rights Act became effective on September 4, 2016.

'''Act No. 14070''' (NKHRA) outlines everything from the funding, research, and agencies to be established in order to carry out the purpose of the act. The NKHRA will create an annual plan to remedy alleged human rights abuses in North Korea and provide humanitarian assistance to North Korean citizens. It calls for the formation of an advisory committee that addresses problems faced by prisoners of war and separated families in the North. With the large number of afflicted individuals targeted by the NKHRA in mind, the act gives preference to the most vulnerable social groups such as children when assistance is to be provided. The act also aims to secure the physical safety of defectors and increases the flow of information to them by providing appropriate financial assistance to South Korean civil groups vis a vis specifically created bodies such as the North Korea Human Rights Foundation and the North Korean Human Rights Archive.

== Background ==

Since the mid-2000s, the Seoul National Assembly has promulgated legislation that seeks to foster a more informed relationship between the Republic of Korea ([[South Korea|ROK]]) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ([[North Korea|DPRK]]). The most notable new enactments include the Inter-Korea Exchange &amp; Cooperation Act, the Inter-
Korean Cooperation Fund Act, the Development of Inter-Korea Relations Act, and most
recently the North Korea Human Rights Act.{{efn|The NKHRA is to supersede all existing legislation with reference to human rights, except where expressly stated otherwise.  However, Article 15 of the Inter-Korean Relations Act is mentioned will "apply mutatis mutandis to the matters necessary to appoint the representatives for North-South dialogue on human rights."{{Cite quote|date=September 2016}}}} Over this period, some [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s have been openly critical of governmental commitment to addressing issues of [[human rights in North Korea]]. These groups have argued that attention given to humanitarian issues in North Korea tapered off following the Great Famine or "[[North Korean famine|Arduous March]]." Historically, consistent aid-focused campaigns were positively correlated to the amount of aid provided to the DPRK after 1995. From 2004 to 2012, bilateral and multilateral aid expressed a steep downward trend before eventually returning to its pre-1995 levels, as the broad network of NGOS campaigning for North Korean aid became limited to a few strategic advocacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Kyungyon|title=The Influence of South Korean NGOs on State Aid Policy|journal=Asian Perspective|date=2016|volume=40|pages=271–298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like Good Friends (Choŭn pŏddŭl) continued to bring awareness to North Korean human rights abuses by distributing photographs of famished North Korean children as one method for generating funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Em|first1=Henry|title=War Politics, Visuality and Governmentality in South Korea|journal=North Korean Review|date=Spring 2016|volume=12|issue=1|pages=51–65|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|language=English|issn=1551-2789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such scrutiny came after various iterations of what ultimately became the NKHRA spent eleven years working its way toward approval from the National Assembly. During this time, both the United States and Japan passed legislation addressing [[North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004|North Korean human rights in 2004]] and 2006, respectively. A 2014 [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|UN Commission of Inquiry Report]] did little to assuage the concerns of human rights advocacy groups after the commission identified clear examples of the afflictions of North Korean citizens. In response, the [[Human Rights Foundation]] (HRF) later developed a Global Coalition for the North Korean Human Rights Act in September 2015 as a part of its continued Disrupt North Korea Project upon voicing its frustration with the National Assembly. The group consists of policymakers, activists and former heads of state. Prominent members include: [[Jimmy Wales]], [[Larry Diamond]], [[Viktor Yushchenko]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Emil Constantinescu]], [[Nurul Izzah Anwar]], and [[Srđa Popović (activist)|Srdja Popovic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Coalition for the North Korean Human Rights Act|url=https://www.humanrightsfoundation.org/programs/hrf-programs/global-coalition-for-the-north-korean-human-rights-act|website=Human Rights Foundation|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking to bring awareness to alleged North Korean human rights abuses and to pressure the South Korean government to be more proactive, the Human Rights Foundation, among others - including [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] - continue to advocate for human rights in North Korea following the enactment of the NKHRA.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Notable provisions ==

===Human Rights Advisory Committee===

The NKHRA calls for a North Korean Human Rights Advisory Committee to be established within the Ministry of Unification. Detailed in Articles 5-6, selection of one half of the ten member advisory committee is dictated by the National Assembly to the Ministry of Unification on the basis of recommendations made by the political party to whom the President belongs. The advisory committee maintains a consultative role with the Minister of Unification. Under the Act, the Ministry will develop a long-term (three year) "master-plan" to promote human rights dialogue and provide humanitarian assistance after receiving advice and information gathered by the advisory committee, which will allow the Ministry to be more effective on a yearly basis under its dynamic short-term action plan.&lt;ref name="NationalLawInformationCenter"/&gt;

===Human Rights Foundation===

Per Articles 10-12 of the act, a Human Rights Foundation will be established as a corporation once it has filed for incorporation. Selection of one half of the twelve member Board of the Foundation is dictated by the National Assembly to the Ministry of Unification on the basis of recommendations made by the political party to whom the President belongs, with a chief director selected by the Minister of Unification. The Foundation is given the authority to conduct policy research and development in order to prevent human rights abuses and promote dialogue between North and South Korea. The act gives the Foundation authority to delegate responsibility (while providing financial assistance) for researching human rights and humanitarian issues to NGOs and local agencies. Articles 16-17 canonize Foundation members as public officials and outline applicable provisions of the Criminal Act to which they are held accountable. Members found to be in receipt of any subsidy of the NKHRA are subject to a fine of ₩30 million and up to three years in prison.&lt;ref name="NationalLawInformationCenter"/&gt;

===Human Rights Archive===

Article 13 calls for the establishment of a Human Rights Archive tasked with collecting and recording information pertaining to human rights and humanitarian assistance. The Minister of Unification gives express permission for the Archive to delegate any of the functions with which it is tasked to outside institutions while providing them with subsidies to cover any expenses incurred. All data collected and stored by the Archive is required to be transferred to the Ministry of Justice on a quarterly basis, which would allow cases to be systematically built against North Korean policymakers.&lt;ref name="NationalLawInformationCenter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Rights Law Aimed at Improving Plight of N.

===Reporting and Cooperation===

Under the act, the Minister of Unification is required to annually report to the National Assembly updates on the current status of human rights and any improvements accounted for by the act.
Article 9 §2 expressly calls for the appointment of an Ambassador for Human Rights in North Korea to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This provision is intended to facilitate cooperation with international organizations, international bodies and foreign governments in information exchange and promoting awareness of human rights concerns in North Korea, internationally.&lt;ref name="NationalLawInformationCenter"/&gt;

* All Foundation and Archive activities are under the purview of the Minister of Unification. By proxy, those delegated to local agencies would be as well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* Article 14 gives the Minister of Unification the power to "request cooperation from other administrative agencies, public organizations, and relevant persons to submit materials, state opinions, or provide cooperation for other matters necessary for policy implementation." In the event of such a request, the head of the organization is required to comply with the request.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Norton Stanley Karno''' (* 29. June 1936)&lt;ref name=karnofiles/&gt; is best known as an attorney for the [[Church of Scientology]] and its founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in the 1960s and 1970s, and whose name figures prominently in Scientology's history.&lt;ref name= diglwatch&gt;[http://www.digl-watch.info/people.shtml#_karno_norton http://www.digl-watch.info/people.shtml#_karno_norton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=karnofiles&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050316093154/http://members.aol.com/nortnkarno/kfile.html The Karno Files]&lt;/ref&gt;

Karno is also well known as an active [[real estate]] investor. According to an article in the Colorado newspaper ''Daily Camera'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Karno or one of his corporations owns more than 500 pieces of real estate nationwide, including seven parcels in Boulder County, Colorado.&lt;ref name=dailycamera&gt;Clint Talbott, "Evidence? None, Nada", ''The Daily Camera'', February 5, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Karno is associated with the California firm of Karno, Schwartz &amp; Friedman &lt;ref name=KSF&gt;http://www.lawyers.com/California/Encino/Karno-Schwartz-and-Friedman-94949-f.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hubbard's will==
The 1979 version of Hubbard's Last Will and Testament named Karno as Executor:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ...I nominate and appoint Norton S. Karno as Executor of this Will. Should Norton S. Karno be deceased or otherwise unable or unwilling to act as Executor, then I nominate and appoint Michael M. Smith as Executor of this Will.

I acknowledge that I have been informed and am advised that a conflict of interest may exist as to Norton S. Karno in his capacity as Personal Representative hereunder and in his capacity as a general partner of a partnership in which I may have an interest at my death. I understand that Norton S. Karno could favour the partnership over the estate, and vice versa, which could prejudice the rights of the other. In view of the foregoing, I hereby waive any conflict of interest that may result in Norton S. Karno's service in the aforementioned capacities.&lt;ref name=diaz&gt;[http://www.robertodiaz.org/hubbard-death1.html robertodiaz.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Guardian's Office==
During Scientology's days of the [[Guardian's Office]], Norton Karno wrote a letter to the GO's [[David Gaiman]], complaining that Hubbard was receiving no money from the Church of Scientology.  Shortly thereafter, Karno was taken off Hubbard's will to be replaced by Norman Starkey as Executor.&lt;ref name=karnofiles/&gt;

Karno, along with fellow attorneys [[Scientology and the legal system#Legal counsel|Meade Emory]], [[Scientology and the legal system#Legal counsel|James Q. Fisher]], and [[Scientology and the legal system#Legal counsel|Sherman and Stephen Lenske]] were reportedly involved in the Church's battle against the [[Internal Revenue Service]] during [[Operation Snow White]].&lt;ref name=IRS&gt;[http://sc-i-r-s-ology.com/documents/1973-09-05irssuitfiled.html http://sc-i-r-s-ology.com/documents/1973-09-05irssuitfiled.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital Lightwave==
In 1997, Karno was the second biggest stakeholder in [[Digital Lightwave]], a [[Scientology]]-related company in [[Clearwater, Florida]], during their [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref name=sptimes&gt;"The CEO and his Church", Deborah O'Neill and Jeff Harrington, ''St.Petersburg Times'', June 2, 2002.[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/06/02/TampaBay/The_CEO_and_his_churc.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|possession}}
{{Property law}}

In law, '''possession''' is the  control a person's intentional exercises toward a thing. In all cases, to possess something, a person must have an intention to possess it. A person may be in possession of some property (although possession does not always imply [[ownership]]). Like ownership, the possession of anything is commonly regulated by country under [[property law]].

==Intention to possess==
An intention to possess (sometimes called ''animus possidendi'') is the other component of possession. All that is required is an intention to possess something for the time being. In [[common law]] countries, the intention to possess a thing is a fact. Normally, it is proved by the acts of control and surrounding circumstances.

It is possible to intend to possess something without knowing that it exists. For example, if you intend to possess a suitcase, then you intend to possess its contents, even though you do not know what it contains. It is important to distinguish between the intention sufficient to obtain possession of a thing and the intention required to commit the crime of possessing something illegally, such as banned drugs, firearms or stolen goods.&lt;ref name="Teh HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|43|1985|litigants=[[He Kaw Teh v R]] |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 523 |courtname=auto |date=11 July 1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The intention to exclude others from the suitcase and its contents does not necessarily amount to the guilty mind of intending to possess illegally.

When people possess places to which the public has access, it may be difficult to know whether they intend to possess everything within those places. In such circumstances, some people make it clear that they do not want possession of the things brought there by the public. For example, it is not uncommon to see a sign above the coat rack in a restaurant which disclaims responsibility for items left there.

==Importance of possession==
Possession is one of the most important concepts in [[property law]]. There are three related and overlapping but not identical legal concepts: possession, right of possession and ownership.

In common law countries, possession is itself a property right. The owner of a property has the [[right of possession]] and may assign that right wholly or partially to another who may then also assign the right of possession to a third party. For example, an owner of residential property may assign the right of possession to a property manager under a property management [[contract]] who may then assign the right of possession to a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] under a rental agreement. There is a [[rebuttable presumption]] that the possessor of property also has the right of possession, and evidence to the contrary may be offered to establish who has the legal right of possession to determine who should have actual possession, which may include evidence of ownership (without assignment of the right of possession) or evidence of a superior right of possession without ownership. Possession of a thing for long enough can become ownership by termination of the previous owner's right of possession and ownership rights. In the same way, the passage of time can bring to an end the owner's right to recover exclusive possession of a property without losing the ownership of it, as when an adverse [[easement]] for use is granted by a court.

In civil law countries, possession is not a right but a (legal) fact which enjoys certain protection by the law. It can provide evidence of ownership but it does not in itself satisfy the burden of proof. For example, ownership of a house is never proven by mere possession of a house. Possession is a factual state of exercising control over an object, whether owning the object or not. Only a legal (possessor has legal ground), bona fide (possessor does not know he has no right to possess) and regular possession (not acquired through force or by deceit) can become ownership over passage of time. A possessor enjoys certain judicial protection against third parties even if he is not the owner.

There may be varying degrees of rights to possession. For example, if you leave a book that belongs to you at a cafe and the waiter picks it up, you have lost possession. When you return to recover the book, even though the waiter has possession, you have a better right to possession and the book should be returned. This example demonstrates the distinction between ownership and possession: throughout the process you have not lost ownership of the book although you have lost possession at some point; or instead, the book may have been owned by a third party (such as a [[lending library]]) throughout, despite the changes in possession.

==Obtaining possession==
Possession requires both control and intention. It is obtained from the first moment that both those conditions exist simultaneously. Usually, intention precedes control, as when you see a coin on the ground and reach down to pick it up. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a person might obtain control of a thing before forming the intention to possess it. If  unknowingly sat on and therefore had control of a $10 note on the seat of a train, he or she could obtain possession by becoming aware of the note and forming the intention to possess it. People can also intend to possess things left, without their knowledge, in spaces they control.

Possession can be obtained by a one-sided act by which factual control is established. This can take the form of apprehension (taking an object not in someone's possession) or seizure (taking an object in someone's possession). It can also be obtained through a two-sided process of handing over the possession from one party to another. The party handing over possession must intend to do so.

===Possession acquired by consent===
Most property possessed is obtained with the consent of someone else who possessed it. They may have been purchased, received as gifts, leased, or borrowed. The transfer of possession of goods is called [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]]. For land, it is common to speak of granting or giving possession.

A temporary transfer of possession is called a [[bailment]]. Bailment is often regarded as the separation of ownership and possession. For example, the library continues to own the book while you possess it and will have the right to possess it again when your right comes to an end. A common transaction involving bailment is a conditional sale or hire-purchase, in which the seller lets the buyer have possession of the thing before it is paid for. The buyer pays the purchase price in installments and, when it is fully paid, ownership of the thing is transferred from seller to buyer.

===Possession acquired without consent===
It is possible to obtain possession of a thing without anyone else's consent. First, you might take possession of something which has never been possessed before. This can occur when you catch a wild animal; or create a new thing, such as a loaf of bread. Secondly, you might find something which someone else has lost. Thirdly, you might take something from another person without their consent. Possession acquired without consent is a property right which the law protects. It gives rise to a right of possession which is enforceable against everyone except those with a better right to possession.

===Forms of transferring possession===
There are various forms of transferring possession. One can physically hand over the object (e.g. handing over a newspaper bought at the newsstand) but it is not always necessary for the party to literally grab the object for possession to be considered transferred. It is enough that the object is within the realm of factual control (e.g. leaving a letter in the letterbox). Sometimes it is enough for a symbol of the object which enables factual control to be handed over (e.g. handing over the keys to a car or a house). One may also choose to terminate possession, as one throws a letter in the trash. Possession includes having the opportunity to terminate possession.

The '''Queensland Competition Authority''' (QCA), an independent [[statutory authority]] that was established by the [[Queensland Government]] in 1997, promotes competition as the basis for enhancing efficiency and growth in the [[Queensland]] economy.&lt;ref name="aqca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qca.org.au/What-we-do.aspx |title=What we do |date=2 October 2014 |publisher=Queensland Competition Authority |accessdate=2 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Authority is governed by a three-member Board. The [[minister (government)|Minister]] responsible for administering the ''Queensland Competition Authority Act'' is the [[Treasurer of Queensland|Treasurer]], [[Curtis Pitt]].

==Functions==
The QCA's primary role is to ensure [[monopoly]] businesses operating in Queensland, particularly in the provision of key infrastructure, do not abuse their market power through unfair pricing or restrictive access arrangements.

Following a decision by the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] in 2012, their role was expanded to include responsibilities for the state’s regulatory reform, through the establishment of the Office of Best Practice Regulation (OBPR). The OBPR supports the Queensland Government’s strategy of reducing the burden of regulation on business and industry by 20% by 2018.

In support of the Queensland Government’s objective to improve productivity across the state, they also provide professional advice on productivity matters.

==Responsibilities==

In terms of their enabling legislation, the ''Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997'' (the QCA Act), their main responsibilities are:&lt;ref name="ar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qca.org.au/AR-2013-14 |title=Annual Report 2013-14 |date=2 October 2014 |publisher=Queensland Competition Authority |accessdate=2 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monopoly prices oversight ===
The QCA use pricing and other regulatory arrangements, based on sound economic and commercial principles, to encourage monopoly businesses to operate responsibly in the absence of normal competitive market forces.

Prices oversight prevents government and non-government monopolies or near-monopolies from abusing their market power by charging excessive prices for their products or services – because they either have no competitors or existing ones are ineffective.

The QCA may investigate the pricing practices of such monopolies or monitor their pricing practices, depending on the referral from the Ministers responsible for administering the QCA Act (at present [2014] the Treasurer and Minister for Trade). They only perform these functions on request from the Minister.&lt;ref name="ar"/&gt;

The monopoly prices oversight powers of the QCA enable consumers to enjoy market prices, while businesses still earn a reasonable investment return – thus ensuring a beneficial outcome for all.

=== Third party access ===
Essential infrastructure that underpins economic activity should be accessible to all potential users.

The QCA regulate third party access to essential infrastructure so as to support competition by enabling competitors (i.e. ‘third parties’) to access infrastructure which cannot be economically duplicated, such as electricity and gas distribution systems, water storage and distribution systems, rail tracks and port channels. As an example, in the Queensland rail sector, they ensure track owned by Aurizon Holdings may also be used by other transport operators. This provides customers, such as coal miners, with options regarding the haulage of their product.

By opening up access, competition is enhanced in related markets such as electricity and gas retailing and rail transport.

=== Competitive neutrality ===
The principle of competitive neutrality requires that government business activities competing in the market with non-government or private-business activities do not gain an [[unfair competitive advantage (business)|unfair competitive advantage]] by virtue of being government-owned.

Their potential advantage could result from being exempt from any of the following: 
* Commonwealth or state taxes and tax equivalent payments
* debt guarantee fees
* the procedural or regulatory requirements of the federal, state or local governments.

The principle of competitive neutrality does not extend to competitive advantage arising from factors such as business size, skills, location or customer loyalty.

=== General issues ===
Apart from the specific responsibilities outlined above, the QCA has a range of general responsibilities. In particular, under section 10(e) of the QCA Act, Ministers can direct them to investigate and report on matters relating to competition, industry, productivity or best practice regulation.

Reflecting the Queensland Government’s priorities, they have increased their focus on matters relating to regulatory reform and productivity since 2012. 
 
=== Productivity ===
The QCA conduct inquiries into productivity related matters referred to them by the Queensland Government. They provide advice on ways to improve the productivity of the Queensland economy with an aim to increase economic growth and achieve higher living standards for the Queensland community.

=== Office of Best Practice Regulation ===
Queensland has over 65,000 pages of regulation. Complying with these regulations may cost the state economy as much as $2.5 billion a year.

The Office of Best Practice Regulation (OBPR) provides a transparent process to measure and, where possible, reduce the regulatory burden. It assists government departments as they work towards their goal of reducing regulation by 20% by 2018.  All departments have targets to reduce the regulatory obligations in their legislation and regulations.

=== Responsibilities outside the QCA Act ===
The responsibilities, in addition to those under the QCA Act, include:
* setting retail electricity prices under the Electricity Act 1994 and the enforcement of customer protections under the Electricity Industry Code and the Gas Industry Code
* reviewing charges payable to bulk water suppliers for the supply of bulk water to south east Queensland distributor–retailers (under the south east Queensland Water Market Rules pursuant to the Water Act 2000)
* applying competitive neutrality principles to local government business activities under the Local Government Act 2009.

=== Application ===
In undertaking their roles, the QCA work in the following areas:
* Productivity
* Electricity
* Water
* Rail
* Ports
* Gas
* competitive neutrality
* best practice regulation.

==History==
The '''Register of County Court Judgments''' was established by Parliament in 1852, originally maintained by the Lord Chancellor's Department, until it was transferred to '''Registry Trust''' in 1985. Details of administration orders made against individuals in county courts were added from 1993, and details of [[Child Support Agency]] liability orders were added from 1997.

The [[Courts Act 2003]]&lt;ref&gt;S.98&lt;/ref&gt; extended the register to include High Court judgments from 6 April 2006, and renamed it the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines. Enforced tribunal awards for money against individuals and companies have been added since 1 April 2009.

The register is currently regulated by the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines Regulations 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20053595.htm SI 2005/3595]&lt;/ref&gt; as amended by the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines (Amendments) Regulations 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/474/made SI 2009/474]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registry Trust==
The register is operated by Registry Trust Limited on behalf of the [[Ministry of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.registry-trust.org.uk | publisher=Registry Trust Limited | accessdate=2008-03-09 | year=2006 | title=Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Registry Trust''' was originally established in 1985 by the predecessor of the Ministry of Justice, the [[Lord Chancellor's Department]], and is a not-for-profit company that is entirely independent of the government. Prior to that date, the register was run by the Lord Chancellor's Department directly, but was proving costly to maintain. As the register is crucial for performing credit-worthiness checks, the government transferred operation to an independent and self-financing organisation, Registry Trust.

Registry Trust also operate similar registers for [[Scotland]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Jersey]]

A '''roof lantern''' is a [[daylighting]] architectural element. Architectural lanterns are atop a larger roof and provide natural light into the space or room below.  In contemporary use it is an architectural [[daylighting#Skylights|skylight]] structure. The term 'roof top lantern' is used to describe the lighted decorative [[lantern]]s atop taxi cabs in Japan, designed to reflect the cultural heritage of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[paper lantern]]s.

==History==
The glazed lantern was developed during the Middle Ages. Roof lanterns of masonry and glass were used in [[Renaissance architecture]], such as in principal [[cathedral]]s. In 16th-century [[France]] and [[Italy]], they began usage in [[orangeries]], an early form of a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] structure with tall windows and a glazed roof section for wintering [[citrus]] trees and other plants in non-[[temperate climate]]s.

Post-Renaissance roof lanterns were made of timber and glass and were often prone to leaking. &lt;blockquote&gt;
Initially wood-framed in the 18th and 19th centuries, skylights became even more popular in metal construction with the advent of sheet-metal shops during the [[Victorian era]]. Virtually every urban row house of the late-19th and early-20th centuries relied upon a metal-framed skylight to illuminate its enclosed stairwell. More elaborate dwellings of the era showed a fondness for the Roof Lantern, in which the humble ceiling-window design of the skylight is elaborated into a miniature glass-paneled [[sunroom|conservatory]]-style roof [[cupola]] or tower.&lt;ref name="Skylights &amp; Roof Lanterns"&gt;{{cite web

Modern lanterns benefit from advances in [[glazing (window)|glazing]] and sealing techniques, plus the development of high performance [[Insulated glazing|insulated glass]] and sealants, which reduce energy loss and provide water-tightness in the same manner as conventional skylights. Typically, roof lanterns are constructed using wood, [[UPVC]] or aluminium, or a combination of those materials.

They serve as an architectural feature, distinguished from commercial manufactured skylights by their custom design, providing unique views to the outdoors. Traditional architectural styles characterise most roof lanterns in the UK. In the U.S., where the term 'custom' skylight is often used, modern styles of roof lanterns are also common in the building vernacular.

'''''Rostker v. Goldberg''''', 453 U.S. 57 (1981), was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] was [[US constitution|constitutional]].  After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only. Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional. (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.) In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed.

== Draft and registration laws ==
The Military Selective Service Act (Act) (1948) (revised 1967) authorizes the President to require the registration for possible military service of males, but not females, the purpose of registration being to facilitate any eventual conscription under the Act.

However, registration for the draft was discontinued by Presidential Proclamation in 1974 (the Act was amended in 1973 to preclude conscription). In early 1980, President Jimmy Carter re-established the Military Selective Service System primarily because the [[Soviet Union]] had invaded Afghanistan. President Carter also recommended that the Act be amended so that the MSSA extended to include women. The question of registering women for the draft not only received considerable national attention and was the subject of wide-ranging public debate, but also was extensively considered by Congress in hearings, floor debate, and in committee. On April 22 in the House and June 12th in the Senate, a Joint Resolution to resume the registration process was passed. However, the full requested fund amount was not granted, rather just the funds required to register men. Registration of young men started on July 21, 1980.

== Case background  ==
In 1971 an anti-war group, the Philadelphia Resistance, gathered a group of young male high school students, including Andrew Rowland, his brother, David Sitman and David Fruedman to protest the draft. In ''Rowland v. Tarr'' (1971) the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania heard a challenge to the MSSA on several grounds, one of which was gender discrimination. In 1974, they were not granted a 3-judge court opinion because the draft was now discontinued. This group of men petitioned again in 1974 in ''Goldberg v. Tarr''. Robert Goldberg was a medical student at Penn State who registered and claimed to be a conscientious objector. In July 1980, just a few days before registration was to commence again, the district court offered an opinion claiming that the MSSA violated the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment.

The director of the Selective Service System, Bernard Rostker, filed an appeal and the circuit judge stayed the court decision and registration began as scheduled. ''Rostker v. Goldberg'' moved up to the Supreme Court.

== Case arguments ==
The Army and Marine Corps precluded the use of women in combat as a matter of established policy, and both the Navy and the Air Force restricted women’s participation in combat. Even the president-who had originally suggested that women be included-expressed his intent to continue the current military policy excluding women from combat. Since the purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops, and since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided funds should not be used to register them.  As one Senator said, “It has been suggested that all women be registered, but only a handful actually be inducted in an emergency. The Committee finds this a confused and ultimately unsatisfactory solution." As the Senate Committee recognized a year before, "training would be needlessly burdened by women recruits who could not be used in combat." All in all, the proponents of the current MSSA advocated not using government funds to register people who were excluded from the job anyway. The main point of those who favored the registration of females was that females were in favor of it because of gender equality principles; women, as full citizens, ought to have the same civic duties and responsibilities as men.

=== Ruling ===
In the majority opinion, Justice William Rehnquist wrote "[t]he existence of the combat restrictions clearly indicates the basis for Congress' decision to exempt women from registration. The purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops. Since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided not to register them." Implicit in the [[obiter dicta]] of the ruling was to hold valid the statutory restrictions on gender discrimination in assigning combat roles. Men and women, because of the combat restrictions on women, are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft therefore, there is no violation of the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court therefore reversed the decision of the district court.

=== Dissenting opinion ===
White, Marshall, and Brennan dissented. Justice White did not think that excluding women “offended the Constitution” but rather that Congress did not “conclude that every position in the military, no matter how far removed from combat, must be filled with combat ready men.” Marshall dissented on the principle of equal civic obligation.

'''Simona Levi'''  is a theatre director, playwright, activist, technopolitical strategist, cultural manager and curator, multidisciplinary artist, researcher, reporter, teacher and lecturer.  Born in Italy and naturalized Spanish, she has been living in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], since 1990. She is a prominent activist in European [[social movement]]s supporting the free circulation of knowledge, culture and information, [[e-democracy]], strategic use of digital tools for organization, communication, collective action and the struggle against corruption. She has also participated in movements in defense of the&amp;nbsp;[[right to housing]] and use of&amp;nbsp;[[public space]].

She is a key figure in the establishment of [[Xnet]], the [[Free Culture Forum]], the anticorruption movement 15MpaRato, and the Citizens Group against Corruption at both Catalan and Spanish levels.

Simona Levi is coauthor of the book ''Tecnopolítica, internet y r-evoluciones - Sobre la centralidad de redes digitales en el #15M''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and editor of ''Cultura libre digital - Nociones básicas para defender lo que es de todxs'', both of which were published in 2012 by Icaria.

In March 2017 the [[Pompeu Fabra University]] (UPF) of Barcelona announced that Levi would direct the master's degree in Civil Rights, Technopolitics and Digital Culture at the UPF Barcelona School of Management.

==Artistic career==
A theatre director, actress and dancer by training, Simona Levi studied&amp;nbsp;[[performing arts]]&amp;nbsp;at the [[Jacques Lecoq|Jacques Lecoq School]] in [[Paris]], where she worked as a programmer in the squatter arts space L’oeil du Cyclone. She started touring as an actress with several companies in 1982, eventually settling in Barcelona in 1990. In 1994 she set up Conservas in the city’s Raval neighborhood. This is a venue promoting local, innovative, independent performing arts based on a self-production paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/Simona/Levi/reabre/historico/espacio/creacion/Conservas/elpepiespcat/20080422elpcat_25/Tes | title=Simona Levi reabre su histórico espacio de creación Conservas |accessdate= April 8, 2011 | date=April 22, 2008 |publisher=El País}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 she founded Compañia Conservas, and that same year the company presented its first stage production, ''Femina Ex Machina'', directed by Levi and Dominique Grandmougin. The piece was awarded the FAD Special Critics Price and the Aplaudiment Award, and toured extensively to festivals and theatres in Europe ([[Spain]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Norway]]...) for more than two years. In 2003, again with Dominique Grandmougin, she directed the company’s second work, ''Seven Dust'', which premièred at the Mercat de les Flors in Barcelona. The production toured through several European countries, including Italy, France, [[Belgium]], Switzerland, [[Finland]], Slovenia and [[Poland]]. In 2007, with Marc Sampere, she co-directed the third show by Compañia Conservas, ''Realidades Avanzadas'', which questioned [[representative democracy]] and the concept of property.  This work is based on the [[open-source model]]. At the end of the performance, audience members could take home a [[CD-ROM]] with the texts, videos, music and images used in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/Parodia/participacion/elpepuespcat/20070328elpcat_13/Tes | title=Parodia de la participación |accessdate=April 8, 2001 |date=March 28, 2007 |publisher=El País}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the production was sparked by a video posted on [[YouTube]] in October 2006 that denounced real estate [[speculation]] and included footage recorded with a hidden camera in the anti-mobbing office at Barcelona City Council. The video was removed from YouTube at the request of the bank [[La Caixa]], which alleged [[copyright infringement]] based on the use of images of one of its branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gara.net/paperezkoa/20080215/62657/es/La-revolucion-publico-llega-Fundicion-corrosivo-mitin-contra-violencia-inmobiliaria| title=La revolución del público llega a la Fundición con un corrosivo mitin contra la "violencia inmobiliaria" |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |date=February 15, 2008 |publisher=Diario Gara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 to 2011 Simona Levi directed the Performing and Applied Arts Festival InnMotion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simona Levi's projects at CCCB|url=http://www.cccb.org/en/autor-simona_levi-12711|website=CCCB}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is held at the [[Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/BARCELONA/In/Motion/amplia/aforo/ofrecer/arriesgado/menu/artistico/elpepiespcat/20020702elpcat_29/Tes?print=1 |title='In Motion' amplía su aforo para ofrecer un arriesgado menú artístico |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |date=July 2, 2002 |publisher=El País}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/cultura/20070702/51369300006/un-corto-porno-en-3d-y-un-video-con-la-ciudad-como-plato-sorpresas-visuales-en-el-grec.html | title= Un corto porno en 3D y un vídeo con la ciudad como plató, sorpresas visuales en el Grec |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |date= July 2, 2007 |publisher=La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 she has managed the stage production of the [[Oxcars|oXcars]].

She is scriptwriter and director of the play ''Hazte Banquero - Tarjetas Black: todo lo que quisieron ocultarte'' (Become a Banker: Black Cards, Everything They Wanted to Hide from You), a documentary work staging the “black credit cards” corruption case and revealing the ''modus operandi'' of the top management of the bank [[Caja Madrid]] by means of a selection from 447 emails sent to and by the bank’s president [[Miguel Blesa]]. The work was premiered in July 2016 in the Poliorama Theatre, Barcelona, as part of the city’s [[Festival Grec de Barcelona|Grec Festival]] and has also been performed in several venues including the Fernán Gómez Theatre in Madrid and the Rosalia de Castro Theatre in A Coruña. After seeing the show in Madrid, the [[HSBC]] whistleblower [[Hervé Falciani]] said that he could “see the future” in this dramatization of data.

==Activism==
Simona Levi is one of the founders of eXgae (now [[Xnet]]), a non-profit association created in 2008 which explores alternative models for [[cultural diffusion]], [[copyright]] and democracy in the digital age. Since 2008, Xnet, with the support of Conservas, has organised the annual [[Oxcars|oXcars,]] a non-competitive awards ceremony, which puts the spotlight on projects created in different arts disciplines based on the paradigm of free culture.

As a member of Xnet, she is director of the staging of the [[Oxcars|oXcars]] and also the coordinator of the [[Free Culture Forum|FCForum]], an international arena in which organisations and experts in the field of free/libre knowledge and culture work towards creating a global strategic framework for action and coordination. She is also a founding member of Red Sostenible (Sustainable Network), a citizen platform created in January 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://red-sostenible.net/index.php/P%C3%A1gina_Principal |title=Red Sostenible |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518161358/http://red-sostenible.net/index.php/P%C3%A1gina_Principal |archivedate=2011-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to combat the introduction of the anti-download legislation known as the “Sinde Law” in Spain, and to defend Internet rights. The work of this platform would seem to be of concern to the United States government. A cable from the US ambassador in Spain notes that “[…] these populist advocacy groups are very vocal”.

In 2010, she appeared before the [[European Union]] Parliamentary Sub-Committee on Intellectual Property Law reform to defend the proposals contained in the “Charter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge”, a document that was drafted collectively by participants of the FCForum. In her presentation, she offered an overview of some of the omissions in the legislation and put forward possible solutions included in the Charter, such as the abolition of Spain’s [[private copying levy|levy for private copying]] or “canon digital” and the need to reform [[copyright collecting societies]] which, she pointed out, “hinder the free circulation of knowledge and sustainability for authors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/01/29/navegante/1264780371.html |title=Propuestas para innovar en la reforma de Ley de Propiedad Intelectual | accessdate=April 8, 2011 |date= January 21, 2010 |publisher=El Mundo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

In recent years, she has participated as a speaker and observer at national and international events, where she talks about the Xnet project,  the situation of free culture, digital democracy, copyright management, and possible alternatives to the present model. These events include the Ministerial Forum for Creative Europe (The [[Czech Republic]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forumforcreativeeurope.cz/en/Conference-agenda |title= Conference agenda |accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmediale ([[Berlin]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transmediale.de/content/observer-talk-day-simona-levi|title=Observer talk of the day with Simona Levi|publisher=Transmediale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economies of the Commons ([[Amsterdam]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ecommons.tuxic.nl/?p=2506 |title=Simona Levi: "Power is always using the name of freedom to do the nasty things |accessdate= April 8, 2011 | date= November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the seminar “Sustainable Economy Law and the Internet” organized by the Telecommunications Technical Engineering Faculty at the Technical University of Madrid. As a representative of the FCForum, she is a [[lobbyist]] at the [[European Commission]].

Simona Levi is a member of the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15M]] movement in Spain and of the group 15MpaRato, which filed a lawsuit against the banker and former&amp;nbsp;[[IMF]]&amp;nbsp;Managing Director&amp;nbsp;[[Rodrigo Rato]], an action that launched the [[Bankia]] trial in Spain after an anonymous source used the Xnet anticorruption mailbox to give access to the web domain &lt;nowiki&gt;http://correosdeblesa.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; with more than 8,000 emails from the Inbox of [[Miguel Blesa]], president of Caja Madrid from 1996 to 2009. These revealed, for the first time, the existence of the so-called Black Cards (tax-free, corporate credit cards for Caja Madrid–Bankia cronies), how the bank bought and sold the [[City National Bank of Florida]], and how the bank’s customers were defrauded by the [[preferred stock]] scheme. In June 2015 Xnet published a selection of the Blesa emails through four online media sources. The [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|National Court]] admitted the case and charged Rodrigo Rato and the former board of directors with fraud, falsification of accounts in order to attract investment, and improper management, among other crimes.

Simona Levi is a member of the Grupo Ciudadano contra la Corrupción (Citizens Group against Corruption), a network which works at both Catalan and Spanish levels to strengthen already-existing initiatives to protect [[whistleblower]]s, coordinate them and facilitate exchange of information among them. The Spanish branch of the Group was presented at the Free Culture Forum 2015 with the support of Xnet, 15MpaRato, David Fernàndez, former member of parliament for the political party [[Popular Unity Candidacy|CUP (Popular Unity Candidacy)]], and the Acción Cívica (Civic Action) platform, among others.

In 2015–2016, as a member of the Advisory Council of the Barcelona City Hall Office for Transparency and Best Practice, she initiated and worked to install the Ethical and Good Governance Box, a complaints box by means of which citizens can denounce corruption and other practices that are damaging for good governance in the city of Barcelona. This mailbox, similar to that already produced by Xnet, is the first such box to be promoted by a government (in this case that of the city of Barcelona). Once the mailbox was presented in public, Levi announced her resignation from the advisory board.

In 2017 [[Rolling Stone magazine]] chose Simona Levi, as the founder of Xnet and for her work with 15MpaRato, as one of 25 people in the world who are shaping the future. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/pictures/25-people-shaping-future-in-tech-science-medicine-activism-w511978 | title=Rolling Stone: 25 People Shaping the Future |accessdate= December 10, 2017 | date=November 17, 2017 |publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Levi is one of the coordinators of [[X Party]], a Spanish political party that emerged from the [[2011–12 Spanish protests|15-M movement]] (Indignados movement)and was founded on 17 December 2012. She was second on the X Party ballot for the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Spain)|2014 European Parliament elections]], after the party’s first candidate [[Hervé Falciani]].

The '''Spanish Society of Authors and Publishers''' (''Sociedad General de Autores y Editores, SGAE'') is the main [[collecting society]] for [[songwriter]]s, [[composer]]s and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]]s in Spain. It is similar to AGADU, [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], [[GEMA (German organization)|GEMA]], [[Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música|SADAIC]], [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]] and SAYCO. The philologist, poet, composer, scriptwriter, movie and television director and producer Antón Reixa (1957) is the Chairman of the Board of Directors since May 2012. SGAE was founded in 1889 as Society of Authors of Spain. In 1995, its name changed to Society of Authors and Publishers, seeking to accommodate cultural editors.

SGAE comprises more than 100,000 music, audiovisual and dramatic creators. Created in 1899,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} its main mission is the protection of its members' rights for the use of their works throughout the world. These uses include mechanical reproduction, public performance, synchronization and many other forms of musical distribution. This process culminates in the collection and subsequent royalty distribution to its members.

With over 430 employees, more than 200 representatives in Spain, plus offices in the USA, Brazil, Mexico, Cuba and Argentina, SGAE protects the rights of more than two million members from all over the world. It does so through reciprocal representation agreements entered into with 150 foreign societies which, in turn, administer and protect its members rights in their respective territories.

SGAE is not only an organism for the management of rights. Through its Fundación Autor, or in collaboration with cultural institutions, SGAE enhances its compromise to promote the continuous formation of its members and the diffusion of their works around the world, aiding for their well-being, including the start-up of an assistance program with multiple features and social benefits.

In 2018, SGAE was involved in a television scam known as "La Rueda", where TV broadcasters played more of their personally owned music in late-night slots, leaving tens of millions of dollars less each year for other parties whose music is played on Spanish TV.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8463245/spain-music-publishers-scheme-music-royalties-tv-broadcasters-the-wheel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital canon==
One of the main activities of the SGAE is the collection of a [[blank media tax]] called “canon”. This tax is aimed to compensate authors for private copies of their work and was incorporated into Spanish law by Law 22/1987 of November 11, Intellectual Property. This law recognized the right of users to make private copies. The fee was intended to levy countervailing audio and video devices such as tapes, stereos or televisions. Its latest version, called “digital canon”, placed the SGAE in the middle of a controversy when trying to extrapolate this charge to digital devices such as CD, DVD, external hard drives and cell phones capable of playing music. The amount payable ranges from 0.17 euros on the price of a CD-R up to 227 euros to be paid to purchase a copier.

===Opponents===
The digital canon was implemented on 18 December 2007, and it introduced the payment of a fee as compensation for private copying that both individuals and companies must pay regardless of the intended use for the device. This has been a main argument of opponents of the blank media tax, who believe that the indiscriminate application of the canon does not respect the presumption of innocence of consumers. However, the Spanish Intellectual Property Law recognizes the right to private copying, so there is no offense to commit, and therefore there is no presumption of innocence. The digital canon has grown unpopular in Spain and the two main Spanish organizations of Internet users had collected three million signatures by February 2010 calling for the abolition of the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/canon/digital/millones/firmas/esquelas/periodicos/elpepucul/20100212elpepucul_4/Tes|title=Contra el canon digital, tres millones de firmas y esquelas en los periódicos|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=2010-02-12|work=EL PAÍS|access-date=2017-03-07|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Internet users defend their right to make private copies of the purchased contents without paying any additional fees.

In July 2018, in response to the "Rueda" scandal, [[Warner/Chappell]], [[Sony/ATV]], [[Universal Music Publishing Group]], [[BMG Rights Management]], and [[Peermusic]] have attempted to pull their catalogues from SGAE's repertoire by 2019, and may refuse to license their music for broadcast. These publishers account for 60% of Spain's broadcasting rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/major-publishers-request-to-remove-catalogs-from-spanish-society-sgae&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defenders===
The private copying levy has traditionally been seen as a compensation for the original authors, transferring payment from analog media to digital media. Apart from the controversy surrounding it in Spain, the tax common among European countries and is seen as a compensation accepted in all European Union countries, provided by Directive 2001/29/EC, which in Article 5 authorizes the various member countries to enter the private copying exception provided that the legislation adequately compensate the original authors. Ireland, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus do not recognize the right to private copying, so no fee is charged. Other countries have opted to compensate the authors directly. This is the case of Norway, where 40 million euros were spent for this purpose during 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Canon por copia privada (España)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Europe, the fee is also charged in countries such as Canada, while in the U.S., recording media devices are taxed at a rate of 3%.

==Legal dispute==
In 2004, the SGAE claimed EUR 16,759.25 to the company PADAWAN, dedicated to the marketing of multimedia devices such as CD, DVD or MP3, to compensate for devices sold between September 2002 and September 2004. PADAWAN took the case to trial, and the Court of Barcelona consulted with the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Spanish tax system for the cultural industry is compatible with Community law. The Court of Justice of European Union General Counsel, Verica Trstenjak, ruled that the application of digital canon in Spain is illegal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-canon-digital-espanol-ilegal-20100511152051.html|title=El canon digital español es ilegal|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2010-05-11|work=europapress.es|access-date=2017-03-07|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; when imposed indiscriminately on all recording and playing equipment and materials purchased by companies and not only those who presumably are intended for making private copies, the only case in which the digital canon would comply with European legislation. The law states that under no circumstances the canon can be imposed to companies and professionals that clearly acquire the devices for purposes unrelated to private copying.

Following the European resolution, digital canon has been strongly questioned by Internet users and some political parties. To achieve parliamentary support for the so-called “Sinde Law”, after the Culture Ministry, [[Ángeles González-Sinde]], approved by the Senate Finance Committee on February 1, 2011 the Spanish Government committed to eliminate the digital fee within three months after the approval of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/02/01/navegante/1296565987.html|title=La Comisión de Economía del Senado aprueba la 'Ley Sinde' por unanimidad {{!}} Navegante {{!}} elmundo.es|last=Internet|first=Unidad Editorial|website=www.elmundo.es|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition required by the main opposition party, the Partido Popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-ley-sinde-floriano-pp-patada-puerta-pretendia-evitar-delitos-vulneraba-derechos-fundamentales-20101223125435.html|title=Floriano (PP): "La 'patada en la puerta' pretendía evitar delitos, pero vulneraba derechos fundamentales"|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2010-12-23|work=europapress.es|access-date=2017-03-07|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The SGAE has been involved in several controversies, like charging a fine of €96 to a middle school for trying to make a theatrical play whose rights belonged to [[Federico García Lorca]]'s heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = SGAE charge 100 euros to students of highschool (In spanish) | url =http://www.farodevigo.es/sociedad-cultura/2010/02/03/sgae-cobra-cien-euros-alumnos-colegio-gallego-representar-lorca/408284.html | author = SGAE | accessdate = 2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SGAE denied access to any information or communication to the owners of the rights to the school. The school administrators by their own account finally found the copyright holders, the [[Centro Dramático Nacional]], (whose responsibles weren't informed of the situation at all by their SGAE representatives) and they gladly agreed to the school petition without any charge. However, the SGAE replied that they only acted like intermediaries and had no authority to stop demanding the payment for the copyright of registered works, unless the author or the owners requested so.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Finally, Lorca’s nephew, Manuel Fernández Montesinos, contacted the Ramón Menéndez Pidal middle school to inform that they could play "[[Bodas de sangre]]" without any charges. A few days later, Montesinos wrote again to the School Principal refusing to lose the copyright's tax since the play was to be represented in a professional theatre and not at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/coruna/2010/02/09/0003_8283549.htm|title=La familia de Lorca se niega a ceder gratis la obra de teatro al grupo del Zalaeta|date=2010-02-09|work=La Voz de Galicia|access-date=2017-03-07|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SGAE has also claimed copyright for works of authors deceased more than 70 years ago at the time of the claim, a condition that, under European law, deems the works to be of public domain. According to the councils of Zalamea de la Serena (Badajoz),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/08/13/cultura/1250160931.html|title=La SGAE acusa a Zalamea de la Serena de deber 24.000 euros por derechos de autor {{!}} Cultura {{!}} elmundo.es|last=Internet|first=Unidad Editorial|website=www.elmundo.es|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fuente Obejuna (Córdoba),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/20090814/espectaculos-teatro/fuenteovejuna-levanta-contra-sgae-20090814.html|title=Fuenteovejuna se levanta contra la SGAE - Espectaculos_Teatro - Espectaculos - ABC.es|last=ABC|website=ABC|language=es|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company claimed 24,000 and 30,000 euros respectively to represent the classic Spanish dramas "El alcalde de Zalamea" and "[[Fuenteovejuna]]", whose authors died centuries ago. The problem arises from the fact that many of the represented classic plays are adaptations to current Spanish from an original work’s ancient language, so in those cases a collection of fees is required from the adapter. In both cases, the SGAE rejected the accusations and stated that, in the case of Zalamea de la Serena, the requested quantity was 95 euros.

A common description of SGAE by independent songwriters in Spain is that the organization is made up of pirates who prefer to keep and spend royalty money owed to the writers.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Embezzlement investigation==
On 1 July 2011, eight members of the SGAE, including the president, Teddy Bautista, were arrested and charged with [[embezzlement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/07/01/espana/1309537638.html Bautista y otros 8 miembros de la SGAE, detenidos por desviar fondos]&lt;/ref&gt; The Investigation Committee estimated that as much as 87 million euros were embezzled directly or indirectly from 1997 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/3566939/11/11/El-auditor-eleva-a-87-millones-el-dinero-que-la-SGAE-desvio-a-la-red-de-Neri.html El auditor eleva a 87 millones el dinero que la SGAE desvió a la red de Neri]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7259">A '''statutory declaration''' is a legal document  defined under the law of certain [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. It is similar to a statement made under [[oath]], however, it is not sworn. 

Statutory declarations are commonly used to allow a person to declare something to be true for the purposes of satisfying some legal requirement or regulation when no other evidence is available. They are thus similar to [[affidavit]]s (which are made on oath).

Depending on jurisdiction, statutory declarations can be used for:
*Declarations of identity, nationality, marital status, etc. when documentary evidence is unavailable.
*Declaring the intention to [[name change|change one's name]].
*Affirming the provenance and nature of goods for export or import.
*Statements of originality for [[patent]] applications.

==Australia==

[[Australian law]] defines a statutory declaration as a written statement declared to be true in the presence of an authorised witness. The ''Statutory Declarations Act 1959'' governs the use of statutory declarations in matters involving the law of the [[Australia|Australian Commonwealth]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], and other territories but not including the [[Northern Territory]].

Any person within the [[jurisdiction]] of this law may make a statutory declaration in relation to any matter. The declaration may be used in connection with matters of law, including judicial proceedings, but what weight is given to the declaration is a matter for the [[judge]] to decide.

Statutory declarations must be made in a prescribed form and witnessed by a person as specified in the ''Statutory Declarations Regulations (1993)''. Prescribed witnesses include legal and medical practitioners, [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]], [[notary public|notaries public]], police officers, military officers, registered members of certain professional organisations (i.e. National Tax Accountant's Association and Institution of Engineers Australia), and certain other Commonwealth employees.

Intentionally making a false statement as a statutory declaration is a crime equivalent to [[perjury]], and punishable by fines and/or a prison sentence of up to four years.

The [[states of Australia]] each have their own laws regarding statutory declarations.

==Canada==

In Canadian jurisdictions, statutory declarations are statements of facts written down and attested to by the declarant before individuals who are authorized to administer [[oath]]s, except that they are normally used outside of court settings. They have the same effect in law as a sworn statement or affidavit.  In federal proceedings, the form is governed by the ''[[Canada Evidence Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-5/page-26.html#h-13 ''Canada Evidence Act'', RSC 1985, c C-5, s 41.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar provision is made by the various provinces for use in proceedings within their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INSTRUCTIONS TO PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO ADMINISTER OATHS, AFFIRMATIONS AND SOLEMN DECLARATIONS WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA|url = http://www.servicealberta.ca/pdf/ltmanual/AFF-1-SCHEDULEA.pdf|accessdate = 2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who makes a false declaration can be charged with [[perjury]] under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-73.html#h-53 Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 131.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Statutory declarations can be used as a method of legally [[name change|changing one's name]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/family/birth-certificates-and-changing-your-name-s/changing-your-name-s/  CAB Statutory declaration of change of name for adults (Scotland)]&lt;/ref&gt; They may be used by UK financial institutions to enable an asset of relatively small value (usually less than £15,000) to be transferred to the executors of a will or other persons legally entitled to deal with or benefit from the estate of a person who has died.

===England and Wales===
Under the Statutory Declarations Act 1835,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/5-6/62/contents Statutory Declarations Act 1835] Extent England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; a declaration can be made before anyone who is authorised by law to hear it (for example, a solicitor or legal executive)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/29/section/12 section 12(1)(f)] and
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/29/schedule/1/paragraph/2  Schedule 2] Legal Services Act 2007. See also:    [http://www.theiop.org/uploads/downloads/Reserved%20Activites%20Briefing%20Sheet.pdf Institute of Paralegals]&lt;/ref&gt;, or before any Justice of the Peace. In addition, officers of the armed services with the equivalent rank of major and above, and British diplomatic and consular officers in post abroad, may authenticate a statutory declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118551/statutory-declarations.pdf Passport policy - Statutory Declarations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The person who hears the declaration need not enquire into the truth of it. That person’s function is limited to hearing the declaration, and certifying that he or she has done so by signing it. If the declaration turns out to be untrue, the defendant making it may be punished for perjury.

The form of the statutory declaration is prescribed in the schedule&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/5-6/62/schedule/1 ''Statutory Declarations Act 1835''] &lt;small&gt;[1835 c. 62 (Regnal. 5_and_6_Will_4)]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to the Act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I (full name), do solemnly and sincerely declare that the contents of this declaration are true. And I make this declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and by virtue of the provisions of the Statutory Declarations Act 1835."&lt;ref&gt;''Adult Court Book Bench'', page 180. Judicial College, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A standard form is used for a statutory declaration; one copy will be given to the applicant and the other is held on file.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/criminal/docs/2014/crim-pr-form-part37-statutory-declaration-revised-feb-2014.doc  Statutory Declaration Form] as laid down by the ''Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980'', section 14 and ''Criminal Procedure Rules'', rule 37.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions''' ('''SORT'''), also known as the '''Treaty of Moscow''', was a strategic arms reduction treaty between the [[United States]] and [[Russia]] that was in force from June 2003 until February 2011 when it was superseded by the [[New START]] treaty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/2010%20New%20START%20msg%20rel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, SORT was positioned as "represent[ing] an important element of the new strategic relationship" between the two countries&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Transmittal: The Moscow Treaty 2002&lt;/ref&gt; with both parties agreeing to limit their [[nuclear arsenal]] to between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed warheads each. It was signed in [[Moscow]] on 24 May 2002. After ratification by the [[U.S. Senate]] and the [[State Duma]], SORT came into force on 1 June 2003. It would have expired on 31 December 2012 if not superseded by [[New START]]. Either party could have withdrawn from the treaty upon giving three months written notice to the other.

==Mutual nuclear disarmament==
SORT was one in a long line of treaties and negotiations on mutual [[nuclear disarmament]] between Russia (and its predecessor, the [[Soviet Union]]) and the United States, which includes [[SALT I]] (1969–1972), the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM Treaty]] (1972), [[SALT II]] (1972–1979), the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]] (1987), [[START I]] (1991), [[START II]] (1993) and [[New START]] (2010).

The Moscow Treaty was different from START in that it limited operationally deployed warheads, whereas START I limited warheads through declared attribution to their means of delivery (ICBMs, SLBMs, and Heavy Bombers).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/start1.html START1 treaty hypertext US State Dept.] Article II&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian and U.S. delegations met twice a year to discuss the implementation of the Moscow Treaty at the Bilateral Implementation Commission (BIC).

==Ratification==
The treaty was submitted for ratification on December 2002. However, the passage of the agreement took about a year because the bill had to be resubmitted after its rejection in committee due to concerns about funding for nuclear forces and about cutting systems that had not yet reached the end of their service lives. Further, the deputies were concerned about the U.S. ability to upload reserve nuclear warheads for a first strike (upload potential).

The ratification was also problematic because the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Duma, [[Dmitry Rogozin]], disagreed with his Federation Council counterpart [[Margelov]]. Deputy Rogozin argued that the Moscow Treaty should be delayed because of the [[2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]]. In the end, however, this delay never happened. The final vote was similar to [[START II]] with nearly a third of the deputies voting against. The ratification resolution mandated presidential reporting on nuclear force developments and noted that key legislators should be included in interagency planning.

==Implementation==
[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] reported that President Bush directed the US military to cut its stockpile of both deployed and reserve nuclear weapons in half by 2012. The goal was achieved in 2007, a reduction of US nuclear warheads to just over 50 percent of the 2001 total. A further proposal by Bush would have brought the total down another 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug08/trebes.html Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. Science &amp; Technology Review. ''Monitoring a Nuclear Weapon from the Inside: Embedded sensors could help transform stockpile stewardship'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2014}}
The treaty was criticized for various reasons:
* There were no verification provisions to give confidence, to either the signatories or other parties, that the stated reductions have in fact taken place.
* The arsenal reductions were not required to be permanent; warheads are not required to be destroyed and may therefore be placed in storage and later redeployed.
* The arsenal reductions were required to be completed by 31 December 2012, which is also the day on which the treaty loses all force, unless extended by both parties.
* There was a clause in the treaty which provided that withdrawal can occur upon the giving of three months' notice and since no benchmarks are required in the treaty, either side could feasibly perform no actions in furtherance of the treaty, and then withdraw in September 2012.

'''Synechism''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] συνεχής ''synechḗs'', "continuous" + ''-ism'', from σύν ''syn'', "together" + ἔχειν ''échein&gt;'', "to have", "to hold"), a philosophical term proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Law of Mind", ''Monist'', ii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8akLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA533 534], reprinted (''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 6, paragraphs 102-163) (''Essential Peirce'' 1, pp. 312-333).&lt;/ref&gt; to express the tendency to regard things such as space, time, and law as continuous:&lt;ref name=stl&gt;See p. 115 in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner, ed., 1992, from Peirce's 1898 lectures.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The things of this world, that seem so transitory to philosophers, are not continuous. They are composed of discrete atoms, no doubt [[Roger Joseph Boscovich|Boscovichian]] points. The really continuous things, Space, and Time, and Law, are eternal.}}

His synechism holds that the essential feature in philosophic speculation is continuity. It denies that all is merely ideas, likewise that all is merely matter, and mind–matter dualism.

The adjective "synechological" is used in the same general sense; "synechology" is a theory of continuity or universal causation; "synechia" is a term in [[ophthalmology]] for a morbid union of parts.

==The Categories==

Peirce held that there are three elements or [[Categories (Peirce)|categories]] throughout experience:
*Firstness, quality of feeling—possibility, idea, vagueness, chance, "some".
*Secondness, reaction, resistance—actuality, brute fact, individuality, discreteness, "[[Haecceity|this]]".
*Thirdness, representation, mediation—necessity or destiny, habit, law, generality, continuity, "all".

Peirce held that firstness and secondness, as elements, give thirdness and continuity something upon which to operate, and that continuity governs all experience and every element in it.

==Hypotheses==

Synechism is specially directed to the question of [[hypothesis]], and holds that a hypothesis is justifiable only on the ground that it provides an explanation. All understanding of facts consists in generalizing concerning them. Generalization is seen as movement by thought toward continuity. The fact that some things are ultimate may be recognized by the synechist without abandoning his standpoint, since synechism is a normative or regulative principle, not a theory of existence.&lt;ref&gt;"Synechism", ''Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9FlDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA657&amp;dq=%22synechism%22 p. 657] (1911), reprinted in CP 6.169–173, see 173: &lt;blockquote&gt;It would, therefore, be most contrary to his own principle for the synechist not to generalize from that which experience forces upon him, especially since it is only so far as facts can be generalized that they can be understood; and the very reality, in his way of looking at the matter, is nothing else than the way in which facts must ultimately come to be understood. There would be a contradiction here, if this ultimacy were looked upon as something to be absolutely realized; but the synechist cannot consistently so regard it. Synechism is not an ultimate and absolute metaphysical doctrine; it is a regulative principle of logic, prescribing what sort of hypothesis is fit to be entertained and examined.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immortality==

In a contribution to an 1887 symposium ''Science and Immortality'', Peirce had said that the question stood undecided on whether there is immortality or at least "a future life", but also that science could come to shed light on the question.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1887), first published in a Symposium in the ''Christian Register'', Boston, April 7, 1887, reprinted as "Contribution XX" in ''Science and Immortality: The Christian Register Symposium, Revised and Enlarged'', Samuel J. Barrows, ed., Boston: Geo. H. Ellis, pp. 69–76. ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=V9wPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69 Eprint]. Reprinted as "Science and Immortality" in ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, paragraphs 548–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 1893 manuscript "Immortality in the Light of Synechism,"&lt;ref&gt;Unpublished at the time because of a misunderstanding between Peirce and editor [[Paul Carus]], according to [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/ep/ep2/headers/ep2heads.htm the headnote] in ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2. Published as "Immortality and Synechism" in ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraphs 565–78, and reprinted under the original manuscript title in ''Essential Papers'' v. 2, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce applied his doctrine of synechism to the question of the soul's immortality in order to argue in the affirmative. According to Peirce, synechism flatly denies [[Parmenides]]' claim that "Being is, and non-being is nothing" and declares instead that "being is a matter of more or less, so as to merge insensibly into nothing." Peirce argued that the view that "no experiential question can be answered with absolute certainty" ([[fallibilism]]) implies the view that "the object has an imperfect and qualified existence" and implies, furthermore, the view that there is no absolute distinction between a phenomenon and its substrate, and among various persons, and between waking and sleeping; one who takes on a role in creation's drama identifies to that extent with creation's author. Carnal consciousness, according to Peirce's synechism, does not cease quickly upon death, and is a small part of a person, for there is also social consciousness: one's spirit really does live on in others; and there is also spiritual consciousness, which we confuse with other things, and in which one is constituted as an eternal truth "embodied by the universe as a whole": that eternal truth "as an archetypal idea can never fail; and in the world to come is destined to a special spiritual embodiment." Peirce said in conclusion that synechism is not religion but scientific philosophy, but could come to unify religion and science.

Around 1906,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (manuscript circa 1906), "Answers to Questions Concerning My Belief in God", ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, paragraphs 494–521. See §9 "Immortality", paragraphs 519–521.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce reaffirmed some of the above forms of immortality, but added, "If I am in another life it is sure to be most interesting; but I cannot imagine how it is going to be me. At the same time, I really don't know anything about it," and that mental action's dependence on the brain was an assumption warranted in science by facts until contrary facts come to light, but from the standpoint of practical interest the dependence remained open to some doubt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4822">Officially known as the '''Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the zone of cooperation in an area between the Indonesian province of East Timor and Northern Australia''', the '''Timor Gap Treaty''' is a treaty between the governments of [[Australia]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1991/9.html|title=Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an Area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia |work=Australasian Legal Information Institute - Australian Treaty Series 1991|year=1991|accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signatories to the treaty were then Australian Foreign Affairs Minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] and then Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Ali Alatas]]. The treaty was signed on December 11, 1989 and came into force on February 9, 1991.
[[File:Timor Gap map.PNG|thumb|400px|The [[Timor Gap]]]]
It provided for the joint exploitation of petroleum resources in a part of the Timor Sea seabed which were claimed by both Australia and Indonesia.

The portion of the seabed was known as the [[Timor Gap]] as it formed a break or gap in the [[Australia-Indonesia border|Australia-Indonesia maritime border]] which had been earlier agreed to because Portugal, the administering power of East Timor, did not wish to participate in a separate round of boundary negotiations as they were already under discussion at the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Conference on the Law of the Sea]]. After the Indonesia invasion and annexation of the colony in 1975–1976, East Timor was made a province of Indonesia and both Australia and Indonesia began negotiations to solve issues arising over claims to the seabed in the area.

Less than two weeks after the treaty came into force, Portugal instituted proceedings against Australia at the International Court of Justice. As Portugal was still recognized by the U.N. as the lawful administering power of East Timor, Portugal requested to dispute the lawfulness of Australia's negotiations as a party to the Timor Gap Treaty on behalf of the people of East Timor. The court ruled that it could not adjudicate the dispute as it would require the court to rule upon the lawfulness of Indonesia's annexation of East Timor, a decision that could not be made, nor could it become binding, without the consent of Indonesia. the court ruled 14 to 2 with Judge Weeramantry and Judge Skubiszewski dissenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=430&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;case=84&amp;p3=5 |title=East Timor (Portugal v. Australia)  |publisher=International Court of Justice |date=30 June 1995 |accessdate=2014-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Skubiszewski condemned the ruling of the court, stating that his primary opposition to the ruling was that, "recognition of annexation erodes self-determination." And that the courts adherence to legal correctness alone had been to the detriment of justice and was, "cause for concern."

The treaty was no longer in force when East Timor seceded from Indonesia in 1998. A new treaty to replace the Timor Gap Treaty was negotiated, resulting in the [[Timor Sea Treaty]].

==Biography==

Honoré was born in [[London]] but was brought up in [[South Africa]]. He served in the South African Infantry during the [[Second World War]] and was severely wounded in the [[First Battle of El Alamein|Battle of Alamein]]. After the war he continued his studies at [[New College, Oxford]], and he has lived and taught in [[Oxford, England|Oxford]] for the last seventy years, including periods as a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] and then of New College.&lt;ref name="AllSouls"&gt;Profile of [http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/people.php?personid=150 Tony Honré] All Souls College website, Oxford; read April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1971 and 1988 he was [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Civil Law at Oxford]] and a Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]];&lt;ref name="OxfordProfile"&gt;Profile of [https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/profile/hornorea Tony Honoré] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407152759/https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/profile/hornorea |date=2014-04-07 }} University of Oxford website, read April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SKU 978-1-920025-38-0"&gt;Daniel Visser and Max Loubser (2011) ''[http://www.siberink.co.za/p978-1-920025-38-0/Thinking-about-Law-Essays-for-Tony-Honore.aspx Thinking about Law: Essays for Tony Honore]''; Siber Ink, Westlake (South Africa). read April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; for nearly thirty years after retiring from his Chair, he taught seminars in Jurisprudence for the [[Bachelor of Civil Law|BCL]] jointly with [[John Gardner (law)|John Gardner]].

Honoré was a close associate of [[H. L. A. Hart]]. They jointly wrote ''Causation in the Law'' (Oxford, 1st ed. 1959, 2nd 1985) in 1953-8 and Honoré had some influence on Hart's ''The Concept of Law'' (Oxford, 1st ed. 1961, 2nd 1994). A number of his philosophical papers are collected in ''Making Law Bind'' (Oxford, 1987) and ''Responsibility and Fault'' (Oxford, 1999) and his contributions to legal philosophy and Roman law, which range widely, include sixteen books and more than a hundred articles published over the last six decades.

Honoré is an honorary [[Queen's Counsel|Q.C.]] and Bencher of [[Lincoln's Inn]], a member of the [[British Academy|British]] and [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Bavarian Academies]] and of the International Academy of Comparative Law. In South Africa, his standing has been recognised by the award of honorary degrees from the Universities of [[University of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Stellenbosch University|Stellenbosch]] and [[University of Cape Town|Cape Town]]. When receiving this last degree, in 1990, he had the opportunity to give an address.  He used this opportunity to point to the parallel between the extension of citizenship to all free people in the [[Roman Empire]], regardless of race, sex or religion, by [[Caracalla]] in 211 AD, and the extension of citizenship to the whole of the South African population. This he foresaw would need an adjustment of the legal system, and he suggested a constitutional court to carry it through with a parallel to the composition of the [[German Constitutional Court]].  [[Nelson Mandela]] approved of this.  It was put into practice in 1995, and has been a success.

He has delivered the [[Hamlyn Lectures|Hamlyn lectures]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;''The Quest for security: Employees, Tenants, Wives'', Tony Honoré [http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/The_Quest_for_Security_Employees_Tenants_Wives_1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; the Blackstone and H. L. A. Hart lectures, the J. H. Gray lectures at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and the Maccabaean lecture in Jurisprudence at the British Academy. Three [[Festschrift]]en have been published in his honour.

His father left the family when McMahon was still a baby and took his elder son Rod with him, therefore McMahon did not meet him until age twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/mcmahon-vince.html|title=Vince McMahon Biography|publisher=SLAM!

== Business career ==
=== World Wide Wrestling Federation (1969–1979) ===
McMahon first met the promoter for [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] (CWC), his father [[Vincent J. McMahon]], at the age of 12. At that point, McMahon became interested in following his father's professional wrestling footsteps and often accompanied him on trips to [[Madison Square Garden]]. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler, but his father did not let him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;

In 1968, McMahon graduated from [[East Carolina University]]&lt;ref name="Roderick"/&gt; with a business degree and after a nondescript career as a traveling salesman, he was eager to assume a managerial role in his father’s [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] promotion (although the elder McMahon was not thrilled with the idea of his son entering the business).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hur|first1=Michael|title=Wrestling and The New World Order|date=2015|location=lulu.com|isbn=978-1329330443|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, McMahon made his debut as an in-ring announcer for the WWWF's ''[[List of former WWE programming#All-Star Wrestling (1974–1986)|All-Star Wrestling]]''.&lt;ref name="McMahonFamily"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaelberer|first=Angie Peterson |title=The McMahons: Vince McMahon and Family |publisher=Capstone Press|year=2003|page=15|isbn=0-7368-2143-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he was assigned to a small territory in Maine, where he promoted his first card. He later became the play-by-play commentator for television matches after he replaced Ray Morgan in 1971, a role he regularly maintained until November 1997.

Throughout the 1970s, McMahon became the prominent force in his father's company and, over the next decade, assisted his father in tripling TV syndication.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPCGDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=inoki%20vs%20ali%20vince%20mcmahon%20jr&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FTaXQPN3L8&amp;sig=FApa6eTlPxfy2djRuwfTTnKTz6I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi947_2kcfOAhXHBcAKHbK4DLMQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=inoki%20vs%20ali%20vince%20mcmahon%20jr&amp;f=false|title=Ali vs. Inoki: The Forgotten Fight That Inspired Mixed Martial Arts and Launched Sports Entertainment|first=Josh|last=Gross|date=June 9, 2016|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed for the renaming of the company to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The younger McMahon was also behind the [[Muhammad Ali]] versus [[Antonio Inoki]] match of 1976.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In 1979, the younger McMahon and his wife [[Linda McMahon|Linda]] founded their own company, [[WWE#Titan Sports|Titan Sports]], which was incorporated in the following year&lt;ref name="WWEBoard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/governance/board.jsp |title=WWE Board of Directors |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=September 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924084351/http://corporate.wwe.com/governance/board.jsp |archivedate=September 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1982 - when McMahon was aged 37 - acquired control of the Capitol Wrestling Co. from his ailing father (who died in May 1984).

=== World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE ===
==== 1980s wrestling boom ====
{{main article|1980s professional wrestling boom}}
On  February 21, 1980, McMahon officially founded Titan Sports, and the company's headquarters were established in [[South Yarmouth, Massachusetts]], using the now defunct [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] as a home base for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ctnews.com/politicalcapitol/2010/09/30/a-few-loose-ends-from-the-mcmahon-bankruptcy-story/|title=A few loose ends from the McMahon bankruptcy story|date=October 1, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his purchase of the WWF, professional wrestling was a business run by regional promotions. The various promoters shared an understanding that they would not invade each other’s territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinitecore.ca/superstar/index.php?threadid=68183|title=KM : Reading Topic :  WWF NATIONAL EXPANSION|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become. In 1983, the WWF split from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] a second time, after initially splitting from them in 1963 before rejoining them in 1971. The NWA was the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan.

He began expanding the company nationally by promoting in areas outside of the company's Northeast U.S. stomping grounds and by signing talent from other companies, such as the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA). In 1984, he recruited [[Hulk Hogan]] to be the WWF’s charismatic new megastar, and the two quickly drew the ire of industry peers as the promotion began traveling and broadcasting into rival territories. Nevertheless, McMahon (who still also fronted as the WWF’s squeaky clean babyface announcer) created ''[[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'' by incorporating pop music stars into wrestling storylines. As a result, the WWF was able to expand its fanbase into a national mainstream audience as the promotion was featured heavily on MTV programming. On March 31, 1985, he ran [[WrestleMania I|the first WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], available on [[closed circuit television]] in various markets throughout the U.S.

During the late 1980s, McMahon shaped the WWF into a unique sports entertainment brand that reached out to family audiences while attracting fans who had never before paid attention to pro wrestling. By directing his storylines towards highly publicized supercards, McMahon capitalized on a fledgling revenue stream by promoting these events live on PPV television. In 1987, the WWF reportedly drew 93,173 fans to the [[Silverdome|Pontiac Silverdome]] (which was called the "biggest crowd in sports entertainment history") for [[WrestleMania III]], which featured the main event of Hulk Hogan versus [[André the Giant]].&lt;ref name="corporatebio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/bios/vk_mcmahon.jsp |title=Vince McMahon's biography |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |publisher=WWE Corporate |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215125621/http://corporate.wwe.com/company/bios/vk_mcmahon.jsp |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attitude Era ====
{{main article|The Attitude Era}}
After struggling against [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), McMahon cemented the WWF as the preeminent wrestling promotion in the late 1990s, when he initiated a new brand strategy that eventually returned the WWF to prominence. Sensing a public shift towards a more hardened and cynical fan base, McMahon redirected storylines towards a more adult-oriented model. The concept became known as "WWF Attitude", and McMahon commenced the new era when he manipulated the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] away from [[Bret Hart]] at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in what is now known as the "[[Montreal Screwjob]]."&lt;ref name="Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1997/mainevent/|title=Survivor Series 1997 main event (Montreal Screwjob)|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon, who for years had downplayed his ownership of the company and was mostly known as a commentator, became involved in WWF storylines as the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|evil]] Mr. McMahon, who began a legendary feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who challenged the boss’s authority. As a result, the WWF suddenly found itself back in the midst of national pop-culture, drawing millions of viewers for its weekly ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' broadcasts, which ranked among the highest-rated shows on cable television.&lt;ref name="corporatebio"/&gt;

In October 1999, McMahon led the WWF in an [[initial public offering]] of company stock.  McMahon acquired the fading WCW from [[Turner Broadcasting System]] on March 23, 2001, bringing an end to the [[Monday Night Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= WWF buys rival WCW |url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/03/23/deals/wwf/|accessdate=March 12, 2016|publisher=CNN Money|date=March 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 1, 2001, [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] filed for bankruptcy, leaving WWF as the last major wrestling promotion at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ringside: A History of Professional Wrestling in America|last=Beekman|first=Scott|page=139|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=978-0275984014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other business dealings ===
[[File:Ron Killings &amp; Vince McMahon laughing.jpg|thumb|McMahon sharing a joke with [[Ron Killings]] at the 2008 ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops|Tribute to the Troops]]'' event]]
In 1979, Vince and Linda purchased the [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] and the [[Cape Cod Buccaneers]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Hockey League (1981–87)|Atlantic Coast Hockey League]]. In addition to pro wrestling and hockey, they began selling out rock concerts, including [[Van Halen]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]], in non-summer months, traditionally considered unprofitable due to lack of tourists. This venture led the McMahons to join the International Association of Arena Managers, learning the details of the arena business and networking with other managers through IAAM conferences, which Linda later called a "great benefit" to WWE's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin |date=2013 |title=WWE 50 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, McMahon founded the [[World Bodybuilding Federation]] a bodybuilding organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dilbert|first=Ryan|title=Vince McMahon's Failed Attempt to Take over Bodybuilding|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2542941-vince-mcmahons-failed-attempt-to-take-over-bodybuilding|publisher=Salon.com|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, McMahon again ventured outside the world of professional wrestling by launching the [[XFL]], a professional [[American football]] league. The league began in February 2001, with McMahon making an appearance at the first game. However, the XFL quickly folded after one season due to low television ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boehlert|first=Eric|title=Why the XFL tanked|url=http://entertainment.salon.com/2001/05/11/xfl_demise/|publisher=Salon.com|date=May 11, 2001|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, McMahon helped launch an [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] streaming service known as [[WWE Network]].

In 2017, McMahon established and personally funded a separate entity from WWE, Alpha Entertainment. McMahon streamed a major announcement live regarding the new company on Jan 25th, 2018 at 3pm ET/2pm CT. During the live stream, McMahon announced the resurrection of the [[XFL (2020)|XFL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alpha Entertainment LLC|url=https://www.alphaentllc.com/#vince|publisher=Alphaentllc.com|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commentator (1971–1997) ====
Prior to the evolution of the Mr. McMahon character, McMahon was primarily seen as an [[Sports commentator|commentator]] on television, with his behind-the-scenes involvement generally kept off TV for [[kayfabe]]-based reasons. While he did publicly identify himself as the owner of the WWF outside of WWF programming, on TV his ownership of the WWF was considered an [[open secret]] through the mid-1990s. Jack Tunney was portrayed as the president of WWF instead of him.

McMahon made his commentary debut in 1971 when he replaced Ray Morgan after Morgan had a pay dispute with McMahon's father, [[Vincent J. McMahon]], shortly before a scheduled TV taping. The elder McMahon let Morgan walk instead of giving into his demands and needed a replacement on the spot, offering it to his son. For the younger McMahon, it was also somewhat of a compromise, as it allowed him to appear on television. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler but his father did not let him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;''McMahon'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

McMahon eventually became the regular play-by-play commentator and maintained that role until November 1997, portraying himself as easily  excited and over-the-top. In addition to matches, McMahon also hosted other WWF shows, and introduced WWF programming to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on [[Black Saturday (wrestling)|Black Saturday]], upon the WWF's acquisition of [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] and its lucrative [[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday night timeslot]] (McMahon sold the timeslot to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] after the move backfired on him and he eventually acquired JCP's successor company, [[World Championship Wrestling]], from [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] in 2001). At the [[Slammy Award|1987 Slammy Awards]], McMahon performed in a musical number and sang the song "Stand Back".&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2008/12/07/7661906.html|title=Bringing back Slammy Awards – a good, bad idea|author=Bishop, Matt and Matt Mackinder|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=December 9, 2008|date=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Camp (style)|campy]] "Stand Back" video has since resurfaced several times over the years as a [[running gag]] between McMahon and any [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] wrestler he is feuding with at that particular time, and was included on the 2006 ''McMahon'' DVD.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;

As with most play-by-play commentators, McMahon was a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] "voice of the fans", in contrast to the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[color commentator]], usually [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Bobby Heenan]] or [[Jerry Lawler]]. While most of McMahon's on-screen physicality took place during his "Mr. McMahon" character later in his career, he was involved in physical altercations on WWF television only a few times as a commentator or host; in 1985, when [[Andre the Giant]] grabbed him by the collar during an interview on ''[[Tuesday Night Titans]]'' (Andre had become irritated at McMahon's questions regarding his feud with [[Big John Studd]] and their match at [[WrestleMania I|the first WrestleMania]]); on the September 28, 1991 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'', when [[Roddy Piper]] mistakenly hit him with a folding chair aimed at [[Ric Flair]] (requiring McMahon to be taken out of the arena on a [[stretcher]]), and again on the November 8, 1993 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', when [[Randy Savage]] hurled him to the floor in an attempt to attack [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]] after McMahon attempted to restrain him. McMahon can also be seen screaming at medics and WWF personnel during the May 26, 1990 episode of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'' (after Hulk Hogan was attacked by [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] during a segment of ''The Brother Love Show''), when Hogan was not moved out of the arena quickly enough.

===== United States Wrestling Association (1993) =====
While the Mr. McMahon character marked the first time that McMahon had been portrayed as a villain in WWF, in 1993, McMahon was engaged in a feud with [[Jerry Lawler]] as part of a cross-promotion between the WWF and the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA). As part of the angle, McMahon sent various WWF wrestlers to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in order to dethrone Lawler as the "king of professional wrestling". This angle marked the first time that McMahon physically interjected himself into a match, as he occasionally tripped and punched at Lawler while seated ringside. During the angle, McMahon was not acknowledged as the owner of the WWF, and the feud was not acknowledged on WWF television, as the two continued to provide commentary together (along with [[Randy Savage]]) for the television show ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]''. The feud also helped build toward Lawler's match with [[Bret Hart]] at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1993/|title=SummerSlam 1993 official results|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak of the angle came with [[Tatanka (wrestler)|Tatanka]] defeating Lawler to win the [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship|USWA Championship]] with McMahon gloating at Lawler while wearing the championship belt.&lt;ref name="tatankabio"&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Chavis|url=http://www.nativetatanka.com/bio2.html|title=Tatanka's Biography (Page 2)|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=Native Tatanka |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071226140653/http://www.nativetatanka.com/bio2.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This storyline came to an abrupt end when Lawler was accused of raping a young girl in Memphis, and he was dropped from the WWF. He returned shortly afterward, however, as the girl later stated that the rape accusations were lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wrestleview.com/faq/?article=jerrylawler | title=Jerry Lawler – FAQ  | publisher=Wrestleview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Start of the Mr. McMahon character (1996–1997) ====
{{see also|Montreal Screwjob}}
Throughout late 1996 and into 1997, McMahon slowly began to be referred to as the owner on WWF television while remaining as the company's lead play-by-play commentator. On the September 23, 1996 ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', [[Jim Ross]] delivered a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Worked shoots|worked shoot]] promo during which he ran down McMahon, outing him as [[chairman]] and not just a commentator for the first time in WWF storylines. This was followed up on the October 23 ''Raw'' with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] referring to then-WWF President [[Gorilla Monsoon]] as "just a puppet" and that it was actually McMahon "pulling all the strings". The March 17, 1997 ''WWF Raw Is War'' is cited by some as the beginning of the Mr. McMahon character, as after [[Bret Hart]] lost to [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sycho Sid]] in a steel cage match for the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]], Hart engaged in an [[Profanity|expletive]]-laden rant against McMahon and WWF management. This rant followed Hart shoving McMahon to the ground when he attempted to conduct a post-match interview. McMahon, himself, returned to the commentary position and nearly cursed out Hart before being calmed down by Ross and Lawler.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt;

McMahon largely remained an commentator after the Bret Hart incident on ''Raw''. On September 22, 1997, on the first-ever ''Raw'' to be broadcast from [[Madison Square Garden]], Bret's brother [[Owen Hart]] was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Stone Cold Steve Austin entered the ring with five [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers following, and assaulted Hart. When it appeared Austin would fight the officers, McMahon ran into the ring to lecture him that he could not physically compete; at the time, Austin was recovering from a broken neck after Owen Hart [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] in his match against Austin at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]]. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested on charges of trespassing, assault, and assaulting a police officer. This marked the beginning of the Austin-McMahon rivalry.

At [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in 1997, [[Bret Hart]] defended his WWF Championship against long-time rival [[Shawn Michaels]] in the main event. During the match, Michaels applied Hart's own signature [[Professional wrestling holds|submission maneuver]] [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|The Sharpshooter]] on Hart. Though Hart did not submit, McMahon ordered the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] to ring the bell, thus [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|screwing]] Hart out of the title and making Michaels the champion and making McMahon turn [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the first time on WWF television. This incident was subsequently dubbed the "Montreal Screwjob".&lt;ref name="Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart" /&gt; Following the incident, McMahon left the commentary table for good ([[Jim Ross]] replaced McMahon as lead commentator) and the Mr. McMahon character began.

==== Feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin (1997–1999) ====
{{main article|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporate Ministry|l1=The Corporation}}In December 1997 on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', the night after [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], McMahon talked about the behavior and attitude of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], such as Austin having assaulted WWF Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter and commentators such as Jim Ross and McMahon himself. Mr. McMahon demanded that Austin defend his Intercontinental championship against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] in a rematch. As in the previous match, Austin used his pickup truck as a weapon against The Rock and the [[Nation of Domination]] gang. Austin decided to forfeit the title to The Rock, but instead Austin gave The Rock a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and knocked McMahon off the ring ropes.

On the January 19, 1998 episode of Raw Is War, McMahon called [[Mike Tyson]] to the ring for a major announcement. Before McMahon could make the announcement (that Tyson would serve as a ringside enforcer at [[Wrestlemania XIV]] for the WWE World title match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels) Austin interrupted and confronted Tyson culminating with Austin displaying his middle finger right in Tyson's face. Tyson shoved Austin at which point WWE security and Tyson's entourage intervened and separated both men. McMahon was incensed by Austin's actions screaming "YOU RUINED IT" and had to be held back from attacking Austin himself. 

On the March 2 edition of Raw Is War, Mike Tyson joined [[D-Generation X]], led by WWE World Champion Shawn Michaels. A week later, Austin called out McMahon incensed by Tyson's alignment with Michaels. Austin verbally abused McMahon and attempted to provoke a clearly agitated McMahon into hitting him (Austin) but McMahon left. On the following episode of Raw Is War, McMahon claimed he hadn't hit Austin on the previous episode of Raw as he didn't want to ruin the Wrestlemania XIV main event. Asked to explain what this meant, McMahon stated Austin would be unable to compete with a broken jaw. After initial attempts to dodge the question of whether he wanted Austin to become WWF Champion, McMahon finally answered with "it's not just a "no", it's a OH HELL NO" mimicking Austin's "hell yeah" catchphrase. McMahon didn't get involved during the Wrestlemania XIV main event during which Mike Tyson turned on Shawn Michaels and assisted Austin in becoming WWE Champion. 

On the March 30 ''Raw Is War'', the night after Austin won the WWF title at WrestleMania XIV, McMahon presented him with a new title belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature. Austin responded by delivering the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to McMahon for the second time. On the April 13 episode of Raw Is War, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] interfered. This marked the first time since June 10, 1996 that [[Monday Night Wars|''Raw'' beat WCW's ''Nitro'' in the ratings]]. This led to a title match between Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]], for which McMahon sat ringside and attempted to assist Love in winning the match. Love ultimately did win by disqualification when Austin hit McMahon with a chair. Austin retained the title which couldn't change hands by disqualification under regular match rules. In a title rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]], Austin again retained, despite McMahon being the referee and his "Corporate Stooges", [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. While McMahon was incapacitated by an accidental Love chair shot, Austin delivered the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to Love and used McMahon's hand to count his pinfall victory.

In the fall of 1998, McMahon said he was "damn sick and tired" of seeing Stone Cold Steve Austin as the WWF Champion and developed a "master plan" to remove the championship from Austin. By employing the services of [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]], McMahon set up a triple threat match for the WWF championship at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], in which Undertaker and Kane could only win by pinning Austin. At Breakdown, Austin lost the title after being pinned simultaneously by both Undertaker and Kane. However, no new champion was crowned. The following night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', McMahon attempted to announce a new WWF Champion. He held a presentation ceremony, and introduced The Undertaker and Kane. After saying that both deserved to be the WWF Champion, Austin drove a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] into the arena, and attacked McMahon before police officers  stopped him, and arrested him. Because The Undertaker and Kane both failed to defend McMahon from Austin, McMahon did not name a new champion, but instead made a match at [[WWE Judgment Day#1998|Judgment Day]] between The Undertaker and Kane with Austin as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special referee]]. This prompted The Undertaker and Kane to attack Mr. McMahon, injuring his ankle because he gave them the [[Finger (gesture)|finger]] behind their backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980928.html|title=WWF RAW is WAR 28.9.98|first=Christopher|last=Zimmerman|publisher=Slash Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Judgement Day, there was still no champion crowned as Austin declared himself the winner after counting a double pinfall three count for both men. McMahon ordered the WWF Championship to be defended in a [[Professional wrestling tournament|14-man tournament]] named [[Survivor Series (1998)#Tournaments bracket|Deadly Games]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]] in 1998. McMahon made sure that [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] reached the finals because Mankind had visited McMahon in hospital after McMahon was sent to the hospital by the [[The Brothers of Destruction|Undertaker and Kane]].&lt;ref name="Survivor Series - The Rock vs Mankind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1998/1998/|title=Survivor Series 1998 main event|accessdate=January 15, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also awarded Mankind the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]] due to his status as a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore wrestling legend]]. Originally, McMahon was acting as he if he was helping out Mankind during the match. At one point, The Rock turned his attention to McMahon. McMahon [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on Mankind after a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|screwjob]], however, as The Rock had caught Mankind in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]]. Mankind had not submitted but McMahon ordered the referee to ring the bell, thus giving The Rock the WWF Championship. This was an homage to the "[[Montreal Screwjob]]" that occurred one year earlier.&lt;ref name="Survivor Series - The Rock vs Mankind"/&gt; McMahon referred to The Rock as the "Corporate Champion" thus forming the Corporation with his son [[Shane McMahon|Shane]] and The Rock.&lt;ref name="corporation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/corporation.html|title=Corporation Profile|accessdate=January 15, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Mankind defeated The Rock to win the WWF Championship after The Rock passed out to the [[Professional wrestling holds#Mandible claw|Mandible Claw]]. McMahon, however, screwed Mankind once again by reversing the decision and returning the belt to his chosen champion, The Rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1990s.html#26|title=Rock Bottom results|accessdate=January 15, 2008|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon participated in a "Corporate Rumble" on the January 11, 1999 ''Raw'' as an unscheduled participant, but was eliminated by [[Chyna]].

McMahon restarted a long-running feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when, in December 1998, he made Austin face the Undertaker in a Buried Alive match with the Royal Rumble qualification on the line. Austin defeated the Undertaker with help from Kane. McMahon had put up $100,000 to anyone who could eliminate Austin from the Royal Rumble match.&lt;ref name="Royal Rumble - 1999 Rumble match"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/mainevent/|title=1999 Royal Rumble match|accessdate=January 15, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]], thanks to help from the Corporation's attack on Austin in the women's bathroom during the match (Austin and McMahon went under the ropes, not over them as the Royal Rumble rules require for an elimination to occur along with the 'Shawn Michaels Rule', in which both feet must touch the floor after going over the top rope) and The Rock distracting Austin, McMahon lifted Austin over the top rope from behind, thus winning the match and earning a title shot at [[WrestleMania XV]] against the WWF Champion The Rock. He turned down his spot, however, and WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels awarded it to Austin, which infuriated McMahon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher |last=Zimmerman |url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1999/raw012599 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209100552/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1999%2Fraw012599 |archivedate=February 9, 2008 |title=RAW is WAR recap |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=January 25, 1999 |publisher=The Other Arena |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin decided to put his title shot on the line against McMahon so he could get a chance to fight Vince at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|In Your House: St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]]. During the match, [[Big Show]] — a future member of the Corporation — interrupted, making his WWF debut. He threw Austin through the side of the cage thus giving him the victory.&lt;ref name="corporation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/stvalentinesdaymassacre.html|title=St. Valentine's Day Massacre results|accessdate=January 15, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Corporation started a feud with [[The Undertaker]]'s new faction the "[[Ministry of Darkness]]", which led to a storyline introducing McMahon's daughter [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]]. Stephanie played an "innocent sweet girl" who was kidnapped by The Ministry twice. The first time she was kidnapped, she was found by [[Ken Shamrock]] on behalf of McMahon in a basement of the stadium. The second time she was kidnapped, The Undertaker attempted to marry her whilst she was forcefully tied to the Ministry's crucifix, but she was saved by Steve Austin. This angle saw a brief friendship develop between McMahon and Austin, cooling their long running feud. McMahon became a member of the short-lived stable [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]], during May 1999. McMahon's son Shane merged the Corporation with Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness to form the [[Corporate Ministry]]. On the June 7 episode of ''Raw Is War'', McMahon was revealed as the "Higher Power" behind the Corporate Ministry. This not only reignited McMahon's feud with WWF Champion Austin but also caused a [[kayfabe]] disgusted [[Linda McMahon|Linda]] and Stephanie McMahon to give their 50% share of the WWF to Austin.

At [[King of the Ring (1999)|King of the Ring]], Vince and Shane defeated Austin in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap]] [[ladder match]] to regain control of the WWF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html#1999|title=King of the Ring 1999 results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CEO, Austin had scheduled a WWF Championship match, to be shown on ''Raw Is War'' after King Of The Ring. During the match, Austin defeated the Undertaker once again to become the WWF Champion. At [[Fully Loaded (1999)|Fully Loaded]], Austin was again scheduled for a match against The Undertaker. If Austin lost, he would be banned from wrestling for the WWF Championship again; if he won, Vince McMahon would be banned from appearing on WWF TV. Austin defeated The Undertaker, and McMahon was banned from WWF TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/loaded.html#99|title=Fully Loaded 1999 results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMahon returned as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] in the fall of 1999 and won the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] in a match against [[Triple H]], thanks to outside interference from Austin on the September 16 ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]''. He had decided to vacate the title during the following Monday's ''Raw Is War'', because he was not allowed on WWF TV because of the stipulations of the Fully Loaded 1999 contract he signed. However, Stone Cold Steve Austin reinstated him in return for a WWF title shot. Over the next few months McMahon and Triple H feuded, with the linchpin of the feud being Triple H's storyline marriage to Stephanie McMahon. The feud culminated at [[Armageddon (1999)|Armageddon]] in 1999; McMahon faced Triple H in a [[Hardcore wrestling|No Holds Barred match]] which McMahon lost. Afterward, Stephanie turned on him, revealing her true colors. McMahon, along with his son Shane, then disappeared from WWF television, unable to accept the union between Triple H and Stephanie. This left Triple H and Stephanie in complete control of the WWF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/1999/results/ |title=Armageddon 1999 official results |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319104738/http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/1999/results/ |archivedate=March 19, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== McMahon-Helmsley Era (2000–2001) ====
{{main article|McMahon-Helmsley Faction}}
McMahon returned to WWF television on the March 13, 2000 ''Raw Is War'' helping [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] win his WWF title shot back from the Big Show. He also attacked Shane McMahon and [[Triple H]].&lt;ref name="raw2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/2000.html|title=RAW is WAR results, 2000|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, McMahon and The Rock defeated [[Shane McMahon]] and The [[Big Show]] in a tag team match with help from special guest referee [[Mick Foley|Mankind]].&lt;ref name="raw2000"/&gt; At [[WrestleMania 2000]], Triple H defended the WWF Championship in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal Four-Way Elimination match]] in which each competitor had a McMahon in his corner. Triple H had his wife Stephanie McMahon who was also the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWF Women's Champion]] in his corner, The Rock had Vince McMahon in his corner, Mick Foley had Linda McMahon in his corner, and Big Show had Shane in his corner. After Big Show and Foley were eliminated, Triple H and The Rock were left. Although Vince was in The Rock's corner, he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on The Rock after [[Professional wrestling attacks#Chair shot|hitting him with a chair]], turning heel for the first time since his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin, which helped Triple H win the match and retain his title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm16/mainevent/ |title=WrestleMania 2000 main event |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221171738/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm16/mainevent/ |archivedate=February 21, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This began the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction|McMahon-Helmsley Era]].

[[File:Vince kotr 2000.jpg|thumb|McMahon after losing his match at [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] in June 2000]]
At [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]], McMahon, Shane, and WWF Champion Triple H took on [[The Brothers of Destruction]] ([[The Undertaker]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]) and The Rock in a six-man tag team match for the WWF Championship. The stipulation of this match was that whoever made the scoring pinfall would become the WWF Champion. McMahon was pinned by The Rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html#2000|title=King of the Ring 2000 results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon was then absent from WWF television until late 2000. On the December 4 episode of ''Raw Is War'', McMahon questioned the motives of WWF Commissioner Mick Foley and expressed concern of the well being of the six superstars competing in the Hell in a Cell match at [[Armageddon (2000)|Armageddon]]. On the December 18 episode of ''Raw Is War'', McMahon faced [[Kurt Angle]] in a non-title match which was fought to no contest when Mick Foley interfered and attacked both men. After the match, both men beat Foley and McMahon fired him.&lt;ref name="raw2000"/&gt;

McMahon then began a public [[kayfabe|extramarital affair]] with [[Trish Stratus]], much to the disgust of his daughter, Stephanie. However, on the February 26 episode of ''Raw'', McMahon and Stephanie humiliated Trish by dumping sewage on her, with McMahon adding that Stephanie will always be "daddy's little girl" and Trish was only "daddy's little toy". McMahon and Stephanie then aligned together against Shane, who'd returned and had enough of Vince's actions in recent months. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], McMahon lost to Shane after Linda—who had been [[Psychological abuse|emotionally abused]] to the point of a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]; the breakdown was caused after Vince demanded a divorce on the December 7 episode of ''SmackDown!''; the breakdown left her helpless as she was deemed unable to continue being CEO of the WWF at the time, giving Vince 100% authority; finally, she was heavily sedated, in the storyline—hit Vince with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Low blow|low blow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm17/results/ |title=WrestleMania XVII official results |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119085101/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm17/results/ |archivedate=November 19, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=9Khz-5HDsiQ#t=03m36s|title=Mcmahon vs Mcmahon – WrestleMania 17 Match Recap MV}}. Retrieved April 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same night, McMahon formed an alliance with Stone Cold Steve Austin, helping him defeat The Rock to gain another WWF Championship. The two, along with Triple H, formed an alliance. Austin and Triple H put The Rock out of action with a brutal assault and suspension; this was done so The Rock could film ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. Austin and Triple H held all three major WWF titles at the same time. The alliance was short lived, due to an injury to Triple H and a business venture by McMahon.

==== The Invasion and brand extension (2001–2005) ====

McMahon purchased long-time rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in March 2001 from [[AOL]] [[Time Warner]] and signed many wrestlers from the organization. This marked the beginning of the Invasion storyline, in which the former WCW wrestlers regularly fought matches against the WWF wrestlers. On the July 9, 2001 episode of ''Raw Is War'', some [[List of Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni|extremists]] as well as several former ECW wrestlers on the WWF roster, joined with the WCW wrestlers to form [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] joined the Alliance, along with [[Shane McMahon|Shane]] and [[Stephanie McMahon]]. Vince McMahon led Team WWF. At [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]], Team WWF defeated Team Alliance in a Survivor Series elimination match to pick up the victory for WWF and end the Invasion storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/mainevent/ |title=Survivor Series 2001 main event |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326173627/http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/mainevent/ |archivedate=March 26, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the collapse of The Alliance, McMahon created the "Vince McMahon Kiss My Ass Club", also known as the "Mr. McMahon Kiss My Ass Club", which consisted of various WWE individuals being ordered to kiss his buttocks in the middle of the ring, usually with the threat of suspension or firing if they refused. The club was originally proclaimed closed by [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] after McMahon was forced to kiss [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]]'s buttocks on an episode of ''SmackDown!''.&lt;ref name=assclub02540&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/011206.html|title=WWE SmackDown!

In November 2001, [[Ric Flair]] returned to WWF after an eight-year hiatus declaring himself the co-owner of the WWF, which infuriated McMahon. The two faced each other in January 2002, at [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]], in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Street Fight|Street Fight]] which Flair won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811413/results/|title=Royal Rumble 2002 official results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their status as co-owners, McMahon became the owner of ''SmackDown!'' while Flair became the owner of ''Raw''. However, on the June 10 ''Raw'', McMahon defeated Flair to end the rivalry and become the sole owner of WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020610.html|title=RAW results – June&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;2002|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On the February 13, 2003 ''SmackDown!'', McMahon tried to derail the return of [[Hulk Hogan]] after a five-month hiatus but was knocked out by Hogan and received a [[Leg drop#Running leg drop|running leg drop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030213.html|title=SmackDown! results – February&amp;nbsp;13,&amp;nbsp;2003|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]], McMahon interfered in Hogan's match with The Rock. Hogan had originally won the match as he hit The Rock with a running leg drop, but the lights went out. When the lights came back on, McMahon came to the ringside to distract Hogan. [[Sylvain Grenier]], the referee, gave The Rock a chair, which he then hit Hogan with. He ended the match with a [[Powerslam#Side slam|Rock Bottom]] to defeat Hogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/ |title=No Way Out 2003 main event |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219180229/http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/ |archivedate=February 19, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to McMahon facing Hogan in a match at [[WrestleMania XIX]], which McMahon lost in a Street Fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/results/|title=WrestleMania XIX official results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon then banned Hogan from the ring but Hogan returned under the [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] of "Mr. America". McMahon tried to prove that Mr. America was Hogan under a mask but failed at these attempts. Hogan later quit WWE and at which point McMahon claimed that he had discovered Mr. America was Hulk Hogan and "fired" him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030703.html|title=SmackDown! results – July&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;2003|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
McMahon asked his daughter Stephanie to resign as SmackDown! [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|General Manager]] on the October 2 ''SmackDown!''. Stephanie, however, refused to resign and this set up an [["I Quit" match]] between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/031002.html|title=SmackDown! results – October&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;2003|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[No Mercy (2003)|No Mercy]], McMahon defeated Stephanie in an "I Quit" match when Linda threw in the towel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/2003/results|title=No Mercy 2003 Full Event Results|accessdate=August 22, 2015|publisher=[[WWE]].com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that night, he helped [[Brock Lesnar]] retain the WWE Championship against The Undertaker in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Biker Chain match]].&lt;ref name="No Mercy - Lesnar vs Taker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2003/mainevent/|title=No Mercy 2003 main event|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; This started a rivalry between McMahon and Undertaker.

==== Feud with D-Generation X, Donald Trump and Bobby Lashley (2005–2007) ====
He began a feud with [[Eric Bischoff]] in late 2005, when he decided that Bischoff was not doing a good job as General Manager of ''Raw''. He started "The Trial of Eric Bischoff" where McMahon served as the judge. Bischoff ended up losing the trial; McMahon "fired" him, and put him in a garbage truck before it drove away. Bischoff stayed gone for months. Almost a year later on ''Raw'' in late 2006, Bischoff was brought out by McMahon's executive assistant [[Jonathan Coachman]] so that he could announce the completion of his book ''[[Controversy Creates Cash]]''. Bischoff began [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Examples of "worked shoots"|blasting remarks]] at McMahon, saying that he was fired "unceremoniously" as the ''Raw'' General Manager, that there would be no McMahon if not for Bischoff's over-the-top rebellious ideas, and that [[D-Generation X]] was nothing but a rip off of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]].[[File:Mrmcmahon092407.jpg|thumb|upright|left|McMahon during a ''Raw'' episode in 2007]]
On the December 26, 2005 ''Raw'', Vince personally reviewed [[Bret "Hit Man" Hart: The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be|Bret Hart's DVD]]. [[Shawn Michaels]] came out and he also started talking about Hart. McMahon replied, "I screwed Bret Hart. Shawn, don't make me screw you".&lt;ref name="Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12262005/|title=Advantage Kane|accessdate=January 15, 2008|date=December 26, 2005|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2006 [[Royal Rumble (2006)|Royal Rumble]], when Michaels was among the final six remaining participants after eliminating [[Shelton Benjamin]], McMahon's entrance theme music distracted Michaels, allowing [[Shane McMahon]] to eliminate him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble06.html|title=Royal Rumble 2006 results|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 27 ''Raw'', Michaels was knocked unconscious by Shane. When Michaels' former [[The Rockers|Rockers]] tag team partner [[Marty Jannetty]] came to the rescue of Michaels, he was forced to join McMahon's "Kiss My Ass Club".&lt;ref name="jannettymichaels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02272006/|title=Joining the Club|accessdate=February 27, 2006|publisher=WWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII|March 18 edition]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', Michaels faced Shane in a Street Fight. McMahon screwed Michaels while Shane had Michaels in the Sharpshooter.

On the May 15 ''Raw'', [[Triple H]] hit Shane with a [[sledgehammer]] meant for Michaels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Louie|last=Dee|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05152006/|title=Money Shot|accessdate=January 17, 2008|date=May 15, 2006|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next week on ''Raw'', Triple H had another chance to hit Michaels with the object but he instead whacked the Spirit Squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Louie|last=Dee|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05222006/|title=Apology Accepted?|accessdate=January 17, 2008|date=May 22, 2006|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a few weeks, McMahon ignored Michaels and began a rivalry with Triple H by forcing him to join "Kiss My Ass Club" (Triple H hit McMahon with a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] instead of joining the club) and pitting him in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Gauntlet match|gauntlet handicap match]] against the Spirit Squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Louie|last=Dee|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/06052006/|title=Kiss this|accessdate=January 17, 2008|date=June 5, 2006|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAW - HHH vs Spirit Squad"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed|last=Williams III|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/06122006/|title=An extreme awakening makes Cena snap|accessdate=January 17, 2008|date=June 12, 2006|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels, however, saved Triple H and the two reformed [[D-Generation X]] (DX).

In January 2007, McMahon started a feud with [[Donald Trump]], which was featured on major media outlets. Originally Trump wanted to fight McMahon himself but they came to a deal: both men would pick a representative to wrestle at [[WrestleMania 23]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair vs. Hair match]]. The man whose wrestler lost would have his head shaved bald. After the contract signing on ''Raw'', Trump pushed McMahon over the table in the ring onto his head after McMahon provoked Trump with several finger pokes to the shoulders. Later at a press conference, McMahon, during a photo opportunity, offered to shake hands with Trump but retracted his hand as Trump put out his. McMahon went on to fiddle with Trump's tie and flick Trump's nose. This angered Trump as he then slapped McMahon across the face. McMahon was then restrained from retaliating by Trump's bodyguards and [[Bobby Lashley]], Trump's representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania23/exclusives/pressconference|title=Billion-dollar breakdown at Trump Tower|author=Louie Dee|accessdate=March 28, 2007|publisher=WWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At WrestleMania 23, McMahon's representative ([[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]]) lost the match.&lt;ref name="WrestleMania 23 - Lashley vs Umaga"&gt;{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Tello|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania23/matches/39161842/results/|title=The 'mane' event|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, McMahon's hair was shaved bald by Trump and Lashley with the help of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], who was the special guest referee of the "Battle of the Billionaires" match.&lt;ref name="WrestleMania 23 - Lashley vs Umaga"/&gt;

McMahon then began a rivalry with Lashley over his [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Championship]]. At [[Backlash (2007)|Backlash]], McMahon pinned Lashley in a 3-on-1 [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] teaming up with his son [[Shane McMahon|Shane]] and [[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]] to win the ECW Championship.&lt;ref name="Backlash - Team McMahon vs Lashley"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Robinson|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/2007/matches/396065214/results/ |title=Hell freezes over in ECW|accessdate=January 17, 2008|date=April 29, 2007|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/history/ecwchampionship/042907mcmahon|title=Mr. McMahon's first ECW Championship reign|accessdate=January 18, 2008|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Judgment Day (2007)|Judgment Day]], McMahon defended his ECW Championship against Lashley again in a 3-on-1 handicap match.

==== Faked death, illegitimate son and Million Dollar Mania (2007–2008) ====
[[File:Flickr - simononly - WWE Fan Axxess - Vince's Limo.jpg|thumb|The exploded limousine at [[WrestleMania Axxess]]]]
On June 11, 2007, WWE aired a segment at the end of ''Raw'' that featured McMahon entering a limousine moments before it exploded. The show went off-air shortly after, and WWE.com reported the [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] within minutes as though it were a legitimate occurrence, proclaiming that McMahon was "presumed dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/mcmahonexplosionupdate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621115331/http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/mcmahonexplosionupdate|archivedate=June 21, 2007|title=McMahon Explosion Update|publisher=WWE|date=June 11, 2007|accessdate=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was the fate of the fictional "Mr. McMahon" character, no harm came to the actual person; the "presumed death" of McMahon was part of a storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/news/breakingnews/20070612_12wwe_breaking.html|title=Vince McMahon’s hoax goes up in smoke|author=Rory Sweeney|publisher=Timesleader.com|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=June 26, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623150701/http://www.timesleader.com/news/breakingnews/20070612_12wwe_breaking.html|archivedate=June 23, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE later acknowledged to [[CNBC]] that he was not truly dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/19330600|title=WWE's McMahon "Death": I'm A Murder Suspect|author=Darren Rovell|publisher=CNBC.com|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=June 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The June 25 ''Raw'' was scheduled to be a three-hour memorial to "Mr. McMahon". However, due to the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|actual]] death of [[Chris Benoit]], the show opened with McMahon standing in an empty arena, acknowledging that his reported death was only of his character as part of a storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usbenoit0626,0,4246396.story?coll=ny-top-headlines |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705113805/http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usbenoit0626%2C0%2C4246396.story?coll=ny-top-headlines |archivedate=July 5, 2007 |title=WWE wrestler Chris Benoit and family found dead |author=Alfonso A.

On the August 6 show, McMahon said that he faked his death to see what people really thought of him, with Stephanie accused of faking mourning while checking her father's last will and testament to see how it would benefit her.

The "Mr. McMahon" character officially returned on the August 6 ''Monday Night Raw''. He talked about many subjects, including an investigation by the [[United States Congress]] and owing money to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. McMahon also declared a battle royal to determine a new ''Raw'' General Manager, which was won by [[William Regal]]. At the end of ''Raw'', [[Jonathan Coachman]] informed McMahon of a ([[kayfabe|storyline]]) paternity suit regarding an illegitimate long-lost child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070806.html|title=RAW results – August&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;2007|accessdate=September 12, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was revealed in the following weeks as being a male member of the WWE roster. On the September 3 ''Raw'', McMahon appeared and was confronted by his family. They were interrupted by [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Mr. Kennedy]], who claimed to be McMahon's "illegitimate son". He was himself interrupted by a lawyer claiming Kennedy was not McMahon's son and that the real son would be revealed the next week on ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070903.html|title=RAW results – September&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;2007|accessdate=September 12, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; His illegitimate son was finally revealed on September 10 on ''Raw'' as [[Hornswoggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070910.html|title=RAW results – September&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;2007|accessdate=September 12, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, after months of "tough love" antics towards Hornswoggle, [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] revealed that Hornswoggle was not McMahon's son and that he was actually [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]]'s son. It turned out that the scam was thought up by Shane, Stephanie and Linda McMahon, along with Finlay.

[[File:Vince McMahon hof.jpg|thumb|McMahon at the Hall of Fame while introducing [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]]]
On the June 2 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that, starting the next week, he would give away US$1,000,000 live on ''Raw''. Fans could register online, and each week, randomly selected fans would receive a part of the $1,000,000. McMahon's Million Dollar Mania lasted just three weeks and was suspended after the 3-hour Draft episode of ''Raw'' on June 23. After giving away $500,000, explosions tore apart the ''Raw'' stage, which fell and collapsed on top of McMahon. On June 30, Shane addressed the WWE audience before ''Raw'', informing the fans that his family had chosen to keep his father’s condition private. In addition, he also urged the WWE roster to stand together during what he described as a "turbulent time". The McMahons made several requests to the wrestlers for solidarity, before finally appointing [[Mike Adamle]] as the new general manager of ''Raw'' in order to restore order to the brand.

==== Feud with The Legacy and Bret Hart (2009–2010) ====
On the January 5, 2009 ''Raw'', [[Chris Jericho]] told Stephanie McMahon that McMahon would be returning to ''Raw'' soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/01052009/|title=Big Night In The Big Easy|accessdate=January 5, 2009|publisher=WWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, Jericho was ([[kayfabe]]) fired from WWE by Stephanie. On the January 19 ''Raw'', McMahon returned, as a face, and supported his daughter's decision on Jericho, but Stephanie rehired him. [[Randy Orton]] then came out and assaulted McMahon after harassing Stephanie. McMahon returned on the March 30 ''Raw'' with his son, Shane, and son-in-law Triple H to confront Orton. The night after [[WrestleMania XXV]], McMahon appeared on ''Raw'' to announce Orton would not receive another championship opportunity at [[Backlash (2009)|Backlash]], but compete in a six-man tag team match with his [[The Legacy (professional wrestling)|Legacy]] stablemates against Triple H, Shane McMahon and himself. ''Raw'' General Manager [[Vickie Guerrero]] made the match for the WWE Championship. Orton then challenged McMahon to a match that night, in which Legacy assaulted him, and Orton also hitting him with the RKO. After being assisted by Triple H, Shane and a returning Batista, McMahon announced Batista would replace him in the match at Backlash. On the June 15 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that he had sold the ''Raw'' brand to businessman Donald Trump. The next week, during the ''Trump is Raw'' show, McMahon bought the brand back from Trump. On the June 29 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that every week, a celebrity guest host would control ''Raw'' for the night. He soon appeared on ''SmackDown'', putting [[Theodore Long]] on probation for his actions. On August 24 ''Raw'', McMahon had a birthday bash which was interrupted by The Legacy, and competed in a six-man tag team match with his long-time rival team [[D-Generation X|DX]], in which they won after the interference of [[John Cena]]. He continued to appear on ''SmackDown'', making occasional matches and reminding Long that he is still on probation. On the November 16 ''Raw'', McMahon was called out by guest host [[Roddy Piper]], who wanted a match with McMahon that night in [[Madison Square Garden]]. McMahon declined, and announced his retirement from in-ring competition.&lt;ref name="us.wwe.com"&gt;[http://us.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/]{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the January 4, 2010 ''Raw'', McMahon, once again a heel, confronted special guest host Bret "The Hitman" Hart for the (televised) first time since the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series 1997, with the intention of burying the hatchet from the above-mentioned Montreal Screwjob. The two appeared to finally bury the hatchet, but after shaking hands, Vince kicked Hart in the groin and left the arena to a loud chorus of boos and the crowd chanting "You screwed Bret! You screwed Bret!".&lt;ref name="us.wwe.com"/&gt; A match was then booked between the two at [[WrestleMania XXVI]], which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a No Holds Barred Lumberjack match. On the May 31 ''Raw'', McMahon returned to congratulate Hart on becoming the new Raw General Manager. On the June 22 ''Raw'', McMahon fired Hart for not dealing with ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'' season one rookies, known as [[Nexus (professional wrestling)|The Nexus]]. That same night, he announced the new General Manager would be anonymous and make decisions via emails, which would be read by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]. The General Manager's first decision was McMahon to be the guest referee for a WWE Championship match that night between John Cena and [[Sheamus]]. The match was interrupted by The Nexus who then attacked McMahon. McMahon appeared in a segment on the November 1 ''Raw'', in a coma from the attack by The Nexus. He woke up and his doctor ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) explained what had happened since he had been out. The scene transitioned to Stephanie McMahon waking up, revealing [[Dream sequence|it was all a dream]].

==== Sporadic appearances (2011–present) ====
In early 2011, McMahon once again stepped away from WWE story-lines in order to focus on both his corporate and backstage duties.

On the June 27 episode of ''Raw'', [[CM Punk]] made a scathing-on air speech criticizing WWE and McMahon about the way WWE was run.  McMahon suspended Punk, but reinstated him at the behest of Punk's [[Money in the Bank (2011)|Money in the Bank]] opponent, WWE Champion John Cena.  At the pay-per-view, McMahon and Vice President of Talent Relations [[John Laurinaitis]] interfered on Cena's behalf but Punk was ultimately successful and walked out of the company with the championship. On the following ''Raw'', Triple H returned and, on behalf of WWE's board of directors, fired McMahon from his position of running ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'', though leaving him chairman of the board. Triple H then announced he himself had been designated Chief Operating Officer of WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-07-18/mcmahon-relieved-of-duties|title=McMahon Released |accessdate=July 16, 2011|publisher=WWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon returned on the October 10 ''Raw'', firing Triple H from running ''Raw'', stating the board of directors had called Triple H a financial catastrophe, and that the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE employees]] had voted [[Motion of no confidence|no confidence]] in him the previous week. He subsequently appointed Laurinaitis as the interim general manager of ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-10-10/results|title=WWE Raw SuperShow results: The "Laurinaitis Era" begins|accessdate=October 12, 2011|publisher=WWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2012, McMahon returned to give a job evaluation to John Laurinaitis. After a conflict with Cena and Big Show that saw McMahon accidentally knocked out by Big Show, McMahon declared that if Big Show lost his match at [[No Way Out (2012)|No Way Out]], Laurinaitis would be fired. Cena defeated Big Show in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]], and McMahon fired Laurinaitis. McMahon announced [[AJ Lee|AJ]] as ''Raw''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s new general manager at ''[[WWE Raw 1000|Raw 1000]]'' and made  Booker T SmackDown's new general manager on August 3 episode of ''SmackDown''. After CM Punk interrupted him on the October 8 episode of ''Raw'', he challenged Punk to a match, threatening to fire him if he declined. The match did not officially start, but McMahon held his own in a brawl with Punk until Punk attempted the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Go to Sleep|GTS]]. Ryback and Cena interfered and McMahon ultimately booked Punk in a match with Ryback at  [[Hell in a Cell (2012)|Hell in a Cell]].

During the buildup for the [[Royal Rumble (2013)|2013 Royal Rumble]], McMahon told CM Punk that if [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] interfered in his match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], Punk would forfeit his title. During the match, the lights went out and Rock was attacked by what appeared to be The Shield, leading to Rock's loss. Vince came out and restarted the match at Rock's request and Rock was victorious. The next night on ''Raw'', while conducting a performance review on [[Paul Heyman]], he was assaulted by the returning [[Brock Lesnar]], who attacked him with the [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|F-5]]. According to WWE.com, McMahon broke his pelvis and required surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-01-28/mr-mcmahon-injury-update-after-brock-lesnar-attack-26088187|title=Mr. McMahon suffers broken pelvis due to Brock Lesnar attack|publisher=WWE.com|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vince sought revenge on Heyman and faced him in a street fight on the February 25 episode of ''Raw'', but Lesnar again interfered, only for Triple H to interfere as well, setting up a rematch between Lesnar and Triple H at [[WrestleMania 29]]. From June 2013, members of the [[McMahon family]] began to dispute various elements of the control of WWE, such as the fates of [[Daniel Bryan]], and of ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' General Managers [[Brad Maddox]] and [[Vickie Guerrero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-smackdown-results/42724-wwe-smackdown-results-7-19-13-new-smackdown-gm|title=WWE SMACKDOWN RESULTS - 7/19/13 (NEW SMACKDOWN GM)|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=July 19, 2013|last=Tedesco|first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Triple H and Stephanie created [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]], McMahon celebrated [[Randy Orton]]'s victory at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs (2013)|TLC]] with them, but stepped aside from his on-screen authority role in early 2014 in order to evaluate Triple H and Stephanie's control of the company.

McMahon returned on the November 3, 2014 episode of ''Raw'', making a stipulation that if Team Cena had defeated Team Authority at [[Survivor Series (2014)|Survivor Series]], The Authority would be removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caldwell|first1=James|title=CALDWELL'S WWE RAW RESULTS 11/3: Complete "virtual-time" coverage of live Raw - VKM returns on 3 Hour &amp; 38 Minute Show, Rollins vs. Orton, U.S. Title match on WWE Network, more|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwerawreport/article_81616.shtml#.VFigNfnF9ps|website=PWTorch.com|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team Cena won the match, but McMahon gave John Cena the option to reinstate The Authority. McMahon returned on the December 14, 2015 episode of ''Raw'', aligning himself with [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]], by confronting [[Roman Reigns]] over his attack on [[Triple H]] at the [[TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs (2015)|TLC]] pay-per-view.  McMahon granted Reigns a rematch for the [[WWE World Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Sheamus]], with the stipulation that if he failed to win the championship he would be fired. During the match, McMahon interfered on Sheamus' behalf but was attacked by Reigns, who then pinned Sheamus to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} On the December 28 episode of ''Raw'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wortman|first1=James|title=Raw Five-Point Preview: Dec. 28, 2015|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2015-12-28/five-point-preview-28409262|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon was arrested for assaulting an [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer and resisting arrest after a confrontation with Roman Reigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE Raw live results: Dec. 28, 2015|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2015-12-28/wwe-raw-results-28453974|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon made himself special guest referee in Reigns' rematch against Sheamus on the January 4, 2016 episode of ''Raw'', where Reigns won after McMahon was knocked out and another referee made the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benigno|first1=Anthony|title=WWE World Heavyweight Champion Roman Reigns def.

On the February 22, episode of ''Raw'', McMahon presented the first ever "Vincent J. McMahon Legacy of Excellence" Award to Stephanie before being interrupted [[Shane McMahon]], who returned to WWE for the first time in over six years, confronting his father and sister, and claiming that he wanted control of ''Raw''. This led to Vince book Shane against The Undertaker at [[WrestleMania 32]] in a Hell in a Cell match with the stipulation that if Shane won, he would have full control of ''Raw'' and The Undertaker would be banned from competing in any future WrestleMania.&lt;ref name="Raw2222016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tedesco|first1=Mike|title=WWE RAW Results - 2/22/16 (Shane McMahon returns)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-raw-results/57868-wwe-raw-results-2-22-16-live-results-from-detroit|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the April 4 episode of ''Raw'', McMahon gloated about Shane's loss at WrestleMania the previous night, before Shane came out, accepted his defeat and said goodbye, leading McMahon to allow Shane to run that nights show, after feeling upstaged by his son. After Shane ran ''Raw'' for the rest of April, at [[Payback (2016)|Payback]], McMahon announced Shane and Stephanie had joint control.

On the April 3, 2017 episode of ''Raw'', McMahon returned to announce [[Kurt Angle]] as the new Raw General Manager and the upcoming [[2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-raw-results/77098-wwe-raw-results-april-3-wrestlemania/|title=WWE RAW Results - 4/3/17 (Night after WrestleMania 33) - WWE News and Results, RAW and Smackdown Results, TNA News, ROH News|first=Mike|last=Tedesco|date=April 3, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, it was announced that McMahon would make an appearance on the September 12 episode of ''SmackDown Live''. At the end of that night as a [[Babyface (professional wrestling)|face]], McMahon confronted [[Kevin Owens]], who was unhappy about Vince's son Shane attacking him the week before, which resulted in Shane being suspended. McMahon was furious about the heinous words regarding his family, and how Owens was not respectful, and how he planned to prosecute everybody who wronged him. McMahon warned him that his lawsuit would result in him being fired, but McMahon has the cash to deal with that empty threat. This prompted Owens to say Shane put his hands on him, but McMahon said he suspended Shane for not finishing off Owens. Shane was then reinstated to face Owens at the ''Hell in a Cell'' pay-per-view. Owens then attacked McMahon, leaving him laying in the ring. Even with several referees present, Owens still continued to attack McMahon, and splashed down on him from atop one of the ring posts, resulting in McMahon being ([[kayfabe]]) injured. [[Stephanie McMahon]] also returned to help her father, as he was attended to by WWE officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2017/0912/632078/wwe-smackdown-live-results/|title=WWE SmackDown Results - Vince McMahon Attacked, Three Title Matches, New Champions Crowned, More - WrestlingInc.com|work=WrestlingInc.com|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2018, McMahon returned on ''[[Raw 25 Years]]'' to address the WWE Universe, only to later turn on them by calling them "cheap" turning heel once again. He was later confronted, and [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|stunnered]], by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. On March 12, McMahon made an appearance in a backstage segment with [[Roman Reigns]], announcing that Reigns would be suspended for his recent actions.On SmackDown 1000 McMahon returned as face once again after dancing on TruthTV.

== Other media ==
In 2001, McMahon was interviewed by ''[[Playboy]]'' and performed an interview with his son Shane for the second issue of the magazine that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Playboy Interview: Vince McMahon |magazine=Playboy |pages=55–68 |date=February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, at age 60, McMahon was featured on the cover of ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]'' magazine.

=== Family ===
{{Main article|McMahon family}}
McMahon married [[Linda McMahon]] on August 26, 1966 in [[New Bern, North Carolina]]. The two met in church when Linda was 13 and Vince was 16. At that time, McMahon was known as Vince Lupton, using his stepfather's surname. They were introduced by Vince's mother, Vicky H. Lupton (now Vicky H. Askew). They have two children, [[Shane McMahon|Shane]] and [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]], both of whom have spent time in the WWF/E both onscreen and behind the scenes. Shane left the company on January 1, 2010 (later returning in 2016), while Stephanie continues to be active in a backstage role and onscreen.

McMahon has six grandchildren: Declan James, Kenyon Jesse, and Rogan Henry McMahon, sons of Shane and his wife [[Marissa Mazzola-McMahon|Marissa]]; and Aurora Rose, Murphy Claire, and Vaughn Evelyn Levesque, daughters of Stephanie and her husband [[Triple H|Paul "Triple H" Levesque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rxmuscle.com/hmr-radio-show/2424-jefftheproducer-hmr.html|title=Heavy Muscle Radio/Access Bodybuilding: (1-3-11):TRIPLE H!

=== Harassment allegations ===
On April 3, 1992, Rita Chatterton, a former [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] noted for her stint as Rita Marie in the WWF in the 1980s and for being the first female referee in the WWF (possibly in professional wrestling history),&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Assael &amp; Mike Mooneyham. ''Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation'' (p. 116)&lt;/ref&gt; made an appearance on [[Geraldo Rivera]]'s show ''Now It Can Be Told''. She claimed that on July 16, 1986, McMahon tried to force her to perform [[oral sex]] on him in his limousine and, when she refused, raped her.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Assael &amp; Mike Mooneyham. ''Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation'' (p. 115-117)&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2006, McMahon was accused of sexual harassment by a worker at a tanning bar in [[Boca Raton, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bocaratonnews.com/index.php?src=news&amp;prid=14071&amp;category=Local%20News|title=WWE chief accused of groping Boca tanning salon worker|author=Dale King|publisher=Boca Raton News|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=February 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the charge appeared to be discredited because McMahon was in [[Miami]] for the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]] at the time. It was soon clarified that the alleged incident was reported to police on the day of the Rumble, but actually took place the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=15391|title=McMahon situation to get more publicity|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, it was reported that no charges would be filed against McMahon as a result of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digest|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2006-03-25/news/0603250062_1_consecutive-life-cancer-treatment-life-terms|accessdate=March 9, 2016|work=Sun-Sentinel|date=March 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal trial ===
In 1993, McMahon was indicted in federal court after a [[steroid]] controversy engulfed the promotion and thus temporarily ceded control of the WWF to his wife Linda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/sports/wwf-s-mcmahon-indicted.html |title=W.W.F.'s McMahon Indicted |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 19, 1993 |accessdate=October 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case went to trial in 1994, where McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to his wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/nyregion/wrestling-promoter-fights-steroid-charges.html |title=Wrestling Promoter Fights Steroid Charges |work=The New York Times |date=April 28, 1994 |accessdate=October 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prosecution witness was [[Kevin Wacholz]], who had wrestled for the company in 1992 as "Nailz" and who had been fired after a violent confrontation with McMahon. Wacholz testified that McMahon had ordered him to use steroids, but his credibility was called into question during his testimony as he made it clear he "hated" McMahon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/12/nyregion/nailz-the-wrestler-testifies-he-was-told-to-use-steroids.html?pagewanted=1 | title=Nailz the Wrestler Testifies He Was Told to Use Steroids}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/faq/?article=nailz|title= NAILZ |work=Wrestleview|accessdate=November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
