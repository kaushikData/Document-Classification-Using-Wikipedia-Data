'''''13 Going on 30''''' (released as '''''Suddenly 30''''' in some countries) is a 2004 American [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[romantic comedy]] film written by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa and directed by [[Gary Winick]]. Starring [[Jennifer Garner]], the film was produced by [[Revolution Studios]] for [[Columbia Pictures]], and was released on April 23, 2004. It follows a 13-year-old girl who dreams of being popular. During her birthday party, she is humiliated by classmates and wishes that she was 30 years old. When she eventually does emerge, she finds herself five days shy of her 30th birthday, uncertain how she got there.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Garner's performance and its nostalgic environment. It was also praised for its humorous plot and self-empowering message. The film was also a commercial success, earning $22 million in its first week and grossing over $96 million, becoming one of the year's biggest-selling [[DVD]] rental titles. Its soundtrack features songs spanning from the 1980s to the 2000s, with a range of hits from famous recording artists such as [[Talking Heads]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Pat Benatar]] and [[Whitney Houston]]. Additionally, the soundtrack charted inside the top 50 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Garner's acting earned her nominations from both the [[MTV Movie Awards]] and the [[Teen Choice Awards]], and the film was also re-released in DVD in 2006 as "Fun and Flirty Edition", and on [[Blu-Ray]] in 2009.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- See WP:FILMPLOT for more details. The general rule is that the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
On May 26, 1987, Jenna Rink, a gawky girl, yearns to be popular, but the only way she can get the ruling [[clique]]—the "Six Chicks", led by mean girl Lucy "Tom-Tom" Wyman—to attend her upcoming 13th-birthday party is by doing their homework. Jenna's best friend, the geeky boy Matty Flamhaff (with the nickname of Beaver because he looks like the star of ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''), arrives early to the party to give her a bright pink, dream [[dollhouse]] that he built for her. He sprinkles his second gift, a packet of glittery "magic wishing dust", on its roof.

The Six Chicks soon show up with the cutest boys in class and make Jenna play "[[seven minutes in heaven]]". While Jenna waits, blindfolded, in a dark closet, thinking a popular boy she has a crush on is about to enter, the Six Chicks vanish with all the boys, half the food and Jenna's completed homework. It is Matt who walks into the closet, to Jenna's horror. She locks herself in the closet and cries, wishing to be 30; above her, the glittering wishing dust from the dollhouse gently rains down.

The next morning, Jenna awakens in a gleaming [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] apartment. Jenna's dream has come true: It is now 2004, and Jenna, at first utterly baffled, particularly by the handsome hunk in her shower, realizes she has magically turned 30 overnight, with no idea of what happened in the intervening 17 years.

Jenna discovers that she works for ''Poise'', her favorite fashion magazine. Tough-as-nails Lucy is her co-editor and best friend, but the magazine itself is in serious trouble, having been scooped by a rival magazine named ''Sparkle'' so often that the editor-in-chief believes someone inside ''Poise'' is tipping them off. Jenna, freaking out like the frightened teen she still is, wants only to find Matty. She gets his address and races down to [[Greenwich Village]] where the now-grown Matt ([[Mark Ruffalo]]) is a struggling photographer. To her confusion, he is distant and cold, and cannot even fill Jenna in on much of her missing past, because she became head of the "Six now seven Chicks", and never spoke to Matt again. She even became Prom Queen—and Lucy, her only friend, is actually the original "Tom-Tom" after [[plastic surgery]].

While delighting in her freedom and great clothes, Jenna stumbles through a grown-up world, learning enough of life to advise other 13-year-olds whom she actually prefers to hang with. But her slowly emerging past reveals she was nothing like the sweet, shy girl she had been the day before: this grown-up Jenna stole ideas, refuses to speak to her parents, and has office sex with the husband of a co-worker. After Jenna overhears her supposed best friend Lucy badmouthing her, in a plan to save the magazine behind her back, she decides to fix the sins of the past she cannot remember.

She returns to her hometown in [[New Jersey]] and weeps in the same basement closet. Her parents find her there, and they hug. She gets back in touch with Matt, gingerly apologizes and hires him to do the photography on her own new plans for ''Poise'', which is a huge break for him. Even though Matt has a fiancée in [[Chicago]] who is eager for him to move there, Jenna and Matt begin to fall for each other.

Everyone loves Matt's photos and Jenna's new plans to save the magazine, but when ''Sparkle'' shows up yet again with this exact material, including Matt's own photographs, and with Lucy as their new head, ''Poise'' folds. Outraged, Jenna confronts Lucy for stealing, but Lucy scornfully tells her that Jenna was the one sabotaging her own magazine all along; Lucy merely found out about it and did the same thing.

Matt, wounded by what he thought was Jenna's betrayal of him, is getting married the next day. Jenna rushes out to the leafy suburb on his wedding day, hoping to convince Matt that she was not the person she had seemed to be, that he would marry her if he could see who she really was, but Matt, already in his tuxedo, says the past cannot come back and hands Jenna her pink homemade dollhouse, which he had kept all these years. While the wedding begins in the background, Jenna leaves in tears, closing her eyes and clinging to the dollhouse—on which a few bits of wishing dust still remain.

When Jenna opens her eyes, she is back in 1987, on that same 13th-birthday night with a second chance. This time, when Matt finds her huddled alone in the closet, she kisses him. They run upstairs together, bumping into Tom-Tom on the way; Jenna rips up the homework in Tom-Tom's hands and Jenna and Matt run out of the house, emerging—presumably in around 2004 again only with Jenna having this time travelled the intervening 17 years normally—as a wedding couple on the other side of the door, and, as credits roll, they are moving into a bright pink house just like the dollhouse that started it all.

The film received an approval rating of 65% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 158 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|13_going_on_30|13 Going on 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a very positive review with a grade of "A-", writing "13 Going on 30 is the rare commercial comedy that leaves you entranced by what can happen only in the movies."&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite news|title=13 Going on 30 - Movie Review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,613797,00.html|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=EW|date=22 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gleiberman also praised Jennifer Garner's performance, writing: "She cuts out all traces of adult consciousness, of irony and flirtation and manipulation, reducing herself to a keen, goggle-eyed earnestness that's utterly beguiling."&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised her performance, writing "Garner throws herself so fully and effectively into the role that in a few key scenes, she vividly conveys Jenna's high spirits and giddy pleasure through the graceful curling of her toes."&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117923559.html | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | title=13 Going On 30 | first=Joe | last=Leydon | date=April 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leydon praised the director Gary Winick for " bringing a fresh spin to most of the script's cliches and emphasizing nuggets of emotional truth provided by Goldsmith and Yuspa."&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; [[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote that "The movie is tailor-made for women who openly lust for dream houses, dream jobs, and dream hubbies."&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; He also wrote that "the best stuff involves the childhood preamble. (The young actors playing Jenna, Matt, and Lucy are terrific.) Those moments feel painfully, comically true."&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, commenting, "This romantic comedy is intended as a cautionary fairy tale. The silly humor works with the movie's gentle message of self-empowerment and avoids sappiness in a tender interlude where the adult Jenna returns to her childhood home. Amusing, charming and pleasantly nostalgic, 13 Going on 30 should fall easily onto moviegoers' wish lists."&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2004-04-22-13-going-on-30_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title='13 Going on 30' not just for kids | first1=Claudia | last1=Puig | date=April 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written: "This shameless rip-off of the [[Tom Hanks]] Classic ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'' is weak, but predictable and is sparked by the excellent performance of Jennifer Garner".&lt;ref&gt;2005 DVD and Video guide, p.1120. {{ISBN|0-345-44995-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elvis Mitchell of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation does; it often feels like prechewed Bubble Yum. The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success, even at a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism. The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads. Instead it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it, too."&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Elvis|title=13 Going On 30 (2004) FILM REVIEW; Freaky Future: An Awkward Teenager Finds Herself Fast-Forwarded to Adulthood|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950CE1DE143AF930A15757C0A9629C8B63|accessdate=July 30, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Gronvall of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' wrote that "The formula works, thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner, who's so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock. Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral—self-love is a prerequisite for true love—there's a touching wistfulness about roads not taken."&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/13-going-on-30/Film?oid=1054518 13 Going On 30 | Chicago Reader&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Morales of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' commented: "The thirtysomething in me was all, [[wikt:gag me with a spoon|gag me with a spoon]], but the kid in me was like, this movie's rad to the max."&lt;ref name=village&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-04-13/film/film/1 Film - Page 1 - Movies - New York - Village Voice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Académie de la Carpette anglaise''''', which may be translated as the "English Doormat Academy" (the word ''carpette'' means both "rug" and "fawner"), is a French organisation that awards an annual prize to "members of the French [[elite|élite]] who distinguish themselves by relentlessly promoting the domination of the [[English language]] over the [[French language]] in France and in [[European Union|European institutions]]."  Whether admired or despised for its [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[rhetoric]], the Academy has captured the attention of many in the French-speaking world who genuinely fear that the growing pervasiveness of English will lead to the decline and ultimate demise of French.

The Academy was created in 1999 by a group of four French-language associations.&lt;ref&gt;''Avenir de la langue française'', ''Association pour l'essor de la langue française'', ''Défense de la langue française'', ''Le droit de comprendre''. [http://www.langue-francaise.org/] [http://perso.wanadoo.fr/avenirlf/Adressesutiles/Assocliees.htm#AFAL]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 a second award was introduced to spotlight "key figures and constituent bodies among the European and international [[nomenklatura]] who actively conspire to promote the use of English within European and international institutions". As one member of the Academy put it, its aim is "to reward all those obscure geniuses (...) who are only too ready to say: 'Welcome to our dearly beloved invaders!' as Ceramix proudly proclaimed in the album ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/035/article_19699.asp ''Radio France Internationale'', 14 November 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Ig Nobel Prize]], the English Doormat Award heaps ridicule on its recipients.

==Winners of the English Doormat Award==
*'''1999''': [[Louis Schweitzer (CEO)|Louis Schweitzer]], CEO of [[Renault]], for imposing the use of [[American English]] in its internal meeting reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1892853.stm  | work=[[BBC Online]] | title=Parlez-vous verlan? | date=26 March 2002 | accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The runner-up was [[Claude Allègre]], [[Ministry of National Education (France)|French minister of education]], for declaring that "French people must stop considering English as a foreign language."
*'''2000''': [[Alain Richard]], French [[Ministry of Defence (France)|Minister of Defence]], for making it compulsory for French military personnel to speak English within the [[Eurocorps]], which has no English-speaking nations among its members.
*'''2001''': [[Jean-Marie Messier]], CEO of [[Vivendi Universal]], for his unconditional promotion of English for all internal communication purposes.
*'''2002''': [[Jean-Marie Colombani]], editor of ''[[Le Monde]]'', for publishing a weekly (untranslated) selection from ''[[The New York Times]]'', in English. 
*'''2003''': The [[École des Hautes Études Commerciales|HEC]] Group, whose general manager, Bernard Ramanantsoa, declared: "To say that French is an international language of communication is laughable in this day and age."
*'''2004''': Claude Thélot, president of the Commission for National Debate on the Future of Schools, for declaring that English as a language of international communication should enjoy equal status with French in the school curriculum, and for recommending that undubbed American soaps should be broadcast on French television as an aid to learning English. Another nominee was Claude Simonet, president of the [[French Football Federation]], who adopted the [[Jackson 5]]'s hit "[[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]" as the anthem of the French team.
*'''2005''': [[France Telecom]], the telephone company run by [[Didier Lombard]], for putting in place services and products with English descriptions (''Business Talk, Live-Zoom, Family Talk...'').  This entry defeated, by a vote of eight to four, the entry for [[Yves Daudigny]], president of the consul-general for the [[département]] of [[Aisne]], for his publicity campaign "L'Aisne, it's Open".
*'''2006''': The [[Constitutional Council of France]] for its "numerous violations of article 2 of the Constitution which establishes French as the language of the French Republic" and for having "confirmed the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Protocol on patents]] as consistent with the Constitution, allowing a text in English or German to have legal effect in France."
*'''2007''': [[Christine Lagarde]], Minister of Economy, for having communicated at times with her staff in English, to the point that, ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' revealed, it allegedly earned her the nickname of "Christine the Guard".
*'''2008''': [[Valérie Pécresse]], Minister of Higher Education and Research, for saying that the French language was in decline and that the taboo of English in EU institutions, as well as in French universities, had to be broken, to make intensive education in that language compulsory (which notably goes against the [[Élysée Treaty]] of 1963).&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/news.php?lng=fr&amp;pg=150 Communiqué 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2009''': [[Richard Descoings]], director of the ''[[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]]'', for imposing courses in English only in some programmes offered by the IEPP, and for communicating in English with the [[Lycée Français de Madrid]] (French lycée of Madrid).
*'''2010''' : [[Martine Aubry]], first Secretary of the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], for her use of English slogans such as "Care" and "What Would Jaurès Do?"
*'''2011''': [[Jean-François Copé]], general Secretary of the French party [[Union for a Popular Movement]], for his vigorous promotion of English in schools from kindergarten to universities and his desire to make the Anglicisation of public television a party platform in the 2011 presidential elections.
*'''2012''': [[Frédéric Cuvillier]], [[Ministry of Ecology|Delegate Minister for Transport, Sea and Fishing]] for having declared, according to ''Le Parisien'' that in the field of transports "English should be the working and drafting language of the standardized official documents".
*'''2013''': [[Guillaume Pepy]], president of [[SNCF]], for the "Smiles, the TGV Family and other linguistic mediocrities" and the proposal of "English classes only, in his Champagne's trains".
*'''2013''' (exceptional award): [[Geneviève Fioraso]], [[:fr:Ministre chargé de l'Enseignement supérieur (France)|minister for Higher Education and Research]], because just like Valérie Pécresse ("doormatted" in 2008) and despite several warnings, she rendered legal the article 2 of her bill for English teaching by keeping it.
*'''2014''': [[Pierre Moscovici]], member of the [[European Commission]], for having sent to Michel Sapin, [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance|minister for Finances and Public Accounts]], a letter entirely in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} {{cite journal |last= |first= |date=June–July 2017 |title=Le prix de la Carpette anglaise |trans-title=The English doormat award |url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/mav/153/A/57528 |language= |journal=Le Monde diplomatique |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2015''': [[Alexandre de Juniac]], CEO of Air-France-KLM, for the advertisement campaign "Air France, France is in the air", replacing the elegant commercial « ''Faire du ciel le plus bel endroit de la terre'' » (Making of the Sky the prettiest place on Earth).
*'''2016''': Anne-Florence Schmitt, director of the editorial board of ''[[Madame Figaro]]'', for the constant abuse of anglicisms and bogus English, in that magazine targeted for a large feminine public.

==Winners of the special Jury Award==
*'''2001''': [[Lego]], the [[Denmark|Danish]] toy company, for showcasing its products in English, in France and all over the world, with slogans such as "Explore being me", "Explore together", "Explore logic" and "Explore imagination."
*'''2002''': [[Romano Prodi]], president of the [[European Commission]], for defying community rules by never missing an opportunity to promote English as the one and only language for labelling food products and negotiating with other European countries.
*'''2003''': [[Pascal Lamy]], for his systematic use of English in defiance of community rules, while acting as [[European Commission|European commissioner]]. 
*'''2004''': [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], president of the [[European Central Bank]], for presenting the ECB's policy statements in English at the [[European Parliament]] and for declaring  "I am not a Frenchman" (in English) when taking office.
*'''2005''': [[Josep Borrell]], president of the [[European Parliament]], for favouring English at a session of the [[Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly|Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly]] after having just presided at [[Rabat]] in [[Morocco]] without having translated the working papers.
*'''2006''': [[Ernest-Antoine Seillière]], president of the [[Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe]], for having delivered a speech to the [[European Council]] in [[Brussels]] in English in March 2006.
*'''2007''': The police of [[Geneva]], for an advertisement ''United Police of Geneva'' (title in English).
*'''2008''': [[Eurostat]], the Statistical Service of the European Commission, for giving up German and French to broadcast since April 2008 its publication ''Statistiques en bref'' in English only.
*'''2009''':  [[Jean-Louis Borloo]], Minister of State, [[Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea|Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea]], for invoking emergency in order to sign the Treaty for [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] whose sole working language is English, while five important countries are still withholding signatures.
*'''2010''': [[Paul Kagamé]], President of [[Rwanda]], for replacing French with English as an official language and as the language of education, and for withdrawing Rwanda from the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] to join the [[Commonwealth]].&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
*'''2011''': [[Ryanair]], for demanding in Spain of women pregnant beyond 28 weeks a medical certificate in English, even for domestic flights.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Albeit exaggeratedly, as Rwanda never dropped French as an official language and also never left ''La Francophonie''.&lt;/small&gt;

'''BetaDwarf''' is a Danish [[independent video game developer]] based in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], founded in 2010.The company was formed by a small group of students in 2010, who moved into an unused classroom in [[Aalborg University]] – [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] and began developing their first game, ''[[Forced]]''. Since, they have left the classroom and released a second game, ''[[Forced: Showdown]]''.

== History ==
Steffen Kabbelgaard (actual [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]) started to look at talented people to create a company and start making games. He found Kenneth Harder (actual [[Chief technology officer|CTO]]) with whom he gathered a team of 4 people to start the company. The team quickly grew up to 8 members within a few months.

Through a lack of money to have an office, the newly founded Betadwarf team moved illegally into an unused classroom in [[Aalborg University]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. All members of the team left their apartments to live in this classroom that they accommodated with fridges, beds and microwave ovens. There, they worked on their first game, which would become ''[[Forced]]''.
For 7 months they lived in this classroom until a lecturer of the University accidentally walked in on them. They were forced to move out and found a house in [[Karlslunde]] that they transformed into their new company office and in which they lived in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forcedthegame.com/story/ | title = Forced the game - Story | last = Steffen | first = Kabbelgaard | date = 24 October 2013 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no more funds, they decided to launch a [[Kickstarter]] campaign for ''[[Forced]]''. The campaign didn’t originally start successfully. But, an image posted on [[Imgur]], which described their history and progress as a team, was seen more than a million times and drew many people to the campaign which was successfully funded up to $65,413.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/betadwarf/forced | title = Forced - Kickstarter | last = Steffen | first = Kabbelgaard | date = 21 December 2012 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BetaDwarf team then moved into an office in [[Copenhagen]] in which they continued to live in. After the founders took a loan of $200,000 they finished their game after 3 years of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SteffenBaboonLordKabbelgaard/20131113/204726/How_we_lived_together_for_3_years_while_making_FORCED.php | title = Gamasutra article - How we lived 3 years making Forced | last = Steffen | first = Kabbelgaard | date = 13 November 2013 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Forced]]'' is a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down]] local/online [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] action-puzzler in which the players are cast as slaves who are forced to fight in a fantasy gladiator arena until one of them tries to escape and fights his way to freedom.
The game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on 24 October 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.steampowered.com/app/249990/?l=french | title = Forced Steam page | date = 24 October 2013 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold more than 50,000 copies within the first month. An [[Xbox One]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/forced/bsb39n2rt01v | title = Forced Xbox One release | date = October 2015 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PlayStation 4]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/forced-ps4/ | title = Forced PS4 release | date = October 2015 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; version were released later in October 2015.
After the success of ''[[Forced]]'' and inspired by [[Valve Corporation]], the team worked to improve their company culture creating a flat working environment where everybody gets the same salary and much of the salary is paid as bonuses based on the performance of the products they release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SteffenBaboonLordKabbelgaard/20140625/219708/The_quest_for_a_legendary_company_structure.php| title = Gamasutra article - The quest for a legendary company structure | last = Steffen | first = Kabbelgaard | date = 25 June 2014 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BetaDwarf then started to work on their next game FORCED 2: The Rush. During development the game was renamed to FORCED: Eternal Arenas, for which they ran another successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign, raising $76,014. However, due to a lawsuit threat from a bigger company, demanding to change their new game's name, FORCED: Eternal Arenas became ''[[Forced: Showdown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forcedthegame.com/story/ | title = Forced the game - Story | last = Steffen | first = Kabbelgaard | date = 24 October 2013 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down]] [[Single-player video game|singleplayer]] [[Shoot 'em up#Bullet hell and niche appeal|bullet-hell]] [[Beat 'em up|brawler]], players are cast as Contestants, which are gladiators in a galactic game show where they must battle their way through arenas to defeat the Titans waiting for them and ultimately survive to earn fame, glory and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://forcedshowdown.com/ | title = Forced: Showdown Official Website | date = 24 October 2013 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a little more than two years of development, ''[[Forced: Showdown]]'' was released on 29 March 2016. An [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] version of the game are planned to be released later.
The team released an expansion for ''[[Forced: Showdown]]'' on 31 July 2016 called ''Drone Invasion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.steampowered.com/app/265000/ | title = Forced: Showdown Steam page | date = 24 October 2013 | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are currently working on an unannounced game.

'''''Big Mutha Truckers''''' is a {{vgy|2002}} [[racing]] [[video game]] developed by [[United Kingdom|British]] studio [[Eutechnyx]]. Set in fictional Hick County, the game revolves around completing trips between cities, delivering goods, and competing in races while at the helm of an [[semi-trailer truck|eighteen wheeler]]. The game is available on [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Personal computer|PC]], but enjoyed only mediocre critical and commercial success due to repetitive gameplay, dated graphics, and lackluster sound. The game uses [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]'s "[[Born to Be Wild]]" as its theme song. The sequel is ''[[Big Mutha Truckers 2]]''. A different game of the same name was developed by [[Italy|Italian]] company Raylight Studios and released for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS.

The game's plot revolves around one of four available characters and their quest to inherit the family business. With plans to retire from the family business, Ma' Jackson challenges her four children, Cletus, Earl, Rawkus, and Bobbie-Sue, to a "Trial by Truckin". She gives each sibling 60 days in which to make deliveries to various cities in Hick State County, with the company going to the sibling with the most money in the end.

==Gameplay==
Big Mutha Truckers is primarily a racing game, in the same vein as [[18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker]]. Players spend the majority of their time on the road, navigating the highways between the game's six cities: Salt Sea City, Capital City, Greenback, Skeeter's Creek, Smokestack Heights, and Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated. The player will earn most of his or her money through trade, shipping goods from [[cell phones]] to [[beer]], with additional opportunities from mini-games and challenge races.

Every city features three locations: a garage, a bar, and a store. The garage allowed players to repair damage, refuel, switch trailers to carry different kinds of cargo, buy upgrades to improve their rig, or design custom logos for their truck. In the bar the player can find tips on where to buy and sell certain cargo, and a [[loan shark]]. The store allows the player to buy and sell goods, with prices varying by town. When visiting Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated, the bar and store are replaced by visits to Ma Jackson.

On the road, the player can earn extra money by smashing other vehicles. This money can be multiplied through combos, or by hitting a vehicle with the trailer. If the player earns a high enough combo, he can make reward icons appear on the road. When collected, these icons can refuel the truck, repair damage, or offer a cash bonus. [[Law enforcement]] and [[biker gangs]] are both present in the game, and cause trouble for the player if he or she attacks them by mistake. Any cop will pursue and capture a player, while bikers will attempt to shoot up the trailer, or even detach it from the truck. In either case, it is a significant blow to the player's cash. Every cop in this game can be avoided with skillful driving, and bikers can be shaken away from your truck.

Occasionally, the player will be asked to accomplish a side-mission when he or she visits a bar. These simple point-to-point races are good for cash if the player can complete them.

Big Mutha Truckers has a mixed reception. [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave it a score of 66.41% and 62 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version;&lt;ref name=GRPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS2/&gt; 65.36% and 63 out of 100 for the GameCube version;&lt;ref name=GRGC/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCGC/&gt; 65.35% and 59 out of 100 for the Xbox version;&lt;ref name=GRXB/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCXB/&gt; 56% and 48 out of 100 for the DS version;&lt;ref name=GRDS/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCDS/&gt; 55.80% and 61 out of 100 for the PC version;&lt;ref name=GRPC/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPC/&gt; and 50% for the Game Boy Advance version.&lt;ref name=GRGBA/&gt;

[[GameSpot]] critic Alex Navarro gave the game a 6.2 out of 10 rating, noting that while it "earnestly tries to be a fun game," flaws in the presentation and a lack of varied gameplay lead to a game that "as a full-on purchase . . . just doesn't measure up."&lt;ref name=GSpot/&gt; Similar complaints about the game's commerce model came from Andy Mahood of [[GameSpy]], who wrote that "no matter how much you dress it up . . . this [[lather-rinse-repeat]] cycle can turn stale after only a few hours of play."&lt;ref name=GSpyPC/&gt; Despite negative commentary, though, many reviewers{{Who|date=February 2015}} admitted that the game was enjoyable, if only for the first eight to ten minutes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''Brocklands Adventure Park''' was a family run [[leisure park]] situated near [[Bude]] in [[Cornwall]].

The park was established in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cornwalls.co.uk/attractions/brocklands-adventure-park.htm |title=Brocklands Adventure Park (NOW CLOSED) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Cornwall Guide |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally as a Tearoom and shop but quickly grew in the 1980s with the addition of a large car park and 15 in (381&amp;nbsp;mm) gauge railway with a diesel driven train. The expansion included ponds, slides and a pony ride track. In 1987 additions were made including bouncy castle, trampolines, bumper boats and quad bikes. The park became known as Pixieland Fun Park. In 1997 a steam train replaced the diesel train and in 2000 the name of the park was changed to Brocklands Adventure Park.

The park itself was split into two parts with the main road dividing the rides to the south and the indoor activities, kids outdoor activities and cafe to the north of the road. The indoor multi-activity centre was known ‘Undercover Playland' and the rides era was known as ‘Upper Valley Adventureland'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ideasforthekids.co.uk/attraction.aspx?attID=cead5e41-9d98-49b6-af03-e820d1ebbd5e |title=Brocklands Adventure Park (NOW CLOSED) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Ideas For Kids |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a 4 lane bowling alley known as 'Brock Bowl".

The park closed after in 2007 season because the owners Sue and Dennis Vanstone retired. The diesel train, known as 'Pioneer' was given to [[Sherwood Forest Railway]]. It is not known what happened to the steam train. Another park in the area, [[Killarney Springs]], closed the year prior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4761">The '''Cinematograph Act 1909''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (9 Edw. VII c. 30). It was the first [[primary legislation]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] which specifically regulated the [[film industry]].  It is notable for having unintentionally provided the legal basis for [[film censorship]], leading to the establishment of the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] in 1912.  

==Origins==

During the 1890s and 1900s, most [[Cinematograph|film exhibition]] took place in temporary venues such as [[funfair|fairground]]s, [[music hall]]s and hastily converted shops (so-called '[[penny gaff]]s').  The film then in use was made from the highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] base.  Combined with [[limelight]] illumination, this created a significant safety hazard, resulting in a number of fatal fires.

The 1909 Act specified a strict building code which required, amongst other things, that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure. All commercial cinemas (defined as any business which admitted members of the public to see films in exchange for payment) had to comply with these regulations. In order to enforce this each cinema had to be inspected and licensed by the [[Local government|local authority]]. The Act was amended in the wake of the 1929 [[Glen Cinema Disaster]] in order to give local authorities more powers to regulate the number of emergency exits and insist on other safety measures.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Gardiner | first1 = Juliet | title = The Thirties - an Intimate History | chapter = Prologue | publisher = Harper Press | year = 2010 | location = London | pages = 8 | isbn = 978-0-00-724076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis of censorship==

In the following year, the owner of the London Bridge Picture Palace and Cinematograph Theatre, in South London, was prosecuted under Section 2 of the Act after he defied a condition of the licence issued by the local authority, the [[London County Council]], by opening on a Sunday (27 February 1910).  In the appeal hearing which resulted,&lt;ref&gt;''[[London County Council|LCC]] v. Bermondsey Bioscope Co.'', [1911] 1 K.B. 445&lt;/ref&gt; the cinema owner argued that the intention of the 1909 Act was simply to ensure health and safety, and that authorities had no legal power to attach unrelated conditions to cinemas' licences.  The LCC won the appeal, which established the precedent that the purpose of restrictions on a cinema licence did not have to be restricted to fire prevention.

In the aftermath of this case, local authorities across the country began to censor the content of films, using their licensing powers under the 1909 Act.  This concerned the film industry, which was worried that inconsistent censorship policies would undermine it: under this ad hoc system, a film-maker had no way of knowing the size of his potential market (i.e. how many authorities would allow or ban his film), and cinema owners in areas with strict censorship policies would suffer financially compared to those in more liberal towns.

The result was the creation of the British Board of Film Censors in 1912, a private company which examined and certified films according to nationally agreed criteria.  It was financed by the fees paid by film-makers to the BBFC to have their films examined.  Councils began to issue cinema licences with a provision stating that they may show only films which had been passed by the BBFC, rather than censoring films themselves.

Although the Act itself was later superseded, its provisions remain the legal basis on which the content of films for cinema exhibition is regulated in the UK.  There are occasionally high-profile cases in which a local authority overrules a BBFC decision within its given jurisdiction, either to raise the certificate or ban outright films the Board has passed, or to allow screening of films it has not.  The BBFC was given statutory powers for the first time in 1985, when it was designated as the classifying authority under the [[Video Recordings Act 1984]], in respect of most commercial video recordings sold or hired in the UK.  But these powers do not affect theatrical exhibition, the legal regulation of which remains with local authorities.

[[File:Aesculus hippocastanum fruit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A selection of fresh conkers from a [[horse chestnut]] tree]]

'''Conkers''' is a [[List of traditional children's games|traditional children's game]] in [[British Isles|Britain and Ireland]] played using the seeds of [[horse chestnut]] trees—the name 'conker' is also applied to the seed and to the tree itself.  The game is played by two players, each with a conker threaded onto a piece of string: they take turns striking each other's conker until one breaks.

==Origins==
The first mention of the game is in [[Robert Southey]]'s memoirs published in 1821.  He describes a similar game, but played with snail shells or hazelnuts.  It was only from the 1850s that using horse chestnuts was regularly referred to in certain regions.  The game grew in popularity in the 19th century, and spread beyond [[England]].&lt;ref name="Vamplew2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wray Vamplew|title=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWu6sLJn7-kC&amp;pg=PA75|year= 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-35224-6|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded game of Conkers using horse chestnuts was on the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=Opie&gt;Iona and Peter Opie, ''Children's Games in Street and Playground: Chasing, catching, seeking, hunting, racing, duelling, exerting, daring, guessing, acting, pretending'', Oxford: Clarendon, 1969, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=ud_WTITrPIW3cP-VjfcL&amp;ct=result&amp;id=AK21AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Isle+of+Wight+conkers+1848&amp;q=Isle+of+Wight+1848#search_anchor p. 232].&lt;/ref&gt;

There is uncertainty of the origins of the name.  The name may come from the dialect word ''conker'', meaning "knock out" (perhaps related to French ''conque'' meaning a [[conch]], as the game was originally played using [[snail]] shells and small bits of string.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Hendrickson|title=Ladybugs, tiger lilies, and wallflowers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQFHAAAAYAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Prentice Hall General Reference|isbn=978-0-671-79910-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomme1894"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alice Bertha Gomme|title=The traditional games of England, Scotland, and Ireland: with tunes, singing-rhymes, and methods of playing according to the variants extant and recorded in different parts of the Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddRwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77|year=1894|publisher=D. Nutt|pages=77–}} refers to Conkers as "the same game as Cogger" and states that it is more generally known as "plying with a hard nut".&lt;/ref&gt;) The name may also be influenced by the verb ''conquer'', as earlier games involving shells and hazelnuts has also been called ''conquerors''.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson1993" /&gt; Another possibility is that it is [[onomatopoeia]], representing the sound made by a horse chestnut as it hits another hard object, such as a skull (another children's "game", also called conkers, consists of simply throwing the seeds at one another over a fence or wall). Conkers are also known regionally as ''cheesers''. Although a "cheeser" is a conker with one or more flat sides, this comes about due to it sharing its pod with other conkers (twins or triplets). Also ''Cheggers'' was used in Lancaster, England in the 1920s.  In [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s book ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'', the game is referred to as ''cobblers'' by William Morel.

==Game==
[[File:Stringing conkers.jpg|right|200px|alt=stringing a conker|Stringing a conker]]
[[File:Strung conker.jpg|right|200px|alt=strung conker| conker on a string, ready to play]]
* A hole is drilled in a large, hard conker using a nail, [[Gimlet (tool)|gimlet]], small screwdriver, or electric drill. A piece of string (often a [[shoelace]] is used), about 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8&amp;nbsp;inches) long, is threaded through it.  A large knot at one or both ends of the string secures the conker.
* The game is played between two people, each with a conker.
* They take turns hitting each other's conker using their own. One player lets the conker dangle on the full length of the string while the other player swings their conker and hits.

===Scoring===
* The conker eventually breaking the other's conker gains a point.  This may be either the attacking conker or (more often) the defending one.
* A new conker is a ''none-er'' meaning that it has conquered none yet.
* If a none-er breaks another none-er then it becomes a ''one-er'', if it was a ''one-er'' then it becomes a ''two-er'' etc.  In some areas of Scotland, conker victories are counted using the terms ''bully-one'', ''bully-two'', etc.  In some areas of the United States and Canada, conker victories are counted using the terms ''one-kinger'', ''two-kinger'', etc.
* In some regions the winning conker assimilates the previous score of the losing conker, as well as gaining the score from that particular game.  For example, if a two-er plays a three-er, the surviving conker will become a six-er (the sum of the two previous scores plus one for the current game). In other regions the winning conker simply gains one point, irrespective of the points-value of the loser.

===Variant rules===
* If the strings become entangled, the first player to shout "strings" or "stringsies" has an extra turn.
* If one player drops their conker, the other can shout "stamps" or "stampsies" entitling them to try and break the conker on the ground by stamping on it. Shouting "no stamps" before the other player can shout "stamps" prevents any stamping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldconkerchampionships.com/html/conkers_about.html |title=All About Conkers |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.worldconkerchampionships.com |publisher=Ashton Conker Club |access-date=25 October 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/CONKERS+CHAMPIONSHIPS%3A+Still+bonkers+about+conkers.-a0122352575 |title=CONKERS CHAMPIONSHIPS: Still bonkers about conkers |last1=McGrinder |first1=Jack |last2= |first2= |date=2004 |website=www.thefreelibrary.com |publisher=Scottish Daily Record |access-date=25 October 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardening conkers===
The hardest conkers usually win. Hardening conkers is often done by keeping them for a year (aged conkers are called ''laggies'' in many areas or ''seasoners'' in Ireland and Liverpool), baking them briefly, soaking or boiling in vinegar, or painting with clear nail varnish.  Such hardening is, however, usually regarded as cheating. At the British Junior Conkers Championships on the [[Isle of Wight]] in October 2005, contestants were banned from bringing their own conkers due to fears that they might harden them. The [[Campaign for Real Conkers]] claimed this was an example of over-regulation which was causing a drop in interest in the game. In both the World Conker Championship and the North American Championship, contestants are also restricted to using the conkers provided by the Organisers.

One factor affecting the strength of a conker is the shape of the hole.  A clean cylindrical hole is stronger, as it has no notches or chips that can begin a crack or split.

===Similar game===
A similar [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] game (played with the smaller seed of the jatobá, ''[[Hymenaea courbaril]]'') is called ''gallitos'' (meaning small roosters or cocks, as in [[cockfighting]]). The opponents face each other and the defending gallito is laid in the center of a circle drawn in the dirt. Not until the attacking player misses will the defending player take a turn. Upon missing, if the attacking player is quick enough, they will try to swing at the defending gallito before the defendant removes it from within the circle. If the defending gallito is struck it must remain in the circle until the attacker misses again. This move is called a "''paso de paloma''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101008013901/http%3A//maderaspr.uprm.edu/algarrobo2.pdf Monograph on ''Hymenaea courbaril'' {{es icon}}, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Championships==
In 1965 the [[World Conker Championships]] were set up in [[Ashton, East Northamptonshire|Ashton]] (near [[Oundle]]) [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]], and still take place on the second Sunday of October every year.  In 2004, an audience of 5,000 turned up to watch more than 500 competitors from all over the world. The 2016 Championship was featured on the BBC programme "Countryfile".

1976 was the first time that a non-British contestant won the Men's World Conker Championship. The Mexican Jorge Ramirez Carrillo took the place of a contestant who was unable to arrive on time at Ashton, and defeated the 1975 champion at the finals. The Men's champion has been British in every other year except 1998, when Helmut Kern from Nauort, Germany, won.

In 1999 the Irish Conker Championships began in [[Freshford, County Kilkenny]] in Ireland.

2000 saw the first Ladies' champion from outside the UK. Selma Becker, originally from Austria, took the title. The title of Queen of Conkers has remained in the UK, except in 2001 when Frenchwoman Celine Parachou won.

2001 Eamonn Dooley from Freshford in Co. Kilkenny, Ireland broke the world record by smashing 306 conkers in one hour.&lt;ref name="wcc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldconkerchampionships.com/html/news_gunton_conkers.html|title=World Conker Championships news|accessdate=2013-04-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055510/http://www.worldconkerchampionships.com/html/news_gunton_conkers.html|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 an alternative World Conker Championships was first hosted at Pill Harriers Rugby Club, Newport, Wales. This championship, known as the World Annual National Conker Championships, has been held every year since and is sanctioned by Dogfish Promotions. Contestants from America, Italy, England and Wales have taken part. 

==North America==
The North American Conker Championship was inaugurated on 20 October 2012 at the Historic Gardens&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicgardens.com/|title=Annapolis Royal Historic Gardens|work=historicgardens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the town of [[Annapolis Royal]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], hosted by the Annapolis Royal Conker Club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.annapolisroyalconkerclub.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first North American Conker Champion was Jeff Hafting, of Annapolis Royal, NS.

The 2013 North American Championship was similarly held on the third Saturday, 19 October, and the eventual winner of an all-female Final was Krystyna Schulz of Halifax, NS.

Victor of the 2014 North American Championship was Julian Smith of Yarmouth, NS.

In 2015 the Championship took place on 17 October, once more hosted at the Historic Gardens&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; in Annapolis Royal. The coveted Crofton Chalice was almost regained by Jeff Hafting, the Inaugural 2012 Champion, but he lost in the Final to Simon Bonnington of Granville Ferry, NS. This saw the return of the trophy to its home in Annapolis Royal.

2016 saw the Championship won by Elizabeth Mount of Bear River, NS. In the final bout she beat Oliver Bonnington, son of the 2015 Champion.

Remarkably the 2017 final was a re-match of the previous year as Oliver Bonnington once again tried to beat Elizabeth Mount. It was not to be, and Elizabeth became the first North American Champion to retain the Title. 

In the 2018 Championship on 13th October, Mount was eliminated in the first round; the eventual Champion that year was Amanda Carson of Kingston, NS, who defeated Rikarda Albright.

Prior to this recent re-emergence, it had been played during the late 1940s and early 1950s in New York in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, and in the 1950s and early 1960s in the Amalgamated section of the Bronx and nearby Mt.Vernon. A winning chestnut was referred to as a "killer" and the value of a chestnut was defined by its number of "kills." It was also played in Queens,  the upper West Side of Manhattan, in the Mohawk Valley area of upstate New York and in Westmount, Quebec and other English-speaking parts of Montreal into the 1970s. It was played in the Catholic areas of North Cambridge, MA in the late 1950s, and a winning chestnut was also labeled a "killer". It was being played in the 1960s in Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/conkers2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and into the early 1980s in Smithfield, RI.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
The game was also played in Leicester, Massachusetts in the late 1970s and into the 1980s (and presumably much earlier, given the town's age and predominantly English/Irish settlers) by the children of the Primary School of the town (typically 4th and 5th graders). Leicester's seat of government ("town hall") was a dual use building, serving as both town hall and school. There is a large horse chestnut tree located on the town's common (and adjacent to town hall) that was used as a source for the chestnuts.  The Leiecester variant on the name for the game was "Horse Cobblers"(presumably a variant of "Horse Conkers").&lt;ref&gt;[[Leicester, Massachusetts]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

In 2000 a survey of British schools by [[Keele University]] showed that many were not allowing children to play conkers, as head teachers were afraid of the legal consequences if children were injured while playing the game, or because they thought that the conkers might be used as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1060708.stm |title=Conkers hit by legal fears |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=8 December 2000 |website=ews.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News |access-date=25 October 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TV programme [[Top Gear (current format)|''Top Gear'']] later staged a game of conkers using caravans (travel trailers) suspended from cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/van-conkers|title=Van conkers |publisher=Top Gear|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After putting on safety goggles, presenter [[James May]] commented "I now feel perfectly happy about being hit in the face by a caravan." ''Top Gear'', along with other media commentators, wrongly stated that the wearing of goggles during the game was due to an official [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) edict when it was in fact due to a myth which started when a headmaster bought goggles for children to use as a parody of health and safety regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/myth/september.htm|title=Myth: Kids must wear goggles to play conkers|publisher=Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsored a Conkers tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7637605.stm|title=Conkers get safety group backing |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-10-27 | date=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, several schools banned conkers due to fear of causing [[anaphylactic shock]] in pupils with nut allergies.  Health advisers said that there were no known dangers from conkers for nut-allergy sufferers, although some may experience a mild rash through handling them.&lt;ref name=allergyban&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3722810.stm BBC News: ''School bans 'nut allergy' conkers''] (7 October 2009) (Accessed 2009-03-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Courtenay Place''' is the main street of the Courtenay Quarter in the [[Wellington]], New Zealand inner-city district of [[Te Aro]].

Courtenay Place is known for its entertainment and nightlife. Many restaurants are open late and most of the bars stay open until dawn. It contains offices, accommodation, tourist shopping, entertainment, food, art and buskers offering many genres of free performance. Pedestrian traffic is substantial around the clock.

== Early development ==
[[File:Courtenay Place, circa 1900 (4839950942).jpg|alt=A black and white photo of the view east down Courtenay Place, around 1900|left|thumb|The view east down Courtenay Place, around 1900]]
The first building of any importance in Courtenay Place was built shortly after 1900 by local butcher and businessman, [[John William Rod (New Zealand)|John Rod]] JP.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Evening Post'',13 Jan 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a heritage listed building, originally designed by T S Lambert, situated on the eastern corner of Allen Street and Courtenay Place. Of brick construction, it originally had three stories and a large cellar, with stables at the rear (now 23 Allen street).&lt;ref&gt;Original Plans held by Wellington City Archives&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been reduced to two stories, probably due to earthquake damage. In 2015, the ground floor and cellars accommodate a bar and restaurant.

==The arts==

Every two years Courtenay Place is home to many of the [[New Zealand International Arts Festival]] events.

'''[[Bats Theatre]]''' is a venue for the development of new theatre practitioners and plays.

'''[[Downstage Theatre]]''', founded in 1964, is New Zealand's first professional theatre.

'''[[Embassy Theatre (Wellington)|Embassy Theatre]]''' ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' movie ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' had its world premiere at the Embassy Theatre at the head of Courtenay Place. The movies ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' both had their [[Australasia]]n premiere at the Embassy (Event Slide Shows). Both events were broadcast live to the world for many hours, involving the movement of record amounts of data by [[CityLink Limited|CityLink]]. The theatre is on the Wellington City Council's heritage list in the District Plan. [[Heritage New Zealand]] has recognised its heritage values with Category One registration, indicating a place of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'. It was originally known as the 'De Luxe' and was built in 1924. Designed by Llewellyn Williams and constructed of reinforced concrete, it included classical external and internal architectural details. The name changed to the Embassy in 1945. A long list of theatre identities has been associated with the theatre, including [[William Kemball]], who formed the [[De Luxe Theatre Company]] in 1923, and [[Sir Robert Kerridge]]. [[Kerry Robins]], leaseholder of the Paramount Theatre in Wellington, took over the lease of the Embassy in 1996. It was purchased by the [[Embassy Theatre Trust]] in 1997 with financial underwriting of the refurbishment programme by Wellington City Council. Ownership was transferred to the WCC under the terms of the agreement. Embassy Theatre Trust subsidiary Company Financial report: Audit report In October 2005 Wellington film exhibitor Kerry Robins sold the operational management of the Embassy to Village SkyCity Cinemas.

'''Paramount Theatre''' (no longer operational) is the oldest surviving cinema in Wellington, still with its original name. Originally a part of Te Aro beach, in August 1916 the location of the Paramount was purchased by [[John James Williamson]]. He arranged for architect [[James Bennie]] to design a picture house.

'''Reading Courtenay Central Complex''' contains shops, restaurants and a ten-screen multiplex cinema. The 8,000 m² development links Courtenay Place with the waterfront and was designed to complement the existing character of the strip. This project won the 2003 Property Council NZ Entertainment Excellence Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignite-direct.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060402210211/http://ignite-direct.com/ |date=2 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was originally bulldozed in the mid-1980s by [[Chase Corporation]] for the proposed Wakefield Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vertical Living: The Architectural Centre and the Remaking of Wellington|author=Julia Gatley, Kunal Hari, Damian Skinner, Justine Clark|page=|year=2014|publisher=Auckland University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the company fell victim to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 sharemarket crash]], the site remained derelict for years until it was purchased by Reading Cinemas. The complex was temporarily shut down for safety reasons, after a large earthquake in late 2016 damaged an adjacent parking building beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/nz-earthquake/88029844/big-bertha-crane-moves-in-for-reading-cinema-car-park-demolition|title='Big Bertha' crane moves in for Reading Cinema car park demolition|date=2016-12-30|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision]]''' (aka NZ Film Archive) is on the corner of Ghuznee St and Taranaki St, a block from Courtenay Place.

'''[[Opera House (Wellington)|The Opera House]]'''

'''[[St James Theatre (Wellington)|St James Theatre]]'''. Formerly His Majesty's (and more recently the Westpac St James Theatre), the St. James was designed for [[John Fuller and Sons Ltd]] by Mr [[Henry Eli White]] Architect, structural engineer and contractor. It was the first steel-framed concrete-coated proscenium-arched theatre in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The steel frame allowed for an unsupported 80&amp;nbsp;ft (25 m) span roof structure and also provided good resistance to earthquake damage.

In July 2011, Positively Wellington Venues, an integration between the Wellington Convention Centre and the St James Theatre Trust, began managing this theatre as well as The Opera House, Wellington.

There are two other theatres that sit just outside the Courtenay Place district, '''Circa Theatre''' which sits on the waterfront near Te Papa; and '''Capital E''', home of the National Theatre for Children, which is in Civic Square.

==Events==

'''Crisis Text Line''' is a global not-for-profit organization providing free crisis intervention via [[SMS message]]. The organization's services are available 24 hours a day every day, throughout the US by texting 741741 or Canada by texting 686868.

As of October 26, 2018, Crisis Text Line has processed 86 million text messages.&lt;ref name="Crisis Trends" group=&gt;{{cite web|title=Crisis Trends|url=http://www.crisistrends.org|website=Crisis Text Line|accessdate=October 30, 2017|ref=a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text line is notable among hotlines for its triage system, in which conversations are assessed by an algorithm for severity and queued accordingly.&lt;ref name="Ted" /&gt;
==History==

Crisis Text Line was conceptualized as a result of [[Do Something]]'s mobile interactions with its members. Do Something CEO [[Nancy Lublin]] states that as members increasingly sent deeply personal text messages, she saw a need for a separate channel for these messages in order to better assist the young people sending them. In public appearances, Lublin specifically cites a series of texts reading "He won't stop raping me... It's my dad." as an impetus for creating Crisis Text Line.&lt;ref name ="Ted" group=&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lublin|first1=Nancy|title=Texting that saves lives|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_lublin_texting_that_saves_lives|website=TED|publisher=TED|accessdate=July 6, 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service was given a quiet launch in August 2013 through a text message to Do Something members in Chicago and [[El Paso]], and was soon being used by texters in every United States [[area code]].&lt;ref name="Ted" /&gt; Today, 350 people text the service daily, most of whom discovered the service through word-of-mouth.&lt;ref name="Glamour" group=&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Alex|title=How Crisis Text Line Founder Nancy Lublin Is Saving Lives, Text by Text|url=http://www.glamour.com/inspired/2015/06/crisis-text-line-founder-nancy-lublin|website=Glamour|accessdate=July 6, 2015|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, it was announced that Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile would be waiving fees for use of the service, and that texts to Crisis Text Line would not appear on billing records.&lt;ref name="re/code" group=&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fried|first1=Ina|title=Carriers Waive Charges for Crisis Text Line|url=http://recode.net/2015/07/07/carriers-waive-charges-for-crisis-text-line/|website=re/code|accessdate=July 8, 2015|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity for the move, including a high-profile blog post by Richard Branson, prompted AT&amp;T to follow suit.&lt;ref name="Branson" group=&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branson|first1=Richard|title=Texting in a Crisis: The Inspiring Story of Nancy Lublin|url=http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/texting-in-a-crisis|ref=L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each mobile carrier omits the texts to the hotline from billing records to avoid alerting abusive family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-the-best-nonprofits-know-about-strategy|title=What the Best Nonprofits Know About Strategy|date=2018-08-09|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Crisis Text Line announced via the [[Do Something]] blog that it would be taking steps to become a resource for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing. A text message to the service reading, "I can't call suicide hotlines because I can't hear, so I was hoping I could use this service" was mentioned as an inspiration for this announcement. Specifically, the blog post mentioned accessible training for Crisis Counselors, and creating education around working with Deaf texters.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post" group=&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Jared|title=Finally, a Crisis Hotline the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Community Can Use|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/crisis-text-line/finally-a-crisis-hotline-_b_8136694.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=February 1, 2016|ref=w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Data Scientist Bob Filbin was highlighted in [[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]] as one of their 40 Under 40 for his work using data to inform Crisis Text Line's efforts. Speaking about the difference between Crisis Text Line's corpus and other mental health data, he said, "This is people in their greatest moment of crisis. Most of the other data on mental health and crisis is survey data, which is collected after the fact. It’s people remembering." &lt;ref name="Chronicle" group=&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Nicole|title=Bob Filbin: Counting Texts, Saving Lives|url=https://philanthropy.com/article/40-Under-40-Bob-Filbin-/234750|website=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|accessdate=February 1, 2016|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Crisis Text Line announced that it was now offering its service via [[Facebook Messenger]]. Messenger would be the third channel of communication between texters and crisis counselors, after SMS and [[Kik Messenger|Kik]]. {{cite web|last1=Lublin|first1=Nancy|title=from the desk of Founder/CEO Nancy Lublin...|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/crisis-text-line/from-the-desk-of-founderceo-nancy-lublin/1108844692594948/|website=Facebook|accessdate=November 28, 2017|ref=y}}.

Crisis Text Line exchanged its 50 millionth message with a person in crisis in October 2017, four years after its launch.

==Crisis counselors==

Crisis counselors are all at least eighteen years old, and are selected through an application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crisistextline.org/join-our-efforts/volunteer/|title=Volunteer {{!}} Crisis Text Line|website=www.crisistextline.org|access-date=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once selected, they are required to submit a background check, complete thirty hours of training, and pass a final evaluation. Graduated crisis counselors commit to 200 total volunteer hours.&lt;ref name="New Yorker2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/r-u|title=R U There?|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast|ref=4|last1=Gregory|first1=Alice|date=February 9, 2015|access-date=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==

In order to ensure best practices and effectiveness in training, counseling, technological development, and organizational structure, Crisis Text Line consults with both a board of directors and an expert National Advisory Board.

The board of directors includes founder/CEO Nancy Lublin; danah boyd, Ph.D., the principal researcher at [[Microsoft]] research; and [[David Drummond (Google)|David Drummond]] of [[Google]].&lt;ref name="Board of Directors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.crisistextline.org/who-we-are/board-of-directors/|website=Crisis Text Line|access-date=July 15, 2015|ref=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Shairi Turner was hired as the organization's first Chief Medical Officer in September 2017. According to a blog post from Crisis Text Line, "Dr. Turner’s role will focus on ensuring continued delivery of high quality crisis support to texters and being a leading voice for the org’s primary goals: innovation and empathy." &lt;ref name="Chief Medical Officer"&gt; {{cite web|title=Chief Medical Officer|url=https://www.crisistextline.org/blog/drturner|website=CrisisTextLine.org|access-date=November 28, 2017|ref=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data and CrisisTrends.org==
[[File:Crisis Trends anxiety map August 2014.png|thumb|right|A map depicting frequency of anxiety in the United States, made using Crisis Text Line data and available on crisistrends.org in August 2014]]
Crisistrends.org is a product of Crisis Text Line that, using data derived from the text messages received, compiles and provides information about crises in the United States. Describing potential uses of this data, Lublin told ''Glamour'', "If you know anxiety peaks from 7:00 to 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm, schools could schedule their guidance counselors to be available then".&lt;ref name="Glamour" /&gt;

Crisistrends.org was launched in August 2014. Data on CrisisTrends.org are anonymized.

===Repeat Texters===

In late 2014, Chief Data Scientist Bob Filbin discovered that 3 percent of texters were using 34 percent of organization resources. "Over the next six months, he helped find ways to identify them and move them on to services that could more effectively help them," reports ''Colgate Scene''.&lt;ref name="Colgate Scene"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gusman|first1=Phil|date=Spring 2015|title=Safety in numbers|url=http://news.colgate.edu/scene/2016/05/bob-filbin-data-science-crisis-counseling.html|website=Colagate Scene|publisher=Colgate University|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that the change led to 24,000 additional texters helped in 2015.

===Topic-Specific Findings===

In December 2015, Crisis Text Line made headlines by releasing data that implied that bullying and harassment against [[Muslims]] was on the rise. Lublin was quoted as saying, "These political scare tactics have real implications on everyday Americans."&lt;ref name="CNN Money"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stelter|first1=Brian|date=December 9, 2015|title=Muslim bullying fears on the rise, hotline says|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/09/media/muslim-bullying-harassment-crisis-text-line/|website=CNN Money|publisher=CNN|access-date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crisis Text Line experienced a noteworthy increase in volume immediately after [[Donald Trump]]'s election as [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name="CNN Election"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ravitz|first1=Jessica|date=November 11, 2016|title=Calls to crisis and suicide prevention hotlines surge post-election|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/health/election-crisis-suicide-prevention-hotlines/|website=CNN|publisher=CNN|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the data revealed that "election" and "scared" were the words that overindexed most in the days after the election, and that the word "scared" was most frequently associated with [[LGBTQ]] texters.

The [[Wall Street Journal]] reported on Crisis Text Line's data about prom-related crises, noting that financial concerns were the most prevalent cause of prom-related conversations with the service.&lt;ref name="Prom WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rappaport|first1=Liz|title=Dial Down the Stress of Prom|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/dial-down-the-stress-of-prom-1464800760|website=Wired|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the service's data around military texters revealed that active duty service members and veterans make up 2.4% of texters, and that these texters are more likely to be struggling with suicidal ideation or substance abuse.&lt;ref name="Military"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=John|title=
R U there? Crisis Text Line provides new lifeline for troops and veterans|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/story/life/2016/07/07/crisis-text-line-veterans-military-counseling-help/86525026/|website=Military Times|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictive data===

Lublin told [[Wired (website)|Wired]] that the data are helping counselors by using keywords to predict the subject matter of a conversation. A profile reads: "As the software analyzes incoming texts, it can send counselors targeted messages like, 'There’s a 99 percent chance this texter has a substance abuse issue. Here are three rehab programs within the texter’s area code.'" &lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hempel|first1=Jessi|title=Texts From Teens Build Real-Time Maps of Crisis in America|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/texts-teens-build-real-time-maps-crisis-america/|website=Wired|access-date=July 15, 2015|ref=q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enclave data===

In 2016, Crisis Text Line launched enclave data, available to university researchers and research institutions. Interested researchers were able to apply for selective pulls of conversation data. Texters have the option to opt out completely of being included in this data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisistextline.org/open-data/faq/|title=Enclave Data FAQ - Crisis Text Line|author=|date=|work=CrisisTextLine.org|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was discontinued in 2017 and relaunched in 2018 as [https://www.crisistextline.org/open-data-collaborations Open Data Collaborations]. 

==International==

Crisis Text Line has launched its service in [[Canada]] with affiliate [[Kids Help Phone]], and the [[United Kingdom]] with [[Mental Health Innovations]].

Sutherland was a prolific artist and his work heavily influenced the early development of ''D&amp;D''.

==Early life and inspiration==
Sutherland was born April 4, 1949&lt;ref name="SSDI"/&gt; in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and was a graduate of Minneapolis' [[Roosevelt High School (Minneapolis)|Roosevelt High School]].&lt;ref name=StarTribuneObit&gt;{{cite news |title=Illustrator David Sutherland dies at 56 |author= Hahn, Trudi|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133418135.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]| page=B6 |date= 21 June 2005|accessdate=21 April 2012}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; He trained as a commercial artist for two years at the [[Minneapolis Area Vocational Technical Institute]] before serving in the [[United States Army]] as a [[military police]] officer in the [[Vietnam War]], serving in 1969–1970.&lt;ref name=StarTribuneObit /&gt; After his return from the war, he began his career as a fantasy artist, while working odd jobs.&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt; His artistic talents were nurtured and developed by his father, a fellow artist.  David C. Sutherland II worked in the paper industry and  encouraged his son by bringing home creative materials and supplies.

He became involved with the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] (SCA) in the early 1970s. He spent his free time drawing sketches and cartoons related to these pastimes.

==Career==
[[Image:DungeonMasterGuide4Cover.jpg|thumb|Sutherland's cover for the original ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' (TSR, 1979)]]

Sutherland's involvement in game art began in 1974. After meeting Michael Mornard, a player in Gary Gygax' "Greyhawk" and then Dave Arneson's "Blackmoor" in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism|SCA]], he was introduced to Professor [[M.A.R. Barker]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1975. Barker was designing ''[[Tékumel]]'', an imaginary world for use with ''D&amp;D'', published by [[TSR, Inc.]], the Wisconsin-based company that became the dominant publisher of role-playing games.

The professor put him in touch with TSR,&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt; and soon after, Sutherland was working for TSR.{{When|date=March 2010}} Sutherland worked with the ''D&amp;D'' game's co-inventor, [[Gary Gygax]], as part of a team of illustrators, including [[Erol Otus]], [[Darlene Pekul]], [[David A. Trampier|David Trampier]], and others.&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt; Sutherland also worked as TSR's artistic director, but preferred working on his own illustrations.&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt; He worked at TSR until 1997 when the company was in the process of being purchased by [[Wizards of the Coast]] and he was not offered further employment.&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt;

After his relationship with TSR ended, Sutherland found it difficult to find work and, according to friends, felt abandoned by the gaming industry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Recently divorced,{{When|date=March 2010}} Sutherland remained upset about the dissolution of his marriage,&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt; became despondent and his health began to fail.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} An auction of Sutherland memorabilia—including artwork, miniature sculptures, games, and game memorabilia—was held in 2004, raising [[United States dollar|USD]]$22,000, used to set up a [[trust fund]] for his two daughters.&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt;

He died of chronic liver failure on June 6, 2005 in his home in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituaries: David Sutherland |author= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-40960.html |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]]|date=18 June 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2012| page=B7}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried on June 22, 2005 with full military honors at [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt; He is survived by his two daughters, Susan and Heather, and his mother, sister, and brother.&lt;ref name="SFWA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfwa.org/News/ssutherland.htm |title=Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers of America obituary for Sutherland |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626100702/http://www.sfwa.org/News/ssutherland.htm |archivedate=June 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==
* He wrote the [[Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|adventure module]] ''[[Queen of the Demonweb Pits]]'' (Q1) (with some editing from Gary Gygax).
* He created the [[wemic]], a ''D&amp;D'' lion-centaur.
* He drew the famous and popular [[Isometric projection|isometric]] maps of Castle Ravenloft for the 1st Edition ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''AD&amp;D'') adventure module ''[[Ravenloft (D&amp;D module)|Ravenloft]]''.  As the newly revised version of the module, ''[[Expedition to Castle Ravenloft]]'', explains in the introduction, these maps were "such a powerful aid to play that a generation of Dungeon Masters still fondly recall them and reemploy them whenever possible."  Sutherland is even honored in the story of this newest version of the ''Ravenloft'' module, as there is a mention of a "Dhavit Uthurlan" as the designer of the castle.
*He is the cover artist for the first edition rules of the ''AD&amp;D'' ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]].''&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt;
*He illustrated the scene of a [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragon]], a [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|wizard]] and an armored [[Archery|archer]] on the first ''D&amp;D'' boxed set, "A simple composition, it shows a wand-waving magic user and a knight, his longbow drawn, squaring off against a dragon who sits – à la Smaug from The Hobbit – atop a vast pile of gold coins and jewels."&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt;
*He also illustrated the original cover of the first edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' ''[[Monster Manual]]''.&lt;ref name="CBC obit"/&gt;

The Boston Herald thought that by 1999, the titles had become predictable cash-ins to Disney movies, who would generally have voice actor replacements and the same structure as previous games in the series; the newspaper also commented that Activity Centre games were one part of the triad (along with the "action game" and the "print studio." that Disney Interactive would generally release with each new film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1999-08-01|title=Predictable Disney trots out Tarzan; Tarzan Activity Center, for ages 4-8; Tarzan Print Studio, for all ages; and Tarzan Action Game, for age 8 and up.

Other [[brass instruments]] can also be divided but it is not as frequent as with the Horn section. [[Woodwinds]] - especially [[Flutes]] and [[Clarinets]] - also utilize "divisi" to divide music between parts and even between players of the same part.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">'''EIAJ MTS''' is a multichannel television sound standard created by the [[EIAJ]].

Bilingual and stereo sound television programs started being broadcast in Japan in October 1978 using a system developed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories|NHK Technical Research Labs]]. This system was modified and standardized by the EIAJ in January 1979. 

The original version M TV standard has a monaural FM transmission at 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz. For Japanese multichannel television sound a second channel, or sub-channel, is added to the original signal by using an FM sub-carrier at twice the line frequency (Fh, or 15374&amp;nbsp;Hz). In order to identify the different modes (mono, stereo, or dual sound) a [[pilot tone]] is also added on an AM carrier at 3.5 times the line frequency. The pilot tone frequencies are 982.5&amp;nbsp;Hz for stereo and 922.5&amp;nbsp;Hz for dual sound. Contrary to [[Zweikanalton]] these pilot tones are not coupled to the line frequency but were instead chosen to allow use of filters already employed in the Pocket Bell [[pager]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Numaguchi|first=Yasutaka|title=Present Status of Multichannel-Sound Television Broadcasting in Japan|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|date=December 1979|volume=BC-25|issue=4|pages=128–136|doi=10.1109/TBC.1979.266340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eden Games''' (known as Eden Studios until 2003) is a [[game development studio]]. In May 2002, the company was sold to the [[Infogrames]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobygames.com/company/eden-games-sas&lt;/ref&gt; It is most well known for the ''[[V-Rally]]'' series of games, as well as the 2006 release ''[[Test Drive Unlimited]]''. They have most recently developed ''[[Test Drive Unlimited 2]]'', which was released in February 2011 for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[personal computer|PC]]. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Atari, SA]]. In 2013 Atari decided to close it. However, the company re-opened in 2014 under the impulsion of former employees and with the financing of ID Invest and Monster Capital. As of 2013, Eden Games have started up as a small independent games company, independent of Atari and releases its new game, GT Spirit, on Apple TV in December, 2015.

'''''Gadis Desa''''' (literally ''Maiden from the Village'') is a 1949 [[comedy film|comedy]] from what is now Indonesia{{efn|The film was released during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], in which time Indonesia had declared itself independent while the [[Dutch East Indies]] was still formally in existence.}} written and directed by [[Andjar Asmara]]. Starring Basuki Djaelani, Ratna Ruthinah, [[Ali Joego]], and Djauhari Effendi, it follows the romantic hijinks of a village girl who is taken to be a rich man's second wife. The film, produced by a Dutch-run company, is recognised as the first in which future "father of Indonesian film"{{sfn|Kurniasari 2012, Reviving}} [[Usmar Ismail]] was involved.

==Plot==
Abu Bakar ([[Ali Joego]]) attempts to evict Amat after the latter falls behind on his rent, only to fall in love with Amat's beautiful daughter  Aisah (Ratna Ruthinah). He says that she shall work as his maid, although he intends to make her his [[polygamy|second wife]]. Rusli (Basuki Zaelani), Aisah's cousin and a manservant at Abu Bakar's home, discovers this plan and tells Abu Bakar's wife. Aisah is sent back to her village and Rusli, who has fallen in love with her, proposes.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Gadis Desa}}

==Production==
''Gadis Desa'' was produced by the South Pacific Film Corp (SFPC), a film production house owned and run by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former colonial government of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The film was directed by the former journalist [[Andjar Asmara]], who had worked for SPFC since 1948.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Abisin Abbas}} The film was adapted from a stage play he had written for the travelling troupe [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]] in the early 1930s.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=361}}{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} He brought [[Usmar Ismail]], a young journalist with whom he had previously discussed filmmaking, to the production as an [[assistant director]].&lt;!--Ismail had only recently been released from prison after being accused of spying.--&gt;{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=361}}{{sfn|Said|1982|p=34}} The two [[Native Indonesians|native]] men had limited creative input, serving more as acting and [[dialogue coach]]es. The Dutch cameraman, AA Denninghoff-Stelling, held more power over the final product.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit}}

''Gadis Desa'' starred Ali Joego, Ratna Ruthinah, Basuki Zaelani, and Djauhari Effendi.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Gadis Desa}} All had had theatrical experience: Joego had been a member of Dardanella with Andjar, Ruthinah and her husband Zaelani&amp;nbsp;–making their feature film debut&amp;nbsp;– had been members of the Matahari touring troupe, while Djauhari had been active in the theatre during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] beginning seven years earlier.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ruth Threse Niesen}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ali Yugo}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djauhari Effendi}}

==Release and reception==
''Gadis Desa'' was released in 1949,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Gadis Desa}} followed by a novelisation in 1950.{{sfn|Imanjaya|2006|p=90}} Although he does not record its box-office performance, the Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] suggests that the film's dated plot was reflective of a Dutch belief that native audiences would prefer unsophisticated comedy.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=363}} A [[35&amp;nbsp;mm]] copy is kept at [[Sinematek Indonesia]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Gadis Desa}}

The film proved Andjar's last as a director; he resigned from SPFC before its next production, ''[[Tjitra]]'' (1949), and spent the rest of his film career as a screenwriter.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Abisin Abbas}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=363}} Ismail would go on to become two films for SFPC, ''Tjitra'' and ''Harta Karun'' (1949), and, after the Netherlands recognised Indonesia's independence, he established himself as the "father of Indonesian film" with ''[[Darah dan Doa]]'' (1950).{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=363}}{{sfn|Kurniasari 2012, Reviving}} SPFC would produce four further films before being dissolved in 1949.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, South Pacific}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=367}}

{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}
The '''Giant Robot Project''' is an undertaking by [[Canadians|Canadian]] inventor [[Jaimie Mantzel]] to construct a large six-legged [[robot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/science/article432472.ece Inventor builds a robot large enough to ride in] ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' March 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120415041323/http://jamius.com/Life.html Jaimie's life story...] "[[JME's world]]" April 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The robot is approximately {{nowrap|3.0 to 3.7 meter}} in height with a similar dimension in width and is made primarily from [[scrap metal]] and [[aluminum]] tubing. The machine is powered by a central [[electric motor]] system that mechanically transfers energy to the legs. To walk, the machine lifts 3 of its legs forward while pushing the remaining 3 legs backward against the ground in an alternating cycle. The system is designed in such a way that it can seamlessly adjust its direction of movement based on the rotation of the [[motor controller|drive]] section located at the center of the machine. As of 2010, the robot had no onboard power system in place yet and during initial testing had to be [[tethered]] to external power sources.

Fabrication of the full-scale robot began in 2007 and intermittently continued until December 2010 when an initial and short "Test Drive" was taken.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVhr8FrtmOo youtube.com - Giant Robot Project Test Drive] December 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This brief test demonstrated the structural soundness of the design in general but also highlighted material weaknesses. These currently are being or have since been improved upon through continual upgrades or alterations of the robot.

Complementing the construction, a series of video logs of progress made on the project have been uploaded to [[YouTube]]. Because of this, Mantzel has gained a following of supporters who occasionally make material or financial contributions to the Giant Robot Project.

A smaller version of the robot referred to as the 'Spider Tank' is also in development and serves as a scale model for many of the technologies and design features incorporated into the larger robot.

In [[Chinese culture]], '''Guci''' ({{zh|s=鼓词|t=鼓詞|p=Gǔcí|l=drum lyrics}}) are the [[prose|prosimetric]] lyrics of ''[[dagu (music)|dagu]]'', one musical entertainment form in the ''[[shuochang]]'' or "speak and sing" genre. The performers narrate a story based on the lyrics, usually accompanied by singing, while beating a [[drum]]. Other accompanying musical instruments are [[sanxian]], [[sihu (instrument)|sihu]], [[pipa]] and [[yangqin]]. The art form was very popular during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Robert E. (1998). ''Reading Illustrated Fiction in Late Imperial China.'' [[Stanford University Press]]. pp.26, 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore extant ''guci'' are very important in studying Chinese fiction from those period.&lt;ref&gt;Hanan, Patrick. (2004). ''Chinese Fiction of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries: Essays.'' [[Columbia University Press]]. p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brain Ray rocking Viniyl - Guitar Clinic at Redbone Guitar Boutique, 2009-06-13.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Guitarist [[Brian Ray]] soloing.]]
A '''guitar solo''' is a [[melodic]] passage, instrumental [[section (music)|section]], or entire piece of music written for a [[classical guitar]], [[electric guitar]] or an [[acoustic guitar]]. In the 20th and 21st century [[traditional music]] and [[popular music]] such as [[blues]], [[Swing music|swing]], [[jazz]], [[jazz fusion]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[heavy metal music|metal]] guitar [[solo (music)|solos]] often contain virtuoso techniques and varying degrees of [[improvisation]]. Guitar solos on [[classical guitar]], which are typically written in [[musical notation]], are also used in [[classical music]] forms such as [[chamber music]] and [[concerto]]s.

Guitar solos range from unaccompanied works for a single guitar to compositions with [[accompaniment]] from a few other instruments or a large ensemble. The accompaniment musicians for a guitar solo can range from a small ensemble such as a [[jazz quartet]] or a rock [[musical ensemble|band]], to a large ensemble such as an [[orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Unaccompanied acoustic guitar music is found in [[folk music|folk]] and [[European classical music|classical]] music dating as far back as the instrument has existed, and the use of an acoustic guitar as a solo voice within an ensemble dates back at least to the [[Baroque]] [[concerto]].

==Classical guitar==
[[File:Andrés Segovia (1962).jpg|thumb|Classical guitar soloist [[Andrés Segovia]] (1962)]]
The [[classical guitar]] (also called the Spanish guitar) is an acoustical wooden guitar with six strings, usually nylon, as opposed to the metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitars. Classical guitar is typically played by plucking individual strings with the fingernails or, rarely, the fingertips. A classical guitar solo concert is typically called a [[recital]]; it may include a variety of works, e.g. works written originally for the lute or vihuela by composers such as [[John Dowland]] (b. Ireland 1563) and [[Luis de Narváez]] (b. Spain c. 1500), and also music written for the harpsichord by [[Domenico Scarlatti]] (b. Italy 1685), for the baroque lute by [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]] (b. Germany 1687), for the baroque guitar by [[Robert de Visée]] (b. France c. 1650) or even Spanish-flavored music written for the piano by [[Isaac Albéniz]] (b. Spain 1860) and [[Enrique Granados]] (b. Spain 1867). The most important composer who did not write for the guitar but whose music is often played on it is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (b. Germany 1685), whose baroque [[lute]] works have proved highly adaptable to the instrument.

Of music written originally for guitar, the earliest important composers are from the classical period and include [[Fernando Sor]] (b. Spain 1778) and [[Mauro Giuliani]] (b. Italy 1781), both of whom wrote in a style strongly influenced by Viennese classicism. In the 19th century guitar composers such as [[Johann Kaspar Mertz]] (b. Slovakia, Austria 1806) were strongly influenced by the dominance of the piano. Not until the end of the nineteenth century did the guitar begin to establish its own unique identity. [[Francisco Tárrega]] (b. Spain 1852) was central to this, sometimes incorporating stylized aspects of flamenco's Moorish influences into his romantic miniatures. This was part of late 19th century mainstream European musical nationalism. Albéniz and Granados were central to this movement; their evocation of the guitar was so successful that their compositions have been absorbed into standard guitar repertoire.

Some classical guitarists play [[concerto]]s, which are solos written for performance with the accompaniment of an [[orchestra]]. Not many classical guitar concertos have been written, however, which may perhaps be laid to the imbalance between the volume of multi-instrumental orchestra as compared to a single guitar.  Nevertheless, some guitar concertos are nowadays wide known and popular, especially [[Joaquín Rodrigo]]'s ''[[Concierto de Aranjuez]]'' (with the famous theme from 2nd movement) and ''[[Fantasía para un gentilhombre]]''. Composers who also wrote well known guitar concertos are: [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (originally for mandolin or lute), [[Mauro Giuliani]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]], [[Manuel Ponce]], [[Leo Brouwer]] and [[Lennox Berkeley]]. In the 2000s, contemporary composers are increasingly writing guitar concertos.

===History===
Composers of the Renaissance period who wrote for four course guitar include [[Alonso Mudarra]], [[Miguel de Fuenllana]], [[Adrian Le Roy]] and [[Guillaume de Morlaye]]. Some well known composers of the baroque guitar were [[Gaspar Sanz]], [[Robert de Visée]] and [[Francesco Corbetta]]. From approximately 1780 to 1850, the guitar had numerous composers and performers including: [[Filippo Gragnani]] (1767–1820), [[Antoine de Lhoyer]] (1768–1852), [[Ferdinando Carulli]] (1770–1841), [[Francesco Molino]] (1774–1847), [[Fernando Sor]] (1778–1839), [[Mauro Giuliani]] (1781–1829), [[Niccolò Paganini]] (1782–1840), [[Dionisio Aguado]] (1784 – 1849), [[Luigi Legnani]] (1790–1877), [[Matteo Carcassi]] (1792–1853), [[Napoléon Coste]] (1805–1883) and [[Johann Kaspar Mertz]] (1806–1856). Beginning in the 1920s, guitar soloist [[Andrés Segovia]] popularized the guitar with tours and early phonograph recordings. Modern classical guitar solo performers who are known for playing modern repertoire include [[Leo Brouwer]], [[John Schneider (guitarist)|John Schneider]], [[Reinbert Evers]], [[Maria Kämmerling]], [[Siegfried Behrend]], [[David Starobin]], [[Mats Scheidegger]], [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]], and [[Magnus Andersson (guitarist)|Magnus Andersson]].

==Traditional and popular music==

===Blues, R&amp;B and rock and roll===
[[File:B.B. King in 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|American blues guitarist and singer [[B.B. King]] in 2009.]]
Even though guitar solos are used in a wide range of genres, the term "guitar solo" often refers to [[electric guitar]] solos played in [[blues]] and in [[rock music|rock]]. Unlike acoustic guitars like the classical guitar or steel-string guitar, the electric guitar is played through a [[guitar amplifier]] to make the instrument [[Up to eleven|loud enough]]. Guitar amplifiers also have preamplifier and tone controls, and in some cases, [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] controls that modify the tone. The use of a guitar solo as an instrumental interlude was developed by [[blues]] musicians such as [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Muddy Waters]], and [[T-Bone Walker]], and [[jazz]] like [[Charlie Christian]]. [[Ernest Tubb]]'s 1940 [[honky tonk]] classic, ''Walking the Floor over You'' was the first "hit" recording to feature and highlight a solo by a standard electric guitar–though earlier hits featured electric [[lap steel guitar]]s. Blues master [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]] had also recorded at least one electric guitar solo, but his innovation was neither much noted nor influential.

[[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Willie Dixon]], and [[Jimmy Reed]] played in Chicago in a style characterized by the use of electric guitar, sometimes [[slide guitar]], [[harmonica]], and a [[rhythm section]] of bass and drums.&lt;ref name=pc4&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|4| |Howlin' Wolf &amp; Jimmy Reed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s, a new blues style emerged on Chicago's [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] pioneered by [[Magic Sam]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Otis Rush]] on [[Cobra Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Koroma, pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The 'West Side Sound' had strong rhythmic support from a rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as pefected by Guy, [[Freddie King]], [[Magic Slim]] and [[Luther Allison]] was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/151.html|title=Blues|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Side Chicago Blues|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=11835|work=All about Jazz|author=C. Michael Bailey|date=October 4, 2003|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other blues artists, such as [[John Lee Hooker]] had influences not directly related to the Chicago style. John Lee Hooker's blues is more "personal," based on Hooker's deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar.

These and other blues guitarists inspired the appearance of many virtuoso [[blues rock]] fusion soloists, beginning in 1963 with [[Lonnie Mack]]'s first major recordings.&lt;ref&gt; Mack augmented his blues solos with fast-picking country techniques, and set them to a rock beat. His early recordings are widely regarded as a critical milestone in the rise of the electric guitar's role to that of a lead voice in rock music. See, Wikipedia article on Lonnie Mack.&lt;/ref&gt; One such soloist, [[Jimi Hendrix]], was a rarity in his field at the time: a black man who played [[psychedelic rock]]. Hendrix was a skilled guitarist, and a pioneer in the innovative use of [[distortion]] and [[audio feedback]] in his music.&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pgs. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; Through these artists and others, blues music influenced the development of [[rock music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infernality.blogspot.com/2006/09/origins-and-early-popularity-1960s-and.html|title=History of heavy metal: Origins and early popularity (1960s and early 1970s)|date=September 18, 2006|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important blues rock guitar soloist in the 1960s and 1970s was [[Eric Clapton]], a white performer. In the early 1970s, the [[Texas blues|Texas rock-blues style]] emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles (e.g., [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], a white performer).

===Rock===
The earliest rock guitar solos, as exemplified by popular recordings of [[Duane Eddy]] and [[Link Wray]] in the late 1950s, were relatively simple instrumental melodies.&lt;ref&gt; Describing all of these as "inherently simple": Brown &amp; Newquist, ''Legends of Rock Guitar'', Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997, at p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s, instrumental [[surf music]] represented a step forward in the sonic complexity of rock guitar melodies. In 1963, the dramatic, technically advanced electric guitar solo rose to the fore with [[Lonnie Mack]]'s hit records, "Memphis" and "Wham!" (later covered by [[The Ventures]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and others), and soon, with the advent of [[blues rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-late 1960s, became a characteristic part of rock music. Later still, guitar solos became a defining feature of the rock genre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], in which most songs feature a solo. Metal solos often showcase the virtuosity of the guitarists, especially in metal styles that use [[shred guitar]] techniques for rapid playing of scales and arpeggios.  Since the 1960s, electric guitarists have often altered the [[timbral|timbre]] of their guitar adding electronic [[effects unit|guitar effects]] such as [[reverb]], [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], and [[chorus effect|chorus]] to make the sound fuller and add harmonic overtones. Other effects used in solos include the [[wah pedal]] and the [[talk box]].

Rock bands often have two guitarists, designated "[[lead guitar|lead]]" and "[[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]", with the lead player performing the solos and instrumental melody lines while the rhythm player accompanies with chords or [[riff]]s. In some cases, two guitarists share the lead role. Most rock music is based around [[song]]s in [[traditional]] [[form (music)|forms]]. The main [[form (music)|formal]] features are [[Verse (popular music)|verse]]s, [[refrain|chorus]]es, and [[bridge (music)|bridges]]. The guitar solo is usually the most significant [[instrumental]] section of a [[mainstream]] rock song. In other rock-related genres, such as pop and dance music, the [[synthesizer]] usually plays this role.

In classic [[verse–chorus form]], it often falls between the second chorus and third verse. Extended guitar solos are sometimes used as a song’s outro, such as [[Christopher Cross]]' "[[Ride Like the Wind]]", [[Radiohead]]’s "[[Paranoid Android]]", [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]’s "[[Free Bird]]", [[The Stooges]]' "[[I Wanna Be Your Dog]]", [[Pink Floyd]]’s "[[Comfortably Numb]]", [[Guns N' Roses]]’ "[[November Rain]]", [[Metallica]]’s "[[Fade to Black (song)|Fade to Black]]", [[Led Zeppelin]]’s "[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]", [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s "[[Who's Crying Now]]", [[The Cult]]'s "[[Love Removal Machine]]", [[The Beatles]]’ "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", [[38 Special (band)|.38 Special]]'s "[[Hold On Loosely]]", [[The Rolling Stones]]’ "[[Sway (The Rolling Stones song)|Sway]]", [[Pearl Jam]]’s "[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]", [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]’ "[[Dani California]]", [[Cream (band)|Cream]]’s "[[White Room]]", [[AC/DC]]’s "[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]", [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]]’ "[[Green Grass and High Tides]]", [[The Alan Parsons Project]]’s "[[Eye in the Sky (song)|Eye in the Sky]]" and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]’ "[[Hotel California]]".

Solos can take place in the intro, such as "[[Voodoo Child (Slight Return)]]" by [[Jimi Hendrix]], "[[Since I've Been Loving You]]" by Led Zeppelin, "[[One (Metallica song)|One]]"  by Metallica, "[[Lazy (Deep Purple song)|Lazy]]" by [[Deep Purple]], "[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]], "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" by [[Chuck Berry]], "[[Don't Take Me Alive]]" by [[Steely Dan]], "[[Raised on Rock (Scorpions song)|Raised on Rock]]" by [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] and "[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]" by Pink Floyd.

[[File:Eddie Van Halan - 77 in New Haven.jpg|thumb|alt=A |[[Eddie Van Halen]] in 1977]]
The use of guitar solos in [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] was notable during the 1980s, when rapid-fire "[[shred guitar|shredding]]" solos were common; a virtuostic lead guitarist of a band might be more well-known than the singer. During this time, players began to use advanced [[harmonics]] techniques more widely. Later, guitarists who had developed considerable technical facility began to release albums with instrumental-only guitar [[Musical composition|compositions]]. Guitar solos in popular music waned in fashion in the middle 1990s, coinciding with the rise in popularity of [[nu metal]] and [[grunge]]. Nu metal differed significantly from previous sub-genres of metal and abandoned guitar solos altogether, except for a few rare lead fills here and there, whilst grunge did not wholly abandon solos and included them from time to time. Guitar solos likewise became less prominent in many [[pop music|pop]] and popular rock music styles; either being trimmed down to a short four-bar transition or omitted entirely, in a vast departure from the heavy usage of solos in classic rock music from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Classic rock revival music heavily features soloing, along with classic rock bands that are still active as of 2018.

Occasionally, a song contains a two-part guitar solo with both rhythm and lead guitar taking solos (e.g., "[[Master of Puppets (song)|Master of Puppets]]" by Metallica), or dual solos with both lead and rhythm playing complementary solos—such as with [[Twisted Sister]]’s "30", Iron Maiden's "[[Hallowed Be Thy Name]]", "[[The Trooper]]" or [[Megadeth]]'s "Mechanix". Some rock bands use harmonized dual lead guitar solos as part of their signature sound, such as [[Wishbone Ash]]. This was first popularized by [[the Allman Brothers Band]] in their album ''[[At Fillmore East]]''.

===Bass guitar solos===
Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is played through a [[bass amp|specialized amplifier]] to make the instrument louder and provided control over tone. The bass guitar came into use in popular music in the 1950s. While [[bass guitar]] solos are not common in popular music, some bands include bass solos in some songs, particularly heavy metal, [[funk]], and [[progressive rock]] bands. Some genres use bass guitar solos in most songs, such as [[jazz]] bands or [[jazz fusion]] groups. Bass solos are also common in certain styles of punk music. In a rock context, bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. While bass guitar solos appear on few studio albums from rock or pop bands, genres such as [[progressive rock]], [[fusion genre|fusion]]-influenced rock, and some types of heavy metal are more likely to include bass solos, both in studio albums and in live performances.

Player perform bass solos with a range of techniques, such as plucking or finger picking. In the 1960s, [[The Who]]'s bassist, [[John Entwistle]], performed a [[bass run|bass break]] on the song "[[My Generation (The Who song)|My Generation]]" using a [[plectrum]], though he intended to use his fingers—he simply couldn't drop the plectrum quickly enough. Many consider this one of the first bass solos in rock music, and one of the most recognizable. [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], on "[[Good Times Bad Times]]", the first song on their [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]], uses two bass solos in an influentially dynamic way, as a bridge (when the band drops out after the choruses) to the next verse (after the first chorus) and the guitar solo-driven coda (after the third chorus). [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s bassist, [[John Deacon]], occasionally played bass solos, notably in "[[Under Pressure]]" and "[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]". In the 1970s, [[Aerosmith]]'s bassist, [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]], played a bass intro on the song "[[Sweet Emotion]]" from their album ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]''. Thrash metal group [[Metallica]]'s 1983 debut album ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' features a solo by bassist [[Cliff Burton]] on "[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]", which some consider his greatest work.{{Who|date=July 2012}} [[John McVie]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] performed a notable bass solo on "[[The Chain]]" from the record-setting 1977 album ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]''.

[[Manowar]]'s bassist [[Joey DeMaio]] uses special piccolo bass for his extremely fast bass solos like "Sting of the Bumblebee" and "William's Tale". [[Green Day]] bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] played a bass solo on the song "No One Knows" from the 1992 album ''[[Kerplunk!]]'' and on the song "Makeout Party" from the 2012 album ''[[¡Dos!]]''. [[U2]] includes a bass solo most notably on "[[Gloria (U2 song)|Gloria]]", in which [[Adam Clayton]] utilizes several techniques. Bassist Matt Freeman of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] has a very speedy, guitar-like bass solo in the song '"Maxwell Murder". [[Blink-182]]'s "Voyeur" has a bass solo on both their studio album ''[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]'' and their live album ''[[The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)]]'', in which they must "prepare for the bass solo."

Heavy metal bass players such as [[Geezer Butler]] ([[Black Sabbath]]), [[Alex Webster]] ([[Cannibal Corpse]]), Cliff Burton (Metallica), jazz fusion bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] ([[Weather Report]]), and [[Les Claypool]] ([[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Blind Illusion]]) used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. [[Geddy Lee]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] performed a number of solos, most notably in "[[YYZ (song)|YYZ]]". Also, in both published [[Van Halen]] concert videos, [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]] performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. Funk bassists, such as [[Larry Graham]], began using slapping and popping techniques for their bass solos, which coupled a percussive thumb-slapping technique of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings, often in rhythmic alternation. The [[slapping and popping]] technique incorporates a large number of muted (or 'ghost' tones) to normal notes to add to the rhythmic effect. Slapping and popping solos were prominent in 1980s pop and R&amp;B, and they are still used by some 2000s-era funk and Latin bands.

When playing bass solos, hard rock and heavy metal bassists sometimes use [[bass effects]] such as [[fuzz bass]] or [[wah-wah pedal]]s to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both distortion and wah-wah. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums.

==Plot==
After returning home from [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], Harold Lee and Kumar Patel decide to travel to [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]] so Harold can surprise his neighbor and newfound girlfriend Maria. At the airport, Kumar argues with a [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] agent for searching him “because of the color of his skin” despite the agent being black. The duo encounter Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harold's whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumar's [[bong]] for a [[bomb]] and the duo are apprehended by [[sky marshal]]s. Ron Fox, a neurotic and extremely racist Deputy [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], believes the duo are agents of a joint [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[North Korea]]n conspiracy and send them to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]]. The duo escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to [[Miami, Florida]] where they begin their trek to [[Texas]], hoping Colton can clear their names. 

The duo endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, such as staying at the home of an incestuous sibling couple and their inbred son, escaping a [[Ku Klux Klan]] rally, and visiting a brothel with [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who helps them evade capture from Fox. When they reach Texas, Colton agrees to exonerate the duo, but upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers them to Fox. On the flight back to Cuba, Harold and Kumar subdue Fox’s men. When Fox tries confronting them he is knocked out by Dr. John Beecher the [[Vice Chairman]] of the [[NSA]] after Fox repeatedly treated him poorly. But he accidentally loses his footing, opens a door and falls to his death. Harold and Kumar escape via parachute, and Fox falls to his death while pursuing them. The two land in [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s estate, and after smoking [[cannabis]] with the duo, Bush pardons them. The duo are escorted to Vanessa and Colton's wedding by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and expose Colton's betrayal to Vanessa and the guests. Colton attempts to attack them, but Harold punches him out. Kumar consoles a furious Vanessa by reciting a poem he wrote for her in college and they reconcile. Harold, Kumar, and Vanessa travel to Amsterdam where Harold finds Maria, and the couples happily tour the city together while getting high off cannabis.

==Production==
&lt;!---- 
Clearly not B class level, and due to the lack of coverage of the production phase it's not really 'C' class either. There is no coverage of the development phase including the casting, or the filming or the post-production. A 'C' class article should serve as a sufficient article in its own right, and while it allows for gaps in the coverage it shouldn't be misisng entire sections, so I'm demoting it to "Start" class. If you add a "production" section and want the article reassessed unstrike your request. Betty Logan (talk) 05:56, 25 July 2012 (UTC)

"[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc33147/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf From Outward Appearance to Inner Reality: A Reading of Aaron Copland's Inscape]". Master of Music (Music Theory), December 2010, 72 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; orchestration not shown {{audio|Copland Inscape opening eleven note chord.mid|Play}}]]

'''''Inscape''''' is a 1967 [[musical composition]] for [[orchestra]] by [[Aaron Copland]], approximately twelve to thirteen minutes in length, and commissioned by and dedicated to the [[New York Philharmonic]] for its 125th anniversary (see also ''[[Capriccio burlesco]]''). Composed using the [[twelve-tone technique]], the piece has been considered less accessible than much of Copland's earlier music.&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, John (December 3, 1990). Obituary: "[https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/14/specials/copland-obit.html Copland, Dean of American Music, Dies at 90 ]", ''NYTimes.com''. Accessed April 18, 2016. "Such works as the [[Piano Quartet (Copland)|Piano Quartet]] (1950), the [[Piano Fantasy (Copland)|Piano Fantasy]] (1957), 'Connotations' and 'Inscape' (1967) have made their way more slowly into the repertory than his easily accessible works."&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]'s term "[[inscape]]", invented:

{{quote|to suggest 'a quasi-mystical illumination, a sudden perception of that deeper pattern, order, and unity which gives meaning to external forms.' This description, it seems to me, applies more truly to the creation of music than to any of the other arts.|Copland&lt;ref name="SteinbergSFS"&gt;Steinberg, Michael (March 2016). Program notes: "[https://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/Copland-Inscape.aspx Copland: Inscape]", ''SFSymphony.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Michael (2000). "[http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/inscape-aaron-copland Inscape]", ''LAPhil.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Hopkins's opposite of "inscape" was "[[instress]]" ("perception as opposed to intrinsic, essential quality"), and a commentator writes that Copland, "uses sounds as an 'instress' that communicates a deeper inner essence, an 'inscape.'"&lt;ref name="SteinbergLAP"&gt;Steinberg, Michael (2000). "[http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/inscape-aaron-copland About the Piece: Inscape]", ''LAPhil.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; "The outward appearance is the boundary [[chord (music)|chords]] that frame the composition. The inner reality is the first complete statement of Copland's original [[melody|melodic]] [[idea (music)|idea]] at P-0, which occurs very close to the middle of ''Inscape''."&lt;ref name="Ensign"/&gt;

 Row 1: Eb G  F# D  F  Bb A  B  C# G# E &lt;ref name="Ensign"/&gt;
 Row 2: F  C  Ab D  G  A  B  Eb C# E  F#&lt;ref name="Ensign"/&gt;

The composition begins and ends with eleven-note chords (it may end on a ten note chord&lt;ref name="Ensign"/&gt;), "perhaps a double tease", and, "if there is one over-arching feature to Inscape, it is the alternation of massive blocks of sound, sometimes quite harsh in their harmony, with quieter sonorities and more peaceable gestures."&lt;ref name="SteinbergSFS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SteinbergLAP"/&gt;

Copland said that the twelve-tone technique, "freshened his harmonic palette," and that the composition uses two different [[tone row]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Perlis, Vivian (1998). "[http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Aaron-Copland-Inscape/5783 Aaron Copland - Inscape]", ''Boosey.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing ''[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]'' (1962), he said, "As a result [of using the twelve-tone technique] I began to hear chords I wouldn't have heard otherwise; here was a new way of moving tones about that had a freshening effect on one's technique and approach."&lt;ref name="SteinbergLAP"/&gt; However, he stated that ''Inscape'', "used it [the technique] in a rather more [[tonality|tonal]] way than...''Connotations''."&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz, Richard; ed. (2004). ''Aaron Copland: A Reader : Selected Writings 1923-1972'', p.355. Psychology. {{ISBN|9780415939409}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Through the single, closely-knit [[movement (music)|movement]] of ''Inscape'' there is no perceptible contradiction between the serial and diatonic elements, rather they dissolve freely into each other to produce music of a stimulating independence of spirit."&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;Henderson, Robert "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/943793 Copland's 'Inscape']", ''Tempo'', No. 87 (Winter, 1968-1969), pp. 29-30, ''JSTOR.org''. According to Henderson the first "twelve-note series" opens and closes the piece, while the second is the primary source of melodic material.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Bernstein]] remarked after the premiere: "Aaron, it's amazing how, even when you compose in a completely 'foreign' idiom the music still comes out sounding like you."&lt;ref&gt;Copland, Aaron and Perlis, Vivian (1989). ''Copland: Since 1943'', p.353. St. Martin's. quoted in Dickinson, Peter (2002). ''Copland Connotations: Studies and Interviews'', p.180, n.6. Boydell. {{ISBN|9780851159027}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The writing," also, "bears the unmistakable imprint of Copland's mature personality, in its wide spacing, its spare, lucid textures, often in just two or three parts, and lithe, cumulative rhythms."&lt;ref name="Henderson"/&gt;

'''''K2''''' is a [[board game]] by Adam Kałuża in which players are challenged to climb the [[K2|mountain of the same name]].&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt; In 2012 ''K2'' became the first Polish game to be nominated for a [[Spiel des Jahres|Spiel des Jahres award]].&lt;ref name="Rebel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SdJ" /&gt; It was also nominated for an [[International Gamers Award]].&lt;ref name="IGA" /&gt;

The game features a double-sided board with one side representing an easy ascent and the other a more difficult climbing route. There are also two types of weather conditions that you can use for the climb. This means that there are four combinations of weather and board to set the game's difficulty level.&lt;ref name="GFBR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meoples" /&gt;

Each player has two climbers and gains points for the highest position that each one reaches as long as they survive. Players must maintain a minimum level of acclimatisation for each climber to ensure that they do not die on the mountain. This, along with movement up or down the mountain, is controlled by the playing of cards from each player's personal deck.&lt;ref name="GFBR" /&gt;

''K2'' can be played solo or with up to five players. When there are a number of climbers there is some level of interaction between players due to the limited space on the board. Each position has a stated number of climbers that can stop there meaning that it is possible to block the path upwards or downwards of opposing players.&lt;ref name="Meoples" /&gt;

The game has been praised for the emotional response it gains from players,&lt;ref name="SdJ" /&gt; including "moments of extreme tension".&lt;ref name="GFBR" /&gt; Reviews note that the theme of mountaineering is unique and interesting,&lt;ref name="Kulkmann" /&gt; while the game mechanics simulate climbing, with realistic scenarios.&lt;ref name="SdJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulkmann" /&gt; The variable difficulty level has received positive comments&lt;ref name="Meoples" /&gt; but the replayability of the game has been questioned.&lt;ref name="GFBR" /&gt;

Rebel.pl have released ''K2: Broad Peak'' as an expansion for ''K2''. This gives players two challenges based on historical climbs of [[Broad Peak]] (formerly known as K3) by Polish mountaineers.&lt;ref name="Rebel-BP" /&gt; They also produced a small expansion called ''The Avalanche''.&lt;ref name="Rebel" /&gt; Kałuża's follow-up game, ''[[The Cave (board game)|The Cave]]'', debuted in 2013.

The meaning extends to text in that style which is printed on paper rather than carved into monuments.

'''''Louis''''' is a [[graphic novel]] series created by [[metaphrog]], the Franco-Scottish duo Sandra Marrs and John Chalmers.

==Series overview==
Louis is an unasumming worker who lives in Hamlet with his companion FC (short for Formulaic Companion), his pet mechanical bird. He spends his days filling bottles with air, making fruit, and writing to imaginary aunts. His neighbours Clean and Jerk often try to get him into trouble.

In ''The Guardian'', Julie Burchill has said of Louis that he is the "most adorable character", while ''The Comics Journal'' wrote: "Louis himself is cut from the same cloth as Charlie Brown and Jimmy Corrigan".

''Louis - Red Letter Day'' was published on [[Serializer.net]].&lt;ref&gt;Burchill, Julie (August 23, 2003). [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/aug/23/weekend.julieburchill "Weekend: THE GRAPHIC TRUTH"]. ''The Guardian '', Guardian Weekend Pages, Pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; ''i-D'' described ''Louis - Red Letter Day'' thus: "With squibs for eyes and delicately inked circles for nose and mouth, Louis' reduced features magically express a life spent daydreaming, writing letters to possibly fictional aunts and reading signs that say 'you look like a potato'. Infused with shadowless light and written in precisely elusive balloons Louis - Red Letter Day is a seriously spaced enigma from Metaphrog aka Glaswegian cult artists John Chalmers and Sandra Marrs. Like nothing else around."

Six graphic novels have been released so far. Their fourth, Louis - Dreams Never Die, was released in 2004 in association with the UK based label [[Fat Cat Records]]. For this, Hey (from Berlin) and [[múm]] (from Iceland) wrote two music tracks inspired by the Louis books, and metaphrog made a special short animation. The result was a multimedia project with a [[graphic novel]] and cd/blue vinyl 7".

In 2011, they redrew and repainted Louis - Red Letter Day and this new version was published in hardback.

'''''Lucifer and Prometheus''''' is a work of [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychological literary criticism]] written by [[R.J. Zwi Werblowsky]] and published in 1952. In it, Werblowsky argues that the [[Satan]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For Werblowsky's purposes, the names "Satan" and "[[Lucifer]]" are used more or less interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' became a disproportionately appealing character because of attributes he shares with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]]. It has been called "most illuminating" for its historical and typological perspective on Milton's Satan as embodying both positive and negative values.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Bausani, "Islam in the History of Religions," ''Problems and Methods of the History of Religions'' (Brill, 1972), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also been significant in pointing out the essential ambiguity of Prometheus and his dual Christ-like/Satanic nature as developed in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliahu G. Stroumsa, "Myth into Metaphor: The Case of Prometheus," ''Gilgul: Essays on Transformation, Revolution and Permanence in the History of Religions'' (Brill, 1987), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Werblowsky uses the terminology of [[Carl Jung]] and [[Analytical psychology|his school]] in examining "mythological projections of [[Psyche (psychology)|the human ''psyche'']]", though he emphasizes that he is not interested in the concept of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]] in the strict Jungian sense. Rather, he sees the myth of figures such as Satan and Prometheus as expressing "the shortcomings … of the world as conceived by the human soul." The relation of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and [[civilization]] is explored through the interaction of the concepts of [[Old Testament]] [[sin]] and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] ''[[hubris]]''. In this analysis, Satan "becomes the sole power-exponent in this [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar]], [[Fall of Man|post-lapsarian]] but pre-[[eschatology|eschatological]] universe, and thus stands as the prototype of human civilizing effort."

Werblowsky sets out to explore "the [[hero]]ic at its limits", and makes explicit the motivating factor of [[World War II]] and its horrors in undertaking this study:

{{cquote|The [[The Beast (Bible)|apocalyptic beast let loose]] has become a reality to our generation, and nobody knows what is still ahead of us. It is understandable therefore that books on the [[devil]] have been on the increase lately. … If the attempts of this school have not yet borne much fruit, it is because we fear the devil's sight more than his activity, and because of a very understandable reticence to force open our 'whited sepulchres.'&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "whited sepulchres" is an allusion to {{bibleverse||Matthew|23:27}}; it is used also in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Lucifer and Prometheus'' was one of 204 volumes in [[The International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method]] series published 1910–1965 and including titles from Jung, [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Erich Fromm]] and others. It was Werblowsky's first published book.&lt;ref&gt;Stroumsa, "Myth into Metaphor'', p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; This volume was reissued in 1999 by Routledge. It includes an introduction written by Jung.

'''Magyar Televízió''' ('''''Hungarian Television''''') or '''MTV''' is a nationwide [[public broadcasting|public television]] broadcasting organization in [[Hungary]]. Headquartered in [[Budapest]], it is the oldest television broadcaster in Hungary and today airs five channels: [[M1 (TV channel)|M1 HD]], [[M2 (TV channel)|M2 HD]], [[M3D|M3]], M4 Sport and M5.

MTV is managed and primarily funded by the [[MTVA (Hungary)|Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund]] ({{lang-hu|Médiaszolgáltatás-támogató és Vagyonkezelő Alap}}, abbreviated MTVA).&lt;ref name=ceu.hu /&gt; This [[government agency|government organization]], formed in 2011, also manages the public service broadcasters [[Magyar Rádió]] and [[Duna TV|Duna Televízió]] as well as the Hungarian [[news agency]] [[Magyar Távirati Iroda]].&lt;ref name=mtva.hu&gt;{{cite web|title=MTVA - Médiaszolgáltatás-támogató és Vagyonkezelő Alap portálja - ENGLISH|url=http://mtva.hu/en/english|publisher=Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA)|accessdate=29 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529103918/http://mtva.hu/en/english|archivedate=29 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2015, Magyar Televízió as well as the three other public media organizations managed by the MTVA were merged into a single organization called {{Interlanguage link multi|Duna Media Service|hu|3=Duna Médiaszolgáltató}} ({{lang-hu|Duna Médiaszolgáltató}}).&lt;ref name="MTVA/Duna Media Service Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian public service media companies merge - MTVA|url=http://media-akademia.hu/mtva-press-news/212-hungarian-public-service-media-companies-merge|publisher=Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA)|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222144948/http://media-akademia.hu/mtva-press-news/212-hungarian-public-service-media-companies-merge|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization is the legal successor to Magyar Televízió and is an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].&lt;ref name="Duna Media Service"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polyák|first1=Gábor|title=Hungary : New Amendment to the Media Act|journal=IRIS Legal Observations of the European Audiovisual Observatory|date=2015|issue=2|url=http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2015/2/article22.en.html|accessdate=23 August 2015|publisher=European Audiovisual Observatory|location=Strasbourg, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ebu.ch&gt;{{cite web|title=EBU - Active Members|url=http://www3.ebu.ch/members|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Early years (1954-1969)===
First pioneer transmissions were in Hotel Gellért in 1936.
Test transmissions commenced in 1954, however these were generally with stills or short clips of motion pictures, merely for experimental purposes. Regular test transmissions could be received from February 23, 1957. Transmissions began officially on 1 May 1957, when the May Day ceremonies were brought to the viewers for the first time. Daily news programmes began on July 2, 1957. The television service began its career as part of Hungarian Radio, which was renamed "Hungarian Radio and Television" on August 18, 1957. MTV suggested the establishment of an international organisation for exchanging television material, which was to be named [[Intervision Network|Intervision]]. The first four members of the organisation were Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary and Poland.

By 1959, Hungarian Television had over 50,000 [[subscriber]]s. In 1960, the Corporation decided to establish an archive, where its programmes are stored even today. In less than ten years of operation, MTV had some 2.7 million viewers by 1964. Studies showed that there were about 3-5 viewers per television set. Another study revealed that by 1965, 46% of the inhabitants of rural areas named television as their choice of entertainment, instead of reading (25%) or radio (10%).

Theatrical transmissions were popular at this time: in 1966 23 plays were broadcast from [[Budapest]], 20 from other cities. Also, 25 television movies and five musicals were transmitted this year.

1969 brought the one millionth subscriber, which meant about 4 million viewers. The first colour recording was made this year: it was [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''The Miraculous Mandarin''. Although the [[Orion (company)|Orion company]] presented its first colour television set, transmissions continued to be in black-and-white until 1971.

===The 1970s===
1971 brought the first regular transmission in colour, and the test transmissions of a second channel were begun as well. This decade was probably the most proliferous in the history of the whole company, with thousands of hours of programming made.

===The 1980s===
Annual programming time reached 4.300 hours, equalling to 83 hours a week. Teletext services commenced in 1981, called ''Képújság'' (Picture Newspaper), and television manufacturers started including teletext decoders in their sets. Long-running programmes were started in this decade, including ''Ablak'' (Window) and ''Panoráma'' (a foreign affairs programme). Regional programming began in 1984 in [[Pécs]], and cable television began in [[Székesfehérvár]] the same year. ''RTV'', a programme guide similar to [[BBC]]'s ''[[Radio Times]]'' was bought by 1.4 million viewers weekly. MTV's gradual decline began in 1985, this was the final year when MTV was self-sufficient.

The first broadcast of a telenovela on Hungarian television happened in the mid-1980s with the premier of the Brazilian ''[[Escrava Isaura (1976 TV series)|Escrava Isaura]]'' (Hungarian title: ''Rabszolgasors'' - "Slave Destiny" in English). The first Hungarian soap opera ''[[Szomszédok]]'' (Hungarian for "Neighbors") also started its 12-year-run on 7 May 1987 and was broadcast every second Thursday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108950/ ''Szomszédok'' on IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, experimental digital television recordings were made, but at the time only in studios. From 1988 seniors of 70 years were exempted from payment of the licence fee. Minority programmes in other languages began too: these programmes were recorded generally in regional studios, primarily in [[Pécs]] and [[Szeged]]. MTV2 was given some independence from its sister channel MTV1, and just like at the [[BBC]], they were given separate controllers.

By 1989 the service began broadcasting five days per week to prepare the seven days, as previously Monday only. Some exceptions were made from this practice, for example when the first Hungarian [[cosmonaut]], [[Bertalan Farkas]] entered space. ''[[Nap-kelte]]'' (Daybreak), a daily television magazine programme began in 1989, the first programme to be made by an independent Hungarian television company, namely [[Nap TV|Nap-TV]].

===The 1990s===
With the changeover from socialism, MTV was completely re-structured, some posts were abolished while others were created. Some programmes were axed from both channels, and new ones were started. This decade was a very hectic time in the life of the Company, as TV-presidents seemed to come and go, and so did the programmes.

MTV was admitted as a full active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] on January 1, 1993. In 1992, a new public service television station was started, and was named [[Duna TV]]. This was completely independent from MTV, although some collaboration exists between the two. Commercial channels became available to [[cable television|cable]] viewers in [[Budapest]] the same year.

In 1997, [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]], a commercial channel was to be launched on the frequency where [[m2 (TV channel)|m2]] used to be. However, MTV argued that by doing this, its audience would be given to the new channel as a present, which would mean severe disadvantage to both MTV and [[RTL Klub]], the other debutee commercial channel. The authorities decided to leave the frequency empty, and allocate a new frequency to TV2. m2, however, was still moved to satellite and cable reception only, which, at the time was quite rare. The programming available on MTV-2 was aimed at audiences which were most unlikely to receive the channel, so this meant a severe handicap for the company. Currently the company is recuperating from the decline earlier.

During the 1990s the MTV gradually lost its independence and became the voice of the all-time government, often accused of biased on commenting news .{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is one of the most popular sources of news, and its background news programmes such as ''Az Este'' (The Evening) are both liked and internationally recognised. Its line-up of programmes feature long-running shows, such as the science news programme ''Delta'', whilst other programmes like ''A Hét'' (The Week), a weekly review programme and ''Ablak'' (Window), an afternoon-long umbrella programme featuring general interest programmes, were both axed in recent years.

===The 2000s===
MTV is continuously underfinanced,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} just like many other public service channels around the globe, and is therefore struggling to produce programmes.

Whilst remaining entirely state-owned, the company was re-organised as a Closely Held Corporation. Funding changed significantly in 2002 with the end of the mandatory [[television license]] fee levied on all household with a television set. Following this change, funding for MTV instead began to come from government grants and [[television advertisement|advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lengyel|first=Márk|title=Hungary : Changes in Financing Public Service Broadcasters|journal=IRIS Legal Observations of the European Audiovisual Observatory|issue=2002-8:Extra|url=http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2002/8/article108.en.html|accessdate=29 May 2014|publisher=European Audiovisual Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006 protests in Hungary|2006 protests]] didn't leave the headquarters unscathed; in fact, it was occupied by the rioters for a short time.

In 2000, m2 began broadcasting 24 hours a day, with repeats from its sister channel, m1 and from its archive library and from the Hungarian National Digital Archive and Film Institute (Magyar Nemzeti Digitális Archívum és Filmintézet).

===Present-day===
In 2011, most of the assets and employees of MTV were transferred to the newly created Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund ({{lang-hu|Médiaszolgáltatás-támogató és Vagyonkezelő Alap|links=no}}, abbreviated MTVA), a government organization controlled by the [[Media Council of Hungary]].&lt;ref name=ceu.hu&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Law in Hungary|url=http://medialaws.ceu.hu/public_service_media_more.html|publisher=Center for Media and Communication Studies (CMCS)|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magyar Rádió and Duna Televízió were also made a part of the MTVA, which, together with MTV, unified all three public service broadcasters in Hungary for the first time. Additionally, the Hungarian news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda was merged into the MTVA and has since been responsible for the production of all news content aired on the three broadcasting organizations.&lt;ref name=mtva.hu /&gt;&lt;ref name=freemedia.at&gt;{{cite web|title=International Press Institute: SEEMO Says State Has Appropriated Hungary's Media Landscape|url=http://ipi.freemedia.at/special-pages/newssview/article/seemo-says-state-has-appropriated-hungarys-media-landscape.html|publisher=International Press Institute|accessdate=29 May 2014|location=Austria|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529104508/http://ipi.freemedia.at/special-pages/newssview/article/seemo-says-state-has-appropriated-hungarys-media-landscape.html|archivedate=29 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the unification of all the public media organizations managed by the MTVA was strengthened when all four were merged into a single organization called [[Duna Media Service]] ({{lang-hu|Duna Médiaszolgáltató}}).&lt;ref name="MTVA/Duna Media Service Announcement" /&gt; This [[nonprofit organization]] is the legal successor to the four formerly separate entities managed by the MTVA.&lt;ref name="Duna Media Service 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Polyák|first1=Gábor|last2=Nagy|first2=Krisztina|title=Hungarian Media Law|date=January 2015|publisher=Mérték Media Monitor Nonprofit Ltd.|location=Budapest|page=30|url=http://mertek.eu/sites/default/files/reports/hungarian_media_law_0.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the MTVA and transfer of the public media organizations into it has been frequently criticised by [[non-governmental organization]]s as being politically motivated and intended to the lessen the independence of the public service media in Hungary.&lt;ref name=freemedia.at /&gt;&lt;ref name=freedomhouse.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungary {{!}} Freedom House|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/hungary#.U4axByjLMrd|work=Freedom of the Press 2013|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hrw.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungary: Media Freedom Under Threat {{!}} Human Rights Watch|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/16/hungary-media-freedom-under-threat|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=businessinsider.com&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunai|first=Marton|title=How Hungary's government shaped public media to its mould|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-how-hungarys-government-shaped-public-media-to-its-mould-2014-19|accessdate=29 May 2014|newspaper=Business Insider|date=19 February 2014|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has stated that restructuring was necessary to improve the finances of the public media system and that all of the organizations within the MTVA retain [[editorial independence]].&lt;ref name=ceu.hu /&gt;&lt;ref name=businessinsider.com /&gt;

In 2012, MTV launched [[M3D]], first 3D television in [[Hungary]].

==MTV trademark suit==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Magyar Televízió, who has a trademark on the initials MTV registered with the Hungarian copyright office, sued the American [[MTV|MTV Music Television]] network for trademark infringement when MTV Music Television launched a [[MTV Hungary|Hungarian-language channel]] in 2007.  The suit is still ongoing.

==Notable shows==
* ''[[On the Spot (Hungarian TV series)|On the Spot]]'', documentary film series

==Location==
[[Image:Budapest, Szabadság tér légifotó.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Aerial photography of the old headquarters on Szabadság tér]]
The Hungarian Television's central building was located in the heart of [[Budapest]] on Szabadság tér (Freedom Square), across the Hungarian National Bank ([[Magyar Nemzeti Bank]]), the U.S. Embassy, and near to the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament]]. The building gave room to the Stock Exchange before the war. It is sold now and MTV has moved to the outskirts of Budapest to a purpose-built modern building. The old headquarters can be reached by a five minutes walk from [[Kossuth tér]] where [[Budapest Metro|Metro]] line 2 stops.

{{nihongo|'''Oshikura Manju'''|押し競饅頭}} is a very simple [[Japan]]ese [[game]] that is played on cold days in order to get warm.

The game is played with at least three players, but it is better if there are more. The players first gather around in a circle, as close to each other as possible. They face the outside, standing back to back with each other. When the game starts, the players powerfully shove backwards, pressing their backs towards other players' backs as they [[chant]] "''Oshikura Manju osarete nakuna''", meaning "Oshikura Manju don't cry when shoved". The chant is the most famous part of the song, and many people are familiar with only this part. However, the proper song continues; ''"Nakuko wa dare yowamushi kemushi hasannde sutero"'' (Who is crying? Pinch the coward and caterpillar, and throw them away).{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The players continue shoving each other, repeating this song over and over. There is no accurate end to this game.

One variation to the game is to play in a circle drawn on the ground. The game goes on with whoever pushed out of that circle getting out of the group, ending when one player left in the circle.

The word "Oshikura" in the name of this game is thought to have the meaning of ''"oshikurabe"'' (shoving competition), but originally, it was not a [[Competition|competitive]] game, but an easygoing one where players become absorbed in shoving each other vigorously, which results in them being warmed up.

'''Philco''' (founded as '''Helios Electric Company''', renamed '''Philadelphia Storage Battery Company''') was a pioneer in battery, radio, and television production. In North America, it is the Philco brand owned by [[Philips]]. In other markets, it is the Philco International brand owned by [[AB Electrolux|Electrolux]]. 

In the early 1920s, Philco made storage batteries, "socket power" battery eliminator units, and battery chargers. With the invention of the rectifier tube, which made it practical to power radios by electrical outlets, in 1928, Philco decided to get into the booming radio business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philcoradio.com/history/hist2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710074728/http://www.philcoradio.com/history/hist2.htm |archivedate=2013-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They followed other radio makers such as [[RCA]],   [[Atwater-Kent]], [[Zenith Electronics]], [[Freshman Masterpiece]], [[FADA Radio]]&lt;!--Frank A. D'Andrea Radio--&gt;, and [[AH Grebe]] into the battery-powered radio business.  By 1930, they were selling more radios than any other maker, a position they held for more than 20 years.

Philco built many iconic [[radio]]s and [[television set]]s, including the classic [[cathedral]]-shaped wooden radio of the 1930s (aka the "Baby Grand"), and the [[Predicta]] series of television receiver sets of the 1950s.

[[Philo Farnsworth]], credited for inventing the first fully functional all electronic [[vacuum tube]] television system (patent # US1773980- filed Jan 7, 1927), worked at Philco from 1931 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/farmboy-who-invented-television-while-plowing-180964607/?q=|title=The Farmboy Who Invented Television|first=Kat|last=Eschner|date=|website=smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/farnsworthp.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Farnsworth, Philo|author=|date=|website=www.museum.tv|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430163426/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/farnsworthp.htm|archivedate=30 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Philco was founded in 1892 as Helios Electric Company.&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, Morgan E. ''A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950'' (Antiques Electronics Supply, 1990), p.117.&lt;/ref&gt;  From its inception until 1904, the company manufactured [[Arc lamp#Carbon arc lamp|carbon-arc lamps]]. As this line of business slowly foundered over the last decade of the 19th century, the firm experienced increasingly difficult times. As the Philadelphia Storage Battery Company, in 1906 it began making batteries for [[electric vehicle]]s. They later supplied home charging batteries to the infant radio industry. The Philco brand name appeared in 1919. From 1920 to 1927, all radios were powered by storage batteries which were fairly expensive and often messy in the home.

===First major household product===
[[File:Philco Socket Power A -Battery eliminator--1925.jpg|left|thumb|Philco produced Socket Power "A", "B", and "AB" Battery Eliminators, starting in 1925.]]
[[File:Philco Socket Power A &amp; B Battery eliminators - 1925 August brochure.JPG|thumb|Philco Socket Power A &amp; B Battery Eliminators - 1925 August brochure]]

A very successful August 1925 product, called the "Socket Power Battery Eliminator", was a [[rectifier]] unit which enabled users to operate their battery-powered radios from standard light or wall sockets. By 1927 over a million of these units had been sold, but the invention of the vacuum tube rectifier (incorporated into the coming 1928 line of radio sets) made this technology obsolete.

In 1926, Philco decided to begin making radios.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldradio.com/archives/hardware/philco.htm A Brief History of Philco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050802104540/http://www.oldradio.com/archives/hardware/philco.htm |date=2005-08-02 }} Oldradio.com&lt;/ref&gt; The first Philco radios were introduced in mid-1928, and 96,000 were produced that year, making Philco radios 26th in the nation in production volume. Up to that time most radios were handmade and priced for relatively wealthy consumers. Atwater-Kent, the leading radio seller, coincidentally was also located in Philadelphia.

The Philadelphia Storage Battery Company decided that prices of radios could be scaled for a mass market by incorporating assembly line techniques then only used by the automobile industry. By the 1929 model year, Philco was in third place behind Atwater-Kent and Majestic (Grigsby-Grunow Corp) in radio sales. In 1930 the company sold 600,000 radios, grossed $34 million, and was the leading radio maker in the country. By 1934 they had captured 30% of the domestic radio market.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Philco Corp. document ''Philco-Ford Image'', by Glenn Allison, app. 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philco cathedral radio.jpg|right|thumb|A Philco 90 "cathedral" style radio from 1931]]
Philco radios were notable for their economy of design without sacrificing quality or durability. Like other makers of the era, they offered a wide line of radios beginning with five-tube sets all the way up to high-fidelity consoles with 20 tubes in 1937-38. Philco also made battery-powered radios which were by then called "farm radios", most of which had cabinets identical to their AC powered versions. The Philco "Baby Grand" (today called "cathedral" radios by collectors) was a shape that featured an arched top that wrapped from the sides over the top. This was for economic reason partly, as one piece of wood formed both the top and sides. Philco sold far more of this style than any other maker, a total of over two million (in over twenty models, with from four to eleven tubes) from 1930 to 1938;&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, p.116.&lt;/ref&gt; many of them exist today in collections. By today's standards, most are still excellent performing AM band radios when restored.

A few of their innovations were very futuristic. From 1939 to 1941, they sold radios that were remotely operated by wireless controls, the one-tube "Mystery Control", used on their 13-tube model 116RX-SU (or 39-116).&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; This feature was not offered by any other maker until the 1970s stereo receivers. Philco ranked 57th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting product was the Philco "Beam of Light" 78 RPM record players offered in 1941 and 1942.  These units had a tiny mirror attached to the player's needle.  A beam of light was focused on the mirror which caused a vibrating light to hit a solar cell and produce the audio signal.  While this system had some advantages over the standard crystal phono cartridge of the time, it was unreliable and is today a very difficult unit to restore.

==Expansion into other products==
[[File:Predicta model television 1958-59 DMA.jpg|thumb|Philco Predicta TV set, 1958/1959 ([[Dallas Museum of Art]])]]
Philco began marketing car radios in 1930 and later expanded into other areas including air conditioners (1938), refrigerators (1939), home freezers (1946), consumer televisions (1947), electric ranges (1949), home laundry washers and dryers (1954), and home entertainment products. Their first consumer television set, the 1948 table Model 48-1000, had a {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} screen and sold for US$395.

By 1954, Philco had led the radio industry in volume sales for 24 straight years, selling over 30 million radios.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Philco Corp. book ''The Story Of The Philco Franchise'', 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

Philco was also a pioneer in television broadcasting, launching experimental station W3XE in 1932. In 1941 the station became the third commercially licensed TV operation in the United States as WPTZ. It was sold to [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] in 1953 and operates today as [[KYW-TV]].

The [[Philco Predicta]] TV set was introduced in 1957 for the 1958 model year. It was a black and white television with the picture tube mounted in a unique steerable pod on a pedestal. There were many versions: 17" or 21" picture tubes, wood or metal cabinets and table or floor standing versions, some with rare UHF tuners. Its specially designed, high-deflection-angle (to achieve a shallow front-to-back depth) picture tube turned out to be a very unreliable design, and cost the company dearly in repairs and reputation. Many of them were sold to motels and bars due to the convenience of the swivel tube arrangement.  It was discontinued in 1960; a great failure for Philco.&lt;ref&gt;MZTV - Museum of Television http://www.mztv.com/newframe.asp?content=http://www.mztv.com/predicta.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120032146/http://www.mztv.com/newframe.asp?content=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mztv.com%2Fpredicta.html |date=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, due to the unique design, the Predicta is a collector's favorite and restored examples can easily be found.

In late 1953, engineers at Philco Corporation invented the [[surface barrier transistor]],&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, "Philco Claims Its New Transistor Outperforms Others Now In Use", December 4th 1953, page4&lt;/ref&gt; the first high frequency transistor suitable for use in high speed computers.&lt;ref name="ROSEN1991"&gt;{{cite report | author=Saul Rosen | authorlink=Saul Rosen | title=PHILCO: Some Recollections of the PHILCO TRANSAC S-2000 | institution=Purdue University | type=Computer Science Technical Reports / Purdue e-Pubs | number=CSD-TR-91-051 | pages= | url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1890&amp;context=cstech | date=Jun 1991 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124554/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1890&amp;context=cstech | archivedate=2016-03-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1955, the [[National Security Agency]] and the [[United States Navy]] entered into a contract with Philco to build a specialized scientific transistorized computer based on Philco's surface barrier transistor technology. The project was called SOLO, since the idea was to have powerful personal workstations, and the computer was later commercially named the Philco Transac S-1000 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1890&amp;context=cstech }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Philco had developed and produced a miniature transistorized computer brain for the Navy's jet fighter planes in 1955, which was called the "Transac" (C-1000, C-1100) and which stood for "Transistor Automatic Computer". It used Philco's high-frequency surface-barriers transistors in its circuitry design.&lt;ref&gt;Inventing the Electronic Century, Author: Alfred Dupont Chandler Jr., Page 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Philco Serviceman, September 1955, Volume 23 No.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wall Street Journal'': "Radio Men Told Of Rapid Counter", March 25, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philco All-Transistor Phonograph-1955.jpg|right|thumb|Philco all-transistor model TPA-1 phonograph, developed and produced by Philco in 1955]] 
In 1955, Philco developed and produced the world's first all-transistor phonograph models TPA-1 and TPA-2. This was originally announced in the June 28, 1955, edition of the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''Wall Street Journal''; June 28 1955; page 8; "Phonograph Operated On Transistors to Be Sold by Philco Corp."&lt;/ref&gt; Philco had begun selling these all-transistor phonographs in the fall of 1955 for $59.95. The October 1955 issue of ''Radio &amp; Television News'' magazine (page 41) printed a full-page, detailed article, on Philco's new consumer product all-transistor phonograph. The Philco all-transistor portable phonograph TPA-1 and TPA-2 models played only 45rpm records and used four 1.5v "D" batteries for its power supply. "TPA" stands for "Transistor Phonograph Amplifier". Its circuitry used three Philco germanium PNP alloy-fused junction audio frequency transistors. After the 1956 season ended, Philco decided to discontinue the all-transistor portable 45rpm phonograph models, for transistors were too expensive compared to vacuum tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/philco_tpa_1_tpa1.html |title=TPA-1 M32 R-Player Philco, Philadelphia Stg.

[[File:Philco Safari TV advertisement sign-1959.jpg|right|thumb|Actual store easel display of a 1959 Philco Safari Transistorized portable TV]] 

In 1959, Philco developed and produced the world's first battery-powered portable transistorized TV.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', June 02, 1959, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; This TV model was called the "Safari" and it contained 21 transistors inside. Philco had developed the VHF micro-alloy diffused-base (MADT) transistors&lt;ref&gt;''Wall Street Journal'', October 09, 1957, page 19: "Philco Says It Is Producing A New Kind Of Transistor"&lt;/ref&gt; and used them in the Safari portable TV.&lt;ref&gt;''Fortune Magazine'', September 1959 issue, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; The retail selling price was $250.00 plus the cost of the rechargeable battery, which was $5.25 extra.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', June 01, 1959, pages 37,41&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1962, the Philco 2000 Model 212 computer was chosen for use in the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]]'s famous [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]]. Three of the machines were installed that year{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and ran until 1980. The machines were also used by research labs at [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] and [[General Electric]].

===Space systems===
In 1960, [[NASA]] contracted with Philco to build the worldwide tracking station network for [[Project Mercury]], and all subsequent man-in-space projects until the ground station network was replaced by the [[TDRS]] communication satellites in the 1990s. Philco's Western Development Labs ultimately became [[Space Systems/Loral]], which continues to manufacture spacecraft. In later years, the company produced automotive electronic controls, aerospace tracking systems, and artificial satellites.

In 1963, Philco was also responsible for the design, manufacturing, installation, and service of all the consoles used in both MOCRs (Mission Operations Control Rooms, a.k.a. "Mission Control") at Building 30 of NASA's [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in Houston, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dethloff | first=Henry C. | title=Suddenly Tomorrow Came...

The consoles were used for the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Skylab]], and [[Space Shuttle]] missions until 1998. The Philco-designed and installed consoles in MOCR 2 at JSC have been preserved and will be restored to their Apollo-era configuration for historical purposes. The control room is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the "Apollo Mission Control Center".

===Water purification systems===

In 1971, Philco-Ford began to sell [[reverse osmosis]]-based water purification systems that used tube-shaped membranes developed by the company to filter and desalinate raw polluted water for municipal utilities and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Gain Reported In Purifying Water|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ctBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3237%2C2938928|accessdate=2013-10-24|newspaper=The Toledo Blade|date=1971-09-09|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
[[File:Philco Ford Fridge Badge.jpg|thumb|Philco-Ford "branded" refrigerator badges were used starting in 1966.]]
Philco Corporation by 1960 had applied for bankruptcy protection.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} On December 11, 1961, [[Ford Motor Company]] purchased Philco and continued to offer consumer products, computer systems and defense related projects. The company continued to provide Ford with car and truck radio receivers and consumer product investments were made to color television production.  Along with color and black and white television Philco continued to produce refrigerators, washers, dryers, air conditioners, stoves, radios, portable transistor radios, portable phonographs, audio console systems with high quality "Mastercraft" furniture cabinets, and component stereo systems. The company branded Philco products as "Philco-Ford" in 1966, and console stereo systems reached their zenith during 1966 and 1967, with high quality cabinet construction and powerful stereo chassis systems of 100- and 300-watt consoles. Philco at one time was one of the largest furniture producers in the world and the end was near for building "high quality" furniture cabinets along with stereo equipment. High quality cabinets were replaced with cheaper wood composites covered in vinyl paper with plastic wood pieces, and the quality electronic systems were replaced with cheaper versions imported from Philco in Taiwan. Eventually, all consumer electronic goods would be made by Philco-Taiwan, to lower costs of production and be more competitive in the market. This trend was prevailing in the American electronics industry but Philco-Ford was one of the first to implement. In 1973, a complete line of refrigerators was introduced, consisting of eight side-by-side "Cold Guard" models, which used about one-third less electricity than comparable competitive makes.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company 1973 Annual Report, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Ford sold Philco to [[GTE]], which also owned Sylvania Electric Products/Sylvania, in 1974. In 1977, Philco International was sold to White Consolidated Industries (WCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philco-intl.com/company-history |title=Company History |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031201213/http://www.philco-intl.com/company-history |archivedate=2014-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1986, WCI was bought by [[AB Electrolux]].)

The company (as well as the Sylvania brand name) was acquired from GTE by [[Philips]] in 1981 in order to gain the rights to use the [[Philips]] trademark in the [[United States]] (Philco had been able to keep Philips from using its trademark legally because of the similar-sounding names); as a consequence, Philips sold its products under the name "[[Norelco]]" in the United States. Philips continues to use the Philco name for promotional consumer electronics and has licensed the name for private brands and retro style consumer electronics. Philips also licensed the Philco brand name to [[Funai]] for [[Digital television adapter|digital converter boxes]] for analog TVs in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philcousa.com/product/TB100HH9.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033902/http://philcousa.com/product/TB100HH9.php |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], Philco (then [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Philco-Hitachi]]) was acquired in 1989 by [[Itautec]], becoming [[Itautec-Philco]] and in August 2005 Itautec sold Philco to [[Gradiente]]. In August 2007, Gradiente sold the brand to a group of investors, who intended to license the brand to Brazilian appliance maker Britânia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/mundo_virtual/2007/08/30/gradiente_confirma_venda_da_marca_philco_por_r_22_milh245es_985884.html|title=IG.com.br|author=|date=|website=ig.com.br|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520031343/http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/mundo_virtual/2007/08/30/gradiente_confirma_venda_da_marca_philco_por_r_22_milh245es_985884.html|archivedate=20 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Merloni Group]] acquired rights to the Philco brand (from Philco International) for use in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antoniomerloni.it/extranet/eng/area1_azienda AntonioMerloni.it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004145326/http://www.antoniomerloni.it/extranet/eng/area1_azienda |date=2006-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Philco produces household appliances in affiliation with ex-[[Bendix Corporation]] and [[Thorn EMI]] Moyor Electronics (e.g. Bendix 71258 1000 automatic washing machine 1986). As of 2006, the company is mainly recognised in [[Australia]].

In [[Argentina]], in March 2004, Philco was acquired by a group of Argentine investors. The presence of Philco in Argentina dates since 1930 and remains a traditional mark of appliances in this country. It currently manufactures refrigerators by Helametal Catamarca S.A. (Philco Argentina). All the line electronics, LCD TV, Car Stereos, Air Conditioning, MWO, Audio &amp; DVD, is represented by Newsan SA SANYO and DatandHome SA, with the line of washing machines, dishwashers, air conditioning, water heaters, also the same group.

'''Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles''', styled '''RAIN''', is a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] [[Tribute act|tribute]] and later a theatrical production. ''Rain'' gives audiences the experience of seeing Beatles' songs performed live that were never done so by the band itself. The longest-running Beatles tribute act,&lt;ref name=Arkell /&gt; it predates the popular Broadway show ''[[Beatlemania (musical)|Beatlemania]]'' by several years.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; ''Rain'' has played [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]],&lt;ref name=rgj /&gt; and toured for years.

The show takes the form of a roughly chronological history of The Beatles via their music. About 30 songs are performed during the show. Other than some onstage banter, there is very little dialogue during the production, which consists mostly of exact re-enactments of the Beatles' music.&lt;ref name=isherwood /&gt; The multimedia production uses [[High-definition television|high-definition]] backdrops that feature psychedelic effects, vintage television commercials, and video footage of ''Rain'' cast members recreating iconic Beatle moments.&lt;ref name=rgj /&gt; For legal reasons, ''Rain'' never calls its performers the names of the actual members of The Beatles.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;Jones, Chris. [http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/news/ct-let-it-be-beatles-show-rosemont-column.html "'Let It Be': Why show coming to Rosemont is a Beatles 'celebration',"] ''Chicago Tribune'' (February 19, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each production of ''Rain'' features two performers for each member of the Beatles, who alternate shows; plus an off-stage keyboardist to replicate the studio sounds familiar from later Beatles records.&lt;ref name=rgj /&gt;

== History ==
Rain began in 1975 as '''Reign''',&lt;ref name=rgj&gt;Sion, Mike. [http://www.rgj.com/story/life/2015/01/21/rain-new-generation-takes-reins-beatles-tribute/22132047/ "Rain: New generation takes reins of Beatles tribute,"] ''Reno Gazette-Journal'' (January 23, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Laguna Beach, California]], band that played both original music and Beatles covers. Founding members were Mark Lewis, Eddie Lineberry, Bill Connearney, Grant Belotti, Chuck Coffey, and Steve Wight. (Connearney, Belotti, Lineberry, and Alan Hawley had been members of a prior band known as '''Lucky Dogs'''.) The name of the band, "Reign/Rain," is a reference to the 1966 Beatles single "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]," the B-side of "[[Paperback Writer]]."&lt;ref name=isherwood&gt;Isherwood, Charles. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/theater/reviews/27rain.html?_r=0 "Another Long and Winding Detour,"] ''New York Times'' (October 26, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founder and keyboardist Mark Lewis managed the band, became its lead arranger, and found Rain a regular weekly gig doing Beatles covers at the Mine Shaft in [[Calabasas, California]],&lt;ref name=Marinucci&gt;Marinucci, Steve. "Tribute band Rain isn't the Beatles, but they play them -- and very successfully," Examiner.com (October 18, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Before long Rain had a following of Beatles fans around the [[Los Angeles]]/[[Orange County, California|Orange County]] area,&lt;ref name=rgj /&gt; and soon extended up the West Coast as far as [[Seattle]].

As the band developed a reputation, they performed at the 1978 [[The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon]]. In 1979, producer [[Dick Clark]] hired Rain members to record exact Beatles covers for the [[Richard Marquand]] film ''[[Birth of the Beatles]]''.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, Debra Minor [http://www.timeswv.com/news/lifestyles/rain-a-tribute-to-beatles-set-monday/article_cb52f6d2-3a8d-5d8f-8f38-94e226ba8dc0.html "'Rain — A Tribute to Beatles' set Monday,"] ''Times West Virginian'' (March 13, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, Lewis had built the band into a long-standing touring tradition.&lt;ref name=rgj /&gt; The lineup of Rain remained constant until 1980, with Lineberry playing [[John Lennon]], Coffey playing [[Paul McCartney]], Connearney playing [[George Harrison]], and Belotti playing [[Ringo Starr]] (with Lewis playing keyboards behind the scenes). Joey Curatolo joined Rain in 1978, sharing the role of Paul with Coffey; Curatolo is still a current member of Rain.

Lineberry left Rain in 1980, and Coffey, Connearney, and Belotti all left in 1982. Joe Bithorn joined the group as "George" in 1983, and is still with Rain. Ralph Castell joined Rain in 1986 as Ringo, and is still with the show.

In 2001 the Rain Corporation took over management of the band.&lt;ref name=Grode /&gt; In 2005, management met with producer Jeff Parry to expand the tribute band's scope — which at that point was mostly doing concerts at casinos&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt; — and develop a Broadway-style production in the manner of 1977's ''[[Beatlemania (musical)|Beatlemania]]''.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt; The result of this planning eventually became the 2010 Broadway run.&lt;ref name=Grode&gt;Grode, Eric. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/theater/a-beatles-tribute-show-seeks-half-the-revenues-of-another.html "Can’t Buy Me Love? A Lawsuit Debates It: A Beatles Tribute Show Seeks Half the Revenues of Another,"] ''New York Times'' (July 15, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Pollstar]] listed ''Rain'' at number 17 in its yearly "Pollstar's Hot Top 20" for overall tickets sales of a touring show, band, or production.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

''Rain'' played Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]] in 2009. In 2010 the production performed at [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]'s [[Starlight Theatre (Kansas City, Missouri)|Starlight Theatre]] and [[New Orleans]]' [[Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts]].

In 2009, on the eve of Rain moving to Broadway, the Rain Corporation and Parry's Annerin Productions agreed to produce a [[West End theatre]] version of the show, with both sides splitting the profits 50-50.&lt;ref name=Grode /&gt;

''Rain'' ran on Broadway for 300 shows (and 8 preview performances), first at the [[Neil Simon Theatre]]&lt;ref name=isherwood /&gt; on October 26, 2010 – January 15, 2011, then at the [[Brooks Atkinson Theatre]] on February 8, 2011 – July 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/rain-488176 Internet Broadway Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Parry/Annerin Productions put on ''[[Let It Be (musical)|Let It Be]]'', a Beatles "concert experience"&lt;ref name=Gioia&gt;Gioia, Michael. [http://www.playbill.com/article/producers-of-rain-a-tribute-to-the-beatles-file-copyright-infringement-suit-against-broadways-let-it-be-com-207581 "Producers of Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles File Copyright Infringement Suit Against Broadway's Let It Be,"] ''Playbill'' (July 16, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; that played in London's West End. In 2013, on the eve of ''Let It Be'' coming to Broadway, the Rain Corporation filed a [[copyright]] suit against Parry and his fellow ''Let It Be'' producers. ''Rain'' claimed that ''Let It Be'' was essentially the same concept as ''Rain'', with similar artwork, costumes, and virtually the same song repertoire, and that ''Rain'' was entitled to 50% of ''Let It Be'''s profits."&lt;ref name=Arkell&gt;Arkell, Harriet. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2366605/Beatles-tribute-acts-Rain-Let-It-Be-legal-fight-idea-jukebox-musical-show.htm "Two Beatles tribute acts locked in legal fight over who first came up with idea of ‘jukebox musical’ Let it Be stage show,"] ''Daily Mail'' (July 17, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Parry and Annerin instead proposed giving Rain Corporation 7.5% of their profits.&lt;ref name=Gioia /&gt; The case was settled out of court.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The show begins with the four actors portraying an early version of [[The Beatles]]' appearance at the Cavern Club in 1962. When this scene closes, [[The Beatles]] journey to America, beginning their tour at ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. Moving forward, The Beatles' directions are changing musically while their band grows in popularity performing their largest concert at [[New York City]]'s [[Shea Stadium#Other events|Shea Stadium]]. Subsequent scenes use hallucinogenic and psychedelic designs to represent The Beatles' ever increasing experimentation with substances and Eastern philosophies. The show culminates with the breakup of the group and the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=isherwood /&gt;

A '''robotic competition''' is an event where [[robot]]s have to accomplish a task. Usually they have to beat other robots in order to become the best one. Many competitions are for schools but several professional competitions are arising.

== History ==

Robotic competitions have been organized since the 1970s and 1980s. In 1979 a [[Micromouse]] competition was organized by the [[IEEE]] as shown in the ''[[IEEE Spectrum|Spectrum]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/tag/maze-runner/ |title=Maze Runner Archives |publisher=cyberneticzoo.com |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is difficult to pinpoint the first robotic competition in history two events are well known nowadays for their longevity: the All Japan Sumo from Japan, and the Trinity College International Fire fighting Robot Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trinityrobotcontest.org/ |title=Trinity College Int'L Firefighting Home Robot Contest |publisher=Trinityrobotcontest.org |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other competitions have grown in popularity with the pass of time, being the [[Robocup]] and the [[Robo One]] two of the main singular events in current times. In parallel companies like [[Lego]] and [[VEX Robotics Competition|VEX]] have developed their own branded events and called them leagues, although they function more like individual cups in regional qualifiers with finals.

There is some controversy whether university specific challenges should be considered competitions or more workshops, in general the trend is to open competitions to the public in order to prevent nepotism and improve the quality of the robots competing at the event.

Some organizations have been trying to standardize robotics competition through the introduction of full-fledged leagues with a standard calendar, but the model as been only working in specific countries like Spain where the National League was founded in 2008 and is still functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnrc.es |title=Liga nacional de robotica de competicion |publisher=Lnrc.es |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria to classify robot competitions ==

There are many criteria that can be used to classify robot competitions which makes it hard to establish a standard way of referring to them:

* Popularity with public or competitors
* Indoors versus Outdoors
* Branded materials (LEGO or VEX) versus Open materials
* Minors / students versus Professionals / clubs
* Itinerant (Robocup) versus Fixed-location (All Japan Sumo)
* Nature of movement: humanoid, wheeled, aerial, aquatic, underwater,...

== Competitions ==

=== Major competitions and organizations ===

All these competitions are indoors, itinerant in their location and showcase different categories. The competitions in this listing have a yearly recurrent major impact in their locations with a huge national impact or an international significant reach.

The competition’s class structure of beginner, beginner/intermediate, intermediate, and advanced provides students with the opportunity to build upon their skills, and the application of those skills, as they engineer increasingly more complex ROVs for increasingly more complex mission tasks.

=== International METU Robotics Days ===
The International METU Robotics Days event is hosted annually by the [[Middle East Technical University]] in Ankara, Turkey. The Robotics Days include eight categories of competition as well as lectures, seminars and workshops.

=== RobotArt.org ===
Competition oriented to challenge teams to produce something visually beautiful with robotics – that is, to have a robot use physical brushes and paint to create an artwork.   The competition is open to anyone regardless of age or affiliation and any type of robot can be used.  Teams can enter up to 6 paintings in each of the competition categories of “original artwork” and “reinterpreted artwork” where a reference image or existing artwork is used as a reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=These robots just won up to $30,000 for their paintings|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/winners-of-the-2016-robot-art-contest-2016-5|accessdate=May 26, 2016|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unsourced or discontinued minor competitions ==

This events do not seem to be continued anymore or have no reference that we can use to consider them active.

=== OFF Road Robotics Competition ===
The competition is organized by the Robot Association of Finland.

The goal is to build a robot which is able to move without human help off-road. The competition is held annually at the mid-summer Jämi Fly In air show in  Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamiflyin.com/uk/introduction.html|title=Jami Fly In|publisher=jamiflyin.com|accessdate=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.propelli.net/robot/offroad2007.html|title=Off-road Robot Car Competition 2007|publisher=propelli.net|accessdate=August 31, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425175302/http://www.propelli.net/robot/offroad2007.html|archivedate=April 25, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The competition track is randomly selected 10 minutes before competition by the judge, marked with four wooden sticks to make a 200-meter track.  The track consists of sand roads and fields containing bushes and rocks. The robots must run outside the sticks from start to finish without human assistance as fast as possible. YouTube movies and pictures from the 2007 and 2008 competitions are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robotti.wikidot.com/off-road-2007|title=Off Road 2007 videos|publisher=wikidot.com|accessdate=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Autonomous Robot Racing Challenge (IARRC) ===
Student teams from around the world compete in an outdoor racing competition, where small-scale robots race against other robots to the finish line, without any human guidance or control. Their skills are put to test in a static judging event, a drag race and a circuit race event, where the vehicles navigate around obstacles and obey the traffic rules. These robots are finding their way in applications such as space exploration, mining, search and rescue, remote sensing and automotive inspection.

Robot Racing is an effort to promote research in autonomous mobile robotics technology. The competition provides students with engineering design challenges, including components of mechanical, computer, control software, and system integration. Students work together to design and build robotic vehicles that can navigate twisting, obstacle-filled courses without any human guidance or control.

{{nihongo|'''''Shadow Hunters'''''|シャドウハンターズ|shadō hantāzu}} is a [[deduction board game|social deduction]] [[board game]] designed by Yasutaka Ikeda that was first published in 2005 by [[Game Republic]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerepublic.jp/company/history.html 株式会社ゲームリパブリック沿革] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202083133/http://www.gamerepublic.jp/company/history.html |date=2010-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bgame.jp/&lt;/ref&gt; The game was published in the United States by [[Z-Man Games]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="rulebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zmangames.com/boardgames/files/shadow_hunters/Shadow_Hunters_Rules.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110101019/http://www.zmangames.com/boardgames/files/shadow_hunters/Shadow_Hunters_Rules.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art style of the game closely resembles the style found in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]].

Players are secretly assigned the role of a character belonging to one of three factions: Shadows, which are supernatural creatures of the night, Hunters, which are humans attempting to exterminate the Shadows, and Neutrals, which are unaffiliated characters who are caught in the crossfire with individual victory conditions.

Each player does not know the identity or [[allegiance]] of any other player, and must use cards, [[negotiation]], and guesswork to figure out who everyone else is.  The game ends when one or more players have fulfilled their victory conditions. At this point all players who have fulfilled their objectives are declared winners, whether they are part of the same faction or even alive.

==Setup==
First, [[shuffle]] the six area cards and place them [[random]]ly on the designated spots on the game board.  Next, shuffle the [[White]], [[Black]], and [[Hermit]] decks separately and place them face down on the marked area on the side of the board.  Now each player must choose a [[color]] and place one piece in the ''No Damage'' circle on the board (the [[health points|HP]] piece) and one piece in front of them for now (the Player piece).  Shuffle the Shadow, Hunter, and Neutral character decks face down separately, and looking at the table below, pick out the appropriate number of cards from each deck, shuffle all of the selected character cards together, then hand out one card to each player, face down.  Make sure that other players cannot see your character card when you receive it.  Once you have your character card, read over it to see your affiliation, your special ability, and your victory condition.  Finally, randomly determine the starting player and begin the game.

|}

==Gameplay==
Turn order proceeds in a [[clockwise]] fashion.  On a player's turn, he or she must move their character by rolling the [[dice]] and moving their player piece to the area card corresponding to the number they rolled.  If a seven is rolled, the player may choose where they want to move, given that it is not the same area that they are currently on.  Next, the player may choose whether or not to use the ability stated on the area card.  Finally, a player may decide if they want to attack another player within range.

===Areas===
Areas are the locations where player characters will land on and interact with.  Listed below are the six area cards and what action players may choose to perform when they land on them.

{| style="width: 75%; height: 300px" border="1"
|-
| '''Location''' || '''Effect'''
|-
| Hermit's Cabin || The player draws a card from the top of the Hermit Cards stack and confirms what's written on it, then gives it to another player of their choice.
|-
| Church || The player draws a card from the top of the White Cards stack and follows the instructions.
|-
| Cemetery || The player draws a card from the top of the Black Cards stack and follows the instructions.
|-
| Underworld Gate || The player chooses one of three card stacks (White, Black, or Hermit) and draws a card from the top of that stack, then follows the instructions.
|-
| Weird Woods|| The player chooses a player and does one of the following two actions: &lt;br /&gt;
A. Deals 2 points of damage to the player &lt;br /&gt;
B. Removes 1 point of damage from the player. (The player may choose themselves)
|-
| Erstwhile Altar || The player obtains an Equipment Card from another player of their choice.  Nothing happens if no player has Equipment Cards.
|}

===Card Types===
'''Single-Use Cards:''' Cards that are placed in their deck's discard pile immediately after play.  When a deck runs out of cards, its respective discard pile is shuffled and made into the new deck.

'''Equipment Cards:''' Cards that the player keeps in front of them when played.  They are always in effect when in front of a player.  There is no limit to how many equipment cards a player may have.

====Hermit Cards====
The Hermit deck contains only Single-Use cards.  Hermit Cards are used to help determine what character and allegiance another player is.  When a player draws a Hermit card, they should read what is printed on the card carefully, then hand it face down to the player that they would like to learn more about.  The other player will then silently read the card, and if their character matches what is stated on the card, they must suffer the card's effects.  If not, the other player must simply say "nothing happens."  The player receiving the card may not [[lie]] about their character unless they are the ''Unknown'' character.

====White and Black Cards====
Both the White and Black decks contain Single-Use cards and Equipment cards.  White Cards are usually beneficial for either the player drawing them or for others.  The White deck contain equipment cards that benefit the user through defensive and supportive means.  Black Cards are usually used to inflict damage on other players, but will sometimes inflict damage randomly or even harm the user.  The Black deck contains equipment cards that benefit the user through offensive means.

===Combat===
At the end of a player's turn, they have the option of attacking another player within range.  The default range is the area card that the player is currently on and the adjacent area card that is paired with it.  Some Black equipment cards have the ability to modify a player's attack range.  When a player makes an attack, they roll both dice and inflict the amount of damage equal to the [[subtraction|difference]] between the numbers (higher number - lower number) rolled to the enemy player.  Attacks made against multiple opponents, which is permitted by a specific Black card, are made by rolling the dice and inflicting that amount of damage to all targets.

====Death====
As a player takes damage during the game, they move the HP piece onto the number on the board corresponding to how much damage they currently have.  HP pieces are used to show the damage levels of all players.  A player's character [[death|dies]] when they have accumulated damage equal or more to the HP listed on their character card.  When a character dies, the player must flip their character card face up if they have not already and remove their HP piece and Player piece from the board.  If a player has killed another player, they are allowed to take one Equipment card from the dead player and discard the rest.

===Characters===
Each character possess a special ability that they may use when they reveal their character by flipping their character card face up.  The exceptions to this rule are ''Daniel'' and ''Unknown'', whose powers are always active.  Listed below are all the characters, their affiliations, and their special abilities.

{| style="width: 100%; height: 100%" border="1"
|-
| '''Character''' || '''Affiliation''' || '''Ability'''
|-
| Allie || Neutral || ''Mother's Love:'' You can fully heal your damage once during the game.
|-
| Bob || Neutral || ''Robbery:'' If you inflict 2 or more points of damage to another character, you can take an Equipment Card of your choice from that character instead of giving him/her the damage.
|-
| Charles || Neutral || ''Bloody Feast:'' After you attack a character, you can attack the same character again by giving yourself 2 points of damage.
|-
| Daniel || Neutral || ''Scream:'' You must reveal your identity when another character dies.  You cannot reveal your identity at any other time.
|-
| Emi || Hunter || ''Teleport:'' When you move, you can choose either to roll the dice normally OR move to an adjacent Area Card without rolling the dice.
|-
| Franklin || Hunter || ''Lightning:'' Once during the game, at the start of your turn, you can choose a character and give him/her damage by rolling a 6-sided die.
|-
| George || Hunter || ''Demolish:'' Once during the game, at the start of your turn, you can choose a character and give him/her damage by rolling a 4-sided die.
|-
| Unknown || Shadow || ''Deceit:'' When given a Hermit Card, you may lie about your identity to trigger the card or to say "nothing happens."  You do not have to reveal your identity to use this Special Ability.
|-
| Vampire || Shadow || ''Suck Blood:'' When you attack and give damage to a player, you immediately heal 2 points of your own damage.
|-
| Werewolf || Shadow || ''Counterattack:'' When you are attacked by a player, you can choose to counterattack him/her immediately after the initial attack is resolved.  It is acceptable to reveal your identity right after you are attacked to do the counterattack.
|}

===Victory===
A player wins if they fulfill the victory condition stated on their character card at any time during the game.  Once a player's victory condition is reached, they may immediately flip their character card face up if they have not already and declare victory, ending the game.  All players who have fulfilled their characters' victory conditions by the end of the game are considered to be winners, making it possible for multiple players, even if they are on opposing teams, to win.  If a player's character is dead but their victory condition is fulfilled by the end of the game, they are still considered to be a winner.

'''Company management''' in a [[theatre]] or a travelling company entails all of the travelling, accommodation and day-to-day needs of the acting, design and technical company members. In [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatre]]s it often includes renting [[apartments]] and hotel rooms, booking airline tickets, orchestrating furnishings and cleanings for rented apartments, and dealing with any special needs and requests. Company managers will also often coordinate auditions and aid in contracting actors and creatives.

In a travelling company the company manager also arranges for travel and housing, but might also travel with the production. In most local or regional theaters the company manager takes on the job of being the liaison to the actors. The company manager is not only the direct point of contact of any questions the actors might have but he or she is the direct contact from the management team to the actors.

In traveling shows or festivals the company manager might be responsible for all staff issues, such as: travel arrangements and meals for not only the actors but for the entire staff.  But in theaters such as Broadway or regional theaters where actors are stationary for a longer run; the company manager takes on the actors and the production manager deals with the tech crew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17429">'''Vogel's Tonnetz''' is a graphical and mathematical representation of the scale range of [[just intonation]], introduced by German music theorist [[Martin Vogel]] 1976 in his book ''Die Lehre von den Tonbeziehungen'' (english: On the Relations of Tone, 1993). 
The graphical representation is based on [[Tonnetz|Euler's Tonnetz]], adding a third dimension for just [[Harmonic seventh|sevenths]] to the two dimensions for just [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] and just [[Major third|thirds]]. 
It serves to illustrate and analyze chords and their relations.
The four-dimensional mathematical representation including octaves allows the Evaluation of the [[#Consonance and the congruency of harmonics|congruency of harmonics]] of chords depending on the tonal material. 
It can thus also serve to determine the optimal tonal material for a certain chord.

== The graphical representation ==

The graphical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is limited to the three dimensions for fifths, thirds, and seventh. In this representation tones separated by one or several octaves are depicted on the same nodes. The illustration shows the chord which is the most frequent 4-note chord in western music: the major seventh. In Euler's Tonnetz the B-flat is constructed from fifths and thirds. In Vogel's Tonnetz it is given as a just harmonic seventh.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The representation of this chord in Vogel's three-dimensional Tonnetz makes its statistical dominance much more plausible than its representation in Euler's two-dimensional Tonnetz: There is a distinct reference note (C), and all other notes are linked to this reference note via simple one-step intervals in this Tonnetz.

== The mathematical representation ==

The mathematical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is four-dimensional, considering also [[octave]]s.
Each tone is represented by a [[4-tuple|quadruple]] of numbers specifying how many octaves, "fifths", "thirds", and "seventh" are needed to reach that tone in the Tonnetz (where the terms "fifths", "thirds", and "seventh" denote the prime numbers 3, 5, and 7, instead of the intervals 3/2, 5/4 und 7/4).
The C-major seventh chord with the notes c', e', g', and b-flat' could (with reference to C)be represented by the numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7.
This corresponds to the quadruple (2,0,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (1,1,0,0), and (0,0,0,1).
The quadruple notations represents the [[prime decomposition]] of the numbers that are needed to describe the chord, limited to the first four prime numbers.

Vogel adopts the harmonic dualism of [[Arthur von Oettingen]], with [[major chord|major]] and [[minor chord|minor]] chords being mirror images of each other. This view is complemented by a quantitative computation of [[consonance]] (or rather [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]) values.

[[File:Chords with reference notes.jpg|thumb|C major and C minor chord with upper and lower reference tone]]

For this purpose Vogel introduces virtual reference tones that are not necessarily part of the chord. These reference tones are chosen such that all chord tones have integer relations to these reference tones. For each chord there exists a lower and an upper reference tone, with all chord tones being integer multiples of the frequency of the lower reference tone and integer fractions of the frequency of the upper reference tone. In quadruple notation there are only positive (or zero) values if the chord is related to the lower reference tone, and only negative (or zero) values if the chord is related to the higher reference tone.

To get a single numerical value describing the complexity of a chord, Vogel builds a weighted sum of the quadruples describing the notes of the chord. He suggests the weights 1, 3, 5, and 7 for the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7. Vogel rejects the more obvious variant where prime number 2 is weighted with 2 because it leads to results that in his opinion do not comply with the perception of musically skilled listeners. Finally, the weighted sum is divided by the number of tones of the chord. This computation is done for both the higher and the lower reference tone. Depending on which of those two values is smaller, the chord is then labeled as "Oberklang" or "Unterklang" ("upper chord", if reference to the lower reference note, or "lower chord", if referenced to the upper reference note).

The C major chord c’-e’-g’ could, for instance, be referenced to C.
All three notes of the triad can be represented as integer multiples of the frequency of this reference tone (4, 5, and 6). 
The prime decomposition yields 2&amp;#x00B7;2,5,2&amp;#x00B7;3. 
Applying the weights suggested by Vogel one obtains a so-called consonance value of (1+1+5+1+3)/3 = 11/3 = 3.67. 
The same chord may also be referenced to b’’’’: this upper reference tone has 15 times the frequency of c’, 12 times the frequency of e’ and ten times the frequency of g’. 
The prime decomposition yields3&amp;#x00B7;5,2&amp;#x00B7;2&amp;#x00B7;3,2&amp;#x00B7;5.
The consonance value computes to (3+5+1+1+3+1+5)/3 = 19/3 = 6,33. 
As the consonance value for the lower reference tone is better (smaller), the c major chord c’-e’-g’ is defined to be an upper chord referenced to C.
The consonance value of the c minor chord c’-es’-g’ is identical.
It is, however, reference to the upper reference tone of this chord, g’’’.
In consequence, Vogel rejects the naming of this chord as C minor as its reference note is not C but G. He calls it "G lower chord".

Vogel suggests a specific notation for upper and lower chords.
The notation starts by denoting the reference tone in lower case.
Upper chords are marked by an "O" (Oberklang) and are denoted from left to right, lower chords are marked by a "U" (Unterklang) and are denoted from right to left.
The C major chord is denoted as cO, the C minor chord is denoted as Ug.
Additional symbols for additional notes (7 for adding an upper or lower seventh) are added to the left or to the right, depending on whether it is an upper or a lower chord. 
The C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord depicted above would be denoted as cO7.

In addition to the calculation of consonance values for single chords, 
Vogel suggests a computation of the consonance of chord transitions.
When transiting from an n-note chord to an m-note chord all N&amp;#x00B7;M note-to-note transitions are evaluated via prime decomposition and weighted sum, and a mean value for all these transitions is computed.
Vogel also suggest to compute a consonance value for an entire piece of music, taking into account a central reference point similar to a [[Gregorian mode|final]].

=== Consonance and the congruency of harmonics ===

The consonance value calculated with Vogel's formula should rather be termed dissonance value, because with increasing dissonance of a chord or interval its value increases.
Vogel did not claim to predict consonance judgments of today's listeners.
A close relation of Vogel's consonance values with consonance judgments is in deed not to be expected.
Firstly, consonance judgments correlate strongly with familiarity judgments.&lt;ref name="Karas"&gt;Agnieszka Karas, Christian Kaernbach: ''Putting Martin Vogel to test: An attempt to evaluate a musical theory.'' In U. Ansorge et al. (Hrsg.): ''Beiträge zur [https://www.teap.de/docs/teap2013_final_programme_updated.pdf 55. Tagung experimentell arbeitender Psychologen.]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF; 11,3&amp;nbsp;MB)'' Pabst Science Publishers, Lengerich, 2013, S. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, major and minor are attributed emotional values by today's Western listeners (minor being perceived as expressing sadness).
Thirdly, his formula considers only the congruency of harmonics, but not the congruency of [[combination tone]]s.
It would be more cautious to say that Vogel's formula correlates with the congruency of harmonics, expressing in how far the harmonics of a chord fit together or not.

The range of the validity of the formula is in addition limited by the limits of hearing.
A just octave cannot be discriminated from an octave that is mistuned by a [[schisma]] (a mistuning of about 2 [[cent (music)|cent]]). The perceptual limit for the frequency difference of complex tones is about 0.25 % (4 cent).&lt;ref name="Kaernbach"&gt;Christian Kaernbach, Christian Bering: ''Exploring the temporal mechanism involved in the pitch of unresolved harmonics.'' In: ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.'' Vol. 110, 2001, S. 1039-1048 ([http://www.emotion.uni-kiel.de/fileadmin/emotion/team/kaernbach/publications/2001_kae_ber_jasa.pdf PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt;
Vogel's consonance formula yields a consonance value of (1&amp;#x00B7;1+0&amp;#x00B7;3+0&amp;#x00B7;5+0&amp;#x00B7;7)/2 = 0.5 for the just octave (1,0,0,0), and a values of (14&amp;#x00B7;1+8&amp;#x00B7;3+1&amp;#x00B7;5+0&amp;#x00B7;7)/2 = 43/2 = 21.5 for the octave mistuned by a schisma (-14,8,1,0).

=== Consequences for the selection of tones ===
[[File:C minor chord with high and low third.jpg|thumb|C minor chord with high and low third [[File:C minor chord with third high and low.ogg|noicon|40px]]]]

Vogel's consonance formula can help to decide, which tones of the Tonnetz should be taken for a certain chord. The consonance value of the seventh chord in Euler's Tonnetz (see figure above) is 8.5. In Vogel's Tonnetz one could select the same tones, resulting in the same consonance value. If one, however, decides to select the just seventh, the consonance value improves to 4.5. Hence, according to Vogel, the seventh chord using a just seventh is to be preferred over a seventh chord where the seventh is built from fifth and thirds.

=== Compositional consequences ===

Vogel claims that his formula entails also compositional consequences.
If one wants a chord to be consonant, major chords should be composed such that thirds and sevenths are set in a high register.
Minor chords, however, would have to be set the other way round, with thirds and sevenths being set in a low register.
This is by no means compatible with the compositional practice of the last centuries (with perhaps the exception of the Tristan chord, see below).
In consequence, minor chords set along Vogel's composition rules sound unfamiliar.
They exhibit, however, a better congruency of harmonics than their classical variants.
The left-hand of the two C minor chords in the adjoining figure is composed in the classical way, with the third being set in a high register. The consonance value for this chord is 4.33.
The right-hand minor chord features a low third. It sounds unfamiliar. Its consonance value is, however, much lower (3.0), and the congruency of its harmonics is much better.

== Limiting the theory to the prime numbers 2, 3, 5 and 7 ==

Vogel considers the theoretically infinite four-dimensional space of tones of his Tonnetz as complete; no further dimensions are needed for higher prime numbers.
According to his theory, consonance results from the congruency of [[harmonics]]. The prime number 11 and any other higher prime number can not lead to any perception of congruency, as the [[inner ear]] separates only the first eight to ten partials.&lt;ref name="Kaernbach"/&gt; The eleventh partial may be audible and discriminable from the tenth or twelfth partial if isolated via techniques such as [[Harmonic#Harmonics_on_stringed_instruments|flageolet]]. If presented as part of a complex tone comprising also the adjoining partials these partials would fuse together, and a congruency with the partial of another note could no longer be detected. It might be interesting to test whether it is possible to detect harmonic congruency for higher prime numbers for instruments with odd partials, as the distances between partials are higher in these instruments. With training it might be possible to detect consonance up to prime number 17 or even 19.

== The half-diminished seventh chord in Vogel's Tonnetz ==

[[File:Tristanvorspiel.jpg|thumb|400px|Beginning of the Prelude of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan and Isolde, with the Tristan chord (yellow) and its resolution (blue) [[File:Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg|noicon|40px]] ]]
[[File:Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz.gif|framed|The Tristan chord(yellow) and its resolution (blue) in Vogel's Tonnetz, animated]]

The [[Tristan chord]] is a historically important chord in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''Tristan and Isolde''. Its role in [[Diatonic function|functional harmony]] cannot clearly be determined. It is considered to be tonally unsettled and extremely chromatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kurth (Musikwissenschaftler)|Ernst Kurth:]] ''Romantische Harmonik und ihre Krise in Wagners „Tristan“'', Bern 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vogel's Tonnetz this chord appears to be the dual counterpiece of a major seventh chord. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that this G-sharp minor chord with an added lower seventh (E-sharp or F is a seventh below the reference of this G-sharp minor chord, the D-sharp) resolves in a E major chord with an added upper seventh (see also the adjoining animated figure). In addition, Wagner's way to set this chord is compatible with this view, with the third (B) and the seventh (F or E-sharp) set in a low register. In Vogel's notation one would note this chord as 7Ud{{music|#}}, as the reference note of the G-sharp minor chord is the D-sharp.

It is not very likely that Vogel's notation for minor chords will win recognition. It would require that a C minor chord is denoted as Ug, as lower chord under g. A compromise notation could be to denote the Tristan chord as G{{music|#}}m/F, i.e., as a G-sharp minor chord with an F in the bass.

The "explanation" of the Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz as a well-composed counter-piece of a major seventh chord cannot be compared to an "explanation" in the scope of functional harmony. Both types of explanations cannot really explain why certain chords and chord sequences have established themselves in musical history. Functional harmony focuses on the relation of a chord to the prevailing tonality. In consequence, it cannot explain chord progressions found in late-romantic music where there is no longer a continuous tonality present. In contrast, Vogel's theory focuses more on the congruency of the notes of a single chord, or with the notes of the preceding or subsequent chord than on the role of this chord in the context of a prevailing tonality. Vogel's analysis reveals that the Tristan chord is by no means an attack on the tonal system as such but that it is part of it exactly as its counterpart, the major seventh chord.

A similar chord is also often used by jazz musicians.
There it is commonly notated as a half-diminished seventh chord.
The Tristan chord could hence be noted as Fm&lt;sup&gt;7 b5&lt;/sup&gt;).
This way to describe this chord misses its relation to a G-sharp minor chord.
It results from the practice to describe chords starting from their lowest note.
According to Vogel this is appropriate for upper chords, but not for lower chords.
Lower chords should be described top-down instead of bottom-up.
The principle of starting with the lowest note is not consequently observed in other situations, such as with [[Inverted chord|inverted chords]].
A C major chord in its [[first inversion]] is not typically described as an E minor chord with altered fifth (Em&lt;sup&gt;+5&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Reception ==

Vogel's Tonnetz resorts on a theory (Euler's Tonnetz) that is more than 100 years older than the presently dominating functional harmony.
Vogel's Tonnetz and functional harmony are not in conflict with each other.
On the contrary, they can be seen as complementing each other:
While Vogel's theory focuses on local relations of tones and chords, 
functional harmony considers the global role of a chord in the context of the entire piece of music.
However, the prevalence of functional harmony and the peculiarities of Vogel's notation hamper the general reception.
Vogel's consonance formula has only recently been tested empirically.&lt;ref name="Karas" /&gt; 
Kaernbach suggests a simplified notation:
writing always from left to right, using capital letters for the reference tones (avoiding confusions with the convention to use lowercase letters for minor chords), and using a triangular symbol (&amp;#9650; und &amp;#9660;) to denote upper and lower chords. 
The beginning of the prelude of Tristan and Isolde could then be denoted as 
D&amp;#9660;{{music|#}}7 → E&amp;#9650;7.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Kaernbach: ''Honoring Martin Vogel – Champion of just intonation in music.'' In U. Ansorge et al. (Hrsg.): ''Beiträge zur [https://www.teap.de/docs/teap2013_final_programme_updated.pdf 55.

'''''X-Men: Days of Future Past''''' is a 2014 [[superhero film]] based on the fictional [[X-Men]] characters that appear in [[Marvel Comics]]. A British-American venture,&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/537a84f76612f|title=X-Men Days of Future Past (2014)|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' was directed by [[Bryan Singer]]; it is also the seventh installment of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], the sequel to both ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) and ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (2011) and is the fourth and, currently, final film of the original X-Men series and the second film in the X-Men prequel quadrilogy. The story, inspired by the 1981 ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' storyline "[[Days of Future Past]]" by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], focuses on two time periods, with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] traveling back in time to 1973 to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Hugh Jackman]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[Ellen Page]], [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Ian McKellen]], and [[Patrick Stewart]]. [[Simon Kinberg]] wrote the screenplay from a story he conceived with [[Jane Goldman]] and [[Matthew Vaughn]].

Vaughn had directed ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' and was set to return in ''Days of Future Past'' before leaving for ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]''. Thus Singer, who had directed the first two ''X-Men'' films, made his return as a director, and brought along most of the crew from those productions. With a budget of $205 million, principal photography began in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in April 2013 and concluded in August the same year, with additional filming and [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] taking place in November 2013 and February 2014. Twelve companies handled the visual effects.

''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' premiered in New York City on May 10, 2014, and was theatrically released on May 23. It is the second-best reviewed film in the ''X-Men'' film series following ''[[Logan (2017 film)|Logan]]'', drawing favorable notices for its story, visual effects, action scenes, acting, thematic elements and Singer's direction. During its theatrical run, the film earned over $747 million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth highest-grossing film of 2014]], as well as the second highest-grossing film in the series behind ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]''. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], making it the first ''X-Men'' film to be nominated for an Oscar.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- As per WP:FILMPLOT, limit plot summaries for featured film articles between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;

In a year 2023 at a dystopian future, [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] have been programmed to identify and hunt down [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and any humans who dared to help them. A small band of mutants were attacked and [[Kitty Pryde]] sends [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]'s consciousness [[Time travel|back in time]] a few days before the attack, in an effort to warn the other mutants so as to ensure their survival.

[[Professor Charles Xavier]] and other mutant survivors later meet Kitty Pryde at a remote Chinese temple, and explains the history of the Sentinels, which were designed by [[Bolivar Trask]], whom [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] assassinated in 1973. Feared by Trask's death, the government forces immediately captured Mystique and experimented on by scientists who used her [[DNA]] to advance their Sentinel program explaining how they are able to adapt to nearly every mutant power. Because of Kitty's time traveling ability, Xavier and Magneto plans to prevent Trask's assassination but since Xavier cannot survive going back decades, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] volunteers instead since his regenerative powers would allow him to survive the process.

After awakening in his younger body in 1973, Wolverine arrives at the [[X-Mansion]], discovering the school has been shut down for years due to many of the students and staffs being drafted to the [[Vietnam War]]. A young, broken Xavier turned into [[alcoholism]] and has shunned his mutant powers by using a specialized serum that suppresses his telepathic abilities in order to walk. Hoping to reunite with Mystique, Xavier agrees to help Wolverine and busts [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lensherr]] , who got incarcerated in 1963 after [[John F. Kennedy]] got assassinated due to him, (he maintains his innocence later on) out of his prison cell under [[the Pentagon]], aided by [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]].

Mystique discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants and in revenge plots to assassinate him at the [[Paris Peace Accords]]. Her vengeance results in failure after Xavier, Hank, and Wolverine intervene, and Erik attempts to kill her to prevent the Sentinel takeover from happening. A fight ensures between Hank and Erik which allows Mystique to escape but the three expose themselves as mutants to the world. Trask takes advantage of this event and successfully convinces President [[Richard Nixon]] to initialize the Sentinel program.

Erik obtains his signature helmet back from the Pentagon to block out Xavier's psychic powers and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel prototypes. Returning to the X-Mansion, Xavier ultimately abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and mankind. After using [[Cerebro]] to track Mystique, he, Hank and Wolverine take flight to [[Washington, D.C.]] to put an end to her assassination plot on Trask.

At a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, Xavier, Hank, and Wolverine search for the disguised Mystique. Erik appears, controlling the Sentinels, and uses the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] to surround the [[White House]]. Hank transforms into Beast and fights a Sentinel. Wolverine confronts Erik, but is thrown into the [[Potomac River]]. Nixon, Trask, and Mystique hide in a safe room beneath the White House, but Erik rips it out of the building with the intention of killing the U.S. President.

In the future, the Sentinels managed to find the X-Men and launch an attack on them; one by one perished while attempting to buy more time. Meanwhile back in 1973, Xavier persuades Mystique to spare Trask after she saves President Nixon from Erik, altering history and erasing the Sentinels from existence. Erik and Mystique both leave, one a criminal, the other a hero; and Trask is jailed for attempting to sell U.S. military secrets to Vietnamese officials.

Wolverine wakes up at the mansion in 2023 to find [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Kitty Pryde|Kitty]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Scott Summers]] and Xavier all alive. Wolverine speaks to Xavier, who is also aware of the changes in history. Back in 1973, the younger Wolverine is rescued by Mystique, who is disguised as [[William Stryker]].

In a [[post-credits scene]], set in Ancient Egypt, an Egyptian crowd is seen chanting to [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur]], who telekinetically elevates building blocks to forge [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] as [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|four horsemen]] observe him from afar.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1830579/x-men-days-of-future-past-post-credits-scene-spoilers/|title='X-Men: Days Of Future Past' Post-Credits Scene Explained|last=Zalben|first=Alex|date=May 23, 2014|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Postcredits1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/x-men-days-of-future-past-spoilers-end-post-credits-scene-apocalypse/|title='X-Men: Days of Future Past' End Credits Scene Explained|author=Kendrick, Ben|date=May 29, 2014|publisher=ScreenRant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Wolverine (character)|Logan / Wolverine]]
: A mutant with accelerated healing, heightened animal-like senses, and—in 1973—retractable bone claws; in the future, his skeleton and claws are laced with [[adamantium]] in his body, making him virtually invulnerable. His healing factor also slows his ageing, allowing him to live above the lifespan of an ordinary human.  Jackman noted how Wolverine driving the plot in spite of his gruff personality made for interesting story choices, as "if you want someone to go back to take someone's head off, fantastic, but he's really got to go back and almost act in parts as inspiration, as mentor, as guide, because he can't do it all on his own, which is always his preferred method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/hugh-jackman-x-men-days-of-future-past-interview/|title=Hugh Jackman Talks Reuniting with Bryan Singer, Battling Sentinels, How Long He'll Play Wolverine, and More on the Set of X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST|date=February 19, 2014|author=Weintraub, Steve|publisher=Collider |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James McAvoy]] (younger adult) and [[Patrick Stewart]] (adult) as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier / Professor X]]
: A mutant pacifist and the world's most powerful [[Telepathy|telepath]]. He is also a founder of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, and leader of the [[X-Men]]. Singer described the younger Xavier as "a very different beast from ''First Class''{{'}}s feckless playboy. He's a wounded animal, bearded, long-haired, filled with rage at the way the world has treated him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/x-men-days-future-past-trailer-breakdown/|title=Bay City Roller - X-Men: Days Of Future Past Trailer Breakdown|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinberg said the film was intended to be the story of the younger Xavier beginning to "become the Professor Xavier we know" as Wolverine mentored him.&lt;ref name="Secrets"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/x-men-days-of-future-past/30696/simon-kinberg-interview-x-men-days-of-future-past |title=Simon Kinberg interview: X-Men: Days Of Future Past |date=May 28, 2014 |website=Den of Geek |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing Limited]] |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michael Fassbender]] (younger adult) and [[Ian McKellen]] (adult) as [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]
: A powerful mutant who can manipulate magnetic fields. While he dissents with Xavier due to a wish to prove [[supremacism|mutantkind's superiority]], they revert to being allies as adult Erik helps the X-Men battle against Sentinels in the future.
* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkhölme / Mystique]]
: A mutant with the shapeshifting ability, and also Xavier's childhood friend and adopted sister. Singer said Mystique "is less innocent, evolved, getting closer to where Mystique was in ''[[X2 (film)|X-Men 2]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/x-men-days-of-future-past-cast-interview/ |title=Comic-Con: 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' Interview Highlights |last= Trumbore|first =Dave| accessdate= July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence had suffered skin irritations from the full body make-up used in ''First Class'', and the process was changed so from the neck down it would be a [[bodysuit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/391827/jennifer-lawrence-i-m-sinking-into-a-bit-of-depression|title=Jennifer Lawrence: "I'm Sinking Into a Bit of Depression"|publisher=E!

* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]
: A mutant who can manipulate weather and one of the most battle-tested and powerful X-Men. Asked if her pregnancy affected her role, Berry replied, "I wasn't in as much as I was meant to be. My ever-growing belly was posing a constant challenge! What I could do was getting more limited so the role that I play is so different from what it could have been, due to my surprise pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://x-menfilms.com/2013/08/02/halle-berry-theres-something-very-revealing-about-storm-in-xmen-dofp/ |title=Halle Berry: Revealing and shocking Storm developments in 'Days of Future Past|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kinberg, Berry had another scene in the film that was cut because of Berry's limited schedule.&lt;ref name="Collider set visit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/x-men-days-of-future-past-set-visit/ |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past Set Visit: 90 Thing to Know About X-Men: Days of Future Past |author=Weintruab, Steve |accessdate= June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nicholas Hoult]] (teenager) and [[Kelsey Grammer]] (adult) as [[Beast (comics)|Dr. Hank McCoy / Beast]]
: A mutant with super-strength, agility, reflexes and enhanced speed. Hoult plays the character in scenes set in 1973 while Grammer makes a cameo appearance as Beast in the future setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/kelsey-grammer-cameo-planned-x-men-101200099.html|title=Classic X-Men set for sequel cameo|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=March 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323092422/http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/kelsey-grammer-cameo-planned-x-men-101200099.html#|archive-date=March 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cameo was added because the writers felt Hoult's Beast was "such a sweet, young character" that audiences would want to learn he survived.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/days-of-future-past-secrets-explained/|title=X-Men: Days Of Future Past's Secrets Explained|work=Empire|author=Plumb, Ali|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Grammer learned of this opportunity to return as Beast, a character he had enjoyed playing in ''The Last Stand'', he called Singer asking to get involved, and was flown from New York in secret to avoid drawing attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1848949/x-men-days-of-future-past-beast-cameo-kelsey-grammer/|title=How 'X-Men: Days Of Future Past' Made One Of Its Top-Secret Cameos Possible|publisher=MTV.com|author=Wigler, Josh|date=June 23, 2014|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anna Paquin]] as [[Rogue (comics)|Marie / Rogue]]
: A mutant who can absorb the life force and mutant abilities of anyone she touches. Kinberg wrote a shorter part for Paquin than initially planned because she did not have much time to be on-set.&lt;ref name="Collider set visit" /&gt; During post-production, Paquin's role was reduced to a cameo after most of her scenes were cut; these scenes were later restored on an alternate version of the film, which was released to home media.&lt;ref name=roguecut&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39693 |title=Anna Paquin's Rogue Cut Out Of X-Men: Days Of Future Past |website=Empireonline.com |author=Plumb, Ali |date=December 22, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39967 |title=Bryan Singer On Rogue Being Cut From X-Men: Days of Future Past |website=Empireonline.com |author=Plumb, Ali |date=January 30, 2014|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/117225-anna-paquins-rogue-will-be-present-for-x-men-days-of-future-past |title=Anna Paquin's Rogue Will be Present for X-Men: Days of Future Past|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/fox-to-add-anna-paquin-back-to-x-men-days-of-future-past-1201314028/ |title=Fox to Add Anna Paquin Back to 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'|date=September 25, 2014|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kinberg, Rogue was to be rescued by the future Magneto and Xavier to provide the elder characters a mission, "something like ''[[Unforgiven]]''". Eventually the producers felt it was a subplot that did "not service the main story", and reshot scenes to replace them.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/x-men-writer-on-apocalypse-plot-98479448361.html |title=X-Men Writer On Apocalypse Plot Twists, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch And Much More (Exclusive) |publisher=Yahoo!

: A mutant who can pass through solid objects.

* [[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Bolivar Trask]]

==Production==

===Development===
Producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] stated in August 2006 that a continuation of the ''X-Men'' main film series would require a renegotiation. New cast members of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' were signed, while the older cast members were not.&lt;ref name=australia&gt;{{cite news |author1=Beck, Marilyn |author2=Stacy Jenel Smith  |lastauthoramp=yes | url=http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_4177414 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20070616033903/http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_4177414 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 16, 2007 | title=Major renegotiations possible stumbling block for new 'X-Men' | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' | date=August 13, 2006 | accessdate=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donner said, "There is forty years worth of stories.

===Writing===
Kinberg said the main focus of this film was the future of the ''X-Men'' film series. With the use of cast members from the original trilogy and from ''First Class'', they needed to decide the sequels' destination.&lt;ref name="Collider set visit" /&gt; In preparation for the film, Kinberg studied films about time travel, including ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'', and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. Singer originated a philosophy and a set of rules for the time travel in the film so the story would be as plausible as possible.&lt;ref name="Collider set visit" /&gt;

According to Kinberg, as they were writing the script, they thought it is sensible that Wolverine was traveling between time periods, because of his ageless look and ability to heal rapidly.&lt;ref name="Collider set visit" /&gt; He further stated of making Wolverine the time traveler, "We made the decision for a lot of reasons&amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp;he's the protagonist of the franchise, and probably the most beloved character to a mass audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://x-menfilms.com/2013/12/03/writer-simon-kinberg-explains-how-first-class-2-turned-into-xmen-dofp/ |title=Kinberg: How First Class 2 became Days of Future Past |author=XMF, Anthony |date=December 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinberg and Vaughn considered Bishop and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] candidates for the role of time traveler.&lt;ref name="Secrets"/&gt; Kinberg said [[Rachel Summers]] was in the first draft of the script; she sent Wolverine back to 1973. The character was later replaced with Kitty Pryde, to whom Kinberg gave a secondary power of sending people's consciousnesses into the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://x-menfilms.com/simon-kinberg-on-kitty-pryde-taking-over-rachel-summers-role-in-x-men-days-of-future-past/ |title=Simon Kinberg on Kitty Pryde over Rachel Summers' role in X-Men: Days of Future Past|date=June 17, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juggernaut, [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Psylocke]] were also considered for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Juggernaut-Almost-Looked-Like-X-Men-Days-Future-Past-43494.html |title=Juggernaut Almost Looked Like This in X-Men: Days of Future Past |author=O'Connell, Sean |date=June 17, 2014 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/x-men-days-future-past-concept-art-jubilee |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past Concept Art Reveals Future Jubilee &amp; Juggernaut|author=Shaw-Williams, Hannah |date=June 18, 2014 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/295935-gambit-and-nightcrawler-heading-to-x-men-apocalypse |title=Gambit and Nightcrawler Heading to X-Men: Apocalypse? |date=March 20, 2014| accessdate=November 26, 2014 |author=Lesnick, Silas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Psylocke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://x-menfilms.com/simon-kinberg-x-men-apocalypse-completes-the-first-class-trilogy/ |title=Simon Kinberg: X-Men: Apocalypse Completes the First Class Trilogy |date=September 26, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer was asked how the film integrates the themes of the earlier ''X-Men'' films; he said, "It establishes that some villain characters may have been right with their fears. It confronts the notions of hope and second chances. Its characters that are lost trying to find themselves. In ''X-Men 1'' and ''2'', the characters had come into their own and knew who they were. In this one, they're all lost and they're trying to keep it together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/bryan-singer/29368/bryan-singer-interview-x-men-days-of-future-past-star-trek-and-more |title=Bryan Singer interview: X-Men.

===Filming===
''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' had a production budget of $205 million.&lt;ref name="filmla"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filmla.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2014_FeatureFilm_study_v10_WEB.pdf|format=pdf|page=6|title=2014 Feature Film Study|publisher=FilmL.A.|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Principal photography]] began on April 15, 2013, at Mel's Cité du Cinema in [[Montreal]], Canada, and ended on August 17, 2013.&lt;ref name="FilmingMTV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="productionwraps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178807-production-wraps-on-x-men-days-of-future-past |title=Production Wraps on X-Men: Days of Future Past| author= Perry, Spencer|date=August 17, 2013|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|title=Bryan Singer Talks JACK THE GIANT SLAYER, Re-Writing the Film in Pre-Production, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and More|url=http://collider.com/bryan-singer-jack-the-giant-slayer-x-men-interview/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=February 25, 2013|date=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming had to begin in April 2013 to accommodate the cast's individual schedules.&lt;ref name="Collider set visit" /&gt; [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]], [[Montreal City Hall]], and [[McGill University]] were also used as filming locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/04/28/montreal-invaded-by-x-men |title=Montreal invaded by 'X-Men'|author=QMI Agency|accessdate=May 14, 2013|date=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/177287-tensions-rise-in-new-set-photo-from-x-men-days-of-future-past |title=Tensions Rise in New Set Photo From X-Men: Days of Future Past|date= June 4, 2013|accessdate= June 5, 2013|author= Perry, Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aerial plate unit was sent to film in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Richard Stammers" /&gt; Additional filming took place in Montreal in November 2013 and February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/x-men-days-of-future-past-heads-back-to-montreal-for-reshoots |title=X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST HEADS BACK TO MONTREAL FOR RESHOOTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Beast-Gets-Work-X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Set-Photo-41700.html |title=Beast Gets To Work In New X-Men: Days Of Future Past Set Photo|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', the film is the second most expensive produced by 20th Century Fox after ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/report-days-future-past-second-657780 |title=Report: 'Days of Future Past' Second Only to 'Avatar' in Cost to Fox |date=November 19, 2013|accessdate=December 29, 2013|author=McMillan, Greame}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book writer Chris Claremont said in an interview that he was consulted for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2013/08/15/chris-claremont-x-men-days-of-future-past-interview/ |title=X-Icon Chris Claremont Talks X-Men's 50th, 'Days of Future Past' |publisher=MTV |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' is the first ''X-Men'' film to be filmed in native [[3D film|3D]]; it was shot using [[Arri Alexa]]-M cameras with Leica Prime lenses and Fujinon Zoom lenses, along with [[3ality Technica]] TS-35 camera rigs and Stereo Image Processor (SIP) technology systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/definitionmags/status/315433238673891328 |title=Twitter / definitionmags: X-Men: Days of Future Past|accessdate= March 24, 2013|date= March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/bryan-singer-to-shoot-x-men-days-of-future-past-in-3d-hayley-atwell-in-captain-america-the-winter-soldier-after-all-20130213 |title=Bryan Singer To Shoot 'X-Men: Days Of Future Past' In 3D |author=Kevin Jagernauth |date=February 13, 2013 |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605045949/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/bryan-singer-to-shoot-x-men-days-of-future-past-in-3d-hayley-atwell-in-captain-america-the-winter-soldier-after-all-20130213# |archive-date=June 5, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of photography [[Newton Thomas Sigel]] was asked about using Arri Alexa-M cameras; he said, "For Bryan and myself, the Alexa has been almost the gateway to getting the look we like in film". Sigel added that the Arri Alexa-M camera's small size was a big advantage to the film's main unit, which carried three 3D rigs. The film also used the Alexa XTs for the production's 2D work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arri.de/news/alexa-xt-on-x-men/ |title=ARRI Group: News |accessdate=June 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727192335/http://www.arri.de/news/alexa-xt-on-x-men/# |archive-date=July 27, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production designer John Myhre said his work load was "six months squeeze[d] down in to 3-4 months", given the sets were massive but he did not have the usual time to design and build before principal photography began. The lue underground hallways and Cerebro sets were faithful recreations of the sets seen in the first ''X-Men'', albeit ransacked and damaged to imply the government had raided the mansion.&lt;ref name=myrhe/&gt; The sets had many hidden "Xs", including the staircase of the X-Mansion. Myrhe said he wanted to embrace the 1970s setting in the same way ''First Class'' embraced its 1960s setting,&lt;ref name="Collider set visit" /&gt; and costume designer Louise Mingenbach also drew heavily from 1970s styles for the clothing seen in the 1973 scenes. Hoult wore corduroys, Jackman a wooden-paneled buckle and a peacock-print shirt, and McAvoy wore a brown leather jacket. Peters wore 1981-inspired clothing; this was Mingenbach's way of showing Quicksilver's irreverence for the exact time and place. In one scene, Mingenbach gave Fassbender as the younger Erik Lehnsherr a fedora as a nod to the one the character wore in the first X-Men film.&lt;ref name=louise&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/fashion/201405/x-men-days-of-future-past-costumes |title=GQ+A with Louise Mingenbach: The Days of Future Past Costume Designer on X-Men |date=May 23, 2014| work= [[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] |accessdate=June 22, 2014 |first=Phili|last= Stelios}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the future period of the film, Mingenbach wanted a darker, slightly futuristic and tactical look for the characters. This included changing the suit Patrick Stewart had previously worn as Xavier to battle fatigues.&lt;ref name=louise /&gt;

The Sentinels had two separate versions, to depict how the earlier prototypes built by Trask in the 1970s evolved into the adaptable killing machines of the dystopian future.&lt;ref name=sentinels&gt;{{cite video|title=Sentinels: For a Secure Future|location=''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' Blu-ray|year=2014|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|format=Featurette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer described the 1973 version as "a little fun and stylish but also a little retro", with a key element being that they are made of plastic to be unaffected by Magneto's powers. Myhre used styles from molded plastics from the 1970s to design Sentinels from that period,&lt;ref name="Collider set visit" /&gt; and cited inspiration from both the cars of the decade and "those wonderful TV sets that were round with smoked glass panels". The overall style was bulky to fit "the traditional idea of a robot looks like",&lt;ref name=sentinels/&gt; and drew the most from the comics version, such as the purple color and a humanoid shape, while trying to stand out on its own with its retro design.&lt;ref name="Myhre Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/johny-myhre-x-men-days-of-future-past-interview/ |title=John Myhre Talks X-Men Days of Future Past, Sentinels and Easter Eggs |author=Weintraub, Steve |accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The robots' ability to fly was compared to a [[Harrier Jump Jet]], as the Sentinels had [[V/STOL|vertical takeoff]] and could glide. Life-sized Sentinels were built by [[Legacy Effects]] to be featured on the set, and had articulated joints to be fully poseable. The sound effects averted metallic noises, while adding [[Woofer|woof]] effects on the Sentinels' footsteps to display its weight on the ground.&lt;ref name=sentinels/&gt;

On the other hand, the future Sentinels would resemble "giant versions of Mystique" to show how their technological development was based on studying the shapeshifting mutant's DNA. Thus their design is sleek and feminine, with a body covered in mechanical scales that move during the process of adapting to a mutant's attack, while also featuring angular and dark faces to enhance the intimidation. The future robots would feature what Singer described as "biomechanical technology to transform to adapt to other mutants, to take on their physicality and some of their powers to use against mutantkind", which the director imagined to be fueled by [[nanotechnology]] and "the ability to really change things almost at a molecular level". The Sentinels' heads would also open up as an extra weapon, and for straighter combat the robots could create blades and spikes out of their limbs. The crackling sound of the robots' scales was made by rubbing riveted belts on [[shale]] rocks.&lt;ref name=fxguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/future-threat-x-men-days-of-future-past/|title=Future threat – X-Men: Days of Future Past|publisher=Fxguide|first=Ian|last=Failes|date=May 27, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sentinels/&gt;

For the future setting of the film, a set featuring a hillside monastery was built. Myhre was inspired by Chinese temples built on the sides of cliffs. The future set also featured a mixture of architectural styles from China, India, and Indonesia. Part of the set was a big wall, which was inspired by the [[Great Wall of China]].&lt;ref name="Myhre Interview" /&gt;

===Visual effects===
''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' had 1,311 visual effects shots produced by twelve studios. Richard Stammer served as the overall effects supervisor based on his work for ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.&lt;ref name="Richard Stammers"/&gt; The leading company was [[Moving Picture Company]], who created the future Sentinels and worked on the sequences involving the X-Jet and Cerebro's red virtual world.&lt;ref name="Richard Stammers"/&gt; The Sentinels' scaled bodies were created by adapting a tool originally developed to create hair and fur, which would later evolve into creating a proxy representation of each individual scale as a "[[hair follicle|follicle]]".&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; Another major contributor was [[Digital Domain]], with effects from the 1973 portion that encompassed nearly a third of the work. These included the Sentinels, Mystique's transformations and eyes, and various digital environments. Digital augmentation turned a remote airstrip into a Vietnam prisoner camp and added Paris' famed [[mansard roof]]tops to the Montreal locations. The environment work based on Washington, D.C. required the team to study period references of the [[National Mall]] and [[White House]], and photograph almost all of RFK Stadium to create a detailed digital replica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=8066|title=X-MEN – DAYS OF FUTURE PAST: Lou Pecora – VFX |author=Frei, Vincent|publisher=Art of VFX|date=May 28, 2014|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Rising Sun Pictures]] created a sequence considered by many reviewers the centerpiece of the film's effects, where Quicksilver uses his super speed in the Pentagon kitchen. Depicting how, to a speedster, actions in real time come down to a virtual standstill, objects float around in [[slow motion]]. After doing [[LIDAR Analyst|LIDAR]] scan of the kitchen set, the digital recreation added many [[computer-generated imagery|computer generated props]]  - cooking gear, cutlery, vegetables and water released by a [[fire sprinkler system]] - rendered in near microscopic detail regarding placement and lighting, particularly because the footage had to work in 3D. To simulate Quicksilver running on the walls, Evan Peters and a stunt double were filmed in both the set being suspended by a harness and on a treadmill that stood in front of a [[chroma key]] green screen. Only Peters' legs were digitally replaced.&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsp.com.au/x-men-days-of-future-past/|title=Rising Sun Pictures Makes Time Stand Still in "X-Men: Days of Future Past"|publisher=Rising Sun Pictures|accessdate=Jan 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the sequence only having 29 effects shots,&lt;ref name="Richard Stammers"/&gt; it required nearly seven months of work from RSP's team of 70 artists.&lt;ref name="Tom Fedorowytsch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-16/adelaide-visual-effects-supervisor-shocked-by-oscar-nomination/6021988|title=Oscar nominations 2015: Adelaide visual effects supervisor 'shocked' by Oscar nomination|publisher=ABC Online |date=Jan 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] worked on Beast's transformations, the creation of Xavier's plane, and speed effects for Quicksilver. They also worked with Digital Domain on the sequence featuring the inside of the 1973 Sentinel.  Mokko Studio worked on Mystique's eyes and costume fixes. [[Cinesite]] worked on the future New York City in the opening prologue along with clean-ups, wire removals, and production fixes. Fuel VFX worked on holographic effects and Havok's mutant powers. Vision Globale worked on visual effects relating to a dream and flashback sequence. [[Hydraulx]], Lola and [[Method Studios]] handled a number of compositions and production fixes. The Third Floor worked on extensive story-boarding and visualisation.&lt;ref name="Richard Stammers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=7910 |title=X-Men{{mdash}}Days of Future Past: Richard Stammers{{mdash}}Production VFX Supervisor |author=Frei, Vincent |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Director Bryan Singer's regular collaborator [[John Ottman]] worked on the score of the film, in addition to being its editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/175917-john-ottman-to-score-x-men-days-of-future-past |title=John Ottman to Score X-Men: Days of Future Past |date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2013|author=Perry, Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottman is the first composer to score more than one film in the ''X-Men'' film series, having previously scored ''X2'' (2003). This also marked the first time a theme from a previous X-Men film has been retained; Ottman re-used some of his themes from ''X2'', most notably the main title theme. While Ottman retained the same style of "lyrical and build upon character themes that would weave in and out of the film and done in a straight orchestral sense" that he had used in ''X2'', following Singer's request he tried to compose "something more 'modern'" that could be compared to other contemporary superhero scores, and not follow [[Henry Jackman]]' score for ''First Class''. The 1970s setting inspired the inclusion of "[[synthesizer|synthesized]] elements with some analog synths and electric piano and bass and some guitar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/john-ottman-on-the-balancing-act-of-editing-and-scoring-x-men-days-of-future-past/|title=John Ottman on the balancing act of editing and scoring 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'|publisher=HitFix|first=Kristopher|last=Tapley|date=May 22, 2014|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film score was released on [[Music download|digital download]] on May 16, 2014, on [[Compact Disc|CD]] on May 26, 2014, and on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] on August 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/x-men-days-future-past-original/id879524426 |title=iTunes - Music - X-Men: Days of Future Past (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) by John Ottman |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/X-Men-Future-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B00IUA5FC0 |title=John Ottman's X-Men: Days of Future Past Soundtrack |date=May 3, 2014|accessdate=May 3, 2014|author=Amazon UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiconvinyl.com/catalog/original-soundtrack/x-mendays-of-future-past#.VAAcAtnqKSo |title=Original Soundtrack - X-Men:Days of Future Past |accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expanded version of the soundtrack, including music exclusive to ''The Rouge Cut'', was released on June 24, 2015 by [[Sony Classical Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/06/24/x-men-days-of-future-past-the-rogue-cut-soundtrack-details/ |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past - The Rogue Cut Soundtrack Details |date=June 24, 2015 |accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] teasing ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' was attached to the theatrical release of ''The Wolverine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178151-exclusive-hugh-jackman-on-x-men-days-of-future-past|title=Exclusive: Hugh Jackman on X-Men: Days of Future Past |author=Douglas, Edward|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene, set two years after the events of ''The Wolverine'', depicts Wolverine going through an airport security checkpoint while a commercial for Trask Industries plays in the background. Suddenly, Wolverine notices that all the metal objects around him start to shake and levitate. He turns around to see Magneto, who says he needs Wolverine's help to combat a threat to all mutants. When Wolverine asks Magneto why he should trust him, the people around them freeze as Xavier approaches Wolverine and assures him that Magneto is telling the truth. Adam Pockross of [[Yahoo! Movies]] described the mid-credits scene as the coolest part of ''The Wolverine'' and wrote, "Boom! And that's how you tease the next film: by giving us so much to chew on, yet so few answers".&lt;ref name="TheWolverine"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/wolverine-post-credits-scene-perfectly-sets-next-x-160949633.html|title='Wolverine' Post-Credits Sequence Opens Door For Next X-Men Film|author=Pockross, Adam|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child wrote, "overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of us will be chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/x-men-days-of-future-past-trailer |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past trailer: an overdose of superheroes?|date=October 31, 2013|accessdate=November 1, 2013|first=Ben|last= Child | work=The Guardian |location =UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-credits scene teasing ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' was attached to the theatrical release of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' in April 2014. In the scene, which is set during the Vietnam War, Mystique tries to infiltrate a military camp led by William Stryker to recruit fellow mutants Havok, Ink, and Toad. ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' director [[Marc Webb]] had an existing contract with [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] to direct another film following ''[[500 Days of Summer]]'' (2009). After ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', Webb's negotiations with [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] stalled because of his commitment to Fox. Fox eventually agreed to allow Webb to direct the sequel of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', and in exchange, Sony promoted the X-Men film without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/the-secret-deal-behind-spider-man-2-plugging-the-x-men-exclusive-1201158216/ |title=The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Secret Contract Got X-Men Coda in Film|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=April 18, 2014|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, three viral websites were launched before the release of the film{{mdash}}Trask-Industries.com in July 2013, TheBentBullet.com in November 2013 and 25Moments.com in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178201-comic-con-x-men-days-of-future-viral-campaign-kicks-off |title=Comic-Con: X-Men: Days of Future Past Viral Campaign Kicks Off!|author=Perry, Spencer|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate= July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/180503-x-men-days-of-future-past-explores-magnetos-involvement-in-the-jfk-assassination |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past Explores Magneto's Involvement in the JFK Assassination |author=Lesnick, Silas |date=November 25, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/298611-an-x-men-days-of-future-past-interactive-timeline-explores-future-history#/slide/1|title=An X-Men: Days of Future Interactive Timeline Explores Future History|publisher=Superhero Hype|date=April 11, 2014|accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further promote the film, Jackman made a guest appearance on the April 28, 2014, episode of ''[[WWE Raw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/videos/raw-guest-star-hugh-jackman-is-confronted-by-magneto-raw-april-28-2014-26270969 |title=Raw guest star Hugh Jackman is confronted by "Magneto": Raw, April 28, 2014 |publisher=[[WWE]] |date=April 28, 2014 |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/04/28/x-men-star-hugh-jackman-will-probably-punch-someone-on-wwe-raw-tonight/ |title='X-Men' star Hugh Jackman will probably punch someone on WWE Raw tonight |author=Payne, Marissa |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=April 28, 2014 |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2616545/Hugh-Jackman-wrestles-Magneto-WWE-Raw.html |title=Wolverine rules the ring!

====''The Rogue Cut''====
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released an alternate version of the film, titled ''The Rogue Cut'', on July 14, 2015. It added 17 minutes of previously unused footage, including a subplot involving Anna Paquin's character [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], whose role was reduced to a brief cameo in the theatrical release.&lt;ref name="The Rogue Cut"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/339801-bryan-singer-reveals-x-men-days-of-future-past-rogue-cut-release-date|title=Bryan Singer Reveals X-Men: Days of Future Past Rogue Cut Release Date |last=Evry|first=Max |date=May 5, 2015 | publisher= [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]] via SuperheroHype.com|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rogue Cut'' was also screened at the 2015 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramascreen.com/there-will-be-x-men-days-of-future-past-rogue-cut-screening-at-san-diego-comic-con-heres-details/ There Will Be “X-Men: Days of Future Past Rogue Cut” Screening at San Diego Comic-Con! Here’s Details!] Rama's Screen, June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Rogue Cut'', Rogue's role is more consequential, and the narrative is more complex: When Kitty Pryde is accidentally wounded after Wolverine's consciousness experiences a phase between past and future from seeing Stryker in 1973, Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the former X-Mansion, the one place where Xavier's mind cannot reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. Xavier, Magneto, and Iceman succeed in rescuing Rogue, but at the cost of Iceman's life. Rogue uses her power to take over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels are able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand that was severed from the X-Jet during their escape. In another scene, Mystique spends the night at the X-Mansion, revisits her previous romance with Beast, and destroys Cerebro the next morning in order to prevent Xavier from finding her. A new mid-credits scene shows Bolivar Trask imprisoned at the Pentagon cell for selling military secrets to foreign countries.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' has an approval rating of 90% based on 305 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' combines the best elements of the series to produce a satisfyingly fast-paced outing that ranks among the franchise's finest installments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/x_men_days_of_future_past/ |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/x-men-days-of-future-past |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="x-men rules"/&gt;

Sean O'Connell of Cinema Blend gave the film four and a half stars out of five, and said it was "the greatest, most complete and staggeringly entertaining [''X-Men'' film] to date".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Connell|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/X-Men-Days-of-Future-Past-6836.html|title=X-Men: Days of Future Past Review - CinemaBlend.com|accessdate=4 July 2014|publisher=Cinema Blend}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave it four out of five stars and called it, "The best X-Men film since the second one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Thomas|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=138033|title=Empire's X-Men: Days of Future Past Movie Review|accessdate=14 June 2014|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steve Rose of ''[[The Guardian]]'' rated the film three stars out of five; he said, "Non-devotees might struggle, but director Bryan Singer whips up the action towards a symphonic climax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Rose |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/13/x-men-days-of-future-past-review |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past review - 'like trying to follow two games of chess at once' &amp;#124; Film |work=[[The Guardian]]| location =UK |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "While it's more dramatically diffuse than the reboot and lacks a definitive villain, the new film is shot through with a stirring reverence for the Marvel Comics characters and their universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David|last=Rooney|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/x-men-days-future-past/review/703209 |title=''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' (2014) |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "If the characters' quandaries at times feel overly circumscribed, they're also advanced with a bracing emotional directness, devoid of either cynicism or sentimentalism, that touches genuine chords of feeling over the course of the film's fleet 130-minute [sic] running time".&lt;ref name=justinchang&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-x-men-days-of-future-past-1201177971/ |title=Film Review: 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' |date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=August 2, 2014|last=Chang|first= Justin| work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archivedate= August 11, 2014 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140811131431/http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-x-men-days-of-future-past-1201177971/| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, James Charisma of ''[[Playboy]]'' ranked the film #8 on a list of ''15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals''.&lt;ref name="Playboy"&gt;{{cite web | title = Revenge of the Movie: 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals | publisher = [[Playboy]] | url = http://www.playboy.com/articles/15-sequels-better-than-the-original | author = Charisma, James | date = March 15, 2016 | accessdate = July 19, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160726093750/http://www.playboy.com/articles/15-sequels-better-than-the-original# | archive-date = July 26, 2016 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Robbie Collin of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' rated the film two stars out of five and called the plot "a curate's egg, thoroughly scrambled". He concluded, "The film squanders both of its casts, reeling from one fumbled set-piece to the next. It seems to have been constructed in a stupor, and you watch in a daze of future past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10825791/X-Men-Days-of-Future-Past-review-A-mess-of-mutants.html |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past, review: 'A mess of mutants' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| location =UK |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Abrams, writing for [[RogerEbert.com]], gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it a "visually driven and paint-by-numbers-plot". Abrams was critical of the undeveloped subplots that built up because the film's pacing left little time to develop each element of the story set in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/x-men-days-of-future-past-2014 |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past, review by Simon Abrams for rogerebert.com |publisher=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following criticism of ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' for killing off major characters such as Professor Charles Xavier, Cyclops, and Jean Grey, ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' has subsequently been viewed by some critics as a revision of those controversial plot elements in ''X-Men: The Last Stand''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/five-ways-x-men-days-of-future-past-fixes-the-franchises-mistakes/|title=Five Ways "X-Men: Days of Future Past Fixes the Franchise's Previous Mistakes|website=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception== 
The drama received positive reception. It attracted more than 100 million views on [[iQiyi]] within days of its premiere, making it one of the most popular TV series tailored for the online platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/2016-05/27/content_25495425.htm|title=Crime thriller series 'Yu Zui' sees good response|work=[[China Daily]]|date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a score of 8.9/10 on [[Douban]], becoming one of the highest rated dramas.&lt;ref name=yuzui /&gt; Television producer and critic Xie Xiaohu credits the success of “Yu Zui” to the unique character of its protagonist, who differs from the usual straight-laced, incorruptible police officers; and the show's attention-grabbing and lewd content.&lt;ref name=cfi /&gt; The background of the original writer Chang Shuxin, who was jailed decades ago and thus has a good understanding of police officers, also contributed to the success of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixthtone.com/news/bad-boy-cop-goes-against-grain-web-drama-%E2%80%98yu-zui%E2%80%99|title=Bad Boy Cop Goes Against the Grain in Web Drama ‘Yu Zui’|date=2016-06-15|work=Sixth Tone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the show's success, the series was later taken off the internet. Numerous sources have pointed to China’s media regulation body, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television (SAPPRFT), who banned the show for its explicit content.&lt;ref name=cfi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinafilminsider.com/bad-boy-cop-show-disappears-internet/|title=Bad Boy Cop Show Disappears From Internet|date=2016-10-12|work=China Film Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;
