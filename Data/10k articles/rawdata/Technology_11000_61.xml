'''ASRock Inc.''' ({{zh|t=華擎科技股份有限公司}}) is a [[Taiwan]]ese manufacturer of [[motherboard]]s, industrial PCs and [[home theater PC]]s (HTPC). Led by Ted Hsu, it was founded in 2002 and is currently owned by Taiwanese electronics company [[Pegatron]].

==History==
ASRock Inc. is a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer which focuses on the development of motherboards, industrial PCs and HTPCs.

ASRock was originally spun off from [[Asus]] in 2002 in order to compete with companies like [[Foxconn]] for the commodity OEM market. Since then, ASRock has also gained momentum in the [[DIY]] sector and plans for moving the company upstream began in 2007 following a successful [[initial public offering|IPO]] on the [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2007/11/09/2003386995 | publisher=Taipei Times | title=ASRock shares soar in big board debut | date=9 November 2007 | accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 it became part of [[Pegatron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legitreviews.com/asus-to-gradually-reduce-holdings-in-pegatron-technology_12747 | publisher=Legit Reviews | title=ASUS To Gradually Reduce Holdings In Pegatron Technology | date=29 March 2012 | accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asrock currently produces consumer, server, workstation and HTPC motherboards.

ASRock has distributors in over 90 countries around the world and branches in Europe, US and China.

ASRock established itself as a server motherboard affiliate in April 2013, having received orders from 10 mid-size clients for server and industrial PC motherboards and forming partnerships with system integrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20150316PD205 | title=ASRock to supply server motherboards to Alibaba | publisher=DIGITIMES | date=16 March 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316143928/http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20150316PD205 | archivedate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASRock is the world's third largest motherboard manufacturer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/mainboards/display/20110130232851_Asrock_Becomes_World_s_Third_Largest_Maker_of_Mainboards.html | publisher=X-bit labs | title=Asrock Becomes World's Third Largest Maker of Mainboards | date=30 January 2011 | accessdate=22 November 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112085728/http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/mainboards/display/20110130232851_Asrock_Becomes_World_s_Third_Largest_Maker_of_Mainboards.html | archive-date=2013-11-12 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; having cooperated with Johnathan "[[Fatal1ty]]" Wendel - 12 times FPS World Games championship record holder - in the development of a gaming-oriented enthusiast motherboard in 2011. Additionally, in early 2012 ASRock enlisted the help of HWBOT world overclocking champion, Nick Shih.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrock.com/general/about.asp | publisher=ASRock | title=About ASRock | accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9696">'''American Water Works Association''' ('''AWWA''') is an international [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], scientific and educational association founded to improve water quality and supply. Established in 1881, it has a membership (as of 2012) of around 50,000 members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awwa.org/about-us.aspx|title=About Us - American Water Works Association|first=American Water Works|last=Association|website=www.awwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the success of the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] after 1974, senior EPA officials cite the vital role that AWWA played as kind of a non‐threatening meeting ground, particularly at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=24 Transcript] (see p24).&lt;/ref&gt;

AWWA members include: water utilities, treatment plant operators and managers, [[scientist]]s, [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], [[Academia|academics]], [[Regulatory agency|regulators]], and others with an interest in water supply and [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seametrics.com/blog/think-tank-awwa-focuses-on-water/ US Think Tank AWWA Focuses on Water], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirolink.org/resource.html?catid=5&amp;itemid=246 The EnviroLink Network - American Water Works Association], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; AWWA works through advocacy, communications, conferences, education and training, science and technology, and local action among 43 AWWA Sections throughout [[North America]].

AWWA launched AWWAIndia, its first international community, in 2015. AWWAIndia's headquarters office is located in Mumbai, India.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.awwa.org/publications/connections/connections-story/articleid/3904/a-new-day-dawns-in-indias-water-history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Publications and conferences==
To broaden distribution of information on water and related subjects, AWWA publishes the periodicals ''Journal AWWA'' and ''Opflow.''  AWWA also publishes a variety of books, training manuals, standards, reports and videos for use by water professionals and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterandwastewater.com/www_services/readingroom/awwa.htm AWWA-WEF Publications &amp; Books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620140407/http://www.waterandwastewater.com/www_services/readingroom/awwa.htm |date=2012-06-20 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardmethods.org/ Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookfinder.com/author/american-water-works-association/ American Water Works Association - BookFinder.com], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Association also hosts an annual [[business conference|conference]] and exposition for the entire organization each summer in North America. Section conferences are also held in all parts of North America. Specialty conferences are held throughout the year on topics including water quality, distribution systems and utility management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wef.org/conferences/page_details.aspx?id=8877 AWWA/WEF Information Management &amp; Technology Conference and Exposition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504220709/http://www.wef.org/conferences/page_details.aspx?id=8877 |date=2012-05-04 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proceedings of the annual and specialty conferences are published by AWWA.

==Water industry resources==
Through the Partnership for Safe Water AWWA also works with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and other water organizations to help water providers optimize system performance beyond existing regulatory levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/water-utility-management/partnership-for-safe-water.aspx|title=Resources &amp; Tools - American Water Works Association|first=American Water Works|last=Association|website=www.awwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AWWA offers opportunities for people to meet, learn, and network at the international, national, and section levels. In addition to publications and conferences for water professionals, AWWA hosts a variety of workshops, symposia, teleconferences, and programs focused on specific aspects of water stewardship.  In cooperation with other professional associations, AWWA is a resource for water professionals’ continuing education and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwdmag.com/wef-awwa-launch-new-work-water-website WEF, AWWA Launch New 'Work for Water' Website] , Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.com/news/wef-water-security.htm ASCE, AWWA Release Security Standard Guidelines for Water/Wastewater Utilities], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
AWWA presents a number of awards every year to individuals who provide notable service to the drinking water community.  Among the major awards given are the [[Abel Wolman]] Award of Excellence, the [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller]] Award, and the [[John L. Leal|Dr. John L. Leal]] Award.

==Water standards development==
In 1908, AWWA began developing industry standards for products, processes and best practices. The AWWA Standards Program is recognized internationally as a source for scientific and management reference resources for the water community. Currently, there are over 150 AWWA Standards covering [[filtration]] materials, treatment chemicals, [[disinfection]] practices, meters, [[valve]]s, utility management practices, [[storage tank]]s, pumps, and [[ductile iron]], [[steel]], [[concrete]], asbestos-cement, and [[plastic pipe]] and fittings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dot.ny.gov/main/business-center/consultants/forms-publications-and-instructions/engineering-information-issuance-system/eb-repository/eb01038.pdf ENGINEERING BULLETIN 01-038], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Standing committees periodically review and update the standards as required.

In May 1985, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] entered into a cooperative agreement with a consortium led by [[NSF International]] to develop voluntary third-party consensus standards and a certification program for all direct and indirect drinking water additives. Other members of the consortium include AWWA. The consortium is responsible for the cooperative effort of manufacturers, regulators, product users and other interested parties that develop and maintain the NSF standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsf.org/business/newsroom/pdf/Std60-Brochure.pdf Certification Programs and Services for the Water Treatment and Chemicals Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513132637/http://nsf.org/business/newsroom/pdf/Std60-Brochure.pdf |date=2012-05-13 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water for People==
In February 1991, AWWA founded [[Water For People]], a non-profit international development organization that helps people in [[Developing country|developing countries]] improve their quality of life by supporting the development of locally sustainable drinking water resources, sanitation facilities, and health and hygiene education programs.

==Drinking Water Week==
For more than 35 years, AWWA has set aside a week in the spring to recognize the importance of safe drinking water throughout North America.  In 1988, AWWA brought the event to the attention of the US government and formed a coalition along with the League of Women Voters, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Subsequently, AWWA worked with Representative [[Robert Roe]] and Senator [[Dennis DeConcini]] to sponsor a resolution naming the first week of May as "Drinking Water Week."&lt;ref name="waterweek"&gt;[http://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/public-affairs/public-affairs-events/drinking-water-week.aspx "History of Drinking Water Week."] [http://www.awwa.org American Water Works Association]. Accessed January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, a joint congressional resolution declaration was passed and signed by President Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name="waterweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water treatment training|url=https://watertreatmentservices.co.uk/water/water-treatment-training/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
AWWA is an umbrella organization for 43 sections, each of whom represents a specific geographic region. There are 37 AWWA sections in the United States, 5 Canadian sections, and one each in Mexico and Puerto Rico. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.awwa.org/membership/sections-your-local-awwa/section-services/section-map.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TMII Aeromovel train.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Aeromovel]] train at [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], opened in 1989. The girder under the train forms an air duct. The vehicle is connected to a propulsion plate in the duct which is then driven by air pressure.]]
An '''atmospheric railway''' uses differential [[air pressure]] to provide power for propulsion of a railway vehicle. A static power source can transmit motive power to the vehicle in this way, avoiding the necessity of carrying mobile power generating equipment. The air pressure, or partial [[vacuum]] (i.e., negative relative pressure) can be conveyed to the vehicle in a continuous pipe, where the vehicle carries a piston running in the tube. Some form of re-sealable slot is required to enable the piston to be attached to the vehicle. Alternatively the entire vehicle may act as the piston in a large tube.

Several variants of the principle were proposed in the early 19th century, and a number of practical forms were implemented, but all were overcome with unforeseen disadvantages and discontinued within a few years.

A modern proprietary system has been developed and is in use for short-distance applications. [[Porto Alegre Metro]] airport connection is one of them.

==History==
In the early days of railways, single vehicles or groups were propelled by human power, or by horses. As mechanical power came to be understood, locomotive engines were developed; the ''iron horse''. These had serious limitations, in particular being much heavier than the wagons in use, they broke the rails; and adhesion at the iron-to-iron wheel-rail interface was a limitation, for example in trials on the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway#A locomotive|Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]].

Many engineers turned their attention to transmitting power from a static power source, a ''stationary engine'', to a moving train. Such an engine could be more robust and with more available space, potentially more powerful. The solution to transmitting the power, before the days of practical electricity, was the use of either a [[Cable railway|cable system]] or air pressure.

===Medhurst===
In 1799, [[George Medhurst]] of London discussed the idea of moving goods pneumatically through cast iron pipes, and in 1812, he proposed blowing passenger carriages through a tunnel.&lt;ref name="RAB"&gt;R. A. Buchanan, ''The Atmospheric Railway of I.K. Brunel'', Social Studies of Science, Vol. 22, No. 2, Symposium on 'Failed Innovations' (May 1992), pp. 231–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medhurst proposed two alternative systems: either the vehicle itself was the piston, or the tube was relatively small with a separate piston. He never patented his ideas and they were not taken further by him.&lt;ref name = clayton&gt;Howard Clayton, ''The Atmospheric Railways'', self-published by Howard Clayton, Lichfield, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==

===Vallance===
In 1824, a man called Vallance took out a patent and built a short demonstration line; his system consisted of a 6-ft diameter cast iron tube with rails cast in to the lower part; the vehicle was the full size of the tube and bear skin was used to seal the annular space. To slow the vehicle down, doors were opened at each end of the vehicle. Vallance's system worked, but was not adopted commercially.&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;

===Pinkus===
[[File:Dalkey Atmospheric Railway.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Arriving at Kingstown on the Dalkey Atmospheric Railway in 1844]]
In 1835, Henry Pinkus patented a system with a large (9 sq ft) square section tube with a low degree of vacuum, limiting leakage loss.&lt;ref name = hadfield&gt;Charles Hadfield, ''Atmospheric Railways'', Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, Gloucester, 1985 (reprint of 1967), {{ISBN|0-86299-204-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later changed to a small-bore vacuum tube. He proposed to seal the slot that enabled the piston to connect with the vehicle with a continuous rope; rollers on the vehicle lifted the rope in front of the piston connection and returned it afterwards.

He built a demonstration line alongside the [[Kensington Canal]], and issued a prospectus for his ''National Pneumatic Railway Association''. He was unable to interest investors, and his system failed when the rope stretched. However his concept, a small bore pipe with a resealable slot was the prototype for many successor systems.&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;

===Samuda and Clegg===

====Developing a practical scheme====
[[Samuda Brothers|Jacob and Joseph Samuda]] were shipbuilders and engineers, and owned the Southwark Ironworks; they were both members of the Institution of Civil Engineers. [[Samuel Clegg]] was a gas engineer and they worked in collaboration on their atmospheric system. About 1835, they read Medhurst's writings, and developed a small bore vacuum pipe system. Clegg worked on a longitudinal flap valve, for sealing the slot in the pipe.

In 1838, they took out a patent "for a new improvement in valves" and built a full-scale model at Southwark. In 1840, [[Joseph d'Aguilar Samuda|Jacob Samuda]] and Clegg leased half a mile of railway line on the [[West London Railway]] at Wormholt Scrubs (later renamed [[Wormwood Scrubs]]), where the railway had not yet been opened to the public. In that year Clegg left for Portugal, where he was pursuing his career in the gas industry.

Samuda's system involved a continuous (jointed) cast iron pipe laid between the rails of a railway track; the pipe had a slot in the top. The leading vehicle in a train was a ''piston carriage'', which carried a piston inserted in the tube. It was held by a bracket system that passed through the slot, and the actual piston was on a pole ahead of the point at which the bracket left the slot. The slot was sealed from the atmosphere by a continuous leather flap that was opened immediately in advance of the piston bracket and closed again immediately behind it. A pumping station ahead of the train would pump air from the tube, and air pressure behind the piston would push it forward.

The Wormwood Scrubbs demonstration ran for two years. The traction pipe was of 9 inches diameter, and a 16&amp;nbsp;hp stationary engine was used for power. The gradient on the line was a steady 1 in 115. In his treatise, described below, Samuda implies that the pipe would be used in one direction only, and the fact that only one pumping station was erected suggests that trains were gravitated back to the lower end of the run after the atmospheric ascent, as was later done on the Dalkey line (below). Many of the runs were public. Samuda quotes the loads and degree of vacuum and speed of some of the runs; there seems to be little correlation; for example:

* 11 June 1840; 11 tons 10 cwt; maximum speed 22.5&amp;nbsp;mph; 15 inches of vacuum
* 10 August 1840: 5 tons 0 cwt; maximum speed 30&amp;nbsp;mph; 20 inches of vacuum.&lt;ref name = samuda/&gt;

====Competing solutions====
There was enormous public interest in the ideas surrounding atmospheric railways, and at the same time as Samuda was developing his scheme, other ideas were put forward. These included:

* Nickels and Keane; they were to propel trains by pumping air into a continuous canvas tube; the train had a pair of pinch rollers squeezing the outside of the tube, and the air pressure forced the vehicle forward; the effect was the converse of squeezing a toothpaste tube. They claimed a successful demonstration in a timber yard in Waterloo Road.
* James Pilbrow; he proposed a loose piston fitted with a toothed rack; cog wheels would be turned by it, and they were on spindle passing through glands to the outside of the tube; the leading carriage of the train would have a corresponding rack and be impelled forward by the rotation of the cog wheels. Thus the vehicle would keep pace with the piston exactly, without any direct connection to it.
* Henry Lacey conceived a wooden tube, made by barrelmakers as a long, continuous barrel with the opening slot and a timber flap retained by an india-rubber hinge;
* Clarke and Varley proposed sheet iron tubes with a continuous longitudinal slit. If the tubes were made to precision standards, the vacuum would keep the slit closed, but the piston bracket on the train would spring the slit open enough to pass; the elasticity of the tube would close it again behind the piston carriage.
* Joseph Shuttleworth suggested a hydraulic tube; water pressure rather than a partial atmospheric vacuum, would propel the train. In mountainous areas where plentiful water was available, a pumping station would be unnecessary: the water would be used directly. Instead of the flap to seal the slot in the tube, a continuous shaped sealing rope, made of cloth impregnated with india-rubber would be within the pipe. Guides on the piston would lift it into position and the water pressure would hold it in place behind the train. Use of a positive pressure enabled a greater pressure differential than a vacuum system. However the water in the pipe would have to be drained manually by staff along the pipe after every train.

===Samuda's treatise===
[[File:Samuda Armospheric pipe.png|thumb|right|Illustration from ''A Treatise on the Adaptation of Atmospheric Pressure to the Purposes of Locomotion on Railways'', Samuda]]

In 1841, Joseph Samuda published ''A Treatise on the Adaptation of Atmospheric Pressure to the Purposes of Locomotion on Railways''.&lt;ref name = samuda&gt;J d'A Samuda, ''A Treatise on the Adaptation of Atmospheric Pressure to the Purposes of Locomotion on Railways'', John Weale, London, 1841&lt;/ref&gt;

It ran to 50 pages, and Samuda described his system; first the traction pipe:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The moving power is communicated to the train through a continuous pipe or main, laid between the rails, which is exhausted by air pumps worked by stationary steam engines, fixed on the road side, the distance between them varying from one to three miles, according to the nature and traffic of the road. A piston, which is introduced into this pipe, is attached to the leading carriage in each train, through a lateral opening, and is made to travel forward by means of the exhaustion created in front of it. The continuous pipe is fixed between the rails and bolted to the sleepers which carry them; the inside of the tube is unbored, but lined or coated with tallow 1/10th of an inch thick, to equalize the surface and prevent any unnecessary friction from the passage of the travelling piston through it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The operation of the closure valve was to be critical:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Along the upper surface of the pipe is a continuous slit or groove about two inches wide. This groove is covered by a valve, extending the whole length of the railway, formed of a strip of leather riveted between iron plates, the top plates being wider than the groove and serving to prevent the external air forcing the leather into the pipe when the vacuum is formed within it; and the lower plates fitting into the groove when the valve is shut, makes up the circle of the pipe, and prevents the air from passing the piston; one edge of this valve is securely held down by iron bars, fastened by screw bolts to a longitudinal rib cast on the pipe, and allows the leather between the plates and the bar to act as a hinge, similar to a common pump valve; the other edge of the valve falls into a groove which contains a composition of [[beeswax]] and [[tallow]]: this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it. Over this valve is a protecting cover, which serves to preserve it from snow or rain, formed of thin plates of iron about five feet long hinged with leather, and the end of each plate underlaps the next in the direction of the piston's motion,&lt;ref group = note&gt;Yet as single line operation was envisaged, this seems to be impossible.&lt;/ref&gt; thus ensuring the lifting of each in succession.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The piston carriage would open and then close the valve:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To the underside of the first carriage in each train is attached the piston and its appurtenances; a rod passing horizontally from the piston is attached to a connecting arm, about six feet behind the piston. This connecting arm passes through the continuous groove in the pipe, and being fixed to the carriage, imparts motion to the train as the tube becomes exhausted; to the piston rod are also attached four steel wheels, (two in advance and two behind the connecting arm,) which serve to lift the valve, and form a space for the passage of the connecting arm, and also for the admission of air to the back of the piston; another steel wheel is attached to the carriage, regulated by a spring, which serves to ensure the perfect closing of the valve, by running over the top plates immediately after the arm has passed. A copper tube or heater, about ten feet long, constantly kept hot by a small stove, also fixed to the underside of the carriage, passes over and melts the surface of the composition (which has been broken by lifting the valve,) which upon cooling becomes solid, and hermetically seals the valve. Thus each train in passing leaves the pipe in a fit state to receive the next train.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Entering and leaving the pipe was described:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuous pipe is divided into suitable sections (according to the respective distance of the fixed steam engines) by separating valves, which are opened by the train as it goes along: these valves are so constructed that no stoppage or diminution of speed is necessary in passing from one section to another. The exit separating valve, or that at the end of the section nearest to its steam engine, is opened by the compression of air in front of the piston, which necessarily takes place after it has passed the branch which communicates with the air-pump; the entrance separating valve, (that near the commencement of the next section of pipe,) is an equilibrium or balance valve, and opens immediately the piston has entered the pipe. The main pipe is put together with deep socket joints, in each of which an annular space is left about the middle of the packing, and filled with a semi-fluid: thus any possible leakage of air into the pipe is prevented.&lt;ref name = samudanotes&gt;Samdua's treatise; references to parts on diagrams omitted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At that time railway were developing rapidly, and solutions to the technical limitations of the day were eagerly sought, and not always rationally evaluated. Samuda's treatise put forward the advantages of his system:

* transmission of power to trains from static (atmospheric) power stations; the static machinery could be more fuel efficient;
* the train would be relieved of the necessity of carrying the power source, and fuel, with it;
* power available to the train would be greater so that steeper gradients could be negotiated; in building new lines this would hugely reduce construction costs by enabling reducing earthworks and tunnels;
* elimination of a heavy locomotive from the train would enable lighter and cheaper track materials to be used;
* passengers, and lineside residents, would be spared the nuisance of smoke emission from passing trains; this would be especially useful in tunnels;
* collisions between trains would be impossible, because only one train at a time could be handled on any section between two pumping stations; collisions were at the forefront of the mind of the general public in those days before modern signalling systems, when a train was permitted to follow a preceding train after a defined time interval, with no means of detecting whether that train had stalled somewhere ahead on the line;
* the piston travelling in the tube would hold the piston carriage down and, Samuda claimed, prevent derailments, enabling curves to be negotiated safely at high speed;
* persons on the railway would not be subjected to the risk of steam engine boiler explosions (then a very real possibility&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;).

Samuda also rebutted criticisms of his system that had obviously become widespread:

* that if a pumping station failed the whole line would be closed because no train could pass that point; Samuda explained that a pipe arrangement would enable the next pumping station ahead to supply that section; if this was at reduced pressure, the train would nonetheless be able to pass, albeit with a small loss of time;
* that leakage of air at the flap or the pipe joints would critically weaken the vacuum effect; Samuda pointed to experience and test results on his demonstration line, where this was evidently not a problem;
* the capital cost of the engine houses was a huge burden; Samuda observed that the capital cost of steam locomotives was eliminated, and running costs for fuel and maintenance could be expected to be lower.&lt;ref name = samuda/&gt;

====A patent====
In April 1844, Jacob and Joseph Samuda took out a patent for their system. Soon after this, Joseph Samuda died and it was left to his brother Jacob to continue the work. The patent was in three parts: the first describing the atmospheric pipe and piston system, the second describing how in areas of plentiful water supply, the vacuum might be created by using tanks of water at differing levels; and the third section dealt with level crossings of an atmospheric railway.&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;

===Dalkey Atmospheric Railway===
{{main|Dalkey Atmospheric Railway}}
The [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway]] opened in 1834 connecting the port of [[Dún Laoghaire]] (then called Kingstown) to Dublin; it was a standard gauge line. In 1840, it was desired to extend the line to Dalkey, a distance of about two miles. A horse tramway on the route was acquired and converted: it had been used to bring stone from a quarry for the construction of the harbour. It was steeply graded (at 1 in 115 with a 440-yard stretch of 1 in 57) and heavily curved, the sharpest being 570 yards radius. This presented significant difficulties to the locomotives then in use. The treasurer of the company, James Pim, was visiting London and hearing of Samuda's project he viewed it. He considered it to be perfect for the requirements of his company, and after petitioning government for a loan of £26,000,&lt;ref name=mallet2&gt;"Report on the railroad constructed from Kingstown to Dalkey, in Ireliand, upon the atmospheric system, and on the application of this system to railroads in general (Abridged Translation)", Mons. Mallet, The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, in 4 parts commencing May 1844, p279&lt;/ref&gt; it was agreed to install it on the Dalkey line. Thus became the [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]].

A 15-inch traction pipe was used, with a single pumping station at Dalkey, at the upper end of the 2,400-yard run. The engine created 110 ihp and had a flywheel of 36 feet diameter. Five minutes before the scheduled departure of a train from Kingstown, the pumping engine started work, creating a 15-inch vacuum in two minutes. The train was pushed manually to the position where the piston entered the pipe, and the train was held on the brakes until it was ready to start. When that time came, the brakes were released and the train moved off. (The electric telegraph was later installed, obviating reliance on the timetable for engine operation.)

On 17 August 1843, the tube was exhausted for the first time, and the following day a trial run was made. On Saturday 19 August, the line was opened to the public.&lt;ref group = note&gt;Kingstown station was not ready and the runs started from Glasthule Bridge.&lt;/ref&gt;  In service, a typical speed of 30&amp;nbsp;mph was attained; return to Kingstown was by gravitation down the gradient, and slower. By March 1844, 35 train movements operated daily, and 4,500 passengers a week travelled on the line, mostly simply for the novelty.

It is recorded that a young man called Frank Elrington was on one occasion on the piston carriage, which was not attached to the train. On releasing the brake, the light vehicle shot off at high speed, covering the distance in 75 seconds, averaging 65&amp;nbsp;mph.

As this was the first commercially operating atmospheric railway, it attracted the attention of many eminent engineers of the day, including [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], [[Robert Stephenson]], and Sir [[William Cubitt]].&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051230165140/http://www.industrialheritageireland.info/railways/dalkey/dalkey1.htm Industrial Heritage of Ireland website (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The line continued to operate successfully for ten years, outliving the atmospheric system on British lines, although the Paris - St Germain line continued until 1860.&lt;ref name = vignoles&gt;K H Vignoles, ''Charles Blacker Vignoles: Romantic Engineer'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-13539-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the system was abolished in 1855, a 2-2-2 steam locomotive called Princess was employed, incidentally the first steam engine to be manufactured in Ireland. Although a puny mechanism, the steam engine successfully worked the steeply graded line for some years.&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;

===Paris - Saint Germain===
[[File:Wagon-directeur-chemin-atmospherique.jpg|thumb|Saint Germain piston carriage]]In 1835, the brothers Pereire obtained a concession from the ''Compagnie du Chemin de fer de Paris à Saint-Germain''. They opened their 19&amp;nbsp;km line in 1837, but only as far as [[Le Pecq]], a river quay on the left bank of the Seine, as a daunting incline would have been necessary to reach [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], and locomotives of the day were considered incapable of climbing the necessary gradient, adhesion being considered the limiting factor.

On hearing of the success of the Dalkey railway, the French minister of public works (M. Teste) and under-secretary of state (M. Le Grande) dispatched M. Mallet,&lt;ref group = note&gt;Possibly C.-F. Mallet&lt;/ref&gt; inspecteur général honoraire des Ponts et Chaussées, to Dalkey. He wrote an exhaustive technical evaluation of the system installed there, and its potential, which included the results of measurements made with Joseph Samuda.&lt;ref name = hadfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=mallet2/&gt;&lt;ref name = mallet&gt;Mallet, ''Rapport sur le chemin de fer établi suivant le système atmosphérique de Kingstown à Dalkey, en Irlande, et sur l'application de ce système aux chemins de fer en général'',  Carillan-Goeury et Ve Dalmont, Paris, 1844, [https://archive.org/stream/rapportsurleche00mallgoog#page/n8/mode/2up accessible on line]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was through his interest that the Pereire brothers to adopt the system for an extension to St Germain itself, and construction started in 1845, with a wooden bridge crossing the Seine followed by a twenty-arch masonry viaduct and two tunnels under the castle. The extension was opened on 15 April 1847; it was 1.5&amp;nbsp;km in length on a gradient of 1 in 28 (35&amp;nbsp;mm/m).

The traction pipe was laid between the rails; it had a diameter of 63&amp;nbsp;cm (25 inches) with a slot at the top. The slot was closed by two leather flaps. The pumps are powered by two steam engines with a capacity of 200&amp;nbsp;hp, located between the two tunnels at Saint-Germain. Train speed on the ascent was 35&amp;nbsp;km/h (22&amp;nbsp;mph). On the descent the train ran by gravity as far as Pecq, where the steam locomotive took over for the run to Paris.

The system was technically successful, but the development of more powerful steam locomotives led to its abandonment from 3 July 1860, when steam locomotive ran throughout from Paris to St Germain, being assisted by a pusher locomotive up the gradient. This arrangement continued for more than sixty years until the electrification of the line.&lt;ref name = robert&gt;Jean Robert, ''Notre métro'', Omens &amp; Cie, Paris, 1967, ASIN: B0014IR65O, page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

A correspondent of the ''Ohio State Journal'' described some details; there seem to have been two tube sections:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An iron tube is laid down in the centre of the track, which is sunk about one-third of its diameter in the bed of the road. For a distance of 5,500 yards the tube has a diameter of only 1¾ feet [i.e. 21 inches], the ascent here being so slight as not to require the same amount of force as is required on the steep grade to St Germain, where the pipe, for a distance of 3,800 yards, is 2 feet 1 inch [i.e. 25 inches] in diameter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The steam engines had accumulators:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To each engine is adapted two large cylinders, which exhaust fourteen cubic feet of air per second. The pressure in the air cauldron (claudieres) attached to the exhausting machines is equal to six absolute atmospheres.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He described the valve:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout the entire length of the tube, a section is made in the top, leaving an open space of about five inches. In each cut edge of the section there is an offset, to catch the edges of a valve which fits down upon it. The valve is made of a piece of sole leather half an inch thick, having plates of iron attached to it on both the upper and corresponding under side to give it strength&amp;nbsp;... which are perhaps one-fourth of an inch in thickness&amp;nbsp;... The plates are about nine inches long, and their ends, above and below, are placed three quarters of an inch apart, forming joints, so as to give the leather valve pliability, and at the same time firmness.&lt;ref name = nyt1852&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1852/11/10/87844667.pdf Article in the New York Times, 10 November 1852]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clayton records the name of the engineer, Mallet, who had been Inspector general of Public Works, and gives a slightly different account: Clayton says that Mallet used a plaited rope to seal the slot. He also says that vacuum was created by condensing steam in a vacuum chamber between runs, but that may have been a misunderstanding of the pressure accumulators.&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;

===London and Croydon Railway===

====A steam railway at first====
[[File:JollySailor.jpg|thumb|right|Jolly-sailor station on the London and Croydon Railway in 1845, showing the pumping station, and the locomotive-less train]]The [[London and Croydon Railway]] (L&amp;CR) obtained its authorising Act of Parliament in 1835, to build its line from a junction with the [[London and Greenwich Railway]] (L&amp;GR) to Croydon. At that time the L&amp;GR line was under construction, and Parliament resisted the building of two railway termini in the same quarter of London, so that the L&amp;CR would have to share the L&amp;GR's London Bridge station. The line was built for ordinary locomotive operation. A third company, the [[London and Brighton Railway]] (L&amp;BR) was promoted and it too had to share the route into London by running over the L&amp;CR.

When the lines opened in 1839, it was found that congestion arose due to the frequent stopping services on the local Croydon line; this was particularly a problem on the 1 in 100 ascent from New Cross to Dartmouth Arms.&lt;ref name = hadfield/&gt; The L&amp;CR engineer, William Cubitt proposed a solution to the problem: a third track would be laid on the east side of the existing double track main line, and all the local trains in both directions would use it. The faster Brighton trains would be freed of the delay following a stopping train. Cubitt had been impressed during his visit to the Dalkey line, and the new L&amp;CR third track would use atmospheric power. The local line would also be extended to Epsom, also as a single track atmospheric line. These arrangements were adopted and Parliamentary powers obtained on 4 July 1843, also authorising a line to a terminal at Bricklayers Arms. Arrangements were also made with the L&amp;GR for them to add an extra track on the common section of their route. On 1 May 1844, the Bricklayers Arms terminus opened, and a frequent service was run from it, additional to the London Bridge trains.&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;&lt;ref name = hadfield/&gt;&lt;ref name = turner&gt;Charles Howard Turner, ''The London Brighton and South Coast Railway'', volume 1, Batsford Books, London, 1977, {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0275-9}}, pages 239–256&lt;/ref&gt;

====Now atmospheric as well====
The L&amp;CR line diverged to the south-west at Norwood Junction (then called ''Jolly Sailor'', after an inn), and needed to cross the L&amp;BR line. The atmospheric pipe made this impossible on the flat, and a [[overpass|flyover]] was constructed to enable the crossing: this was the first example in the railway world.&lt;ref name = clayton39&gt;Clayton, page 39&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the form of a wooden viaduct with approach gradients of 1 in 50. A similar flyover was to be built at Corbetts Lane Junction, where the L&amp;CR additional line was to be on the north-east side of the existing line, but this was never made.

A 15-inch diameter traction pipe was installed between Forest Hill (then called ''Dartmouth Arms'', also after a local inn) and West Croydon. Although Samuda supervised the installation of the atmospheric apparatus, a weather flap, a hinged iron plate that covered the leather slot valve in the Dalkey installation, was omitted. The L&amp;CR had an Atmospheric Engineer, James Pearson. Maudsley, Son and Field supplied the three 100&amp;nbsp;hp steam engines and pumps at Dartmouth Arms, Jolly Sailor and Croydon (later West Croydon), and elaborate engine houses had been erected for them. They were designed in a gothic style by W H Brakespear, and had tall chimneys which also exhausted the evacuated air at high level.&lt;ref group = note&gt;This may mean that the exhaust air was used to create a draught for the fires.&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-needle electric telegraph system was installed on the line, enabling station staff to indicate to the remote engine house that a train was ready to start.

This section, from Dartmouth Arms to Croydon started operation on the atmospheric system in January 1846.

The traction pipe slot and the piston bracket were handed; that is the slot closure flap was continuously hinged on one side, and the piston support bracket was cranked to minimise the necessary opening of the flap. This meant that the piston carriage could not simply be turned on a turntable at the end of a trip. Instead it was double ended, but the piston was manually transferred to the new leading end. The piston carriage itself had to be moved manually (or by horse power) to the leading end of the train. At Dartmouth Arms the station platform was an island between the two steam operated lines. Cubitt designed a special system of pointwork that enabled the atmospheric piston carriage to enter the ordinary track.&lt;ref group = note&gt;It is not known exactly what form these points took, but some early engineers used switches in which the lead rails move together to form a butt joint with the approach rails, and it is likely Cubitt used this. The traction pipe can hardly have crossed the ordinary track and trains may have been moved by horses.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Trade inspector, General Pasley, visited the line on 1 November 1845 to approve it for opening of the whole line. The Times newspaper reported the event; a special train left London Bridge hauled by a steam locomotive; at Forest Hill the locomotive was detached and:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the piston carriage substituted and the train thence became actuated by atmospheric pressure. The train consisted of ten carriages (including that to which the piston is attached) and its weight was upward of fifty tons. At seven and a half minutes past two the train left the point of rest at the Dartmouth Arms, and at eight and three-quarter minutes past, the piston entered the valve,&lt;ref group = note&gt;75 seconds in moving the train by human or horse power to the pipe.&lt;/ref&gt; when it immediately occurred to us that one striking advantage of the system was the gentle, the almost imperceptible, motion on starting. On quitting the station on locomotive lines we have frequently experienced a "jerk" amounting at times to an absolute "shock" and sufficient to alarm the nervous and timid passenger. Nothing of the sort, however, was experienced here. Within a minute and a quarter of the piston entering the pipe, the speed attained against a strong headwind was at the rate of twelve miles an hour; in the next minute, viz. at eleven minutes past two, twenty-five miles an hour; at thirteen minutes past two, thirty-four miles an hour; fourteen minutes past two, forty miles an hour; and fifteen minutes past two, fifty-two miles an hour, which was maintained until sixteen minutes past two, when the speed began to diminish, and at seventeen and a half minutes past two, the train reached the Croydon terminus, thus performing the journey from Dartmouth Arms, five miles, in eight minutes and three-quarters. The barometer in the piston carriage indicated a vacuum of 25 inches and that in the engine house a vacuum of 28 inches.&lt;ref group = note&gt;These values are much higher than Samuda arranged during the Wormwood Scrubbs demonstrations; standard [[atmospheric pressure]] is taken as 29.92 [[Inch of mercury|in Hg]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = pasleyinsp&gt;The Times newspaper, contemporary report, quoted in Clayton. Note: the Times digital archive does not appear to carry this article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The successful official public run was widely reported and immediately new schemes for long-distance railways on the atmospheric system were being promoted; the [[South Devon Railway Company|South Devon Railway's]] shares appreciated overnight.

====Opening====
Pasley's report of 8 November was favourable, and the line was clear to open. The directors hesitated, desiring to gain a little more experience beforehand. On 19 December 1845 the crankshaft of the Forest Hill stationary engine fractured, and the engine was unusable. However the part was quickly replaced and on 16 January 1846, the line opened.

At 11:00 that morning the crankshaft of one of the Croydon engines broke. Two engines had been provided, so traffic was able to continue using the other,&lt;ref group = note&gt;The Maudsley engines consisted of two engines driving the same shaft; either could be disconnected if required.&lt;/ref&gt; until at 7:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. that engine suffered the same fate. Again repairs were made until 10 February 1846, when both of the Croydon engines failed.

This was a bitter blow for the adherents of the atmospheric system; shortcomings in the manufacture of the stationary engines procured from a reputable engine-maker said nothing about the practicality of the atmospheric system itself, but as Samuda said to the Board:

"The public cannot discriminate (because it cannot know) the cause of the interruptions, and every irregularity is attributed to the atmospheric system."&lt;ref name = samudabreakdowns&gt;Samuda, letter to L&amp;CR Board, quoted in Clayton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, the beam of one of the Forest Hill engines fractured. At this time the directors were making plans for the Epsom extension; they quickly revised their intended purchase of engines from Maudsley, and invited tenders; [[Boulton and Watt]] of Birmingham were awarded the contract, their price having been considerably less than their competitors'.

====Amalgamation====
The London and Brighton Railway amalgamated with the L&amp;CR on 6 July 1846, forming the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&amp;SCR). For the time being the directors of the larger company continued with the L&amp;CR's intentions to use the atmospheric system.

====Technical difficulties====
The summer of 1846 was exceptionally hot and dry, and serious difficulties with the traction pipe flap valve started to show themselves. It was essential to make a good seal when the leather flap was closed, and the weather conditions made the leather stiff. As for the tallow and beeswax compound that was supposed to seal the joint after every train, Samuda had originally said "this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it"&lt;ref name = samuda/&gt; and the hot weather had that effect. Samuda's original description of his system had included a metal weather valve that closed over the flap, but this had been omitted on the L&amp;CR, exposing the valve to the weather, and also encouraging the ingestion of debris, including, an observer reported, a handkerchief dropped by a lady on to the track. Any debris lodging in the seating of the flap could only have reduced its effectiveness.

Moreover the [[tallow]] – that is, rendered animal fat – was attractive to the rat population; their bodies drawn in to the traction pipe at the beginning of pumping in the morning told its story. Delays became frequent, due to inability to create enough vacuum to move the trains, and stoppages on the steep approach inclines at the flyover were commonplace, and widely reported in the press.

The Directors now began to feel uneasy about the atmospheric system, and in particular the Epsom extension, which was to have three engines. In December 1846, they asked Boulton and Watt about cancelling the project, and were told that suspending the supply contract for a year would cost £2,300. The Directors agreed to this.

The winter of 1846/7 brought new meteorological difficulties: unusually cold weather made the leather flap stiff, and snow got into the tube&lt;ref group = note&gt;Snow inside the tube itself might not have been serious; it is likely that compacted snow in the valve seating was the real problem.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in more cancellations of the atmospheric service. A track worker was killed in February 1847 while steam substitution was in operation. This was tragically unfortunate, but it had the effect of widespread reporting that the atmospheric was, yet again, non-operational.&lt;ref name = timesdeath&gt;The Times newspaper, quoted in Clayton&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sudden end====
Through this long period, the Directors must have become less and less committed to pressing on with the atmospheric system, even as money was being spent on extending it towards London Bridge. (It opened from Dartmouth Arms to New Cross in January 1847, using gravitation northbound and the Dartmouth Arms pumping station southbound.) In a situation in which public confidence was important, the Directors could not express their doubts publicly, at least until a final decision had been taken. On 4 May 1847,&lt;ref name = chronicle&gt;Railway Chronicle (periodical) 10 May 1847 quoted in Clayton, stated that this was announced "last Tuesday"&lt;/ref&gt; the directors announced "that the Croydon Atmospheric pipes were pulled up and the plan abandoned".

The reason seems not to have been made public at once, but the trigger seems to have been the insistence of the Board of trade inspector on a second junction at the divergence of the Brighton and Epsom lines. It is not clear what this refers to, and may simply have been a rationalisation of the timing of a painful decision. Whatever the reason, there was to be no more atmospheric work on the LB&amp;SCR.&lt;ref name = clayton/&gt;

===South Devon Railway {{Anchor|South Devon Railway}}===

====Getting authorisation====
[[File:Brunel's Atmospheric Railway.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the SDR's atmospheric railway pipe at [[Didcot Railway Centre]]]]
The [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) and the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] working collaboratively had reached Exeter on 1 May 1844, with a [[broad gauge]] railway connecting the city to London. Interested parties in Devonshire considered it important to extend the connection to Plymouth, but the terrain posed considerable difficulties: there was high ground with no easy route through.

After considerable controversy, the [[South Devon Railway Company]] (SDR) obtained its Act of Parliament authorising a line, on 4 July 1844.

====Determining the route====
The Company's engineer was the innovative engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. He had visited the Dalkey line and he had been impressed with the capabilities of the atmospheric system on that line. Samuda had always put forward the advantages of his system, which (he claimed) included much better hill climbing abilities and lighter weight on the track. This would enable a line in hilly terrain to be planned with steeper than usual gradients, saving substantial cost of construction.

If Brunel had decided definitely to use the atmospheric system at the planning stage, it would have allowed him to strike a route that would have been impossible with the locomotive technology of the day. The route of the South Devon Railway, still in use today, has steep gradients and is generally considered "difficult". Commentators often blame this on it being designed for atmospheric traction; for example:

Sekon, describing the topography of the line, says that beyond Newton Abbot,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the conformation of the country is very unsuitable for the purpose of constructing a railway with good gradients. This drawback did not at the time trouble Mr. Brunel, the engineer to the South Devon Railway Company, since he proposed to work the line on the atmospheric principle, and one of the advantages claimed for the system being that steep banks were as easy to work as a level.&lt;ref name = sekon2013&gt;G A Sekon (pseudonym), ''A History of the Great Western Railway'', Digby Long &amp; Co., London, 1895, reprinted by Forgotten Books, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The line "was left with a legacy of a line built for atmospheric working with the consequent heavy gradients and sharp curves".&lt;ref name = clayton75&gt;Clayton, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brunel "seriously doubted the ability of any engine to tackle the kind of gradients which would be necessary on the South Devon".&lt;ref name = clayton76&gt;Clayton, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact the decision to ''consider'' the adoption of the atmospheric system came ''after'' Parliamentary authorisation, and the route must have been finalised before submission to Parliament.

Eight weeks after passage of the Act, the shareholders heard that "Since the passing of the Act, a proposal has been received&amp;nbsp;... from Messrs. Samuda Brothers&amp;nbsp;... to apply their system of traction to the South Devon Line." Brunel and a deputation of the directors had been asked to visit the Dalkey line. The report went on that as a result,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In view of the fact that at many points of the line both the gradients and curves will render the application of this principle particularly advantageous, your directors have resolved that the atmospheric system, including an electric telegraph, should be adopted on the whole line of the South Devon Railway.&lt;ref name = sdrreport&gt;Report to Shareholders' meeting 28 August 1844, quoted in Clayton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Construction and opening====
[[File:Torquay engine house.jpg|thumb|right|[[Torre railway station#Torquay engine house|Pumping House at Torquay]], Devon]]Construction started at once on the section from Exeter to Newton Abbot (at first called ''Newton''); this first part is broadly level: it was the section onwards from Newton that was hilly. Contracts for the supply of the {{convert|45|hp}} pumping engines and machinery were concluded on 18 January 1845, to be delivered by 1 July in the same year. Manufacture of the traction pipes ran into difficulties: they were to be cast with the slot formed,&lt;ref group = note&gt;In the Dalkey case the pipes were cast as complete cylinders, and the slot was then machined in.&lt;/ref&gt; and distortion was a serious problem at first.

Delivery of the machinery and laying of the pipes was much delayed, but on 11 August 1846, with that work still in progress, a contract was let for the engines required over the hilly section beyond Newton. These were to be more powerful, at {{convert|64|hp}}, and {{convert|82|hp}} in one case, and the traction pipe was to be of a larger diameter.

The train service started between Exeter and Teignmouth on 30 May 1846, but this was operated by steam engines, hired in from the GWR. At length, on 13 September 1847&lt;ref group = note&gt;Clayton says 14 September&lt;/ref&gt; the first passenger trains started operating on the atmospheric system.&lt;ref name = gregory&gt;R H Gregory, ''The South Devon Railway'', Oakwood Press, Salisbury, 1982, {{ISBN|0-85361-286-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kay&gt;Peter Kay, ''Exeter – Newton Abbot: A Railway History'',Platform 5 Publishing, Sheffield, 1991, {{ISBN|978-1-872524-42-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atmospheric goods trains may have operated a few days previously.

Four atmospheric trains ran daily in addition to the advertised steam service, but after a time they replaced the steam trains. At first the atmospheric system was used as far as Teignmouth only, from where a steam engine hauled the train including the piston carriage to Newton, where the piston carriage was removed, and the train continued on its journey. From 9 November some atmospheric working to Newton took place, and from 2 March 1848, all trains on the section were atmospheric.

Through that winter of 1847-8 a regular service was maintained to Teignmouth. The highest speed recorded was an average of {{convert|64|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} over {{convert|4|miles}} hauling {{convert|28|long ton}}, and {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} when hauling {{convert|100|long ton}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Two significant limitations of the atmospheric system were overcome at this period. The first was an auxiliary traction pipe was provided at stations; it was laid outside the track, therefore not obstructing pointwork. The piston carriage connected to it by a rope—the pipe must have had its own piston—and the train could be hauled into a station and on to the start of the onward main pipe. The second development was a level crossing arrangement for the pipe: a hinged cover plate lay across the pipe for road usage, but when the traction pipe was exhausted, a branch pipe actuated a small piston which raised the cover, enabling the piston carriage to pass safely, and acting as a warning to road users. Contemporary technical drawings show the traction pipe considerably lower than normal, with its top about level with the rail heads, and with its centre at the level of the centre of the transoms. No indication is shown as to how track gauge was maintained.

====Underpowered traction system====
[[File:Starcross Pump House.jpg|thumb|right|Starcross pumping house.]]Although the trains were running ostensibly satisfactorily, there had been technical miscalculations. It seems&lt;ref name = clayton91&gt;Clayton, page 91&lt;/ref&gt; that Brunel originally specified {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} for the level section to Newton and {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} pipes for the hilly part of the route, and in specifying the stationary engine power and vacuum pumps, he considerably underpowered them. The {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} pipes seem to have been scrapped, and {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} pipes installed in their place, and {{convert|22|in|adj=on}} pipes started to be installed on the hilly sections. Changes to the engine control governors were made to uprate them to run 50% faster than designed. It was reported that coal consumption was much heavier than forecast, at 3s 1½d per train mile instead of 1s 0d (and instead of 2s 6d which was the hire charge for the leased GWR steam locomotives). This may have been partly due to the electric telegraph not yet having been installed, necessitating pumping according to the timetable, even though a train might be running late. When the telegraph was ready, on 2 August, coal consumption in the following weeks fell by 25%.&lt;ref name = clayton92&gt;Clayton, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems with the slot closure====
During the winter of 1847–1848, the leather flap valve that sealed the traction pipe slot began to give trouble. During the cold days of winter, the leather froze hard in frost after saturation in rain. This resulted in its failing to seat properly after the passage of a train, allowing air into the pipe and reducing the effectiveness of pumping. In the following spring and summer, there was hot and dry weather and the leather valve dried out, with pretty much the same outcome. Brunel had the leather treated with whale oil in an attempt to maintain flexibility. There was said to be a chemical reaction between the [[tannin]] in the leather and iron oxide on the pipe. There were also difficulties with the leather cup seal on the pistons.

Commentators observe that the South Devon system omitted the iron weather flap that was used on the Dalkey line to cover the flap valve. On that line iron plates were turned away immediately ahead of the piston bracket. It is not recorded why this was omitted in South Devon, but at speed that arrangement must have involved considerable mechanical force, and generated environmental noise.

In May and June, even more serious trouble was experienced when sections of the flap tore away from its fixing, and sections had to be quickly replaced. Samuda had a contract with the company to maintain the system, and he advised installation of a weather cover, but this was not adopted. This would not have rectified the immediate problem, and complete replacement of the leather flap was required; this was estimated to cost £32,000—a very large sum of money then—and Samuda declined to act.

====Abandonment====
With a contractual impasse during struggles to keep a flawed system in operation, it was inevitable that the end was near. At a shareholders' meeting on 29 August 1848, the directors were obliged to report all the difficulties, and that Brunel had advised abandonment of the atmospheric system; arrangements were being made with the Great Western Railway to provide steam locomotives, and the atmospheric system would be abandoned from 9 September 1848.

Brunel's report to the Directors, now shown the meeting, was comprehensive, and he was also mindful of his own delicate position, and of the contractual obligations of Samuda. He described the stationary engines, obtained from three suppliers: "These engines have not, on the whole, proved successful; none of them have as yet worked very economically, and some are very extravagant in the use of fuel." As to the difficulties with the leather valve in extremes of weather, heat, frost and heavy rain,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The same remedies apply to all three, keeping the leather of the valve oiled and varnished, and rendering it impervious to the water, which otherwise soaks through it in wet weather, or which freezes it in cold, rendering it too stiff to shut down; and the same precaution prevents the leather being dried up and shrivelled by the heat; for this, and not the melting of the composition, is the principal inconvenience resulting from heat. A little water spread on the valve from a tank in the piston carriage has also been found to be useful in very dry weather, showing that the dryness, and not the heat, was the cause of the leakage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But there was a much more serious problem: "A considerable extent of longitudinal valve failed by the tearing of the leather at the joints between the plates. The leather first partially cracked at these points, which caused a considerable leakage, particularly in dry weather. After a time it tears completely through."

Maintenance of the traction pipe and the valve was Samuda's contractual responsibility, but Brunel indicated that he was blaming the company for careless storage, and for the fact that the valve had been installed for some time before being used by trains; Brunel declined to go into the liability question, alluding to possible palliative measures, but concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cost of construction has far exceeded our expectations, and the difficulty of working a system so totally different from that to which everybody—traveller as well as workmen—is accustomed, have (sic) proved too great; and therefore, although, no doubt, after some further trial, great reductions may be made in the cost of working the portion now laid, I cannot anticipate the possibility of any inducement to continue the system beyond Newton.&lt;ref name = brunelreport&gt;Brunel's report to the Directors, reproduced in Clayton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huge hostility was generated among some shareholders, and Samuda, and Brunel in particular were heavily criticised, but the atmospheric system on the line was finished.

====Retention recommended====
Thomas Gill had been Chairman of the South Devon board and wished to continue with the atmospheric system. In order to press for this he resigned his position, and in November 1848, he published a pamphlet urging retention of the system. He created enough support for this that an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company was held on 6 January 1849. Lengthy technical discussion took place, in which Gill stated that Clark and Varley were prepared to contract to complete the atmospheric system and maintain it over a section of the line. There were, Gill said, twenty-five other inventors anxious to have their creations tried out on the line. The meeting lasted for eight hours, but finally a vote was taken: a majority of shareholders present were in favour of continuing with the system, 645 to 567 shares. However a large block of proxies were held by shareholders who did not wish to attend the meeting, and with their votes abandonment was confirmed by 5,324 to 1,230.

That was the end of the atmospheric system on the South Devon Railway.

====Rats====
It is often asserted among enthusiasts' groups that the primary cause of the failure of the leather flap was rats, attracted to the tallow, gnawing at it. Although rats are said to have been drawn into the traction pipe in the early days, there was no reference to this at the crisis meeting described above.

===Technical details===

====Wormwood Scrubs demonstration line====
The piston carriage on the demonstration line was an open four-wheeled track. No controls of any kind are shown on a drawing. The beam that carried the piston was called the "perch", and it was attached directly to the axles, and pivoted at its centre point; it had a counterweight to the rear of the attachment bracket (called a "coulter").

====Dalkey line====
The customary train consist was two coaches, the piston carriage, which included a guard's compartment and third class accommodation, and a first class carriage, with end observation windows at the rear. The guard had a screw brake, but no other control. Returning (descending) was done under gravity, and the guard had a lever which enabled him to swing the piston assembly to one side, so that the descent was made with the piston outside the tube.

====Saint Germain line====
The section put into service, Le Pecq to Saint Germain, was almost exactly the same length as the Dalkey line, and was operated in a similar way except that the descent by gravity was made with the piston in the tube so that air pressure helped retard speed. The upper terminal had sidings, with switching managed by ropes.&lt;ref name="SMITH"&gt;Paul Smith, ''Les chemins de fer atmospheriques'', In Situ, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====London and Croydon====
The piston carriages were six-wheeled vans, with a driver's platform at each end, as they were double ended. The driver's position was within the carriage, not in the open. The centre axle was unsprung, and the piston assembly was directly connected to it. The driver had a vacuum gauge (a mercury [[Pressure measurement|manometer]], connected by a metal tube to the head of the piston. Some vehicles were fitted with speedometers, an invention of Moses Ricardo. As well as a brake, the driver had a by-pass valve which admitted air to the partially exhausted traction tube ahead of the piston, reducing the tractive force exerted. This seems to have been used on the 1 in 50 descent from the flyover. The lever and valve arrangement are shown in a diagram in Samuda's ''Treatise''.

====Variable size piston====
Part of Samuda's patent included the variable diameter piston, enabling the same piston carriage to negotiate route sections with different traction tube sizes. Clayton describes it: the change could be controlled by the driver while in motion; a lever operated a device rather like an umbrella at the rear of the piston head; it had hinged steel ribs. To accommodate the bracket for the piston, the traction tube slot, and therefore the top of the tube, had to be at the same level whatever the diameter of the tube, so that all of the additional space to be sealed was downwards and sideways; the "umbrella" arrangement was asymmetrical. In fact this was never used on the South Devon Railway as the 22 inch tubes there were never opened; and the change at Forest Hill only lasted four months before the end of the atmospheric system there.&lt;ref name = clayton113&gt;Clayton, page&amp;nbsp;113–199&lt;/ref&gt; A variable diameter piston was also intended to be used on the Saint-Germain railway, where a 15 inch pipe was to be used from Nanterre to Le Pecq, and then a 25 inch pipe on the three and half per cent grade up to Saint-Germain. Only the 25 inch section was completed, so a simple piston was used.&lt;ref name="SMITH"&gt;Paul Smith, ''Les chemins de fer atmospheriques'', In Situ, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Dainton engine house, a vacuum receiver was to be installed in the inlet pipe to the pumps. This was apparently an interceptor for debris that might be ingested into the traction pipe; it had an openable door for staff to clear the debris from time to time.&lt;ref name = clayton110&gt;Clayton, page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early applications===
Two demonstration railways were built with the entire car inside the tube rather than only a piston. In both cases the cars were pushed by atmospheric pressure in one direction and increased pressure in the other, and in both cases the object was to run cars underground without the smoke and gas of steam locomotives.

* [[Thomas Webster Rammell|Rammell]]'s [[Crystal Palace atmospheric railway]] of 1864 was intended to raise interest in his proposed [[Waterloo and Whitehall Railway]] which would have run under the Thames from [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]] to [[Great Scotland Yard]]. Construction on the latter started in 1865 and 1866 but did not continue.

* [[Alfred Ely Beach|Alfred E. Beach]]'s [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]], running for one block under [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City from 1870 to 1873, demonstrated both pneumatic operation and also a method of tunnelling that would not disturb the street surface. Air pressure was controlled by a large impeller, the Roots blower, rather than the disk fans used in all previous installations. Nothing further was ever constructed.

==Aeromovel==
[[File:Aeromóvel de Porto Alegre.JPG|thumb|Aeromovel train in [[Porto Alegre]], seen in 2013]]

The nineteenth century attempts to make a practical atmospheric system (described below) were defeated by technological shortcomings. In the present day, modern materials have enabled a practical system to be implemented.

Towards the end of the twentieth century the Aeromovel Corporation of Brazil developed an automated [[people mover]] that is atmospherically powered. Lightweight trains ride on rails mounted on an elevated hollow concrete box girder that forms the air duct. Each car is attached to a square plate—the piston—within the duct, connected by a mast running through a longitudinal slot that is sealed with rubber flaps. Stationary electric air pumps are located along the line to either blow air into the duct to create positive pressure or to exhaust air from the duct to create a partial vacuum. The pressure differential acting on the piston plate causes the vehicle to move.

Electric power for lighting and braking is supplied to the train by a low voltage (50v) current through the track the vehicles run on; this is used to charge onboard batteries. The trains have conventional brakes for accurate stopping at stations; these brakes are automatically applied if there is no pressure differential acting on the plate. Fully loaded vehicles have a ratio of payload to dead-weight of about 1:1, which is up to three times better than conventional alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeromovel - Technology|url=http://www.aeromovel.com/technology.htm|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicles are driverless with motion determined by lineside controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 5,845,582 Slot sealing system for a pneumatic transportation system guideway|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5845582|publisher=United States Patent 5845582|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeromovel was designed in the late 1970s by Brazilian {{Interlanguage link multi|Oskar H.W.

==Concept==

Flight Rail Corp. in the USA has developed the concept of a high-speed atmospheric train that uses vacuum and air pressure to move passenger modules along an elevated guideway. Stationary power systems create vacuum (ahead of the piston) and pressure (behind the piston) inside a continuous pneumatic tube located centrally below rails within a truss assembly. The free piston is magnetically coupled to the passenger modules above; this arrangement allows the power tube to be closed, avoiding leakage. The transportation unit operates above the power tube on a pair of parallel steel rails.

The company currently has a 1/6 scale pilot model operating on an outdoor test guideway. The guideway is 2095 feet (639 m) long and incorporates 2%, 6% and 10% grades. The pilot model operates at speeds up to 25&amp;nbsp;mph (40&amp;nbsp;km/h). The Corporation claims that a full-scale implementation would be capable of speeds in excess of 200&amp;nbsp;mph (322&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name = flightrail&gt;[http://www.flightrail.com Flight Rail Corp]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Audio-Technica AT-LP120''' is a mid-range [[direct-drive turntable]] introduced in 2009 by the [[Japan|Japanese]] audio equipment manufacturer [[Audio-Technica]]. The AT-LP120 was intended to be a viable replacement for the long-running [[Technics SL-1200]] series of turntables that was set to be discontinued in 2010. It supports both [[RCA_connector#Phono_input|phono]] and [[Line_level#Line_level_in_traditional_signal_paths|line-level]] output&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.audio-technica.com/setting-lp120-usb-turntable-part-2/|title=Setting Up The AT-LP120-USB Turntable|publisher=Audio-Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a built-in [[preamplifier]].

The turntable also has the ability to [[Dubbing_(music)|dub]] records directly to a computer in real-time using a [[USB]] connection.

==Similarities to the SL-1200==
Since it was designed to mimic the Technics SL-1200 series of turntables, the AT-120 shares many design traits with the older Technics models, including:

* Metal construction
* Pop-up target light
* "S"-shaped [[Phonograph#Arm_systems|tonearm]]
* Built-in strobe speed indicator
* Quartz speed lock

The '''ball and beam''' system consists of a long beam which can be tilted by a servo or electric motor together with a ball
rolling back and forth on top of the beam.
It is a popular textbook example in [[control theory]].

The significance of the ball and beam system is that it is a simple system which is open-loop [[BIBO stability|unstable]].
Even if the beam is restricted to be very nearly horizontal, without active [[feedback]], it will swing to one side or the
other, and the ball will roll off the end of the beam.  To stabilize the ball, a [[controller (control theory)|control system]] which
measures the position of the ball and adjusts the beam accordingly must be used.

In two dimensions, the ball and beam system becomes the '''ball and plate''' system, where a ball rolls on top of
a plate whose inclination can be adjusted by tilting it frontwards, backwards, leftwards, or rightwards.

[[File:Beaverslide.jpg|thumb|250px|A beaverslide with a full stack of hay.]]
A '''beaverslide''' is a device for stacking [[hay]] made of wooden poles and planks that builds haystacks of loose, unbaled hay stored outdoors to be used as [[fodder]] for [[livestock]]. The beaverslide consists of a frame supporting an inclined plane up which a load of hay is pushed to a height of about {{convert|30|ft|m|0}}, before dropping through a large gap. The resulting loaf-shaped haystacks can be up to 30 feet high, can weigh up to 20 tons, and can theoretically last up to five or six years. It was invented in the early 1900s and was first called the Beaverhead County Slide Stacker after its place of origin, the [[Big Hole River|Big Hole Valley]] in [[Beaverhead County, Montana|Beaverhead County]], [[Montana]]. The name was quickly shortened to "beaverslide."&lt;!--FYI, the thing also resembles a gigantic version of the literal "beaver slides" that beavers use to quickly access the water, hence probably a double meaning, but can't find a source, so OR until we do--&gt;

== History ==

Early [[American pioneer|settlers]] in the [[American west]] initially stored hay for their livestock under shelter in barns and haylofts. However, unlike the east, where hay is fed as a supplemental form of forage, the northern plains had lengthy and severe winter weather and therefore large quantities of hay were needed to provide adequate forage for animals. Most haylofts were insufficient to store the quantities needed, but in the arid western United States, unlike the more humid east, hay could be stored without the protection of a barn.{{sfn|Sando|p=42}} As a result, settlers used a variety of methods to stack and store large amounts of hay, inventing a number of agricultural machines to lift hay including hay [[derrick]]s and various slides, including a predecessor to the beaverslide called a ram stacker.{{sfn|Sando|p=59}}

About 1908{{efn|name=year invented}} the beaverslide was invented in Montana by two ranchers, Herbert S. Armitage and David J. Stephens,{{efn|name=Stephens' first name}}{{sfn|Oberling}}{{sfn|Munday|loc=ch. 6|p=75}} who ranched near Briston, in the [[Big Hole River|Big Hole Valley]], of [[Beaverhead County, Montana|Beaverhead County]] in southwestern [[Montana]].{{sfn|National Park Service}} Armitage and Stephens filed for a patent on September 7, 1909 and it was awarded on May 31, 1910.{{sfn|US Patent 959906}} The beaverslide may have been called the "Sunny Slope Slide Stacker" at one time, but that name does not appear in the patent.{{sfn|US Patent 959906}}{{sfn|Oberling}} Armitage and Stephens themselves referred to it as the "Beaverhead County Slide Stacker", which quickly became just "beaverslide".{{sfn|Klinkenborg|pp=94–95}}{{sfn|Sando|p=52}}

The beaverslide was somewhat mobile, inexpensive, handled large amounts of hay, and was easily built. It was faster to use than early [[baler]]s and made windproof haystacks.{{sfn|Merrill-Maker|p=234}}{{sfn|Sando|p={{page needed|date=October 2012}}}} It rapidly gained popularity in southwestern Montana and adjacent parts of eastern [[Idaho]], with its use spreading to other western states and Canada in places where light meadow grass was put up as hay.{{sfn|Oberling}}{{sfn|Munday|loc=ch. 6|p=75}} In regions where it had been adopted it remained in common use into the 1990s.{{sfn|Merrill-Maker|p=234}}{{sfn|Sando|p={{page needed|date=October 2012}}}} While use of a beaverslide is labor-intensive, and it has not been commonly used in the 21st century, some ranchers are returning to it to save fuel costs.{{sfn|Welsch &amp; Moore|pp=96–99}}{{sfn|''High Plains Journal''}} Still others never abandoned it because of the large cash outlay required to purchase modern mechanized balers.{{sfn|Sando|p={{page needed|date=October 2012}}}}

== Construction ==
[[File:Beaverslide Avon 03.jpg|thumb|View of beaverslide without haystack]]
The beaverslide is constructed of a rigid pole frame in the form of a right-angle triangle that supports a steeply inclined, slatted, plank ramp, with or without sides, approximately {{convert|50|-|60|ft|m}} long. The size and angle of individual beaverslides varies greatly and reflects local needs.{{sfn|Ernst &amp; Swaney}} Beaverslides were originally of all-wooden construction, usually [[lodgepole pine]],{{sfn|Sando|p=52}} and could last 10 to 15 years.{{sfn|Sando|p=91}} In the 1970s, some components began to be made of metal, which are longer-lasting.{{sfn|Sando|p=58}} The inclined ramp, about {{convert|15|-|20|ft|m|0}} wide, is made of smooth wooden or metal slats and is about two thirds the length of the poles.{{sfn|Ernst &amp; Swaney}} In the 1920s it became possible to extend the height of the slide so that the hay could be thrown further.{{sfn|Sando|p=58}} In the 1950s movable wings were placed on either side of the ramp so that the hay could be stacked more neatly.{{sfn|Sando|p=58}} A flat, toothed wooden platform called a "basket" or rack&lt;!--it's called a "basket" but it doesn't really look like one, no sides--&gt; is suspended by a system of cables and pulleys from the poles.{{sfn|Sando|pp=53–54}} It is raised to bring hay to the top of the slide, and then lowered back down along the length of the ramp. A backstop, usually an open wooden grid held up by poles, is set at the far end of the stack helps hold the completed stack in place.{{sfn|Sando|p=58}} A fence of wood panels or other materials is often placed around the stack to keep out livestock.{{sfn|Sando|p=61}}

== Use ==
[[File:Beaverslide Haystack Avon 09.jpg|thumb|Haystack created by a beaver slide]]
A beaverslide will raise hay to a height that allows a haystack to be built as much as 30 feet high.{{sfn|Sando|p=60}} A large hay crew is required, with a minimum of six people to operate all components. A load of hay is delivered to the base of the beaverslide, often pushed by a [[buckrake]] drawn by a team of horses or a tractor. The hay is loaded onto the rack, which when full is drawn up the inclined ramp by cables powered either by a second team of horses or a motorized vehicle such as a pickup or a tractor.{{sfn|Sando|p=52}} At the top of the incline, the hay falls onto the stack and the rack is lowered for another load.{{sfn|Kerson}} The term "butt" describes the hay stacked by the beaverslide and has two meanings. A "butt" can be the amount of hay on a fully loaded rack, but the term also refers to the amount of hay that can be stacked by the beaverslide without moving it, roughly 24 tons of hay.{{sfn|Sando|pp=55, 90}}&lt;!--Sando has some confusion here; clearly one load going up the ramp is not 24 tons, but you can't build a whole stack in 11 min.--&gt; The hay at the top of each haystack is stomped and piled higher towards the middle to allow rain to run off.{{sfn|''High Plains Journal''}} Depending on the size of the field and the amount of hay produced per acre, once a beaverslide has created a stack, it can be moved a few feet to make a long, continuous haystack, or moved a longer distance to create multiple stacks within a field. Many are built on skids to facilitate being moved from field to field.{{sfn|Sando|pp=57, 61}} If the hay is stacked properly, and remains uneaten, the hay in a beaverslide-constructed stack remains good at least two to three years, with some ranchers claiming it could last up to five or six years. In contrast, baled hay stored outdoors can begin to go bad after only one year.{{sfn|Sando|p=90}}

[[Image:BolexH16.jpg|thumb|150px|A Bolex H16 REX-5 spring-wound [[clockwork]] 16 mm camera]]
'''Bolex''' is a trade mark registered October 1924 for Charles Haccius and Jacques Bogopolsky. The actual company Bolex International S. A. of [[Yverdon]] is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] follow manufacturer of [[Movie camera|motion picture cameras]], the most notable products of which are in the [[16 mm film|16 mm]] and [[Super 16 mm film|Super 16 mm]] formats. A first company '''Bol''' was founded by Haccius and [[Jacques Bogopolsky|Bogopolsky]] (a. k. a. Bolsey or Bolsky) in 1925 and Bolex is derived from Bogopolsky′s name.  He had previously designed cameras for [[Alpa]] of Ballaigues. In 1923 he presented the Cinégraphe Bol at the Geneva fair, a reversible apparatus for taking, printing, and projecting pictures on 35-mm. film.

Paillard-Bolex cameras were much used for nature films, documentaries and by the avant garde, and are still favoured by many [[animators]]. While some later models are electrically powered, the majority of those manufactured since the 1930s use a spring-wound [[clockwork]] power system. The 16&amp;nbsp;mm spring-wound Bolex is a popular introductory camera in [[film school]]s.

Bolex International no longer manufactures its cameras in series, but produces 16mm and Super 16 cameras for customers on special order.  

==History==
Effective September 30, 1930 Bogopolsky sold all assets except a few patents to Ernest Paillard &amp; Cie which retained his services until 1935. Then the H-16 camera was put on the market, the 9.5mm version followed in 1936 and the Double-8mm version in 1938. The H-16 was highly successful. Paillard-Bolex introduced the L-8 for the market of pocket 8mm film cameras. With the postwar boom in home movie making, Paillard-Bolex continued to develop its 8mm and 16mm ranges with the H-16 increasingly adopted by professional film makers. The company also made a successful range of high-end movie projectors for all amateur film making gauges.

In 1952, during the golden era of [[3D film]], Bolex offered the Bolex Stereo: a 3D stereo kit for their H-16 camera and model G projectors. A number of technical changes was made to the H cameras in 1954, above all an entirely different claw drive together with a laterally inverted film gate and a 170 degrees opening angle shutter. In 1956 the first H-16 reflex viewfinder model was brought out. In reaction to the upcoming use of heavier varifocal or zoom lenses and the bigger synchronous electric motors attached to the body Paillard gave it a big rectangular base with three tapped bushings replacing the original single-tap “button” base in 1963 and soon afterwards a protruding 1-to-1 shaft for the ESM motor. A saddle for a 400-ft. film magazine finally allowed the H-16 to be used like professional synch-sound cameras.

In 1965 Kodak introduced the [[Super 8mm]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super 8 mm Film History|url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/products/production/spotlight_on_super_8/super_8mm_history/index.htm|website=Kodak|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paillard Bolex were slow to introduce a Super 8 camera although they quickly modified the 18-5 Auto 8mm projector for Super 8 as the 18-5 L. At about this time (1966) the Bolex 16 Pro Camera was introduced to compete with the Arriflex 16 BL camera, as a technically advanced professional camera more suited for television use than the H-16. Nevertheless the H-16 Standard camera was made until the last days of 1969. The H-16 and H-8 standard models afford the rackover critical focusing feature that had been first introduced with the Bell &amp; Howell Standard camera in 1912.

Effective January 1st, 1970 Paillard sold the Bolex division to [[Eumig]] of Vienna.&lt;ref name="Breiding2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. James Breiding|title=Swiss Made: The Untold Story Behind Switzerland′s Success|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mnkYFt6pijoC&amp;pg=PT385|date=10 January 2013|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=1-84765-809-1|pages=385–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 Eumig rationalised the Super 8 range and Super 8 equipment production in Switzerland was discontinued. The Bolex product brand was retained while being manufactured in Eumig or [[Chinon Industries|Chinon]] factories. The H-16 cameras were still made in Switzerland. 

In 1981 Eumig went into liquidation and Bolex was bought by a management team which set up Bolex International in 1982.&lt;ref name=Breiding2013 /&gt;
Today, the Bolex factory in Switzerland continues to produce new 16mm and Super 16 film cameras and also can convert Bolex H16 reflex models to Super 16mm.

== Digital Bolex D16 ==
{{main|Digital Bolex}}
In 2012, Cinemeridian, Inc. licensed the named Bolex from Bolex International to create a digital Super 16mm cinema camera called the Digital Bolex D16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kif|title=Old-School 16mm Moviemaking Goes Digital|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/12/bolex-digital-16mm-film-camera/|website=Wired|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SchenkLong2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sonja Schenk|author2=Ben Long|title=The Digital Filmmaking Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlRvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Course Technology|isbn=978-1-305-25906-5|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Bolex announced their collaboration with Bolex via the [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding platform on March 12, 2012 at the [[SXSW Film Festival]] where they had a trade show booth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardy|first1=Robert|title=First Impressions of the Digital Bolex from SXSW, and a Short Documentary About the Camera|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2013/03/digital-bolex-sxsw-short-documentary|website=No Film School|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The technical aspects of the Bolex ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
The camera′s capacity is 100&amp;nbsp;ft. A 400-ft magazine (on the Rex 5 - or converted Rex 3 or 4) can be attached to the top of the camera. From the beginning it offered automatic film threading, a clutch for disengaging the drive spring in order to crank the film by hand forward and backwards unlimited, and a cut-off turret disc that is not wider than the camera body in center position. Stepless speed control was available between 8 and 64 frames per second. Early cameras have a 190 degrees opening angle shutter. A few years after their introduction the H cameras could be equipped with an accurate single-frame counter. That accessory was incorporated into all H camera models since 1946.

As with a still reflex camera, the Bolex RX has a [[viewfinder]], which allows the filmmaker to view what he or she is filming. This specific viewfinder is made up of a double prism that deflects 20 percent of the light going through the lens into the viewfinder.

The Paillard-Bolex H-16 usually has a turret for three C-mount lenses. Often, the camera was provided with a 16mm Switar or Yvar, a 25mm Switar or Yvar and the third lens was often a 75mm Yvar or 50mm Switar. It should be noted that only lenses with the designation "RX" in 50 mm or less can be used on the RX models. RX corrected lenses were also manufactured by Schneider, Berthiot, Angénieux, and Rodenstock. The single lens port H-16 M(arine) was made in conjunction with the first underwater housing. A second, later marine housing was made for the electric drive models.

Some people had their H-16 camera converted to Super 16. This format is highly suited to telecine conversion, as Super 16 is close to the 16:9 electronic image format. Some conversions were more successful than others. Bolex (latterly) did offer a factory Super 16mm camera. This has the appropriate markings in the viewfinder and the film gate is machined and polished to professional standards.

Bolex did have a foray into purely professional cameras with the Bolex Pro 16. Again, they decided against a registration pin for mechanical simplicity, to keep the camera as quiet as possible for sync-sound filming. This camera was only offered with 400&amp;nbsp;ft magazine capacity.

== Legacy ==

Directors [[David Lynch]], [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Will Vinton]], [[Maya Deren]], and [[Spike Lee]] all began their careers shooting on Paillard-Bolex Cameras {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, and the Paillard-Bolex has developed a cult following as the result of being used for decades as a beginner camera in film schools worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

There are currently two documentaries in production about the history of the Bolex camera. '''Beyond The Bolex''', a biographical film about Bolex founder Jacques Bogopolsky (later anglicized to Bolsey), is directed by his great-grand daughter Alyssa Bolsey, and features an in-depth look at the inventor's original notes, schematics, prototypes, and fotoage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Mark|title=The BOLEX Goes Digital &amp; Becomes A Documentary|url=http://kickstartmovies.com/2013/04/11/the-bolex-goes-digital-becomes-a-documentary/|website=Kickstartermovies.com|accessdate=13 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814072313/http://kickstartmovies.com/2013/04/11/the-bolex-goes-digital-becomes-a-documentary/|archivedate=14 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second product is being undertaken by Swiss director Alexandre Favre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=July Meeting|url=http://la3dclub.com/july-meeting-bolex-16mm-3-d-717/|website=LA 3D Club|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-1130-502, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Lichtdom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Cathedral of Light above the [[Nazi party rally grounds|''Zeppelintribune'']]]]
[[File:150cm Flak-Scheinwerfer 34 auf SdAnh 104 Luftwaffenmuseum Berlin-Gatow Denis Apel.JPG|thumb|right|A German 150cm searchlight displayed at the ''[[Militärhistorisches Museum Flugplatz Berlin-Gatow]]'', 2003]]

The '''Cathedral of Light''' or '''''Lichtdom''''' was a main aesthetic feature of the [[Nuremberg Rallies|Nazi Party rallies]] in [[Nuremberg]] from 1934 to 1938. Designed by architect [[Albert Speer]], it consisted of 152 anti-aircraft [[searchlight]]s, at intervals of 12 metres, aimed skyward to create a series of vertical bars surrounding the audience. The effect was a brilliant one, both from within the design and on the outside.  The Cathedral of Light was documented in the [[Nazi propaganda]] film ''[[Festliches Nürnberg]]'', released in 1937.

Speer had been commissioned by [[Adolf Hitler]] to build a stadium for the annual party rallies, but the stadium could not be completed in time for the 1933 rally. As a stopgap, he used 152 [[antiaircraft]] [[searchlight]]s pointed upwards around the assembly area.&lt;ref name="kitchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filler"&gt;Martin Filler, "Hanging Out with Hitler", review of Martin Kitchen, ''Speer: Hitler's Architect'', ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' '''62''':20:36-40 (December 17, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The searchlights were borrowed from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', which caused problems with its commander [[Hermann Göring]], because they represented most of [[Germany]]'s [[strategic reserve]]. Hitler overruled him, suggesting that it was a useful piece of [[disinformation]]. "If we use them in such large numbers for a thing like this, other countries will think we're swimming in searchlights."&lt;ref&gt;Speer, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they had originally been planned as a temporary measure until the stadium was completed, they continued to be used afterwards for the party rallies.&lt;ref name="filler"/&gt; A similar effect was created for the [[Olympic Games ceremony#Closing|closing ceremony]] of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]] in [[Berlin]] by Eberhard von der Trappen with Speer's collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Neumann, Kermit Swiler Champa, eds., ''Architecture of the Night: The Illuminated Building'', 2002, {{ISBN|3791325876}}, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen Guttman, ''The Olympics: A History of the Modern Games'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Variants of the effect had the searchlights converge to a point above the spectators.

The Flak Searchlights used were developed in the late 1930s and used 150-centimeter-diameter [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] glass reflectors with an output of 990 million [[candela]]s. The system was powered by a 24-kilowatt generator, based around a 51-horsepower (38&amp;nbsp;kW) 8-cylinder engine, giving a current of 200 amperes at 110 volts. The searchlight was attached to the generator by a cable 200 meters long. The system had a detection range of about 8 kilometers for targets at an altitude of between 4000 and 5000 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/|title=Rare Historical Photos - And the story behind them...|website=rarehistoricalphotos.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer described the effect: "The feeling was of a vast room, with the beams serving as mighty pillars of infinitely light outer walls".&lt;ref name="kjc"/&gt; The British Ambassador to Germany, [[Nevile Henderson|Sir Nevile Henderson]], described it as "both solemn and beautiful... like being in a cathedral of ice".&lt;ref name="kitchen"&gt;quoted in Martin Kitchen, ''Speer: Hitler's Architect'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still considered amongst Speer's most important works.

A '''cock ring''' or '''cockring''' is a ring worn around the [[human penis|penis]], usually at the base. The primary purpose of wearing a cock ring is to restrict the flow of blood from the erect penis in order to produce a stronger [[erection]] or to maintain an erection for a longer period of time. Genital adornment is another purpose, as is repositioning the genitals to provide an enhanced appearance.

Cock rings are also called C rings, penis rings or shaft rings. When used in cases of [[erectile dysfunction]] (ED), they are known by various other names, such as erection rings and tension rings.

Cock rings worn just behind the [[corona of glans penis|corona]] of the [[glans]] of the penis are known as glans rings, head rings or cock crowns.

A ring that is worn around the penis and [[scrotum]] is also usually called a cock ring, but is sometimes referred to as a cock and ball ring.

Rings that are worn just round the scrotum, in order to hold the [[testicles]], are usually called [[testicle cuffs]] or ball stretchers.

==Motivations==
===Medical===
A man may wear an erection ring because he has [[erectile dysfunction]] (ED). When used for ED, a purpose-designed [[penis pump|vacuum pump]] is used to produce an erection by simple mechanical and hydrodynamical action in spite of [[blood vessels|vascular]] or [[nerve]] damage, and the ring is slid off the pump's cylinder onto the base of the penis to maintain the erection before it is lost. The testicles are not ringed in this case.

===Recreational===
A cock ring may be used to prolong erection in order to provide pleasure beyond their own orgasm or simply because the wearer likes the particular sensation of tightness and extreme engorgement that wearing one provides.  It can be worn as a [[sex toy]], as genital jewelry, or simply for the appearance. Some men enjoy using cock rings for masturbation, as wearing of this sex toy contributes to better erection and delays orgasm for themselves, thus it intensifies orgasmic sensations. Also, vibrating cock rings deliver a great range of very pleasurable vibrations that enhance enjoyment for the wearer and their partner.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Use==
[[File:Cendax - Cock ring and ball stretcher.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A cock ring and [[Cock and ball torture|"ball stretcher"]] in use]]
The purpose of a cock ring is to trap blood inside the penis in order to maintain an erection, or encourage a stronger erection. In order to do this it must be placed at the base of the penis.

A ring made of stretchy material is simply stretched over the penis (and optionally also the scrotum, except when used with a pump for impotence) and situated against the body. Rigid rings are used differently: first each testicle is fed through the ring and the entire scrotum is pulled through, then the flaccid penis is pushed through the ring and situated against the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freddyandeddy.com/howto/howusecockring.htm Freddy and Eddy: How Use a Cock Ring&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
When used with a pump, a [[personal lubricant|lubricating gel]] is always used to help the pump maintain a vacuum, in the same way [[vacuum grease]] is used with a [[vacuum pump]] in scientific applications. The gel also makes it easier for the ring to slide off the pump, and later, to remove it from the penis.

==Variations==
Some models include a protruding clitoral stimulator, designed to tickle the [[clitoris]], [[vulva]], or [[anus]] during sex (and during masturbation on using them on a dildo). Others, such as the vibrating ring, vibrate, either vibrating the ring itself, or in a popular 'Dolphin' variant using two removable bullet vibrators to provide stimulation to the testicles and clitoris. Some cock rings have [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrators]] attached that can be worn to stimulate the [[scrotum]] or [[perineum]] of a partner during [[sexual intercourse]]. Many women find that rings with vibrator attachments provide clitoral stimulation that is needed for achieving orgasm. Cock ring users should keep in mind that any pain, discomfort, or feeling of coldness in genitals is a signal to take the cock ring off.

Another variation is an inflatable cock ring for added control of adjustment.

A '''triple cock ring''' or '''triple crown''' is a cock ring that has additional rings for restraining the testicles. In [[orgasm]], the testicles usually retract towards the body before ejaculation. A triple crown changes and intensifies the sensation of orgasm by forcing the testicles to stay away from the body.

==Risks==
Vendors of cock rings and medical sources always indicate that cock rings are not to be worn for more than about 30 minutes. Falling asleep or using [[Prohibition (drugs)|illicit drugs]] at the same time is very dangerous. The first sign of pending problems is when the penis starts to become numb, painful, or cold. As soon as this happens, the cock ring must be removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2318.html Considering cock rings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311002358/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2318.html |date=2010-03-11 }} Retrieved on 2010-03-03&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical issues===
Cock rings that are too tight, or worn for too long can be dangerous: this may cause [[priapism]], a [[medical emergency]] that, if not treated promptly, can result in severe and permanent damage, including penile [[gangrene]] that can result in the destruction and possible [[amputation]] [[penectomy|of the penis]]. Rings for erectile dysfunction are invariably supplied with the instruction that they should not be left on for more than thirty minutes. Falling asleep with a ring on is a particular danger. This may lead to temporary or permanent nerve damage. Numbness in the [[glans penis]], penis becoming cold or penis becoming white may be signs that a cock ring has been worn for too long and medical advice should be sought.

Cock rings must not be used without medical advice by those who have cardiovascular problems or who take blood-thinning medication.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Materials and types==
Commercially available cock rings are made from many different materials, including: leather, rubber, silicone, neoprene, nylon, metals (including: aluminium, steel, titanium, silver, gold and platinum), wood, plastic, bone, horn, ceramic, glass, and semi precious stone. They also come in a range of sizes, particularly the rigid varieties which range in diameter from 35mm to at least 63mm.
[[File:Silver Gentlemen's Ring.jpg|thumb|150px|Silver cock ring]]

Designs range from the simple to the complex. Simple rings may lie flat on a surface, while others are ergonomically curved to fit more comfortably on the wearer. Some designs are horseshoe shaped with a closure. in cross section the rings may vary from round to flatten oval, that latter offering more friction on the penis and are therefore less likely to slip. Many of the newer rings also have different accessories and projections.

There are also vibrating cock rings available which can stimulate the [[testicle|testes]] at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penis-rings.net/ Penis rings: What to do] Retrieved on 2010-03-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, cock rings can be bought with accessories that stimulate the [[clitoris]] or anal area during intercourse. Other cock rings go around the scrotum and can significantly enhance erection and intensity of orgasms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askmen.com/dating/dzimmer_200/211_cock-rings-reasons-she-should-swallow-and-more.html Questions and answers on cock rings] Retrieved on 2010-03-03&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is one negative: the more accessories that are added on, the greater the chance of developing discomfort or cold sensations from the device.

Rings for ED must be able to be placed in position while a pump is connected; the erection is lost as soon as vacuum is removed unless the ring is already in place. This rules out most types other than simple elastic rings.

===Specialized underwear===
Specialized underwear is available which comes with pre-fitted cock rings. The underwear has a pouch with an internal fabric/elastic cock ring which either slides along the penis and encircles the scrotum or, alternatively, simply snaps around the base of the scrotum to snugly—but not in a constricting way—attach the pouch to the genitals. While this type of pouch permits the wearer to "[[Thong (clothing)#Men.27s thongs|go backless]]", C ring pouches can be attached to either a thong or traditional [[jockstrap]].

'''The Explosive Substances Act 1883''' (c. 3) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It makes it illegal to use (or conspire or intend to use) any explosive substance to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, whether or not any explosion actually takes place. A person guilty of an offence under this law is liable to [[life imprisonment]].  

Under the Act, it is also an offence, subject to imprisonment for life, to possess explosives under suspicious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/46-47/3 | title=Explosive Substances Act 1883}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone who helps someone to commit a crime under this law by providing money, materials, premises, or any other assistance is tried and punished as severely as the person who actually uses the explosives.  

Witnesses who are called during the official investigation or the trial can be arrested to prevent them from absconding and do not have the right of silence to protect themselves from self-incrimination. On the other hand, self-incriminating evidence from a witness cannot be used in a different criminal or civil proceeding.

==Applications of this Act==

Any instance of [[terrorism]] involving any kind of bomb is necessarily a crime under Explosive Substances Act 1883 (as well as being a crime under the law against attempted murder). In fact, for many decades the Explosive Substances Act was the basis for the prosecution of terrorist cases, such as [[S-Plan]] in 1939, the [[Birmingham Six]] in 1975, [[Tony Lecomber]] in 1985, and the [[Talbot Street bomb-making haul]] in 2006.  

Since 2000, there has been a series of special [[Terrorism Acts (2000-present)|terrorism laws]] which appear to supersede the Explosive Substances Act in that they can also be used to investigate and prosecute those who misuse explosives to endanger life and property for illegitimate purposes (usually to further their own political causes).  

The terrorism acts have been applied in the cases such as the [[2004 Financial buildings plot]] and [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot]] in which the intent to misuse explosives is alleged.  However, since no actual explosive substances have been found, the Explosive Substances Act cannot be made to apply.  

A recent use of the Act was against Iraqi doctor [[Bilal Abdullah]], who became the first person charged over the London and Glasgow car bomb attacks in 2007. Abdullah, who was arrested after a flaming Jeep was driven into the doors of the arrivals hall at [[Glasgow Airport]]. The 27-year-old, who was working as a doctor at the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital (Paisley)|Royal Alexandra Hospital]] in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], [[Scotland]], before his arrest, was charged with conspiring to cause explosions under the Explosive Substances Act. The charge alleges he "unlawfully and maliciously conspired with others to cause explosions of a nature likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property in the United Kingdom".

In April 2015, Faris al-Khori, a former Syrian doctor, was jailed for 40 months under the Explosives Substances Act for possessing explosive ingredients and bomb-making instructions in properties in Edinburgh.[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-32066871]

[[File:whereismyflyingcar.jpg|thumb|right|"Where's my flying car?" on the March 2008 cover of ''[[Popular Science]]'', a technology magazine that has reported on flying cars and other futuristic aircraft throughout the 20th century.]]

A '''flying car''' is a type of [[personal air vehicle]] or [[roadable aircraft]] that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air. The term "flying car" is also sometimes used to include [[hovercar]]s.

Many prototypes have been built since the first years of the twentieth century using a variety of flight technologies and some have true [[VTOL]] performance, but no flying car has yet reached production status.

Their appearance is often predicted by futurologists, with their failure ever to reach production leading to the catchphrase, "Where's my flying car?"

Flying cars are also a popular theme in [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] stories.

==History==
=== Early developments===
In 1926, [[Henry Ford]] displayed an experimental single-seat aeroplane that he called the "[[Ford Flivver|sky flivver]]". The project was abandoned two years later when a distance-record attempt flight crashed, killing the pilot.&lt;ref name="popsci2001"&gt;''[[Popular Science]]:'' [http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2001-12/looking-back-henry-fords-flivver Looking back at Henry Ford's Flivver: A plane-car for the man of average means], December 2001 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116082811/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/aviationspace/8ca6d4d03cb84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |date=16 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flivver was not a flying car at all, but it did get press attention at the time, exciting the public that they would have a mass-produced affordable airplane product that would be made, marketed, sold, and maintained just like an automobile. The airplane was to be as commonplace in the future as the Model T of the time.

In 1940, [[Henry Ford]] famously predicted: "Mark my word: a combination airplane and motorcar is coming. You may smile, but it will come.”&lt;ref name="popsci2001"/&gt;

The [[Aerocar]] designed and built by [[Molt Taylor]] made a successful flight in December 1949, and in following years versions underwent a series of road and flying tests. [[Chuck Berry]] featured the concept in his 1956 song "[[You Can't Catch Me]]", and in December 1956 the [[Civil Aviation Authority]] approved the design for mass production, but despite wide publicity and an improved version produced in 1989, Taylor did not succeed in getting the flying car into production.&lt;ref name="Glass2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Glass|title=Flying Cars: The True Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFBVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84|date=25 August 2015|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-53423-7|pages=84–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between 1956 - 1958, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s Advanced Design studio built the Volante Tri-Athodyne, a 3/8 scale concept car model. It was designed to have three ducted fans, each with their own motor, that would lift it off the ground and move it through the air. In public relation release, Ford noted that "the day where there will be an aero-car in every garage is still some time off", but added that "the Volante indicates one direction that the styling of such a vehicle would take".&lt;ref name=yesterday&gt;{{cite book |title=Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future|author=Joseph J. Cor|author2=Brian Horrigan|date=15 May 1996 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0801853999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsW34SciarAC&amp;printsec|ref=yesterday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lionel Salisbury |url=http://www.roadabletimes.com/roadables-vtol_volanteFord.html |title=Volante (Ford) VTOL |publisher=Roadabletimes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, [[Popular Mechanics]] reported that [[Hiller Aircraft|Hiller Helicopters]] was developing a ducted-fan aircraft that would be easier to fly than helicopters, and should cost a lot less. Hiller engineers expected that this type of an aircraft would become the basis for a whole family of special-purpose aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/future-that-never-was-personal-aviation#slide-39|title=Prediction 1957: Flying Fan Vehicle|publisher=Gregory Benford and the Editors of Popular Mechanics|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the US Army's Transportation Research Command began an investigation into "flying jeeps", [[ducted-fan]]-based aircraft that were envisioned to be smaller and easier to fly than helicopters. In 1957, [[Chrysler]], [[Curtiss-Wright]], and [[Piasecki]] were assigned contracts for building and delivery of prototypes. They all delivered their prototypes; however, Piasecki's [[Piasecki VZ-8 Airgeep|VZ-8]] was the most successful of the three. While it would normally operate close to the ground, it was capable of flying to several thousand feet, proving to be stable in flight. Nonetheless, the Army decided that the "Flying Jeep concept [was] unsuitable for the modern battlefield", and concentrated on the development of conventional helicopters. In addition to the army contract, Piasecki was developing the Sky Car, a modified version of its VZ-8 for civilian use.

In the mid-1980s, former [[Boeing]] engineer, Fred Barker, founded Flight Innovations Inc. and began the development of the Sky Commuter, a small duct fans-based VTOL aircraft. It was a compact, {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} two-passenger and was made primarily of composite materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-9302266.html|title=Vest-pocket VTOL. (vertical take-off-and-landing aircraft, Sky Commuter) (column)|publisher=Mechanical Engineering-CIME|date=1 December 1990|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the remaining prototype was sold for £86k on [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2008/01/12/sky-commuter-vehicle.html|title=Sky Commuter vehicle prototype for sale|publisher=Urbanaero.com |date=12 January 2012|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern developments===
In 1942, the Soviet armed forces experimented with a gliding tank, the [[Antonov A-40]], but it was not capable of flying on its own.

AeroMobil currently fly-tests a prototype that obtained Slovak [[Ultralight aviation|ultralight]] certification. When the final product will be available or how much it will cost is not yet specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeromobil.com/ |title=AeroMobil: Flying car |publisher=aeromobil.com |accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban Aeronautics' [[X-Hawk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanaero.com/category/x-hawk |title=Urban Aeronautics |publisher=Urbanaero.com |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[VTOL]] turbojet powered [[aircraft]] announced in 2006 with a first flight planned for 2009. It was intended to operate much like a [[tandem rotor]] [[helicopter]], but with ducted fans rather than exposed rotors.  The requisite decrease in rotor size would also decrease fuel efficiency. The X-Hawk was being promoted for rescue and utility functions. As of 2013, no flights had been reported.

[[Terrafugia]] have a flying road vehicle, the [[Terrafugia Transition]] On 7 May 2013, [[Terrafugia]] announced the [[Terrafugia TF-X|TF-X]], a plug-in hybrid tilt-rotor vehicle that would be the first fully autonomous flying car. It would have a range of {{convert|500|miles|km}} per flight and batteries are rechargeable by the engine. Development of TF-X is expected to last 8&amp;ndash;12 years, which means it will not come to market before 2019.

The [[Moller Skycar M400]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Category: Uncategorised |url=http://www.moller.com |title=Moller International Home |publisher=Moller.com |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2002/2002%20-%203737.html?search=Flying%20car |title='&amp;#39;Flight'&amp;#39; 2002 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[prototype]] personal [[VTOL]] (vertical take-off and landing) [[aircraft]] which is powered by four pairs of in-tandem [[Wankel rotary engine]]s, and is approaching the problems of satellite-navigation, incorporated in the proposed [[Small Aircraft Transportation System]]. Moller also advises that, currently, the Skycar would only be allowed to fly from airports &amp; heliports. The Skycar M400 has tiny wheels and no road capability at all. Moller has been developing VTOL craft since the late 1960s, but no Moller vehicle has ever achieved free flight out of ground effect. The proposed Autovolantor model has an all-electric version powered by [[Altairnano]] batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.autoforsale.co.in/2014/07/rinspeed-squba-first-underwater-flying.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718165427/http://blog.autoforsale.co.in/2014/07/rinspeed-squba-first-underwater-flying.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 July 2014 |title=Rinspeed Squba, The First Underwater Flying Car |publisher=autoforsale.co.in |accessdate=13 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Xplorair|Xplorair PX200]] was a French project of single-seater [[VTOL]] aircraft without rotating [[airfoil]], relying on the [[Coandă effect]] and using an array of small [[jet engine]]s called ''thermoreactors'' embedded within [[tiltwing]]s' body. Announced in 2007, the project has been funded by the [[Cabinet of France|Government of France]] and was supported by various [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace firms]]. A full-scale [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] was scheduled for flight at [[Paris Air Show]] 2017, followed by the commercialization of a single-seater flying car in the years after.

The [[SkyRider X2R]] is a prototype of a flying car developed by MACRO Industries, Inc. It is lighter than the Moller Skycar which has never successfully flown untethered.

Also notable is the roadable aircraft [[PAL-V]] ONE, which is an autogyro or [[gyrocopter]] that can be taken to the road, too.

[[Zee.Aero]] and [[Kitty Hawk Corporation]] are developing flying cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vance|first1=Ashlee|last2=Stone|first2=Brad|title=Welcome to Larry Page’s Secret Flying-Car Factories|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/welcome-to-larry-page-s-secret-flying-car-factories|accessdate=12 March 2017|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by സ്വന്തം ലേഖകൻ |url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/news/just-in/2017/04/25/personal-flying-machine-maker-plans-deliveries-this-year.html |title=Flying Cars |publisher=Manoramaonline.com |date=2017-04-25 |accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
A practical flying car must be capable of safe, reliable and environmentally-friendly operation both on public roads and in the air. For widespread adoption it must also be able to fly without a qualified [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] at the controls and come at affordable purchase and running costs.

===Lift===
Many types of aircraft technologies and form factors have been tried. The simplest and earliest approach was to give a driveable car added, bolt-on fixed flying surfaces and propeller. However such a design must either tow its removable parts on a separate trailer behind it, or return to its last landing point before taking off again. Other conventional takeoff fixed-wing designs include folding wings, which the car carries with it when on the road.

Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) designs include [[rotorcraft]] with folding blades, as well as ducted-fan and [[tiltrotor]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/13/terrafugia_tfx_followup/|title=Your Flying Car? Delayed again, but you WILL get it, says Terrafugia|publisher=theregister.co.uk|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most design concepts have inherent problems. Ducted-fan aircraft such as the [[Moller Skycar]] tend to easily lose stability and have been unable to travel at greater than 30–40 [[knot (unit)|knots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/when-cars-fly-1.341214|title=When cars fly|publisher=haaretz.com|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiltrotors, such as the [[V-22 Osprey]] [[convertiplane]], are generally noisy. To date, no vertical takeoff and landing ([[VTOL]]) vehicle has ever demonstrated adequate road capabilities.

The [[autogyro]] has an unpowered lifting rotor, relying on its forward airspeed to generate lift. For road use it requires a folding rotor. Designs such as the [[PAL-V]] are currently being explored.

===Safety===
Although statistically, commercial flying is much safer than driving, unlike commercial planes personal flying cars might not have as many safety checks and their pilots would not be as well trained. Humans already have problems with the aspect of driving in two dimensions (forward and backwards, side to side), adding in the up and down aspect would make "driving" or flying as it would be, much more difficult; however, this problem might be solved via the sole use of self-flying and [[Self-driving car|self-driving]] cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/5-reasons-you-dont-want-flying-car.htm#page=1|title=Top 5 Reasons You Don't Want a Flying Car: Flying Can Be a Scary Event|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mid-air collision]]s and mechanical failures, the aircraft could fall from the sky or go through an emergency landing, resulting in deaths and property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/5-reasons-you-dont-want-flying-car.htm#page=3 |title=Top 5 Reasons You Don't Want a Flying Car: Breaking Down Means Falling Out of the Sky|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, poor weather conditions, such as low air density, lightning storms and heavy rain, snow or fog could be challenging and affect the aircraft's aerodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/5-reasons-you-dont-want-flying-car.htm#page=4|title=Top 5 Reasons You Don't Want a Flying Car: Flying Cars Are Hard to Drive in Bad Weather|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major problem, which increases rapidly with wider adoption, is the risk of mid-air collisions. Another is the unscheduled or emergency landing of a flying car on an unprepared location beneath, including the possibility of accident debris. Regulatory regimes are being developed in anticipation of a large increase in the numbers of [[roadable aircraft]] and [[personal air vehicle]]s in the near future, and compliance with these regimes will be necessary for safe flight.

Mechanically, the challenges of flight are so strict that every opportunity must be taken to keep weight to a  minimum and a typical airframe is lightweight and easily damaged. On the other hand a road vehicle must be able to withstand significant impact loads from casual incidents as well as low-speed and high-speed impacts, and the high strength this demands can add considerable weight. A practical flying car must be both strong enough to pass road safety standards and light enough to fly.

===Environment===
A flying car capable of widespread use must operate safely within a heavily populated urban environment. The lift and propulsion systems must be quiet, and have safety shrouds around all moving parts such as rotors, and must not create excessive pollution.

===Control===
A basic flying car requires the person at the controls to be both a qualified road driver and aircraft pilot. This is impractical for the majority of people and so wider adoption will require computer systems to de-skill piloting. These include aircraft maneuvering, navigation and emergency procedures, all in potentially crowded airspace. [[Fly-by-wire]] computers can also make up for many deficiencies in flight dynamics, such as stability. A practical flying car may need to be a fully [[autonomous vehicle]] in which people are present only as passengers.

===Cost===
The need for the propulsion system to be both small and powerful can at present only be met using advanced and expensive technologies. The cost of manufacture could therefore be as much as 10 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Millennium Book: Your Essential All-purpose Guide to the Year 2000|author=Gail Collins|author2=Dan Collins|date=1 December 1990|publisher=Main Street Books|isbn=978-0-385-41165-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZGZPAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flying cars would be used for shorter distances, at higher frequency, and at lower speeds and lower altitudes than conventional passenger aircraft. However optimal fuel efficiency for airplanes is obtained at high altitudes and high subsonic speeds, so a flying car's energy efficiency would be low compared to a conventional aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Barney L. Capehart (2007). ''Encyclopedia of Energy Engineering and Technology'', Volume 1. CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-8493-3653-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8493-3653-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the flying car's road performance would be compromised by the requirements of flight, so it would be less economical than a conventional motor car as well.

==Popular culture==
===Where's my flying car?===
{{Unreliable sources|section|date=March 2015}}
The flying car was and remains a common feature of [[futurology|conceptions of the future]], including imagined near futures such as those of the 21st century. Complaints of the non-existence of flying cars have become nearly idiomatic as expressions of disappointment in the failure of the present to measure up to the glory of past predictions.{{citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=claim of widespread cultural significance needs independent verification}}

In 1999 the U.S. journalist [[Gail Collins]] noted:
{{quote|Here we are, less than a month until the turn of the millennium, and what I want to know is, what happened to the flying cars? We're about to become Americans of the 21st century. People have been predicting what we'd be like for more than 100 years, and our accoutrements don't entirely live up to expectations. (...) Our failure to produce flying cars seems like a particular betrayal since it was so central to our image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2482&amp;dat=19991212&amp;id=gZlIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pgoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4314,5320971 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130915204753/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2482&amp;dat=19991212&amp;id=gZlIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pgoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4314,5320971 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 September 2013 |title=Future shock: Why there'll be no flying cars |publisher=Google News Archive |work=[[The Post and Courier]] |date=12 December 1992 |accessdate=15 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a result, flying cars have been referred to jokingly with the question "Where's my flying car?", emblematic of the supposed failure of [[technology|modern technology]] to match [[futurist]]ic visions that were promoted in earlier decades.{{refn|group=notes|For example, see Scott, 2007, where she asks "This is not 1901, we all own pocket-sized remote voice receiver/transmitters.

Aired on 8 January 1998, ''[[Seinfeld]]'''s 167th episode, "[[The Dealership]]", featured George and Jerry complaining about the non-existence of the flying cars. Jerry says, "It's like we're living in the '50s here."

A 2001 [[IBM]] television commercial featured [[Avery Brooks]] complaining, "It is the year 2000, but where are the flying cars? I was promised flying cars. I don’t see any flying cars. Why? Why? Why?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Avery Brooks | date = 2000 | title = Where are the flying cars? | medium = Television advertisement | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzm6pvHPSGo | accessdate = 14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Lewis Black]] had a similar routine early in the decade, in which he says, "This new millennium sucks! It's exactly the same as the old millennium! You know why? No flying cars!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popsci.com/cars/article/2010-10/death-and-rebirth-flying-car|title=The Unexpected Rebirth of the Flying Car|work=Popular Science|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Flying Car]]'' was a comedy [[short film]] written by [[Kevin Smith]] in 2002 for ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. It featured [[Dante Hicks]] and [[Randal Graves]] stuck in traffic, discussing the lengths to which a man might go to obtain such a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0311146|title=The Flying Car}}{{unreliable source?|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''[[Onion News Network]]'''s 245th episode, titled "Mean Automakers Dash Nation's Hope for Flying Cars", featured [[The Onion]]'s anchor Brandon Armstrong humorously arguing about the feasibility and existence of flying cars with representatives from [[General Motors]], [[Toyota]] and [[Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1563635|title=Mean Automakers Dash Nation's Hope for Flying Cars}}{{unreliable source?|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''frequency counter''' is an [[electronics|electronic]] [[measuring instrument|instrument]], or [[Electronic component|component]] of one, that is used for measuring [[frequency]]. Frequency counters usually measure the number of cycles of oscillation, or pulses per second in a periodic electronic [[Signal (circuit theory)|signal]]. Such an instrument is sometimes referred to as a cymometer, particularly one of Chinese manufacture{{cn|date=January 2015}}.

[[File:NixieFrequencyCounter.jpg|thumb|right|Systron-Donner frequency counter from 1973 with [[Nixie tube]] display]]

==Operating principle==
Most frequency counters work by using a [[Counter (digital)|counter]] which accumulates the number of events occurring within a specific period of time. After a preset period known as the ''gate time'' (1 second, for example), the value in the counter is transferred to a display and the counter is reset to zero. If the event being measured repeats itself with sufficient stability and the frequency is considerably lower than that of the clock oscillator being used, the resolution of the measurement can be greatly improved by measuring the time required for an entire number of cycles, rather than counting the number of entire cycles observed for a pre-set duration (often referred to as the ''reciprocal technique''). The internal [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] which provides the time signals is called the ''timebase'', and must be calibrated very accurately.

If the event to be counted is already in electronic form, simple interfacing to the instrument is all that is required. More complex signals may need some conditioning to make them suitable for counting. Most general purpose frequency counters will include some form of [[electronic amplifier|amplifier]], [[electronic filter|filter]]ing and shaping circuitry at the input. [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] technology, sensitivity control and [[hysteresis]] are other techniques to improve performance.  Other types of periodic events that are not inherently electronic in nature will need to be converted using some form of [[transducer]]. For example, a mechanical event could be arranged to interrupt a light beam, and the counter made to count the resulting pulses.

Frequency counters designed for [[radio frequencies]] (RF) are also common and operate on the same principles as lower frequency counters. Often, they have more range before they overflow. For very high ([[Microwaves|microwave]]) frequencies, many designs use a high-speed [[prescaler]] to bring the signal frequency down to a point where normal digital circuitry can operate. The displays on such instruments take this into account so they still display the correct value. Microwave frequency counters can currently measure frequencies up to almost 56 [[Gigahertz|GHz]]. Above these frequencies the signal to be measured is combined in a [[Frequency mixer|mixer]] with the signal from a [[local oscillator]], producing a signal at the difference frequency, which is low enough to be measured directly.

==Accuracy and resolution==
[[File:Fluke FreqCounter PM6685R.jpg|thumb|right|Fluke PM6685R frequency counter]]
The accuracy of a frequency counter is strongly dependent on the stability of its timebase. A timebase is very delicate like the hands of a watch, and can be changed by movement, interference, or even drift due to age, meaning it might not "tick" correctly. This can make a frequency reading, when referenced to the timebase, seem higher or lower than the actual value. Highly accurate circuits are used to generate timebases for instrumentation purposes, usually using a [[quartz]] [[crystal oscillator]] within a sealed temperature-controlled chamber, known as an oven controlled crystal oscillator or [[crystal oven]].

For higher accuracy measurements, an external frequency reference tied to a very high stability oscillator such as a [[GPS]] disciplined [[rubidium]] oscillator may be used. Where the frequency does not need to be known to such a high degree of accuracy, simpler oscillators can be used. It is also possible to measure frequency using the same techniques in software in an [[embedded system]]. A [[central processing unit]] (CPU) for example, can be arranged to measure its own frequency of operation provided it has some reference timebase to compare with.

Accuracy is often limited by the available [[Sensor#Resolution|resolution]] of the measurement. Resolution of a single count is generally proportional to the timebase oscillator frequency and the gate time. Improved resolution can be obtained by several techniques such as [[oversampling]]/averaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johansson|first=Staffan|title=New frequency counting principle improves resolution|url=http://www.spectracomcorp.com/Desktopmodules/Bring2Mind/DMX/Download.aspx?EntryId=446&amp;PortalId=0|work=Spectracom|accessdate=24 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910072514/http://www.spectracomcorp.com/Desktopmodules/Bring2Mind/DMX/Download.aspx?EntryId=446&amp;PortalId=0|archivedate=10 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schaad|first=Dr. Theo P.|title=Nano-Resolution, Oceanic, Atmospheric, and Seismic Sensors With Parts-Per-Billion Resolution|url=http://paroscientific.com/pdf/G8218_Nano-Resolution.pdf|work=Paroscientific|accessdate=24 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014133542/http://paroscientific.com/pdf/G8218_Nano-Resolution.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, accuracy can be significantly degraded by jitter on the signal being measured. It is possible to reduce this error by oversampling/averaging techniques.

==I/O Interfaces==
[[Input/output|I/O interfaces]] allow the user to send information to the frequency counter and receive information from the frequency counter. Commonly used interfaces include [[RS232]], [[USB]], [[GPIB]] and [[Ethernet]]. Besides sending measurement results, a counter can notify the user when user-defined measurement limits are exceeded. Common to many counters are the [[Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments|SCPI]] commands used to control them. A new development is built-in LAN-based control via Ethernet complete with [[GUI]]'s. This allows one computer to control one or several instruments and eliminates the need to write SCPI commands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3933">'''Green Power Usage Effectiveness''' (GPUE) is a proposed measurement of both how much [[sustainable energy]] a computer [[data center]] uses, its [[carbon footprint]] per usable [[kilowatt hour]] (kWh) and how efficiently it uses its power; specifically, how much of the power is actually used by the computing equipment (in contrast to cooling and other overhead). It is an addition to the [[power usage effectiveness]] (PUE) definition and was first proposed by [[Greenqloud]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenqloud.com/greenpowerusageeffectiveness-gpue/ GPUE – Green Power Usage Effectiveness - GreenQloud]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Green Grid]] has developed the Power Usage Effectiveness metric &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreengrid.org/sitecore/content/Global/Content/white-papers/The-Green-Grid-Data-Center-Power-Efficiency-Metrics-PUE-and-DCiE.aspx The Green Grid - The Green Grid Data Center Power Efficiency Metrics: PUE and DCiE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217182325/http://thegreengrid.org/sitecore/content/Global/Content/white-papers/The-Green-Grid-Data-Center-Power-Efficiency-Metrics-PUE-and-DCiE.aspx |date=2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or PUE to measure a data centers' effectiveness of getting power to IT equipment. What the PUE tells in simple terms is how much extra energy is needed for each usable kWh for the IT equipment due to the power going into cooling, power distribution loss etc. and it’s a simple formula (in theory):

PUE = Total Facility Power/IT Equipment Power

The PUE can change depending on where measurements are made, when they are made and the timespan the measurements are made in.
Data centers are subtracting factors from their PUE to lower it e.g. district heating. Some of the issues with PUE are being addressed with the PUEx definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serverproblemsolved.com/itprimers/pue-power-usage-effectiveness-metrics-data-center-energy-efficiency-green-grid/ New PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) standards for data center energy efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

GPUE is a way to "weigh" the PUE to better see which data centers are truly green in the sense that they indirectly cause the least amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be emitted by their use of sustainable or unsustainable energy sources.

This new metric GPUE or Green Power Usage Effectiveness is defined as:

GPUE = G × PUEx (for inline comparison of data centers)&lt;br&gt;
or = G @ PUEx  (a better display and for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission calculations)

The "G" is the key factor here and it is a simple calculated value:

G = Weighed sum of energy sources and their lifecycle KG CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KWh

G =∑( %EnergySource × ( 1 + weight) )

Adding 1 to the weight is to "weigh" (multiply) with the PUE to get a number that is comparable to PUE. The weights taken directly from the "lifecycle CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh for electricity generation by power source" table above we got from the 2008 Sovacool Study &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia, ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;  e.g. the weight for unscrubbed coal is e.g. 1.050 (kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh) while hydroelectric river generation has a weight of 0.013. An unknown energy source or a "mix" will get the same as the maximum value which for now is the same as coal.

Example:

PUE 1.20, 50/50 Coal/Hydro&lt;br&gt;
G = 0.5*(1+1.050) + 0.5*(1+0.013)&lt;br&gt;
G = 1.531, GPUEx = 1.84 or 1.531@1.20

Kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per usable kWh = (G-1) × PUEx = 0.64&amp;nbsp;kg

[[File:Sunrise at Cemoro.jpg|thumb|Natural soft lighting from a sunrise in [[Temanggung Regency]], [[Central Java]], Indonesia]]
[[File:Princess Zelda I.jpg|thumb|Artificial soft light from a [[beauty dish]] is used in this [[cosplay]] portrait of [[Princess Zelda]] ]]
'''Hard and soft light''' are different types of [[lighting]] that are commonly used in [[photography]] and [[filmmaking]]. Soft light refers to light that tends to "wrap" around objects, casting diffuse shadows with soft edges. Soft light is when a light source is large relative to the subject; hard light is when the light source is small relative to the subject.

The hardness or softness of light depends mostly on the following two factors:
*Distance. The closer the light source, the softer it becomes.
*Size of light source. The larger the source, the softer it becomes.

The softness of a light source can also be determined by the angle between the illuminated object and the 'length' of the light source (the longest dimension that is perpendicular to the object being lit).  The larger this angle is, the softer the light source.

==Uses of soft light==
Soft light use is popular in cinematography and film for a number of different reasons:

*Cast shadow-less light.
*Fill lighting.  Soft light can reduce shadows without creating additional shadows.
*Make a subject appear more beautiful or youthful through making wrinkles less visible.
*Supplement the lighting from practicals. This technique is used to perform "motivated" lighting, where all light in the scene ''appears'' to come from practical light sources in the scene. Soft light does not cast shadows that would be a giveaway of a supplementary light source.

==Hard light==
Hard light sources cast shadows whose appearance of the shadow depends on the lighting instrument.  For example, [[Fresnel Lantern|fresnel lights]] can be focused such that their shadows can be "cut" with crisp shadows.  That is, the shadows produced will have 'harder' edges with less transition between illumination and shadow.  The focused light will produce harder-edged shadows.  Focusing a fresnel makes the rays of emitted light more parallel.  The parallelism of these rays determines the quality of the shadows.  For shadows with no transitional edge/gradient, a point light source is required. Hard light casts strong, well defined shadows.

When hitting a textured surface at an angle, hard light will accentuate the textures and details in an object.&lt;ref name="Hard and Soft Light Explained - Illustrated Photography"&gt;[http://www.illustratedphotography.com/basic-photography/hard-and-soft-light An explanation of hard and soft light and its usage in photography], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall-off==
{{further|Inverse-square law}}

Light intensity tends to dim with distance. For a [[Point source#Light|point source]] of light, intensity decreases as distance increases. Intensity (''I'') is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (''D''), as expressed in the formula {{math|''I'' {{=}} {{fract|1|''D''{{super|−2}}}}}}.
 
For a thin infinitely long [[Light#Light source|light source]], intensity is inversely proportional to distance. For a light source of infinite area, intensity does not decrease at all. Generally, a soft light source does not drop in intensity as quickly as a point light source would (as distance increases).

Certain lensed lighting instruments (e.g. [[ellipsoidal reflector spotlight]]s) have a good deal of "'''throw'''" and do not lose much intensity as distance increases. These light sources tend to be more effective at large distances than soft light sources. At large distances, an effective soft light source would have to be very large. The (mostly) parallel rays of such instruments tends to cast hard shadows, unlike soft light sources.

==Softness/hardness of various light sources==
Most light sources have a non-negligible size and therefore exhibit the properties of a soft light to some degree.  Even the sun does not cast perfectly hard shadows.

In "hard" light sources, the parallelism of the rays is an important factor in determining shadow behaviour.

The quality of light can be altered by using diffusion gel or aiming a lighting instrument at diffusing material such as a [[Diffusion filter|silk]].  When shooting outdoors, cloud cover provides nature's version of a [[softbox]].

[[File:Clydesdales-harrows.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale horses]] pulling spike harrows, Murrurundi, [[New South Wales|NSW]], Australia]]

In [[agriculture]], a '''harrow''' (often called a set of '''harrows''' in a [[plurale tantum]] sense) is an implement for breaking up and smoothing out the surface of the [[soil]]. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the [[plough]], which is used for deeper [[tillage]]. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by plowing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good [[tilth]] or [[soil structure]] that is suitable for [[seedbed]] use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove [[weed]]s and to cover [[seed]] after sowing. Harrows differ from [[cultivator]]s in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds). 

There are four general types of harrows: [[disc harrow]]s, tine harrows (including [[spring-tooth harrow]]s, [[drag harrow]]s, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were originally drawn by [[working animal|draft animals]], such as horses, mules, or oxen, or in some times and places by [[manual labour]]ers. In modern practice they are almost always [[tractor]]-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a [[drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]] or mounted on the [[three-point hitch]].

A modern development of the traditional harrow is the rotary power harrow, often just called a power harrow.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Martin Fortier. [http://store.farmstart.ca/blogs/farmerreviews/12354997-the-rotary-power-harrow-by-jean-martin-fortier "The rotary power harrow"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214064437/http://store.farmstart.ca/blogs/farmerreviews/12354997-the-rotary-power-harrow-by-jean-martin-fortier |date=2015-02-14 }}, FarmStart Tool Shed, February 18, 2014. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In cooler climates the most common types are the ''[[disc harrow]]'', the ''chain harrow'', the ''tine harrow'' or ''spike harrow'' and the ''[[Spring-tooth harrow|spring tine harrow]]''. Chain harrows are often used for lighter work such as levelling the tilth or covering seed, while disc harrows are typically used for heavy work, such as following ploughing to break up the [[sod]]. In addition, there are various types of ''power harrow'', in which the cultivators are power-driven from the tractor rather than depending on its forward motion.

Tine harrows are used to refine seed-bed condition before planting, to remove small weeds in growing crops and to loosen the inter-row soils to allow for water to soak into the subsoil. The fourth is a chain disk harrow.  Disk attached to chains are pulled at an angle over the ground.  These harrows move rapidly across the surface.  The chain and disk rotate to stay clean while breaking up the top surface to about {{Convert|1|in|cm|0}} deep.  A smooth seedbed is prepared for planting with one pass.
[[File:Man harrowing with tractor and disk harrow (1295027).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Harrowing with tractor and disk harrow in the 1940s)]]
Chain harrowing can be used on pasture land to spread out dung, and to break up dead material (''thatch'') in the sward, and similarly in sports-ground maintenance a light chain harrowing is often used to level off the ground after heavy use, to remove and smooth out boot marks and indentations.  Used on tilled land in combination with the other two types, chain harrowing rolls remaining larger soil clumps to the surface where weather breaks them down and prevents interference with seed germination.

All four harrow types can be used in one pass to prepare soil for seeding.  It is also common to use any combination of two harrows for a variety of [[Tillage|tilling]] processes. Where harrowing provides a very fine tilth, or the soil is very light so that it might easily be wind-blown, a [[Roller (agricultural tool)|roller]] is often added as the last of the set. 

Harrows may be of several types and weights, depending on their purpose. They almost always consist of a rigid frame that holds discs, teeth, linked chains, or other means of moving soil—but tine and chain harrows are often only supported by a rigid towing-bar at the front of the set. 

In the southern hemisphere, so-called ''giant discs'' are a specialised kind of disc harrows that can stand in for a plough in rough country where a mouldboard plough cannot handle tree-stumps and rocks, and a disc-plough is too slow (because of its limited number of discs). Giant scalloped-edged discs operate in a set, or frame, that is often weighted with concrete or steel blocks to improve penetration of the cutting edges. This sort of cultivation is usually followed by broadcast fertilisation and seeding, rather than drilled or row seeding. 

A [[drag harrow|drag]] is a heavy harrow.
[[File:Erpice 1849.jpg|thumb|19th century harrow]]

===Power harrow===
A rotary power harrow, or simply power harrow, has multiple sets of vertical tines. Each set of tines is rotated on a vertical axis and tills the soil horizontally. The result is that, unlike a [[cultivator|rotary tiller]], soil layers are not turned over or inverted, which is useful in preventing dormant weed seeds from being brought to the surface, and there is no horizontal slicing of the subsurface soil that can lead to hardpan formation. &lt;ref&gt;Jean-Martin Fortier.

==Historical reference==
[[File:Ex-libris Schäftlarn 01.jpg|thumb|Spike harrow depicted on a 16th-century German coat-of-arms]]

The invention and use of the harrow was first written in the Chinese agricultural text ''[[Qimin Yaoshu]]'' written by the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]] official Jia Sixie. The harrow was used as a farm implement for breaking up soil chunks as well as eradicating weeds, suppressing pests, and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology |last=Lu |first=Yongxing |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3662513897 |volume=2 |pages=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrows were later used in Europe during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval Machine|page=53|author=[[Jean Gimpel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known illustration of a harrow is in Scene 10 of the eleventh-century [[Bayeux Tapestry]].

'''Deployment''' of '''Internet Protocol Version 6''' ([[IPv6]]), the next generation of the [[Internet Protocol]], has been in progress since the mid-2000s.

IPv6 was designed as a replacement for [[IPv4]] which has been in use since 1982, and is in the final stages of [[IPv4 address exhaustion|exhausting its unallocated address space]], but still carries most Internet traffic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html |title=BGP Analysis Reports |accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google's statistics show IPv6 availability of its users up to 25% &lt;!-- on two Saturdays--&gt;  depending on the day of the week (more use on weekends), with use over 20% any day of the week {{as of|2018|07|alt=since July 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html|title=IPv6 – Google|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption is uneven across countries and Internet service providers.

&lt;!-- when those numbers are updated, also update the main page percentages please --&gt;
In November 2016, 1491 (98.2%) of the 1519 [[top-level domain]]s (TLDs) in the Internet supported IPv6 to access their domain name servers, and 1485 (97.8%) zones contained IPv6 [[Domain Name System|glue records]], and approximately 9.0 million domains (4.6%) had IPv6 address records in their zones. Of all networks in the global BGP routing table, 29.2% had IPv6 protocol support.&lt;ref name=hestat&gt;{{cite web

By 2011, all major operating systems in use on personal computers and server systems had production-quality IPv6 implementations. Cellular telephone systems present a large deployment field for Internet Protocol devices as mobile telephone service is making the transition from [[3G]] to "next-generation" [[4G]] technologies, in which voice is provisioned as a [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) service. This mandates the use of IPv6 for such networks. In 2009, the US cellular operator [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] released technical specifications for devices to operate on its "next-generation" networks.&lt;ref name="verizon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Derek Morr|title=Verizon Mandates IPv6 Support for Next-Gen Cell Phones|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20090609_verizon_mandates_ipv6_support_for_next_gen_cell_phones/|publisher=CircleID|date=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification mandates IPv6 operation according to the ''3GPP Release 8 Specifications (March 2009)'', and deprecates IPv4 as an optional capability.&lt;ref name="verizon" /&gt;

Google publishes statistics on IPv6 adoption among Google users. A graph of IPv6 adoption since 2008 and a map of IPv6 deployment by country are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption |title=IPv6 adoption |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=per-country-ipv6-adoption |title=Per-country IPv6 adoption |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akamai publishes by-country and by-network statistics on IPv6 adoption for traffic it sees on its global Content Distribution Network (CDN).  This set of data also shows graphs for each country and network over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/state-of-the-internet-ipv6-adoption-visualization.jsp |title=IPv6 adoption visualization |publisher=Akamai |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A global view into the history of the growing IPv6 routing tables can be obtained with the SixXS Ghost Route Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixxs.net/tools/grh/ |title=SixXS Ghost Route Hunter |publisher=Sixxs.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool provided a list of all allocated IPv6 prefixes until 2014 and marks with colors the ones that were actually being announced into the Internet BGP tables. When a prefix was announced, it means that the [[Internet service provider|ISP]] at least can receive IPv6 packets for their prefix.

The integration of IPv6 on existing network infrastructure may be monitored from other sources, for example:
* [[Regional Internet registry|Regional Internet registries]] (RIR) IPv6 prefix allocation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v6asns.ripe.net/v/6?s=_ALL;s=CH;s=DE;s=JP;s=FR;s=US;s=BE;s=PE|title=IPv6 Enabled Networks|work=ripe.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPv6 testing, evaluation, and certification===
A few organizations are involved with international IPv6 test and evaluation, ranging from the United States Department of Defense to the University of New Hampshire.

* The US DoD [[Joint Interoperability Test Command]] [[DoD IPv6 Product Certification]] Program
* [[University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory]] involvement in the IPv6 Ready Logo Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipv6ready.org|title=IPv6 Ready Logo Site - Home|work=ipv6ready.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Massey University]] has enabled IPv6 on its border and core campus routers. Its central network services, including DNS, external email and NTP are also enabled. Massey's main website is IPv6-enabled and remote login to some servers and network equipment also support IPv6 for systems administration and networking staff.
* IPv6 has been enabled on 15 websites hosted at [[Tauranga City Council]] (TCC). Changes to equipment on the Council’s internal LAN have also been made to enable IPV6. Some internal networks across the organisation have been enabled for IPv6, and dual-stack technology is being used to enable both IPv4 and IPv6 use. A number of internal servers and client devices communicate via IPv6, and a teredo relay and 6to4 relay ensure users using these two transition technologies are well served when accessing IPV6 addresses.
* The [[University of Auckland]] IT Services team has partially deployed IPv6, in collaboration with the Science Faculty and the Computer Science Department. It has IPv6 connectivity via [[KAREN]] and its commercial ISP. Computer Science is fully dual-stacked; IPv6 has been used in undergraduate laboratory assignments and for post-graduate projects.
* [[KAREN]], New Zealand’s R&amp;E network, is an IPv6 native network and has provided IPv6 as a standard service offering to its members since 2006.
* Auckland-based ISP WorldxChange Communications has had dual-stack since 2008. It has started providing residential customers with dual (IPv4 and IPv6) service using DHCPv6, on a trial basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wxnz.net/ipv6-trial/ |title=WXNZ IPv6 Trial |publisher=Wxnz.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''JEDEC Solid State Technology Association''' is an independent semiconductor engineering trade organization and standardization body.

JEDEC has over 300 members, including some of the world's largest computer companies. Its scope and past activities includes standardization of part numbers, defining an [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD) standard, and leadership in the [[RoHS|lead-free manufacturing]] transition.&lt;ref name="about-JEDEC"/&gt;

The origin of JEDEC traces back to 1944, when [[Radio Manufacturers Association|RMA]] (subsequently renamed EIA) and [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association|NEMA]] established the Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council (JETEC) to coordinate [[vacuum tube]] type numberings.

In 1958, with the advent of [[semiconductor]] technology, the joint JETEC-activity of [[Electronic Industries Association|EIA]] and NEMA was renamed into '''Joint Electron Device Engineering Council'''.&lt;ref name="about-JEDEC"&gt;https://www.jedec.org/about-jedec/jedec-history&lt;/ref&gt; NEMA discontinued its involvement in 1979. In the fall of 1999, JEDEC became a separate trade association under the current name, but maintained an EIA alliance, until EIA ceased operations in 2011.

The origin of JEDEC can be traced back to 1944, when the [[Radio Manufacturers Association]] (RMA), and the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA) established the ''[[Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council]]'' (''[[JETEC]]'') to coordinate [[vacuum tube]] type numberings. The expansion of the radio industry caused JETEC to expand its scope to include solid state devices and develop standards for [[semiconductor device]]s. Eventually, the joint JETEC activity of [[Electronic Industries Association|EIA]] and NEMA was renamed into ''Joint Electron Device Engineering Council'' (''JEDEC'') in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jedec.org/about-jedec/jedec-history|title=JEDEC History|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=jedec.org |publisher=JEDEC |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="about-JEDEC"/&gt; NEMA discontinued its involvement in 1979.

The early work began as a part numbering system for devices which became popular in the 1960s. The first semiconductor devices, such as the 1N23 silicon point contact diode, were still designated in the old ''[[RMA tube designation]]'' system, where the "1" stood for "No filament/heater" and the "N" stood for "crystal rectifier". The first RMA digit thus was re-allocated from "heater power" to "p-n junction count" to form the new EIA/JEDEC ''EIA-370'' standard; for example, the 1N4001 [[rectifier]] [[diode]] and [[2N2222|2N2222 transistor]] part numbers came from ''EIA-370''. They are still popular today. In February 1982, JEDEC issued ''JESD370B'', superseding the original ''EIA-370'' and introducing a new letter symbol "C" that denotes the [[Die (integrated circuit)|die version]], as opposed to "N", now meaning the [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Packaging|packaged version]]. The Japanese [[JIS semiconductor designation]] system employs a similar pattern. JEDEC later developed a numbering system for integrated circuits, but this did not gain acceptance in the semiconductor industry. The European [[Pro Electron]] semiconductor numbering system originated in a similar way from the older [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]].

Earlier in the 20th century, the organization was known as JETEC, the Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council, and was responsible for assigning and coordinating [[RETMA tube designation]]s to electron tubes (also called valves). The type [[6L6]], still to be found in electric-guitar amplifiers, typically has a type number that was assigned by JETEC.

In the fall of 1999, JEDEC became a separate trade association under the current name, but maintained an EIA alliance.

==Test methods and product standards==
This early work was followed by a number of test methods, JESD22, and product standards. For example, the ESD caution symbol, which is the hand with the line drawn through it, was published by JEDEC and is used worldwide. JEDEC also has a dictionary of semiconductor terms. All of JEDEC standards are free on the Web for downloading after a free registration.

JEDEC has issued widely used standards for device interfaces, such as the [[JEDEC memory standards]] for computer memory ([[Random Access Memory|RAM]]), including the [[DDR SDRAM]] standards.

==Semiconductor package drawings==
JEDEC also developed a number of popular package drawings for semiconductors such as [[TO-3]], [[TO-5]], etc. These are on the web under JEP-95. One hot issue is the development of lead-free packages that do not suffer from the [[whisker (metallurgy)|tin whiskers]] problem that reappeared since the recent [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|ban on lead content]]. JEDEC is working with [[iNemi]] on a joint interest group on lead-free issues.

==Industry standards==
JEDEC's adoption of [[open standard|open industry standards]] (i.e., standards that permit any and all interested companies to freely manufacture in compliance with adopted standards) serves several vital functions for the advancement of electronic technologies.  First and foremost, such standards allow for interoperability between different electrical components. JEDEC standards do not protect members from normal patent obligations. The designated representatives of JEDEC member companies are required to disclose patents and patent applications of which they personally are aware (assuming that this information is not considered proprietary). JEDEC patent policy requires that standards found to contain patents whose owners will not sign a standard JEDEC patent letter be withdrawn. Thus the penalty for a failure to disclose patents is retraction of the standard. Typically, standards will not be adopted to cover technology that will be subject to patent protection.  In rare circumstances, standards covered by a patent may be adopted, but only on the understanding that the patent owner will not enforce such patent rights or, at a minimum, that the patent owner will provide a reasonable and non-discriminatory license to the patented technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jedec.org/Home/manuals/JM21L.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308100413/http://www.jedec.org/Home/manuals/jm21l.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-08|title=§8.2 of the JEDEC Manual of Organization and Procedure (JM21-M)|date=July 2002|publisher=JEDEC Solid State Technology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium''' (referred to as 'mSign') was founded in 1999 and comprised 35 member companies. In October 2000, the consortium published an [[XMl]]-interface defining a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] allowing service providers to obtain a mobile (digital) signature from a [[mobile phone]] subscriber.

In 2001, mSign gained industry-wide coverage when it became apparent that [[Brokat]], a company of one of the founders, also obtained a process patent in Germany for using the mobile phone to generate digital signatures.

==Technologies used==
The mSign consortium created the standards on the assumption that a [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] phone with a WAP 1.2 implementation and digital keys stored on the SIM card (i.e. WIM) would be used to generate a mobile (digital) signature. During the standardization process, room was given also to other mechanisms for authenticating the mobile phone subscriber such as the sending of a password via SMS or Dialtone communication and voice identification. The specification also allowed for server-based digital signatures. In other words, digital signatures not generated in the mobile phone but on a central server that would then communicate with the signature requesting Service Providers via the mSign interface.

==Founding members==
The founding members were Siemens, E-Plus Mobilfunk, Mannesmann Mobilfunk, T-Mobile, VIAG Interkom, Schlumberger, Gemplus, T-Telesec, Trust Center of Deutsche Telekom, cv cryptovision and Brokat AG.

==Other members==
Later members include Advance Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., Cable &amp; Wireless HKT, Carticom Corporation, Credit Agricole Indosuiez Luxembourg, EXCELSIS Informationssysteme GmbH, fun communications GmbH, Hewlett-Packard GmbH, Hypo Vereinsbank, IIS/GlobalSign Greece SA, InterCard POS–Service GmbH, ITFinity Solutions, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, MyAlert.com, NSE Software AG, ORGA Kartensysteme GmbH, PAGO eTransaction Services GmbH &amp; Co. KG, payitmobile AG i.G., RCM Technologies (Operational Headquarter, Siemens AG, ICP CD M EBO, SONERA SMARTTRUST GmbH, TC TrustCenter GmbH, WAYS INDIA Ltd. and West LB.

The '''Museum of Transport and Technology''' ('''MOTAT''') is a science and technology museum located in [[Western Springs]], [[Auckland]], New Zealand. It is located close to the [[Western Springs Stadium]], [[Auckland Zoo]] and the [[Western Springs Park]]. The museum has large collections of civilian and military aircraft and other land transport vehicles. An ongoing programme is in place to restore and conserve items in the collections. This work is largely managed by volunteers many of whom have been associated with MOTAT for upwards of four decades. Since the passing of the Museum of Transport and Technology Act in 2000, new management and the support of full-time professional museum staff and a large number of dedicated long term volunteers have ensured the Museum's future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/private/2000/0001/latest/DLM119385.html Museum of Transport and Technology Act 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; New public programmes and facilities now promote the collections.

MOTAT was established in 1960 by a combination of groups including the Old Time Transport Preservation League, which was formed in 1957 and preserved trams and railway locomotives. MOTAT was formally opened in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motat.org.nz/about-motat/corporate/ MOTAT Official Website - Corporate Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

==MOTAT 1 – Great North Road==
MOTAT 1 was built around the site of a [[beam engine]] pump house, which originally provided Auckland's water supply (system similar to the [[Crofton Pumping Station]] and [[Markfield Beam Engine]]). The Council engaged the services of famed engineer, [[William Errington]], to design and construct the Pumphouse and Boiler house to provide the first pressurised water supply to Auckland. Adjacent swampland was excavated creating a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} dammed lake, which is filled by three [[Spring (hydrology)|natural springs]]. This area is now the Western Springs Lake and parkland. The engine is a [[Arthur Woolf|Double Woolf Compound]] built by John Key and Sons of [[Kirkcaldy]] in Scotland, who also built the long scrapped Lancashire boilers that originally provided the steam. The Western Springs Water Works officially opened in a small ceremony on 10 July 1877. The pumphouse was superseded by Auckland's extensive dam system and reticulation in 1928. Restoration and earthquake strengthening of the building was completed in 2002 and overhaul of the long dormant Beam Engine commenced at the start of 2005. On 11 October 2007 the engine moved under pneumatic pressure for the first time in 79 years and was finally tested under steam during the evening of 29 November the same year. The Beam engine was re-commissioned in a special public opening on 19 April 2008. A range of other early steam engines are kept in running order including a 1910 [[Tangye]] steam engine, an impressive 1911 triple-expansion engine built by Campbell Calderwood from [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], Scotland, which was formerly from the ill-fated Sydney Ferry The [[Greycliffe disaster|Greycliffe]] which sank on 3 November 1927 after being hit by the much larger [[Union Company|Union Steam Ship Company]]’s [[Royal Mail Steamship Tahiti]] with the loss of 40 lives. The engine ended its commercial life in the [[Tirau]] dairy factory. Steam for the Beam Engine and other artifacts provided by a 1957 [[Daniel Adamson]] steam boiler, which was formerly used at Frankham's Mill, [[Te Puna]].

Exhibits include trams, trains, vintage traction engines, carriages, cars, buses, trolleybuses and trucks, particularly fire engines, electrical equipment, space flight exhibits including a [[Corporal (rocket)|Corporal rocket]] and general science exhibits. There is also a 'colonial village' of early shops and houses, including a [[Sea Fencibles|fencible]] cottage and a [[blacksmith]] shop.

The MOTAT printery demonstrates type making, type setting and printing on a variety of different manual and mechanical printing presses operated by Volunteers printing giveaways and small publications. A volunteer bindery group also demonstrate their talents and hold classes.

In the 1970s visitors to MOTAT were entertained by the MOTAT Chorus, a group of barbershop singers who later became the Auckland [[City of Sails Chorus]].

The 'Pioneers of Aviation' Pavilion holds memorabilia of early aviators. The displays include miscellaneous parts from [[Richard Pearse]]'s experimental aircraft, (together with research supporting the claim that he made uncontrolled hops/flights prior to the [[Wright brothers]]), a replica of the craft which was flown and his third aircraft (an attempt at a [[VTOL]] tilt rotor craft). The pavilion also holds relics from the [[Walsh Brothers]]' flights and school, and a library and archive of transport resources named in memory of the Walsh Brothers available to all MOTAT visitors and via the MOTAT website for virtual visitors. Also celebrated is [[Charles Kingsford-Smith]]'s [[trans-Tasman]] flight in the [[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]], [[Jean Batten]]'s England–New Zealand flight and later record breaking efforts (her [[Percival Gull]] is exhibited at [[Auckland Airport]]). The larger civil aviation exhibits continue over at MOTAT 2 with displays relating to the [[Pan American Airways]] and [[Imperial Airways]] flying boats of the late 1930s and [[TEAL]] flying boats of the 40s and 50s. The engine from Jean Batten's Percival Gull is displayed at MOTAT 2.

The Road transport collection rotationally displays in excess of 100 cars, trucks, motorbikes and emergency vehicles. Some of the iconic vehicles in the collection include one of the first [[Trekka]] utility vehicles, New Zealand's only homegrown production vehicle built between 1966 and 1973, based on Czechoslovakian [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] engines and chassis. Other vehicles include a 1960s [[Cooper Climax]] race car, an early American [[Brush Motor Car Company]] runabout, an International horseless carriage, an [[Austin Motor Company]] beer tanker (the first in New Zealand) and a wide number of other vehicles. Also in the collection is one of the [[Ferguson Company]] tractors which [[Edmund Hillary]] used to lay supply depots for the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], and with which he beat British explorer Dr [[Vivian Fuchs]] [[Sno-Cat]]s to the [[South Pole]] on 3 January 1958.

MOTAT also houses a small collection of Police vehicles, including former New Zealand Transport Department, later [[New Zealand Ministry of Transport]] (M.O.T.) patrol cars and patrol motorbikes, the road policing duties of which were combined into the [[New Zealand Police]] in the early 1990s. The NZ Police Collection of 40 plus vehicles were housed at MOTAT for a number of years until 2011.

Trams are displayed at MOTAT 1 and operate daily between MOTAT 1's Great North Road Site, via Western Springs Park and Auckland Zoo to MOTAT 2. The extended line was opened by Helen Clark on Friday 27 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motat.org.nz/Projects/Funding%20-%20Tram%20Ext.htm Western Springs Tramway Extension] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525131936/http://www.motat.org.nz/Projects/Funding%20-%20Tram%20Ext.htm |date=25 May 2010 }}.

MOTAT 2's NZ$15 million extended aviation pavilion housing the "Sir Keith Park Memorial Aviation Collection" opened Friday 9 September 2011.

Also known in the past as the 'Sir Keith Park Memorial Airfield', named after [[Keith Park]], the [[Battle of Britain]] and [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Battle of Malta]] hero, MOTAT's aviation collection is on a separate site, neighbouring the [[Waitematā Harbour]] and Auckland Zoo. It contains memorials to [[Fleet Air Arm]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] pilots, radar and other aviation related material, as well as workshops for work on other vehicles, but the main feature is the collection of New Zealand's civil and some [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] aircraft. A [[Grumman Avenger]] TBF-1 NZ2527 1943 torpedo bomber was completed in December 2013 and is due to go on display in early 2014, it is a RNZAF Pacific combat veteran and representative of Avengers operated by the RN Fleet Air Arm. In November 2011 a [[Douglas A4D Skyhawk|Douglas A4K Skyhawk]] jetfighter was permanently loaned to MOTAT followed by a [[De Havilland Devon]] and [[Aermacchi MB-339]] jet trainer in 2012. A [[BAC Strikemaster]] may join the collection from the [[RNZAF]].

There is also a military section which restores and demonstrates a selection of Second World War military trucks, light tracked vehicles and tanks of Allied forces. The military section has regular open days when the [[Military Reenactment Society]] displays and demonstrates the vehicles and uniforms.&lt;ref name="MotatMilitary"&gt;[http://www.motat.org.nz/collections/military.htm Official Museum Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817134954/http://www.motat.org.nz/collections/military.htm |date=17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOTAT 2 also has an operational railway with 1&amp;nbsp;km of track, stations and a selection of former New Zealand Government Railways, light industrial locomotives, wagons and carriages.

On 9 September 2011 a new and larger display hangar was opened at MOTAT 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motat.org.nz/Projects/Funding%20-%20Aviation%20Hanger.htm MOTAT – Aviation Hangar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727051452/http://www.motat.org.nz/Projects/Funding%20-%20Aviation%20Hanger.htm |date=27 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing [[blister hangar]] was moved and restored as part of the same project. With the construction of the new hangar it was now possible to display the restored De Havilland Mosquito and Lockheed Hudson. Short S25 Sunderland Mk V and NAC DC3 Dakota were in moved inside as their overhauls and external painting was completed towards the end of summer 2012. The Short S45A Solent Mk 4, Ventura and top dressing Lodestar will be housed in due course as restorations and building provisions allow.

[[File:K900.jpg|thumb|300px|K900 on static display at MOTAT. Photo: Hayden Booth.]]

MOTAT features several major collections of transport vehicles:

*[[MOTAT collections#Aircraft|Aircraft collection]] — houses New Zealand's largest collection of civil and military aircraft, all with genuine New Zealand aviation pedigrees. These range from relics from Richard Pearse's first 1903 aircraft and an interpretive replica, as well as a large part of his original third vertical takeoff aircraft. 1930's Fox and Tiger Moths, 1930's Rapide, [[Short Solent]] 1940s double decked flying boat, from New Zealand's first International Airline [[TEAL]], a [[Short Sunderland]] marine patrol flying boat, [[De Havilland Mosquito]] wooden fighter bomber, a restored 1940s [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber, Douglas [[DC-3 Dakota]] through to a [[De Havilland Vampire]] 1950s jet fighter and most recently former [[RNZAF]] [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] and [[Aermacchi MB-339]]CB advanced jet trainers. The aviation site of MOTAT located in Meola Road is also known as the Keith Park Memorial Airfield. A replica [[Hawker Hurricane]] is on a plinth in the markings OK-1 of New Zealander and [[RAF]] [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Keith Park]] memorial at the entrance.
*[[MOTAT collections#Railway locomotives|Railway locomotives and collection]] — includes seven steam locomotives from a pioneering 1874 [[NZR F class]] to the iconic [[NZR K class (1932)|NZR K class]] steam locomotive, smaller branch line, industrial and logging tank locomotives. Also six diesel, petrol and petrol electric locomotives, including the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]] which was built to replace the K class from the 1950s through the 1960s and became the most prolific mainline locomotive in New Zealand.
*[[MOTAT collections#Railway carriages|Railway carriages]] — the collection also includes stations, carriages, wagons and other rolling stock.
*[[MOTAT collections#Trams|Tram collection]] — the collection includes over 20 electric, steam and cable trams, many of which are operational, with support equipment and vehicles from former New Zealand tramway systems of Auckland, Wellington, Wanganui and the Mornington Cable tram system in Dunedin. Auckland's horse-drawn tramway opened in 1884 and was replaced by the electric tram system in 1902, closing in 1956. The final closure of an original street tramway was in Wellington in 1964. An 1883 Dunedin Cable Car trailer is the sole South Island tramway exhibit and there are additional trams from Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. The museum is one of five operational Museum and Heritage Tramways in New Zealand.
*[[MOTAT collections#Petrol / diesel buses|Petrol / diesel bus collection]] — contains a significant collection of historic buses from the Auckland region, including a 1924 [[White Motor Company]] 4-cylinder side-valve petrol engine, wooden-bodied 23 seat omnibus, through a 1954 [[Bedford SB]], petrol engine, 35-seat lightweight wooden-body bus specifically built for [[Grafton Bridge]] services, through to a 1978 [[Mercedes-Benz O305]] which last operated in 2005 and a 1978 M.A.N SL200 No.1603 retired in the 2010s.
*[[MOTAT collections#Trolleybuses|Trolleybus collection]] — this collection contains a representative cross-section of trolleybuses which operated in Auckland between 1938 and 1980. First used on a 1&amp;nbsp;km department store-operated route in central Auckland from 1938, the trolleybus system later duplicated and then replaced the aging tram system between 1949 and 1956. The trolleybuses were in turn replaced by diesel buses in 1980.

==Tram service==
[[Image:New Zealand 9 283.jpg|thumb|right|A MOTAT to Zoo tram service operated by Melbourne W2 class tram #321, Auckland, 2006.]]

Tramlines on sleepered track set under bitumen were laid within the museum boundaries with trams commencing operation on 16 December 1967. The Museum tramline was later extended beyond the Museum grounds along Gt. North Road and opened on 19 December 1980. A further extension along Motions Road to Auckland Zoo commenced services on 5 December 1981 using rail set in mass concrete. In 2006–07 the tram line was further extended by a distance of 636 metres, to the aviation hangar at MOTAT 2, the service commencing on 27 April 2007. The tramway is dual gauge, employing 4-foot and 4-foot {{frac|8|1|2}} inches gauges, the rail welded and set in mass concrete.

Trams are operated daily between MOTAT, alongside the Western Springs Park and precinct, past Auckland Zoo to MOTAT 2 and connect both Museum sites.&lt;ref name="MotatTrams"&gt;[http://www.motat.org.nz/collections/trams.htm Tramway &amp; Tramcars] (from the official museum website)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lowercase|nesC}}
{{about|the programming language|the safety code|National Electrical Safety Code}}

'''nesC''' (pronounced "NES-see") is a [[Component-oriented_programming|component-based]], [[Event-driven programming|event-driven]] [[programming language]] used to build applications for the [[TinyOS]] platform. TinyOS is an [[operating environment]] designed to run on embedded devices used in distributed [[wireless sensor network]]s. nesC is built as an extension to the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] with components "wired" together to run applications on TinyOS. The name ''nesC'' is an abbreviation of "network embedded systems C".

==Components and interfaces==
nesC programs are built out of components, which are assembled ("wired") to form whole programs. Components have internal concurrency in the form of tasks. Threads of control may pass into a component through its interfaces. These threads are rooted either in a task or a hardware interrupt. 

Interfaces may be provided or used by components. The provided interfaces are intended to represent the functionality that the component provides to its user, the used interfaces represent the functionality the component needs to perform its job. 

In nesC, interfaces are bidirectional: They specify a set of functions to be implemented by the interface's provider (commands) and a set to be implemented by the interface's user (events). This allows a single interface to represent a complex interaction between components (e.g., registration of interest in some event, followed by a callback when that event happens). This is critical because all lengthy commands in TinyOS (e.g. send packet) are non-blocking; their completion is signaled through an event (send done). By specifying interfaces, a component cannot call the send command unless it provides an implementation of the sendDone event. Typically commands call downwards, i.e., from application components to those closer to the hardware, while events call upwards. Certain primitive events are bound to hardware interrupts. 

Components are statically linked to each other via their interfaces. This increases runtime efficiency, encourages robust design, and allows for better static analysis of programs.

'''Ocean Power Technologies Australasia Pty Ltd''' (OPTA) is an [[Australian]] company, a subsidiary of [[Ocean Power Technologies]] Inc (OPT) of the United States, a [[renewable energy]] company, providing power generation devices, services and related equipment for the extraction of energy from ocean waves. 

In 2009 OPTA was part of [[Victorian Wave Partners]] formed to develop a 19 megawatt [[Renewable energy in Australia#Wave power|wave power project near Portland, Victoria]] connected to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;Ocean Power Technologies: [http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/portland.html Portland Victoria, Australia system]&lt;/ref&gt; The project was to receive an AU$66.46 million grant from the Australia federal government. By 2014, the consortium had abandoned the project, saying it was not commercially viable. OPT had given up on plans to develop the project, which was to cost $232 million for which the Australian government had offered $66.5 million in funding support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/worlds-biggest-wave-energy-project-sinks-without-trace-30448 World’s “biggest” wave energy project sinks without trace]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''performance gap''' is a term commonly used to denote the disparity that is found between the energy use predicted and carbon emissions in the design stage of buildings and the energy use of those buildings in operation. Research in the UK suggests that actual carbon emissions from new homes can be 2.5 times the design estimates, on average.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J; Godoy-Shimizu, D; Tilson, A; Mawditt, I. 2016. Building Performance Evaluation Programme: Findings from domestic projects - Making reality match design. London: Innovate UK. Page 18&lt;/ref&gt; For non-domestic buildings, the gap is even higher - actual carbon emissions as much as 3.8 times the design estimates, on average.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J; Terry, N; Armitage, P. 2016. Building Performance Evaluation Programme: Findings from non-domestic projects - Getting the best from buildings. London: Innovate UK. Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

There are established tools for reducing the performance gap, by reviewing project objectives, outline and detailed design drawings, design calculations, implementation of designs on site, and post-occupancy evaluation. NEF's Assured Performance Process (APP) is one such tool, which is being used extensively on different sites that form part of East Hampshire's Whitehill and Bordon new town development, one of the largest regeneration projects anywhere in the UK, with high ambitions for both environmental performance and health.

==Classification of factors that contribute to the performance gap==
The performance gap is produced mainly due to uncertainties. Uncertainties are found in any “real-world” system, and buildings are no exception. As early as 1978, Gero and Dudnik wrote a paper presenting a methodology to solve the problem of designing subsystems ([[HVAC]]) subjected to uncertain demands. After that, other authors have shown an interest in the uncertainties that are present in building design; Ramallo-González classified uncertainties in building design/construction in three different groups:&lt;ref&gt;Ramallo-González, A.P. 2013. Modelling Simulation and Optimisation of Low-energy Buildings. PhD. University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Environmental. Uncertainty in weather prediction under changing climate; and uncertain weather data information due to the use of synthetic weather data files: (1) use of synthetic years that do not represent a real year, and (2) use of a synthetic year that has not been generated from recorded data in the exact location of the project but in the closest weather station.
# Workmanship and quality of building elements. Differences between the design and the real building: Conductivity of [[thermal bridges]], conductivity of [[insulator (electricity)|insulation]], value of infiltration or U-Values of walls and windows. There may be optimism bias by designers, where expectations about what is possible on site are unrealistic, and/or buildability fails to get adequate attention during design.
# Behavioural. All other parameters linked to human behaviour i.e. door and window opening, heating regimes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, M; Palmer, J; Pope, P; Armitage, P. 2016. UK Housing Stock Models Using SAP: The Case for Heating Regime Change. Science Journal of Engineering 4 (2) 12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;, use of appliances, occupancy patterns or cooking habits.

===Type 1: Environmental uncertainties===
The type 1 from this grouping, have been divided here into two main groups: one concerning the uncertainty due to climate change; and the other concerning uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files. Concerning the uncertainties due to climate change: buildings have long life spans, for example, in England and Wales, around 40% of the office blocks existing in 2004 were built before 1940 (30% if considered by floor area).&lt;ref&gt;ODPM, 2005. Age of Commercial and Industrial Stock: Local Authority Level 2004. London: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;/ref&gt; and, 38.9% of English dwellings in 2007 were built before 1944.&lt;ref&gt;CLG, 2007. English House Condition Survey 2007, Annual report. Communities and Local Government&lt;/ref&gt; This long life span makes buildings likely to operate with climates that might change due to global warming. De Wilde and Coley showed how important is to design buildings that take into consideration climate change and that are able to perform well in future weathers.&lt;ref&gt;de Wilde, P. &amp; Coley, D., 2012. The implications of a changing climate for buildings. Building and Environment, 55, pp.1-7&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerning the uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files: Wang et al. showed the impact that uncertainties in weather data (among others) may cause in energy demand calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, L., Mathew, P. &amp; Pang, X., 2012. Uncertainties in energy consumption introduced by building operations and weather for a medium-size office building. Energy and Buildings, 53, pp.152-158&lt;/ref&gt; The deviation in calculated energy use due to variability in the weather data were found to be different in different locations from a range of (-0.5% – 3%) in San Francisco to a range of (-4% to 6%) in Washington D.C. The ranges were calculated using TMY  as the reference. These deviations on the demand were smaller than the ones due to operational parameters. For those, the ranges were (-29% – 79%) for San Francisco and (-28% – 57%) for Washington D.C. The operation parameters were those linked with occupants’ behaviour. The conclusion of this paper is that occupants will have a larger impact in energy calculations than the variability between synthetically generated weather data files.
The spatial resolution of weather data files was the concern covered by Eames et al.&lt;ref&gt;Eames, M., Kershaw, T. &amp; Coley, D., 2011. The appropriate spatial resolution of future weather files for building simulation. Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 5, pp.1-12&lt;/ref&gt; Eames showed how a low spatial resolution of weather data files can be the cause of disparities of up to 40% in the heating demand.

===Type 2: Workmanship===
In the work of Pettersen, uncertainties of group 2 (workmanship and quality of elements) and group 3 (behaviour) of the previous grouping were considered (Pettersen, 1994).  This work shows how important occupants’ behaviour is on the calculation of the energy demand of a building. Pettersen showed that the total energy use follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when the uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and of around 4.0% when considering those generated by the properties of the building elements. 
A large study was carried out by Leeds Metropolitan at Stamford Brook. This project saw 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield, J., Bell, M., Miles-Shenton, D., South, T. &amp; Lowe, B., 2011. Evaluating the impact of an enhanced energy performance standard on load-bearing masonry domestic construction, Understanding the gap between designed and real performance: Lessons from Stamford Brook. London: Department for Communities and Local Government&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this project show a significant gap between the energy used expected before construction and the actual energy use once the house is occupied. The workmanship is analysed in this work. The authors emphasise the importance of thermal bridges that were not considered for the calculations, and how those originated by the internal partitions that separate dwellings have the largest impact on the final energy use. The dwellings that were monitored in use in this study show a large difference between the real energy use and that estimated using SAP, with one of them giving +176% of the expected value when in use.

Hopfe has published several papers concerning uncertainties in building design that cover workmanship. A more recent publication at the time of writing &lt;ref&gt;Hopfe, C.J. &amp; Hensen, J.L.M., 2011. Uncertainty analysis in building performance simulation for design support. Energy and Buildings, 43, pp.2798-2805&lt;/ref&gt; looks into uncertainties of group 2 and 3. In this work the uncertainties are defined as normal distributions. The random parameters are sampled to generate 200 tests that are sent to the simulator (VA114), the results from which will be analysed to check the uncertainties with the largest impact on the energy calculations. This work showed that the uncertainty in the value used for infiltration is the factor that is likely to have the largest influence on cooling and heating demands. 
Another study performed by de Wilde and Wei Tian,&lt;ref&gt;de Wilde, P. &amp; Tian, W., 2009. Identification of key factors for uncertainty in the prediction of the thermal performance of an office building under climate change. Building Simulation, 2, pp.157-174&lt;/ref&gt; compared the impact of most of the uncertainties affecting building energy calculations taking into account climate change. De Wilde and Tian used a two dimensional Monte Carlo Analysis to generate a database obtained with 7280 runs of a building simulator. A sensitivity analysis was applied to this database to obtain the most significant factors on the variability of the energy demand calculations. Standardised Regression Coefficients and Standardised Rank Regression Coefficients were used to compare the impacts of the uncertainties. 

De Wilde and Tian agreed with Hopfe on the impact of uncertainties in the infiltration over energy calculations, but also introduced other factors, including uncertainties in: weather, U-Value of windows, and other variables related with occupants’ behaviour (equipment and lighting). Their paper compares many of the uncertainties with a good sized database providing a realistic comparison for the scope of the sampling of the uncertainties. 
The work of Schnieders and Hermelink &lt;ref&gt;Schnieders, J. &amp; Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants’ satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171&lt;/ref&gt; showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus).

===Type 3: Occupants===
The work of Schnieders and Hermelink &lt;ref&gt;Schnieders, J. &amp; Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants’ satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171&lt;/ref&gt; showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus). Although the passivhaus standard has a very controlled, high quality workmanship, large differences have been seen in energy demand in different houses.
 
Blight and Coley &lt;ref&gt;Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA&lt;/ref&gt; showed that that variability can be occasioned due to variance in occupant behaviour (it should be noted that the use of windows and doors was included in this work). The work of Blight and Coley proves two things: (1) Occupants have a substantial influence on energy use; and (2) The model they used to generate occupants’ behaviour is accurate for the creation of behavioural patterns of inhabitants. 
 
The method used in the previous paper &lt;ref&gt;Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA&lt;/ref&gt; to generate accurate profiles of occupants’ behaviour was the one developed by Richardson et al.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, I., Thomson, M. &amp; Infield, D., 2008. A high-resolution domestic building occupancy model for energy demand simulations. Energy and Buildings, 40, pp.1560-1566&lt;/ref&gt; The method was developed using the Time-Use Survey (TUS) of the United Kingdom as a reference of real behaviour of occupants, this database was elaborated after recording the activity of more than 6000 occupants in 24-hours diaries with a 10 minutes resolution . Richardson’s paper shows how the tool is able to generate behavioural patterns that correlate with the real data obtained from the TUS.
The availability of this tool allows scientist’s to model the uncertainty of occupants’ behaviour as a set of behavioural patterns that have been proven to correlate with real occupants’ behaviour. 
There have been works published to take into account occupancy in optimisation using the so called robust optimisation &lt;ref&gt;Ramallo-González, A. P., Blight, T., Coley, D. A. 2015, New optimisation methodology to uncover robust low energy designs that accounts for occupant behaviour or other unknowns, Journal of Building Engineering. 2 pp. 59-68, doi:10.1016/j.jobe.2015.05.001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Env contamination1.if.gif|325px|right|Possible sinks of pesticide drift-caused environmental contamination]]

'''Pesticide drift''' refers to the unintentional diffusion of [[pesticide]]s and the potential negative effects of [[pesticide application]], including off-target contamination due to '''spray drift''' as well as runoff from plants or soil.This can lead to damage in human health, environmental contamination, and property damage.&lt;ref name="Community Guide to Recognizing and Reporting Pesticide Problems"  /&gt; The [[California Department of Pesticide Regulation]] estimates that between 37-68% of pesticide illness among U.S. agricultural workers come as a result of pesticide drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvert|first=Geoffrey M.|last2=Karnik|first2=Jennifer|last3=Mehler|first3=Louise|last4=Beckman|first4=John|last5=Morrissey|first5=Barbara|last6=Sievert|first6=Jennifer|last7=Barrett|first7=Rosanna|last8=Lackovic|first8=Michelle|last9=Mabee|first9=Laura|date=December 2008|title=Acute pesticide poisoning among agricultural workers in the United States, 1998-2005|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18666136|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=51|issue=12|pages=883–898|doi=10.1002/ajim.20623|issn=1097-0274|pmid=18666136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
With placement (localised) spraying of broad spectrum pesticides, wind drift must be minimized, and considerable efforts have been made to quantify and control spray drift from [[Spray nozzle|hydraulic nozzles]].&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, A.J., Spray drift: impact of requirements to protect the environment, Crop Protection 19 (2000) p 623-627&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, wind drift is also an efficient mechanism for moving droplets of an appropriate size range to their targets over a wide area with [[ultra-low volume]] (ULV) spraying.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9780262015981.001.0001|title=Pesticide Drift and the Pursuit of Environmental Justice|last=Harrison|first=Jill Lindsey|date=2011-07-29|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262015981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Himel (1974) made a distinction between exo-drift (the transfer of spray out of the target area) and endo-drift, where the [[active ingredient]] (AI) in droplets falls into the target area, but does not reach the biological target.  Endo-drift is volumetrically more significant and may therefore cause greater ecological contamination (e.g. where chemical pesticides pollute [[ground water]]).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Bystander exposure describes the event when individuals unintentionally come in contact with airborne pesticides. Bystanders include workers working at an area separate to the pesticide application are, individuals living in the surrounding areas of an application area, or individuals passing by fields as they are being treated with a pesticide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pesticides : Health, Safety and the Environment|last=Matthews|first=Graham|publisher=Chichester, West Sussex; Wiley Blackwell|year=2016|isbn=|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herbicide volatilisation==
Herbicide volatilisation refers to [[evaporation]] or [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of a volatile [[herbicide]]. The effect of a gaseous chemical is lost at its intended place of application and may move downwind and affect other plants not intended to be affected causing crop damage. Herbicides vary in their susceptibility to volatilisation. Prompt incorporation of the herbicide into the soil may reduce or prevent volatilisation. Wind, temperature, and humidity also affect the rate of volatilisation, with humidity reducing it. [[2,4-D]] and [[dicamba]] are commonly used chemicals that are known to be subject to volatilisation,&lt;ref name=NYTDOWCorn&gt;{{cite news|title=Dow Corn, Resistant to a Weed Killer, Runs Into Opposition|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/business/energy-environment/dow-weed-killer-runs-into-opposition.html|accessdate=April 25, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 25, 2012|author=Andrew Pollack}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are many others.&lt;ref name=MSUHV&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting the Most from Soil-Applied Herbicides|url=http://scarab.msu.montana.edu/CropWeedSearch/Docs/GettingtheMostfromSoil-AppliedHerbicides.htm|publisher=Montana State University|accessdate=April 25, 2012|author=Fabian Menalled and William E. Dyer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221091610/http://scarab.msu.montana.edu/CropWeedSearch/Docs/GettingtheMostfromSoil-AppliedHerbicides.htm|archivedate=21 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of herbicides later in the season to protect herbicide-resistant [[genetically modified plant]]s increases the risk of volatilisation as the temperature is higher and incorporation into the soil impractical.&lt;ref name=NYTDOWCorn /&gt;
==Public concern==
Although there has been much public concern and research into spray drift, [[point source pollution]] (e.g. pesticides entering bodies of water following spillage of concentrate or ''rinsate'') can also cause great environmental harm. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spanoghe|first=Pieter|last2=Maes|first2=An|last3=Steurbaut|first3=Walter|date=2004|title=LIMITATION OF POINT SOURCE PESTICIDE POLLUTION: RESULTS OF BIOREMEDIATION SYSTEM|url=|journal=COMMUNICATIONS IN AGRICULTURAL AND APPLIED BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public concern for pesticide drift is not met with adequate regulatory response. Environmental justice advocates in California, for instance, consider moving up the scale of the discourse on pesticide drift by categorizing it as air pollution in order to receive attention from state environmental protection.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Jill Lindsey|title='Accidents' and Invisibilities: Scaled discourse and the naturalization of regulatory neglect in California's pesticide drift conflict|journal=Political Geography|date=2006|issue=25|pages=506-529}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Farm workers and communities surrounding large farms are at a high risk of coming in contact with pesticides. The San Joaquin valley in California has seen numerous cases of illnesses resulting from exposure to pesticides through pesticide drift.  Organizations such as United Farm Workers Union have fought to implement legislation that would reduce and hold farmers accountable for pesticide drift. The California Department of Pesticide Regulation estimates that between 37-68% of pesticide illness among U.S. agricultural workers come as a result of pesticide drift. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/howard/reader.action?docID=4336000&amp;query=|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insecticides sprayed on crop fields can also have detrimental effects on non-human life forms that are important to the surrounding ecosystems like bees and other insects. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McEwen|first=F.L.|title=Pesticide Residues and Agricultural Workers—An Overview|date=1977|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-738650-8.50008-4|work=Pesticide Management and Insecticide Resistance|pages=37–49|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780127386508|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 to 2006, [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] found nearly 3,000 cases of pesticide drift, nearly half were workers on the fields treated with pesticides and 14% of cases were children under the age of 15. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Soo-Jeong|last2=Mehler|first2=Louise|last3=Beckman|first3=John|last4=Diebolt-Brown|first4=Brienne|last5=Prado|first5=Joanne|last6=Lackovic|first6=Michelle|last7=Waltz|first7=Justin|last8=Mulay|first8=Prakash|last9=Schwartz|first9=Abby|date=August 2011|title=Acute Pesticide Illnesses Associated with Off-Target Pesticide Drift from Agricultural Applications: 11 States, 1998–2006|url=https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1002843|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en|volume=119|issue=8|pages=1162–1169|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002843|issn=0091-6765|pmc=3237344|pmid=21642048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] published a guidance to “manufacturers, formulators, and registrants of pesticide products" (EPA 2001) &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/prn-2001-x-draft-spray-and-dust-drift-label-statements-pesticide-products#background|title=PRN 2001-X Draft: Spray and Dust Drift Label Statements for Pesticide Products {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OCSPP,OPP|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that stated the EPA’s stance against pesticide drift as well as suggested product labeling practices.

'''Polyacetylene''' ([[IUPAC]] name: '''polyethyne''') usually refers to an [[organic polymer]] with the repeating unit (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The name refers to its conceptual construction from [[polymerization]] of [[acetylene]] to give a chain with repeating [[olefin]] groups.  This compound is conceptually important, as the discovery of polyacetylene and its high [[Ionic conductivity|conductivity]] upon [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] helped to launch the field of organic [[conductive polymers]]. The high electrical conductivity discovered by [[Hideki Shirakawa]], [[Alan Heeger]], and [[Alan MacDiarmid]] for this polymer led to intense interest in the use of organic compounds in [[microelectronics]] ([[organic semiconductor]]s). This discovery was recognized by the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.73.681|title=Nobel Lecture: Semiconducting and metallic polymers: The fourth generation of polymeric materials|year= 2001|last1= Heeger|first1= Alan|journal= Reviews of Modern Physics|volume= 73|issue= 3|pages= 681|format=free download|bibcode=2001RvMP...73..681H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early work in the field of polyacetylene research was aimed at using doped polymers as easily processable and lightweight "plastic metals".&lt;ref name=Grubbs /&gt; Despite the promise of this polymer in the field of conductive polymers, many of its properties such as instability to air and difficulty with processing have led to avoidance in commercial applications.

Compounds called polyacetylenes also occur in nature, although in this context the term refers to [[polyyne]]s, compounds containing multiple acetylene groups ("poly" meaning ''many''), rather than to chains of [[Olefin fiber|olefin]] groups ("poly" meaning ''polymerization of'').&lt;ref&gt;Minto, Robert E.; Blacklock, Brenda J. “Biosynthesis and function of polyacetylenes and allied natural products” From Progress in Lipid Research 2008, vol. 47, 233–306. {{doi|10.1016/j.plipres.2008.02.002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyacetylene consists of a long chain of [[carbon]] atoms with alternating single and [[double bond]]s between them, each with one [[hydrogen]] atom. The double bonds can have either [[Cis–trans isomerism|''cis'' or ''trans'' geometry]]. The controlled synthesis of each [[isomer]] of the polymer, ''cis''-polyacetylene or ''trans''-polyacetylene,  can be achieved by changing the temperature at which the reaction is conducted. The ''cis'' form of the polymer is thermodynamically less stable than the ''trans'' isomer. Despite the [[conjugated system|conjugated]] nature of the polyacetylene backbone, not all of the carbon–carbon bonds in the material are equal: a distinct single/double alternation exists.&lt;ref name=Norden /&gt; Each hydrogen atom can be replaced by a [[functional group]]. Substituted polyacetylenes tend to be more rigid than saturated polymers.&lt;ref name=Grubbs /&gt; Furthermore, placing different functional groups as substituents on the polymer backbone leads to a twisted [[Conformational isomerism|conformation]] of the polymer chain to interrupt the conjugation.

== History ==

[[Cuprene]] was one of the earliest reported acetylene polymers. Its highly cross-linked nature led to no further studies in the field for quite some time.&lt;ref name=Feast&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feast|first=W.J.|author2=Tsibouklis, J. |author3=Pouwer, K.L. |author4=Groenendaal, L. |author5= Meijer, E.W. |title=Synthesis, processing and material properties of conjugated polymers|journal=Polymer|date=1996|volume=37|issue=22|page=5017|doi=10.1016/0032-3861(96)00439-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linear polyacetylene was first prepared by [[Giulio Natta]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=Saxman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saxon|first=A.M.|author2=Liepins, F. |author3=Aldissi, M. |title=Polyacetylene: Its Synthesis, Doping, and Structure|journal=Prog. Polym. Sci.|date=1985|volume=11|page=57|doi=10.1016/0079-6700(85)90008-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting polyacetylene was linear, of high molecular weight, displayed high crystallinity, and had a regular structure. X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the resulting polyacetylene was ''trans''-polyacetylene.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;  After this first reported synthesis, few chemists were interested in polyacetylene because the product of [[Natta]]’s preparation was an insoluble, air sensitive, and infusible black powder.

The next major development of polyacetylene polymerization was made by [[Hideki Shirakawa]]’s group who were able to prepare silvery films of polyacetylene. They discovered that the polymerization of polyacetylene could be achieved at the surface of a concentrated solution of the catalyst system of [[triethylaluminium|Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al]] and Ti(OBu)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in an inert solvent such as toluene.&lt;ref name=Norden&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norden|first=B|author2=Krutmeijer, E.|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2000: Conductive Polymers|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/advanced-chemistryprize2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel with Shirakawa's studies, [[Alan Heeger]] and [[Alan MacDiarmid]] were studying the metallic properties of [[polythiazyl]] [(SN)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;], a related but inorganic polymer.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=N|title=Twenty-five years of conducting polymers|journal=Chem. Comm.|date=2003|url=http://teaching.ust.hk/~chem328/ChemComm03-1.pdf|doi=10.1039/B210718J |pages=1–4|last2=McDiarmid|first2=Alan|last3=Heeger|first3=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Polythiazyl caught Heeger's interest as a chain-like metallic material, and he collaborated with [[Alan MacDiarmid]] who had previous experience with this material. By the early 1970s, this polymer was known to be [[superconductive]] at low temperatures.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt; Shirakawa, Heeger, and MacDiarmid collaborated on further development of polyacetylene.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;

Upon [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] polyacetylene with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the conductivity increased seven orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name=Norden /&gt;  Similar results were achieved using Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These materials exhibited the largest room temperature conductivity observed for a covalent organic polymer, and this seminal report was key in furthering the development of organic [[conductive polymers]].&lt;ref name=Shirakawa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shirakawa|first=H.|author2=Louis, E.J. |author3=MacDiarmid, A.G. |author4=Chiang, C.K. |author5= Heeger, A.J. |title=Synthesis of Electrically Conducting Organic Polymers: Halogen Derivatives of Polyacetylene, (CH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=J.C.S.

Furthermore, it was found that heat treatment of the catalyst used for polymerization led to films with higher conductivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shirakawa|first=Hideki|title=Synthesis and characterization of highly conducting polyacetylene|journal=Synthetic Metals|date=1995|volume=69|page=3|doi=10.1016/0379-6779(94)02340-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==

=== From acetylene ===
[[File:Ziegler natta scheme for polyacetylene.png|thumb|left|Ziegler–Natta scheme]]
A variety of methods have been developed to synthesize polyacetylene, from pure acetylene and other monomers. One of the most common methods uses a [[Ziegler–Natta catalyst]], such as [[titanium isopropoxide|Ti(O''i''Pr)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[triethylaluminium|Al(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], with gaseous acetylene. This method allows control over the structure and properties of the final polymer by varying temperature and catalyst loading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feast|first=W. J.|author2=Tsibouklis, J. |author3=Pouwer, K. L. |author4=Groenendaal, L. |author5= Meijer, E. W. |title=Synthesis, processing and material properties of conjugated polymers|journal=Polymer|date=1996|volume=37|issue=22|pages=5017–5047|doi=10.1016/0032-3861(96)00439-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanistic studies suggest that this polymerization involves metal insertion into the triple bond of the monomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=T.

By varying the apparatus and catalyst loading, Shirakawa and coworkers were able to synthesize polyacetylene as thin films, rather than insoluble black powders. They obtained these films by coating the walls of a reaction flask under inert conditions with a solution of the[Ziegler–Natta catalyst and adding gaseous acetylene, resulting in immediate formation of a film.&lt;ref name=Ito&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ito, T.|author2=Shirakawa, H.|author3=Ikeda, S.|title=Simultaneous Polymerization and Formation of Polyacetylene Film on the Surface of Concentrated Soluble Ziegler-Type Catalyst Solution|doi=10.1002/pola.1996.854|journal=J. Polymer Science Part A|date=1974|volume=12|issue=13|pages=11–20|bibcode=1996JPoSA..34.2533I}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enkelmann and coworkers further improved polyacetylene synthesis by changing the catalyst to a [[Cobalt(II) nitrate|Co(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[sodium borohydride|NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] system, which was stable to both oxygen and water.&lt;ref name=Feast /&gt;

Polyacetylene can also be produced by [[radiation]] polymerization of acetylene.  Glow-discharge radiation, γ-radiation, and [[ultraviolet]] irradiation have been used. These methods avoid the use of catalysts and solvent, but require low temperatures to produce regular polymers. Gas-phase polymerization typically produces irregular cuprene, whereas liquid-phase polymerization, conducted at −78&amp;nbsp;°C produces linear ''cis''-polyacetylene, and solid-phase polymerization, conducted at still lower temperature, produces ''trans''-polyacetylene.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;

=== Ring-opening metathesis polymerization ===

Polyacetylene can be synthesized by [[ring-opening metathesis polymerization]] (ROMP) from [[cyclooctatetraene]], a material easier to handle than the [[acetylene]] [[monomer]]. This synthetic route also provides a facile method for adding solubilizing groups to the polymer while maintaining the conjugation.&lt;ref name=Grubbs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorman|first=C. B.|author2=Ginsburg, E. J. |author3=Grubbs, R.

Polymers with linear groups such as ''n''-[[octyl]] had high conductivity but low solubility, while highly branched ''tert''-[[butyl]] groups increased solubility but decreased [[conjugated system|conjugation]] due to polymer twisting to avoid [[steric]] crowding. They obtained soluble and conductive polymers with ''sec''-butyl and neopentyl groups, because the [[methylene group|methylene]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) unit directly connected to the polymer reduces steric crowding and prevents twisting.&lt;ref name=Grubbs /&gt;[[File:Modified Grubbs.png|thumb|center|upright 2.5|Grubbs route to polyacetylene]]

=== From precursor polymers ===
[[File:PVC base polyacetylene.png|thumb|300px|Dehydrohalogenation route to polyacetylene]]
Polyacetylene can also be synthesized from precursor polymers. This method enables processing of the polymer before conversion to insoluble polyacetylene. Short, irregular segments of polyacetylene can be obtained by [[dehydrohalogenation]] of [[poly(vinyl chloride)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conducting Polymers|url=http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/local/organic/tutorial/steinke/4yrPolyConduct2003.pdf|work=ch.ic.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal conversion of precursor polymers is a more effective method for synthesizing long polyacetylene chains. In the Durham-precursor route, polymers are prepared by ring-opening metathesis polymerization, and a subsequent heat-induced reverse [[Diels–Alder reaction]] yields the final polymer, as well as a volatile side product.&lt;ref name=Feast /&gt;

== Doping ==

When polyacetylene films are exposed to vapors of electron-accepting compounds ([[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[dopants]]), the [[electrical conductivity]] of the material increases by orders of magnitude over the undoped material.&lt;ref name=Chiang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiang|first=C.K.|author2=Gau, S.C. |author3=Fincher, C.R. |author4=Park, Y.W. |author5=MacDiarmid, A.G. |author6= Heeger, A.J. |title=Polyacetylene, (CH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;: n-type and p-type doping and compensation|journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|date=1978|volume=33|page=18|doi=10.1063/1.90166|bibcode=1978ApPhL..33...18C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[dopants]] include Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. These [[dopants]] act by abstracting an [[electron]] from the polymer chain. The [[Ionic conductivity|conductivity]] of these polymers is believed to be a result of the creation of [[charge-transfer complexes]] between the polymer and [[halogen]].&lt;ref name=Shirakawa /&gt; [[Charge-transfer complex|Charge-transfer]] occurs from the polymer to the acceptor compound; the polyacetylene chain acts as a [[cation]] and the acceptor as an [[anion]]. The “hole” on the polymer backbone is weakly associated with the anionic acceptor by [[Coulomb potential]].&lt;ref name=Chiang /&gt; Polyacetylene doped with ([[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]) [[dopants]] retain their high conductivity even after exposure to air for several days.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;

Electron-donating ([[n-type semiconductor|n-type]]) [[dopants]] can also be used to create conductive polyacetylene. n-Type [[dopants]] for polyacetylene include lithium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt; As with [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[dopants]], [[charge-transfer complexes]] are created, where the polymer backbone is [[anionic]] and the donor is [[cationic]]. The increase in conductivity upon treatment with an [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] [[dopant]] is not as significant as those achieved upon treatment with a [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[dopant]]. Polyacetylene chains doped with [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] [[dopants]] are extremely sensitive to air and moisture.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;

The conductivity of polyacetylene depends on structure and doping. Undoped ''trans''-polyacetylene films have a conductivity of 4.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while ''cis''-polyacetylene has a lower conductivity of 1.7×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Doping with bromine causes an increase in conductivity to 0.5 Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while a higher conductivity of 38 Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained through doping with iodine.&lt;ref name=Shirakawa/&gt; Doping of either ''cis''- or ''trans''-polyacetylene leads to an increase in their conductivities. Doped ''cis''-polyacetylene films usually have conductivities two or three times greater than doped ''trans''-polyacetylene even though the parent film has lower conductivity.&lt;ref name="McDiarmiad synthetic metals" /&gt;

== Properties ==
The structure of polyacetylene films have been examined by both [[infrared]]&lt;ref name="Shirikawa IR"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shirakawa, H. S.|author2=Ito, T. S.|author3=Ikeda, S.|title=Infrared Spectroscopy of Poly(acetylene)|doi=10.1295/polymj.2.231|journal=Polym. J.|date=1971|volume=2|issue=2|pages=231–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]]&lt;ref name="Shirakawa Raman"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shirakawa, H. S.|author2=Ito, T. S.|author3=Ikeda, S.|title=Raman Scattering and Electronic Spectra of Poly(acetylene)|journal=Polym. J.|date=1973|volume=4|issue=4|pages=460–462|doi=10.1295/polymj.4.460}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[spectroscopy]], and found that structure depends on synthetic conditions. When the synthesis is performed below −78&amp;nbsp;°C, the ''cis'' form predominates, while above 150&amp;nbsp;°C the ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'' form is favored. At room temperature, the polymerization yields a ratio of 60:40 ''cis'':''trans''.&lt;ref name="McDiarmiad synthetic metals" /&gt;  Films containing the ''cis'' form appear coppery, while the ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'' form is silvery.&lt;ref name="McDiarmiad synthetic metals" /&gt; Films of ''cis''-polyacetylene are very flexible and can be readily stretched, while ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]''-polyacetylene is much more brittle. 
	
The synthesis and processing of polyacetylene films affects the properties. Increasing the catalyst ratio creates thicker films with a greater draw ratio, allowing them to be stretched further.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;  Lower catalyst loadings leads to the formation of dark red [[gels]], which can be converted to films by cutting and pressing between glass plates.&lt;ref name="McDiarmiad synthetic metals"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDiarmid|first=A|author2=Heeger, A.|title=Organic Metals and Semiconductors: The Chemistry of Polyacetylene (CH&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) and its Derivatives|journal=Synthetic Metals|date=1979|volume=1|issue=101–118|pages=101|doi=10.1016/0379-6779(80)90002-8 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA087102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A foam-like material can be obtained from the gel by displacing the [[solvent]] with [[benzene]], then freezing and subliming the benzene.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;  Polyacetylene has a bulk density of 0.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while density of the foam is significantly lower, at 0.02–0.04&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;  The morphology consists of [[fibrils]], with an average width of 200&amp;nbsp;Å. These fibrils form an irregular, web-like network, with some [[cross-link]]ing between chains.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt; The insolubility of polyacetylene makes it difficult to characterize this material and to determine the extent of cross-linking in the material.

[[File:Oxidation of Polyacetylene.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Products of oxidation of polyacetylene]]

For applications, polyacetylenes suffer from many drawbacks. They are insoluble in solvents, making it essentially impossible to process the material. While both ''cis'' and ''trans''-polyacetylene show high thermal stability,&lt;ref name="McDiarmiad synthetic metals" /&gt; exposure to air causes a large decrease in the flexibility and conductivity.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;  When polyacetylene is exposed to air, oxidation of the backbone by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occurs. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] shows formation of [[carbonyl]] groups, [[epoxides]], and [[peroxides]].&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Will|first=F.G.|author2=D.W. McKee|title=Thermal Oxidation of Polyacetylene|journal=Journal of Polymer Science|date=1983|volume=21|issue=12|pages=3479–3492|doi=10.1002/pol.1983.170211210|bibcode=1983JPoSA..21.3479W}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Coating with [[polyethylene]] or wax can slow the [[oxidation]] temporarily, while coating with glass increases stability indefinitely.&lt;ref name=Saxman /&gt;

==Applications==
Polyacetylene has no commercial applications, although the discovery of polyacetylene as a conductive organic polymer led to many developments in materials science. Conducting polymers are of interest for solution-processing for film-forming conductive polymers.&lt;ref name=Norden /&gt; Therefore, attention has shifted to other [[conductive polymers]] for application purposes including [[polythiophene]] and [[polyaniline]].

==Basic prototype categories==
Prototypes explore different aspects of an intended design: 
* A '''Proof-of-Principle Prototype''' serves to verify some key functional aspects of the intended design, but usually does not have all the functionality of the final product.
* A '''Working Prototype''' represents all or nearly all of the functionality of the final product.
* A '''Visual Prototype''' represents the size and appearance, but not the functionality, of the intended design. A '''Form Study Prototype''' is a preliminary type of visual prototype in which the geometric features of a design are emphasized, with less concern for color, texture, or other aspects of the final appearance.
* A '''User Experience Prototype''' represents enough of the appearance and function of the product  that it can be used for [[User Research|user research]].
* A '''Functional Prototype''' captures both function and appearance of the intended design, though it may be created with different techniques and even different scale from final design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Advanced Ceramics: Materials, Applications, Processing, and Properties|last = |first = |publisher = Academic Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 491|editor-last = Somiya|editor-first = Shigeyuki|edition = 2nd|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tdx7lS4fO9wC&amp;pg=PA491&amp;lpg=PA491&amp;dq=form+study+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OZl31eFQ7P&amp;sig=Zq7WjZOPAYAbCKNDOHytLlhxuYg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgKahUKEwjjpYv_ydnGAhUGOT4KHUrpAEw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/engineering-consulting/general-prototypes|title = Prototypes: General Categories|date = |accessdate = 13 July 2015|website = ThomasNet|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[paper prototype|'''Paper Prototype''']] is a printed or hand-drawn representation of the user interface of a software product. Such prototypes are commonly used for early testing of a software design, and can be part of a  [[software walkthrough]] to confirm design decisions before more costly levels of design effort are expended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cs.brown.edu/courses/uxisp/slides/prototyping.pptx|title=Prototyping|website=Brown University - User Experience, Independent Study Project|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in creating a prototype vs. a final product==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
In general, the creation of prototypes will differ from creation of the final product in some fundamental ways:

* '''Material''': The materials that will be used in a final product may be expensive or difficult to fabricate, so prototypes may be made from different materials than the final product. In some cases, the final production materials may still be undergoing development themselves and not yet available for use in a prototype. 
* '''Process''': Mass-production processes are often unsuitable for making a small number of parts, so prototypes may be made using different fabrication processes than the final product. For example, a final product that will be made by plastic injection molding will require expensive custom tooling, so a prototype for this product may be fabricated by machining or stereolithography instead. Differences in fabrication process may lead to differences in the appearance of the prototype as compared to the final product. 
* '''Verification''':  The final product may be subject to a number of quality assurance tests to verify conformance with drawings or specifications. These tests may involve custom inspection fixtures, statistical sampling methods, and other techniques appropriate for ongoing production of a large quantity of the final product. Prototypes are generally made with much closer individual inspection and the assumption that some adjustment or rework will be part of the fabrication process. Prototypes may also be exempted from some requirements that will apply to the final product.

Engineers and prototype specialists attempt to minimize the impact of these differences on the intended role for the prototype. For example, if a visual prototype is not able to use the same materials as the final product, they will attempt to substitute materials with properties that closely simulate the intended final materials.

==Characteristics and limitations of prototypes==
[[Image:PL Beskid106 car.jpg|thumb|right|A prototype of the [[Poland|Polish]] economy [[hatchback]] [[car]] [[Beskid (car)|Beskid 106]] designed in the 1980s.]]
Engineers and prototyping specialists seek to understand the limitations of prototypes to exactly simulate the characteristics of their intended design.

It is important to realize that by their very definition, prototypes will represent some compromise from the final production design.  Due to differences in materials, processes and design fidelity, it is possible that a prototype may fail to perform acceptably whereas the production design may have been sound.  A counter-intuitive idea is that prototypes may actually perform acceptably whereas the production design may be flawed since prototyping materials and processes may occasionally outperform their production counterparts.

In general, it can be expected that individual prototype costs will be substantially greater than the final production costs due to inefficiencies in materials and processes. Prototypes are also used to revise the design for the purposes of reducing costs through optimization and refinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gschwind|first=M.|last2=Salapura|first2=V.|last3=Maurer|first3=D.|date=April 2001|title=FPGA prototyping of a RISC processor core for embedded applications|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/924027/?reload=true|journal=IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems|volume=9|issue=2|pages=241–250|doi=10.1109/92.924027|issn=1063-8210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to use prototype testing to reduce the risk that a design may not perform as intended, however prototypes generally cannot eliminate all risk.  There are pragmatic and practical limitations to the ability of a prototype to match the intended final performance of the product and some allowances and engineering judgement are often required before moving forward with a production design.

Building the full design is often expensive and can be time-consuming, especially when repeated several times—building the full design, figuring out what the problems are and how to solve them, then building another full design. As an alternative, [[rapid prototyping]] or [[rapid application development]] techniques are used for the initial prototypes, which implement part, but not all, of the complete design. This allows designers and manufacturers to rapidly and inexpensively test the parts of the design that are most likely to have problems, solve those problems, and then build the full design.

This [[counter-intuitive]] idea—that the quickest way to build something is, first to build something else—is shared by [[scaffolding]] and the telescope rule.

==Engineering sciences==
In technology research, a [[technology demonstrator]] is a prototype serving as [[proof-of-concept]] and demonstration model for a new technology or future product, proving its viability and illustrating conceivable applications.

In large development projects, a [[testbed]] is a platform and prototype development environment for rigorous experimentation and testing of new technologies, components, scientific theories and computational tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEpAYyIRlbEC|title=Designing for Networked Communications: Strategies and Development: Strategies and Development|last=Simon|first=Heilesen|date=2007-01-31|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|isbn=9781599040714|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With recent advances in computer modeling it is becoming practical to eliminate the creation of a physical prototype (except possibly at greatly reduced scales for promotional purposes), instead modeling all aspects of the final product as a [[computer model]]. An example of such a development can be seen in [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]], in which the first full sized physical realization is made on the series production line. Computer modeling is now being extensively used in automotive design, both for form (in the [[Automotive design|styling and aerodynamics]] of the vehicle) and in function—especially for improving vehicle [[crashworthiness]] and in weight reduction to improve mileage.

===Mechanical and electrical engineering===

The most common use of the word prototype is a functional, although experimental, version of a non-military machine (e.g., automobiles, domestic appliances, consumer electronics) whose designers would like to have built by [[mass production]] means, as opposed to a [[mockup]], which is an inert representation of a machine's appearance, often made of some non-durable substance.

An electronics designer often builds the first prototype from [[breadboard]] or [[stripboard]] or [[perfboard]], typically using "DIP" packages.

However, more and more often the first functional prototype is built on a "prototype [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]" almost identical to the production PCB, as PCB manufacturing prices fall and as many components are not available in [[Dual in-line package|DIP]] packages, but only available in [[Surface-mount technology|SMT]] packages optimized for placing on a PCB.

Builders of military machines and aviation prefer the terms "experimental" and "service test".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=upHlAAAAMAAJ|title=International Military Digest|last=Willcox|first=Cornélis De Witt|last2=Stuart|first2=Edwin Roy|date=1918|publisher=Cumulative digest corporation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronics prototyping ===
[[File:Protoboard circuito multivibradores.jpg|thumb|A simple electronic circuit prototype on a breadboard.]]
[[File:Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype System, Mark V, Paris, 2000 - Philippe Binant Archives.jpg|thumb|Example of prototype in optoelectronics ([[Texas Instruments]], DLP Cinema Prototype System).]]

In [[electronics]], prototyping means building an actual circuit to a theoretical design to verify that it works, and to provide a physical platform for debugging it if it does not. The prototype is often constructed using techniques such as [[wire wrap]]ping or using [[veroboard]] or [[breadboard]], with the result being a circuit that is electrically identical to the design but not physically identical to the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wellpcb.com/news/pcb-rapid-prototype|title=PCB Rapid Prototype|last=|first=|date=|website=www.wellpcb.com|publisher=WellPCB|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open-source tools like [[Fritzing]] exist to document electronic prototypes (especially the breadboard-based ones) and move toward physical production. Prototyping platforms such as [[Arduino]] also simplify the task of programming and interacting with a [[microcontroller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-b10XVvN44C|title=Practical AVR Microcontrollers: Games, Gadgets, and Home Automation with the Microcontroller Used in the Arduino|last=Trevennor|first=Alan|date=2012-10-17|publisher=Apress|isbn=9781430244462|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer can choose to deploy their invention as-is using the prototyping platform, or replace it with only the microcontroller chip and the circuitry that is relevant to their product.

A technician can quickly build a prototype (and make additions and modifications) using these techniques, but for volume production it is much faster and usually cheaper to mass-produce custom [[printed circuit board]]s than to produce these other kinds of prototype boards. The proliferation of quick-turn PCB fabrication and assembly companies has enabled the concepts of rapid prototyping to be applied to electronic circuit design. It is now possible, even with the smallest passive components and largest fine-pitch packages, to have boards fabricated, assembled, and even tested in a matter of days.

==Computer programming/computer science==
{{Main|Software prototyping|Software release cycle}}

In many [[programming language]]s, a ''[[function prototype]]'' is the [[declaration (computer science)|declaration]] of a [[subroutine]] or function (and should not be confused with software prototyping). This term is rather [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]]-specific; other terms for this notion are ''signature'', ''type'' and ''interface''.  In [[prototype-based programming]] (a form of [[object-oriented programming]]), new objects are produced by cloning existing objects, which are called prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=5.5 Function Prototypes| url= http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V40F_HTML/AQTLTBTE/DOCU_055.HTM| work= HP | accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may also refer to the [[Prototype Javascript Framework]].

Additionally, the term may refer to the [[Prototype pattern|prototype]] design pattern.

Prototype software is often referred to as alpha grade, meaning it is the first version to run.  Often only a few functions are implemented, the primary focus of the alpha is to have a functional base code on to which features may be added.  Once alpha grade software has most of the required features integrated into it, it becomes beta software for testing of the entire software and to adjust the program to respond correctly during situations unforeseen during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title= Alpha Version Definition | url= https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,1233,t=alpha+version&amp;i=37675,00.asp| work= PC Magazine | accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the end users may not be able to provide a complete set of application objectives, detailed input, processing, or output requirements in the initial stage. After the user evaluation, another prototype will be built based on feedback from users, and again the cycle returns to customer evaluation. The cycle starts by listening to the user, followed by building or revising a mock-up, and letting the user test the [[mock-up]], then back. There is now a new generation of tools called [[Application Simulation Software]] which help quickly simulate application before their development.

[[Extreme programming]] uses [[iterative design]] to gradually add one feature at a time to the initial prototype.

Continuous learning approaches within organizations or businesses may also use the concept of business or process prototypes through software models.

=== Data prototyping ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
A ''data prototype'' is a form of ''functional ''or ''working'' prototype. The justification for its creation is usually a [[data migration]], [[data integration]] or application implementation project and the raw materials used as input are an instance of all the relevant data which exists at the start of the project.

The objectives of ''data prototyping'' are to produce: 
* A set of data cleansing and transformation rules which have been ''seen'' to produce data which is all fit for purpose.
* A dataset which is the result of those rules being applied to an instance of the relevant raw (source) data.
To achieve this, a data architect uses a graphical interface to interactively develop and execute transformation and cleansing rules using raw data. The resultant data is then evaluated and the rules refined. Beyond the obvious visual checking of the data ''on-screen'' by the data architect, the usual evaluation and validation approaches  are to use [[Data profiling]] software and then to insert the resultant data into a test version of the target application and trial its use.

==Scale modeling==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[4mm scale]] (and possibly other Scale modelling articles) --&gt;
[[File:NACA Ames 7x10 Wind Tunnel - GPN-2000-001822.jpg|thumb|A scale model of an airplane in a wind tunnel for testing.]]
In the field of [[scale model]]ing (which includes [[model railroad]]ing, vehicle modeling, [[Model aircraft#Flying model aircraft|airplane modeling]], military modeling, etc.), a prototype is the real-world basis or source for a scale model—such as the real [[EMD GP38-2]] locomotive—which is the prototype of [[Athearn]]'s (among other manufacturers) locomotive model.  Technically, any non-living object can serve as a prototype for a model, including structures, equipment, and appliances, and so on, but generally prototypes have come to mean full-size real-world vehicles including automobiles (the prototype 1957 Chevy has spawned many models), military equipment (such as M4 Shermans, a favorite among US Military modelers), railroad equipment, motor trucks, motorcycles, and space-ships (real-world such as Apollo/Saturn Vs, or the ISS).
As of 2014, basic rapid prototype machines (such as [[3D printers]]) cost about $2,000, but larger and more precise machines can cost as much as $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/technology-and-science/3d-printing-challenges-opportunities-international-relations/p31709 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028064336/http://www.cfr.org/technology-and-science/3d-printing-challenges-opportunities-international-relations/p31709 |archivedate=2013-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metrology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Kilogram]] --&gt;
In the science and practice of [[metrology]], a '''prototype''' is a human-made object that is used as '''''the''''' standard of [[measurement]] of some [[physical quantity]] to base all measurement of that physical quantity against.  Sometimes this standard object is called an '''artifact'''.  In the [[International System of Units]] ('''SI'''), the only prototype remaining in current use is the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]],  a solid [[platinum]]-[[iridium]] cylinder kept at the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) in [[Sèvres]] [[France]] (a suburb of [[Paris]]) that by [[definition]] is the mass of exactly one [[kilogram]].  Copies of this prototype are fashioned and issued to many nations to represent the national standard of the kilogram and are periodically compared to the Paris prototype.

Until 1960, the [[metre|meter]] was defined by a platinum-iridium prototype bar with two scratch marks on it (that were, by definition, spaced apart by one meter), the [[International Prototype Metre]], and in 1983  the meter was redefined to be the distance in [[free space]] covered by [[speed of light|light]] in 1/299,792,458 of a [[second]] (thus ''defining'' the speed of light to be 299,792,458 meters per second).

It is widely believed that the kilogram prototype standard will be replaced. There are two likely replacements. One is a definition of the kilogram that will define another [[physical constant]] (likely either [[Planck's constant]] or the [[elementary charge]]) to a defined numerical value, thus obviating the need for the prototype and removing the possibility of the prototype (and thus the standard and definition of the kilogram) changing very slightly over the years because of loss or gain of atoms. The other definition is using a system that finds the amount of force needed to counteract the pull of earth's gravity on a one kilogram artifact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/23/worlds-roundest-object-perfect-sphere_n_3804690.html]. HuffingtonPost.com. Huffington Post. Retrieved October 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural sciences==
In many sciences, from pathology to taxonomy, prototype refers to a disease, species, etc. which sets a good example for the whole category. In Biology, prototype is the ancestral or primitive form of a species or other group; an archetype.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/prototype prototype]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved December 07, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Senegal bichir]] is regarded as the prototypes of its genus, ''[[Polypterus]]''.

==History==
Following the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], in June 2014, Ukrainian politician and business magnate [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi]] suggested that Ukraine should build a wall along the border with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Heritage.

Jun 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2014 Ukrainian Prime Minister [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] announced Ukraine would strengthen its border with Russia and called this "Project Wall".&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.itar-tass.com/world/755645 Ukraine’s Wall project along border with Russia monument to human stupidity — CSTO SecGen], [[Russian News Agency "TASS"]] ( October 21, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The command of Ukraine's anti-terrorist forces stated that "Two defense lines have been planned, and their main goal is to prevent the infiltration by the adversary into the territory of Ukraine".&lt;ref&gt;Anna Dolgov.

[[File:SWOT en.svg|thumb|A SWOT analysis, with its four elements in a 2×2 matrix.]]
'''SWOT analysis''' (or '''SWOT matrix''') is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to  [[business]] competition or project planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWOT Analysis: Discover New Opportunities, Manage and Eliminate Threats|url=http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=en|date=1006|website=www.mindtools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as the tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management|last=Dess|first=Gregory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259927621|location=United States|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strengths and weakness are frequently internally-related, while opportunities and threats commonly focus on the external environment. The name is an acronym for the four parameters the technique examines:
* '''''S'''trengths'': characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.
* '''''W'''eaknesses'': characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others.
* '''''O'''pportunities'': elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage.
* '''''T'''hreats'':  elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project.
The degree to which the internal environment of the firm matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of [[strategic fit]]. Identification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective. First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is ''not'' attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.

Some authors credit SWOT to [[Albert S. Humphrey|Albert Humphrey]], who led a convention at the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) in the 1960s and 1970s using data from [[Fortune 500]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/brochures/dec-05.pdf|title=SWOT Analysis for Management Consulting|last=Humphrey|first=Albert|date=December 2005|work=SRI Alumni Newsletter|publisher=[[SRI International]]|authorlink=Albert S. Humphrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamplc.com/Humphsprofile.htm|title=Albert Humphrey The "Father" of TAM|publisher=TAM UK|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Humphrey himself did not claim the creation of SWOT, and the origins remain obscure.

== Internal and external factors ==
SWOT analysis aims to identify the key internal and external factors seen as important to achieving an objective. SWOT analysis groups key pieces of information into two main categories:

# Internal factors — the ''strengths'' and ''weaknesses'' internal to the organization
# External factors — the ''opportunities'' and ''threats'' presented by the environment external to the organization

Analysis may view the internal factors as strengths or as weaknesses depending upon their effect on the organization's objectives.  What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses (distractions, competition) for another objective.  The factors may include all of the [[marketing mix|4Ps]] as well as [[personnel]], [[finance]], [[manufacturing]] capabilities, and so on.

The external factors may include [[macroeconomic]] matters, [[technological change]], [[legislation]], and sociocultural changes, as well as changes in the marketplace or in competitive position.  The results are often presented in the form of a [[Table (information)|matrix]].

SWOT analysis is just one method of [[categorization]] and has its own weaknesses. For example, it may tend to persuade its users to compile lists rather than to think about actual important factors in achieving objectives. It also presents the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.

It is prudent not to eliminate any candidate SWOT entry too quickly. The importance of individual SWOTs will be revealed by the value of the strategies they generate.  A SWOT item that produces valuable strategies is important.  A SWOT item that generates no strategies is not important.

== Use ==
The usefulness of SWOT analysis is not limited to [[For-profit corporation|profit-seeking organizations]].  SWOT analysis may be used in any decision-making situation when a desired end-state (objective) is defined.  Examples include [[non-profit organizations]], governmental units, and individuals. SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning and preventive [[crisis management]]. SWOT analysis may also be used in creating a recommendation during a [[viability study]]/survey.

=== Strategy building ===
SWOT analysis can be used effectively to build organizational or personal strategy.  Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identification of internal and external factors (using the popular 2x2 matrix), selection and evaluation of the most important factors, and identification of relations existing between internal and external features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Martin |last2=Wijetilaka |first2=Shehan |date=26 February 2015 |title=5 tips to grow your start-up using SWOT analysis |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/entrepreneurs/tips_to_grow_your_start_up_using_eQEF8Pm8l2Q9hME9TBXvVL |location=Sydney |access-date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an ''aggressive'' strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a potential warning and advice for using a ''defensive'' strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osita |first=Christian |last2=Onyebuchi |first2=Idoko |last3=Justina |first3=Nzekwe |date=31 January 2014 |title=Organization's stability and productivity: the role of SWOT analysis |url=http://journalijiar.com/uploads/2014-10-02_231409_710.pdf |publisher=International Journal of Innovative and Applied Research (2014) |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=23–32 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matching and converting ===
One way of using SWOT is matching and converting. Matching is used to find [[competitive advantage]] by matching the strengths to opportunities. Another tactic is to convert weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to find new markets. If the threats or weaknesses cannot be converted, a company should try to minimize or avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shsu.edu/~mkt_ssm/mkt570/Chap04.ppt See for instance: Mehta, S. (2000) ''Marketing Strategy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate planning ===
As part of the development of strategies and plans to enable the organization to achieve its objectives, that organization will use a systematic/rigorous process known as [[corporate planning]]. SWOT alongside [[PEST analysis|PEST]]/[[PESTLE]] can be used as a basis for the analysis of business and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong. M. A handbook of Human Resource Management Practice (10th edition) 2006, Kogan Page, London {{ISBN|0-7494-4631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Set objectives — defining what the organization is going to do
* Environmental scanning
** Internal appraisals of the organization's SWOT — this needs to include an assessment of the present situation as well as a portfolio of products/services and an analysis of the product/service lifecycle
* Analysis of existing strategies — this should determine relevance from the results of an internal/external appraisal. This may include [[gap analysis]] of environmental factors
* Strategic Issues defined — key factors in the development of a corporate plan that the organization must address
* Develop new/revised strategies — revised analysis of strategic issues may mean the objectives need to change
* Establish [[critical success factor]]s — the achievement of objectives and strategy implementation
* Preparation of operational, resource, projects plans for strategy implementation
* Monitoring all results — mapping against plans, taking corrective action, which may mean amending objectives/strategies&lt;ref name=arms&gt;Armstrong.M  Management Processes and Functions, 1996, London CIPD  {{ISBN|0-85292-438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===
{{Main|Marketing management}}
In many competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing especially on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of [[vertical integration]], historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often finds it necessary to invest in research to collect the data required to perform accurate marketing analysis. Accordingly, management often conducts market research (alternately marketing research) to obtain this information. Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:
* Qualitative marketing research such as focus groups
* Quantitative marketing research such as statistical surveys
* Experimental techniques such as test markets
* Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation
* Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.

Below is an example SWOT analysis of a market position of a small management consultancy with specialism in HRM.&lt;ref name=arms /&gt;

== In community organization ==
The SWOT analysis has been used in community work as a tool to identify positive and negative factors within organizations, communities, and the broader society that promote or inhibit successful implementation of social services and social change efforts.&lt;ref name="community tool box"&gt;{{cite web |title=Community Toolbox: Section 14. SWOT analysis |url=http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/assessment/assessing-community-needs-and-resources/swot-analysis/main |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a preliminary resource, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a community served by a nonprofit or community organization.&lt;ref name="social work" /&gt; This organizing tool is best used in collaboration with community workers and/or community members before developing goals and objectives for a program design or implementing an organizing strategy. The SWOT analysis is a part of the planning for social change process and will not provide a strategic plan if used by itself.  After a SWOT analysis is completed, a social change organization can turn the SWOT list into a series of recommendations to consider before developing a strategic plan.&lt;ref name="our community"&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Community |url=https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/boards/boards_article.jsp?articleId=1369 |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SWOT Analysis ssw 1.png|thumb|one example of a SWOT Analysis used in community organizing]]
[[File:SWOT Analysis ssw 2.png|thumb|A simple SWOT Analysis used in Community Organizing]]

'''Strengths and weaknesses''' (''internal factors within an organization''):&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Human resources — staff, volunteers, board members, target population
* Physical resources — your location, building, equipment
* Financial — grants, funding agencies, other sources of income
* Activities and processes — programs you run, systems you employ
* Past experiences — building blocks for learning and success, your reputation in the community

'''Opportunities and threats''' (''external factors stemming from community or societal forces''):&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Future trends in your field or the culture
* The economy — local, national, or international
* Funding sources — foundations, donors, legislatures
* Demographics — changes in the age, race, gender, culture of those you serve or in your area
* The physical environment —is your building in a growing part of town? Is the bus company cutting routes?
* Legislation — do new federal requirements make your job harder...or easier?
* Local, national, or international events

Although the SWOT analysis was originally designed as an organizational method for business and industries, it has been replicated in various community work as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat internal and external opposition.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; The SWOT analysis is necessary to provide direction to the next stages of the change process.&lt;ref name=BOOK&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkenmaier |first=Julie |title=The Practice of Generalist Social Work |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of Social Work practice.

=== Application in community organization ===

As mentioned [[SWOT analysis#top|above]], SWOT can be crucial to determining the success of a project, while factoring in funding, as well as accessibility and logic. Often, a city will spend a year weighing the [[Risk-benefit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Pittsburg, California]] tried this out recently with the BART program. Citation: (Document). Pittsburg City, California, www.ci.pittsburg.ca.us/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Analysis of Urmia, Iran |url=http://rrrs.reviste.ubbcluj.ro/arhive/Artpdf/v10n22014/RRRS10220145.pdf |website=Reviste}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a project before they even vote on it.
==== Elements to consider ====
Elements to consider in a SWOT analysis include understanding the community that a particular organization is working with. This can be done via public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews. Data collection will help inform the community members and workers when developing the SWOT analysis. A needs and assets assessment is tooling that can be used to identify the needs and existing resources of the community. When these assessments are done and data has been collected, an analysis of the community can be made that informs the SWOT analysis.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

==== Steps for implementation ====
A SWOT analysis is best developed in a group setting such as a work or community meeting. A facilitator can conduct the meeting by first explaining what a SWOT analysis is as well as identifying the meaning of each term.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

One way of facilitating the development of a SWOT analysis includes developing an example SWOT with the larger group then separating each group into smaller teams to present to the larger group after set amount of time.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; This allows for individuals, who may be silenced in a larger group setting, to contribute. Once the allotted time is up, the facilitator may record all the factors of each group onto a large document such as a poster board, and then the large group,  as a collective, can go work through each of the threats and weaknesses to explore options that may be used to combat negative forces with the strengths and opportunities present within the organization and community.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; A SWOT meeting allows  participants to creatively brainstorm, identify obstacles, and possibly strategize solutions/way forward to these limitations.

==== When to use SWOT analysis ====
The uses of a SWOT analysis by a community organization are as follows: to   organize information, provide insight into barriers&lt;ref name="use and misuse"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chermack |first=Thomas J. |author2=Bernadette K. Kasshanna |title=The Use of and Misuse of SWOT analysis and implications for HRD professionals |journal=Human Resource Development International |date=December 2007 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=383–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that may be present while engaging in social change processes, and identify strengths available that can be activated to counteract these barriers.

''A SWOT analysis can be used to:''
* Explore new solutions to problems &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Identify barriers that will limit goals/objectives &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Decide on direction that will be most effective &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Reveal possibilities and limitations for change&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* To revise plans to best navigate systems, communities, and organizations
* As a brainstorming and recording device as a means of communication&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;
* To enhance "credibility of interpretation" to be used in presentation to leaders or key supporters.&lt;ref name="social work"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westhues |first=Anne |author2=Jean Lafrance |author3=Glen Schmidt |title=A SWOT analysis of social work education in Canada |journal=Social Work Education: The International Journal |year=2001 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=35–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits and advantages ===
The SWOT analysis in social work practice framework is beneficial because it helps organizations decide whether or not an objective is obtainable and therefore enables organizations to set achievable goals, objectives, and steps to further the social change or community development effort.&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;{{cite web |last=Quincy |first=Ronald |title=SWOT Analysis: Raising capacity of your organization |url=http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/Libraries/Huamin/Brochure_2.sflb |publisher=Rutgers School of Social Work |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417010302/http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/libraries/huamin/brochure_2.sflb |archivedate=2016-04-17 |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables organizers to take visions and produce practical and efficient outcomes that effect long-lasting change, and it helps organizations gather meaningful information to maximize their potential.&lt;ref name="benefits" /&gt; Completing a SWOT analysis is a useful process regarding the consideration of key organizational priorities, such as gender and cultural diversity and fundraising objectives.&lt;ref name="change agency"&gt;{{cite web |title=Campaigners Toolkit: Strategy |publisher=The Change Agency |url=http://www.thechangeagency.org/campaigners-toolkit/training-resources/strategy/ |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Some findings from Menon et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Menon, A. |title=Antecedents and Consequences of Marketing Strategy Making |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=63 |pages=18–40 |year=1999 |doi=10.2307/1251943 |jstor=1251943 |issue=2 |publisher=American Marketing Association |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hill and Westbrook (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hill, T. &amp; R. Westbrook |title=SWOT Analysis: It’s Time for a Product Recall |journal=Long Range Planning |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=46–52 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0024-6301(96)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that SWOT may harm performance and that "no-one subsequently used the outputs within the later stages of the strategy". 

Other critiques include the misuse of the SWOT analysis as a technique that can be quickly designed without critical thought leading to a misrepresentation of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within an organization's internal and external surroundings.&lt;ref name="SWOT does not need to be recalled"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=Adam |title=SWOT does not need to be recalled: It needs to be enhanced |journal=Swineburne University of Technology |year=2000 |url=http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/2000/swot1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm becomes preoccupied with a single strength, such as cost control, they can neglect their weaknesses, such as product quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another limitation includes the development of a SWOT analysis simply to defend previously decided goals and objectives. This misuse leads to limitations on brainstorming possibilities and "real" identification of barriers. This misuse also places the organization’s interest above the well-being of the community. Further, a SWOT analysis should be developed as a collaborative with a variety of contributions made by participants including community members. The design of a SWOT analysis by one or two community workers is limiting to the realities of the forces, specifically external factors, and devalues the possible contributions of community members.&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;

Overall, managers should remember that SWOT is a starting point for discussion and cannot, in itself, show managers how to achieve a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because the SWOT analysis is a snapshot of the firm at a particular moment in time, the analysis might obscure the fact that both the internal and external environment are rapidly changing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The SVOR alternative ==

In project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements at play in a given project:&lt;ref&gt;Mesly, Olivier (2017). ''Project feasibility – Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY:Taylor and Francis, CRC Press, 546 pages,  9 {{ISBN|9781498757911}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Forces !! Internal !! Mathematical link !! External
|-
| '''Positive''' || Total Forces || Total Forces given constraints = Infrastructures / Opportunities || Opportunities
|-
| '''Mathematical link''' || Vulnerabilities given constraints = 1 / Total Forces  || constant ''k'' || Opportunities  given constraints = 1 / Risks
|-
| '''Negative''' || Vulnerabilities || Risks given constraints = ''k'' / Vulnerabilities || Risks
|}
Constraints consist of: calendar of tasks and activities, costs, and norms of quality. The "''k''" constant varies with each project (for example, it may be valued at 1.3).{{cn|date=February 2018}}{{efn|Best source I could find is https://ceopedia.org/index.php/SWOT_analysis but seems unrelated.}}

== SWOT analysis in popular culture ==
=== Ads ===
Many reports have been published about the use of SWOT by real life companies, and how the idea is spreading.{{which|date=October 2018}} [[Coca-Cola (company)|Coca-Cola]] has used this in their television ads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Highlights/The_Coca-Cola_Company__A_Short_SWOT_Analysis.aspx#.Wo36ULeov4g|title=Value Line - The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research|publisher=Value Line Publishing|website=www.valueline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to effectively target a customer, such as appeal to senses.

=== Television shows ===
In the ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'' episode "Homicide" (Season 2, Episode 6), Jared Dunn ([[Zach Woods]]) introduces the Pied Piper team to SWOT analysis. Later in that episode Dinesh ([[Kumail Nanjiani]]) and Gilfoyle ([[Martin Starr]]) employ the method when deciding whether or not to inform a stunt driver that the calculations for his upcoming jump were performed incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley/season-02/6-homicide/synopsis|website=HBO|title=Synopsis: ''Silicon Valley'' - 'Homicide'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Security Now!''''' is a weekly [[podcast]] hosted by [[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]] and [[Leo Laporte]]. It was the second show to premiere on the [[TWiT.tv|TWiT Network]], launching in summer 2005. The first episode, “As the Worm Turns”, was released on August 19, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Now! Episode Archive 2005 |url=https://www.grc.com/sn/past/2005.htm|date=August 19, 2005|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Security Now!'' consists of a discussion between Gibson and Laporte on issues of [[computer security]] and, conversely, [[computer insecurity|insecurity]]. Covered topics have included security [[security vulnerability|vulnerabilities]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]s, [[password]] security, [[spyware]], [[rootkit]]s, [[Wi-Fi]], [[virtual private network]]s, and [[virtual machine]]s.

==Podcast feed==
''Security Now!'' is distributed via its main podcast [[RSS (file format)|RSS feed]] and on the GRC ''Security Now!'' page. In addition to audio, text transcriptions are published, along with Gibson distributing a low-bandwidth 16 kbit/s version of the show on his own for those with low-bandwidth sources such as satellite internet or dial-up.

The podcast runs for approximately two hours, typically starting with security news. Then Gibson reads a testimonial for his software [[SpinRite]]. The remainder of the show is spent on a particular theme. During the show some advertisements for 3rd party commercial products or services are read out, by co-host Leo Laporte.

Bi-weekly "Mailbag" episodes answer questions and respond to feedback submitted by listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.grc.com/sn/past/2007.htm#102| title = First Mailbag Episode| accessdate = 2007-08-03| author = Steve Gibson with Leo Laporte| quote = Security Now!: 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
In August 2007, ''Security Now!'' won in the People's Choice [[Podcast Awards]] Technology/Science category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.podcastingnews.com/2007/08/16/peoples-choice-podcast-award-winners-announced/&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, ''Security Now!'' ranked fourth in the "Top 40" of all podcasts listened to via the [[Juice (aggregator)|PodNova]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Windows Metafile controversy==
{{further|Windows Metafile vulnerability}}
In January 2006 Steve Gibson accused [[Microsoft]] of intentionally putting a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] into the [[Windows Metafile]] processing code in [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]]. Gibson claimed that while [[reverse engineering]] the Windows Metafile format, he could run [[arbitrary code]] by using a "nonsensical" value in the metafile, and concluded Microsoft had intentionally designed Windows this way so it could run code on Windows computers without the user's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Security Now

A '''standing order''' (or a '''standing instruction''') is an instruction a [[bank account]] holder ("the payer") gives to his or her bank to pay a set amount at regular intervals to another's ("the payee's")  account. The instruction is sometimes known as a '''banker's order'''.

They are typically used to pay rent, mortgage or any other fixed regular payments. Because the amounts paid are fixed, a standing order is not usually suitable for paying variable bills such as credit cards or gas and electricity bills.

Standing orders are available in the [[banking]] systems of a number of countries, including [[Germany]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Barbados]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Netherlands]], [[Russia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Ukraine]] and presumably many others. In the [[United States]], and other countries where [[cheques]] are more popular than bank transfers, a similar service is available, in which the bank automatically mails a cheque to the specified payee.

==Country differences==

=== Germany ===
A standing order (''Dauerauftrag'') can run for a set number of payments, a set period of time, or until cancelled.

=== The Netherlands ===
Standing orders ''(periodieke overschrijvingen)'' are available for a set period of time or until cancelled, to any recipient in the [[Single Euro Payments Area|SEPA]] space. They should not be confused with ''doorlopende machtigingen'' (periodic [[direct debit]]s).

=== Japan ===
A standing order ''(口座自動振替)'' runs until cancelled. They can be cancelled at the account holder's request

=== South Korea ===
A standing order ''(납부자자동이체)'' runs until cancelled. They can be cancelled at the account holder's request. The bank charges fees (average 3000KRW) per transfer.

=== Spain ===
A standing order (''adeudo por domiciliación'') can be set up to run for a set period of time, not  indefinitely.  They can be cancelled at the account holder's request.

=== Switzerland ===
In Switzerland standing orders are available for a set period of time or until cancelled. They can be made to any recipient in the SEPA space.

=== UK &amp; Ireland ===
A standing order can be set up to run for a set period of time, or indefinitely, and can be cancelled at the account holder's request. Standing orders are standardized by the trade body [[UK Payments Administration]]. In 2008 a number of banks began to introduce [[Faster Payments]] as the method of transfer for standing orders when available, in place of the slower [[BACS]] system; with this method payments reach the receiving account the same day, rather than after a delay of three days or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/payment_options/automated_payments/standing_orders/|title=UK Payments Administration - Standing Orders}}, [[UK Payments]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from direct debit==
Standing orders are distinct from [[direct debit]]s; both are methods of setting up repeated transfers of money from one account to another, but they operate in different ways. The fundamental difference is that standing orders send payments arranged by the ''payer,'' while direct debits are specified and collected by the ''payee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smartdebit.co.uk/standing-order-vs-direct-debit/|title=Standing order vs Direct Debit|date=2012-04-19|work=SmartDebit|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*A standing order can be set up and modified only by the payer, and is for amounts specified by the payer to be paid at specified times (usually a fixed amount at a specified interval examples). The amount can be paid into any bank account, which need not belong to an organisation vetted by the payer's bank.
*A direct debit requires the payer authorize the payee take a direct debit for any amount at any time, or to instruct the bank to honour direct debit requests from a specified payee. The payee has full control over the payments. They can vary the amount and frequency of payments without further authorisation from the customer (subject to providing the customer with the required advance notice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standing Order vs Direct Debit|url=https://gocardless.com/direct-debit/intro-to-direct-debit/standing-order/|publisher=GoCardless|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The payer has no direct control over these payments, but can cancel the direct debit at any time, with no reason required, and require the return of disputed payments. It is not possible to authorise an individual to take direct debits; only organisations that have a contract with the payer's bank, or have been vetted by it, can do this.

'''TRESemmé''' is an American multi-national brand of [[hair care]] products first manufactured in 1947 by the Godefroy Manufacturing Company in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], United States.  It was named after the renowned hair care expert [[Edna L. Emme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRESemmé|url=http://www.hul.co.in/brands-in-action/detail/TRESemm-/311858/|website=Hindustan Unilever Limited|publisher=Unilever 2014|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand name is a [[phonetic]] respelling of "well-loved" ({{Lang-fr|très-aimé}}) that cleverly includes the surname of its namesake.

The TRESemmé [[product line]] was initially marketed only to [[Beauty salon|beauty salons]]. The TRESemmé brand was purchased by [[Alberto|Alberto-Culver]] in 1968, a company acquired by [[Unilever]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bittar, Christine; [http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/branding-brand-development/4686585-1.html Positioning: Tresemme Hair Line Goes Back To Its Roots]; Brandweek; [2004-06-28]; retrieved on 2007-12-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The TRESemmé brand was launched in 1947 by Godefroy Manufacturing, and was bought in 1968 by [[Alberto-Culver]], a manufacturer of hair and skincare products. The original intention was to only distribute the products of the brand within beauty salons; however, as the product line became more popular, it was marketed to [[supermarkets]] and [[pharmacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keen|first1=Melissa|title=Tresemme Marketing Strategy|url=http://prezi.com/n1nn1pchqq3r/tresemme-marketing-strategy/|website=Prezi.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Alberto-Culver was then bought by [[Unilever]], an [[Anglo]]–[[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[consumer goods]] company. At that time, the product line was further developed and more products were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Jay P|title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 36.|date=2001|publisher=St James Press|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product range==
TRESemmé creates formulas suited for different types of hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRESemmé|url=http://www.unilever.com/brands-in-action/detail/TRESemm-/292124/|website=Unilever|publisher=Unilever 2014|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRESemmé products include: [[shampoos]] &amp; [[conditioners]], [[Dry shampoo|dry shampoos]], [[mousse]], [[gels]], [[hair sprays]], ''crème &amp; milk'', and other [[Hairstyling|styling sprays]]. TRESemmé's products are used in [[Hair salon|hair salons]] across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and [[Asia]], particularly for ''hair repair treatment'' from heat damage caused by [[hair iron]]ing and [[blowdryer|blowdrying]].&lt;ref&gt;On August 7, 2012, '''TRESemmé''' will have its first international release in the [[Philippines]].

[[File:Telex machine ASR-32.jpg|thumb|A Teletype Model 32 used for Telex service]]
The '''telex''' network was a public switched network of [[teleprinter]]s similar to a [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]], for the purposes of sending text-based messages. Telex was a major method of sending written messages electronically between businesses in the post-World War II period. Its usage went into decline as the [[fax machine]] grew in popularity in the 1980s.

The "telex" term refers to the network, not the teleprinters; point-to-point teleprinter systems had been in use long before telex exchanges were built in the 1930s. Teleprinters evolved from [[telegraph]] systems, and, like the telegraph, they used [[binary signal]]s, which means that symbols were represented by the presence or absence of a pre-defined level of electric current. This is significantly different from the analog [[telephone]] system, which used varying voltages to encode frequency information. For this reason, telex exchanges were entirely separate from the telephone system, with their own signalling standards, exchanges and system of "telex numbers" (the counterpart of telephone numbers).

Telex provided the first common medium for international record communications using standard signalling techniques and operating criteria as specified by the [[International Telecommunication Union]]. Customers on any telex exchange could deliver messages to any other, around the world. To lower line usage, telex messages were normally first encoded onto [[paper tape]] and then read into the line as quickly as possible. The system normally delivered information at 50 baud or approximately 66 words per minute, encoded using the [[Baudot code#ITA2|International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]]. In the last days of the telex networks, end-user equipment was often replaced by modems and phone lines, reducing the telex network to what was effectively a directory service running on the phone network.

==Development==

[[File:Puma teleprinter.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A late-model [[British Telecom]] "Puma" telex machine of the 1980s]]

Telex began in Germany as a research and development program in 1926 that became an operational teleprinter service in 1933. The service, operated by the {{lang|de|[[Reichspost]]}} ([[Reich]] postal service)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fifty years of telex |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjMgAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22world%27s+first+public+teleprinter+network%22 |journal=Telecommunication Journal |publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]] |publication-date=1984 |volume=51 |page=35 |access-date=2017-05-18 |quote=Just over fifty years ago, in October 1933, the {{lang|de|Deutsche Reichspost}} as it was then known, opened the world's first public teleprinter network. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
had a speed of 50 [[baud]] — approximately 66 words per minute.

Telex service spread within Europe and (particularly after 1945) around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roemisch |first=Rudolf |title=Siemens EDS System in Service in Europe and Overseas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2RVAAAAYAAJ |journal=Siemens Review |publisher=Siemens-Schuckertwerke AG |publication-date=1978 |volume=45 |issue=4 |page=176 |access-date=2016-02-04 |quote=The inauguration of the first telex service in the world in Germany in 1933 was soon followed by the development of similar networks in several more European countries. However, telex did not enjoy significant and worldwide growth until after 1945. Thanks to the great advantages of the new telex service, above all in overcoming time differences and language problems, telex networks were introduced in quick succession in all parts of the world. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1978, [[West Germany]], including [[West Berlin]], had 123,298 telex connections. Long before automatic telephony became available, most countries, even in central [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], had at least a few high-frequency ([[shortwave]]) telex links. Often, government postal and telegraph services (PTTs) initiated these radio links. The most common radio standard, [[ITU-T|CCITT]] R.44 had error-corrected retransmitting [[time-division multiplexing]] of radio channels. Most impoverished PTTs operated their telex-on-radio (TOR) channels non-stop, to get the maximum value from them.

The cost of TOR equipment has continued to fall. Although the system initially required specialised equipment, {{as of|2016|lc=on}} many [[amateur radio]] operators operate TOR (also known as [[radioteletype|RTTY]]) with special software and inexpensive hardware to adapt [[computer sound card]]s to short-wave radios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dxzone.com/catalog/Software/RTTY/ |title=RTTY Software |publisher=The DXZone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cablegrams or ''telegrams'' actually operate over dedicated telex networks, using TOR whenever required.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Telex served as the forerunner of modern [[fax]], [[email]], and [[text messaging]] — both technically and stylistically. Abbreviated English (like "CU L8R" for "see you later") as used in texting originated with telex operators exchanging informal messages in real time{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} — they became the first "texters" long before the introduction of mobile phones{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Telex users could send the same message to several places around the world at the same time, like email today, using the Western Union InfoMaster Computer. This involved transmitting the message via paper tape to the InfoMaster Computer (dial code 6111) and specifying the destination addresses for the single text. In this way, a single message could be sent to multiple distant Telex and TWX machines as well as delivering the same message to non-Telex and non-TWX subscribers via Western Union [[Mailgram]].

==Operation and applications==
{{norefs|section|date = June 2018}}
Telex messages are routed by addressing them to a telex address, e.g., "14910 ERIC S", where 14910 is the subscriber number, ERIC is an abbreviation for the subscriber's name (in this case Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson in Sweden) and S is the country code. Solutions also exist for the automatic routing of messages to different telex terminals within a subscriber organization, by using different terminal identities, e.g., "+T148".

A major advantage of telex is that the receipt of the message by the recipient could be confirmed with a high degree of certainty by the "[[Enquiry character|answerback]]". At the beginning of the message, the sender would transmit a WRU (Who aRe yoU) code, and the recipient machine would automatically initiate a response which was usually encoded in a rotating drum with pegs, much like a [[music box]]. The position of the pegs sent an unambiguous identifying code to the sender, so the sender could verify connection to the correct recipient. The WRU code would also be sent at the end of the message, so a correct response would confirm that the connection had remained unbroken during the message transmission. This gave telex a major advantage over group 2 fax which had no inherent error-checking capability.

The usual method of operation was that the message would be prepared off-line, using [[paper tape]]. All common telex machines incorporated a 5-hole paper-tape punch and reader. Once the paper tape had been prepared, the message could be transmitted in minimum time. Telex billing was always by connected duration, so minimizing the connected time saved money. However, it was also possible to connect in "real time", where the sender and the recipient could both type on the keyboard and these characters would be immediately printed on the distant machine.

Telex could also be used as a rudimentary but functional carrier of information from one IT system to another, in effect a primitive forerunner of [[Electronic Data Interchange]]. The sending IT system would create an output (e.g., an inventory list) on paper tape using a mutually agreed format. The tape would be sent by telex and collected on a corresponding paper tape by the receiver and this tape could then be read into the receiving IT system.

One use of telex circuits, in use until the widescale adoption of [[X.400]] and [[Internet]] email, was to facilitate a message handling system, allowing local email systems to exchange messages with other email and telex systems via a central routing operation, or switch. One of the largest such switches was operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] as recently as 1994, permitting the exchange of messages between a number of IBM Officevision, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[ALL-IN-1]] and [[Microsoft Mail]] systems. In addition to permitting email to be sent to telex, formal coding conventions adopted in the composition of telex messages enabled automatic routing of telexes to email recipients.

==United States==
===Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX)===
The Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX) was developed by the [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] in the United States. It originally transmitted at 45.45 baud or approximately 60 words per minute, using five level [[Baudot code]]. AT&amp;T began TWX on November 21, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anton A. Huurdeman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnjGRDVIUL4C&amp;pg=PA302 |title=The worldwide history of telecommunications |publisher=Wiley |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-471-20505-0 |page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~uparc/documents/TypingFromAfar.pdf |title=Typing From Afar}}&lt;/ref&gt; AT&amp;T later{{when|date=October 2017}} developed a second generation of TWX called "four row" that used the 110 baud, using eight level [[ASCII]] code. TWX was offered in both "3-row" Baudot and "4-row" ASCII versions up to the late 1970s.

TWX used the [[public switched telephone network]]. In addition to having separate area codes (510, 610, 710, 810 and 910) for the TWX service, the TWX lines were also set up with a special Class of Service to prevent connections from [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] to TWX and vice versa.

The code/speed conversion between "3-row" Baudot and "4-row" ASCII TWX service was accomplished using a special Bell "10A/B board" via a live operator. A TWX customer would place a call to the 10A/B board operator for Baudot – ASCII calls, ASCII – Baudot calls and also TWX Conference calls. The code / speed conversion was done by a Western Electric unit that provided this capability. There were multiple code / speed conversion units at each operator position.

AT&amp;T published the trade magazine ''[[TWX (magazine)|TWX]]'', related to the Teletypewriter Exchange Service from 1944 to 1952. It published articles that touched upon many aspects of the technology.

Western Union purchased the TWX system from AT&amp;T in January 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= WU to Buy AT&amp;T TWX |journal= Western Union News |volume=II |issue= 4 |date= January 15, 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TWX system and the special US area codes (510, 710, 810 and 910) continued until 1981, when Western Union completed the conversion to the Western Union Telex II system. Any remaining "3-row" Baudot customers were converted to Western Union Telex service during the period 1979 to 1981. [[Bell Canada]] retained area code 610 until 1992; its remaining numbers were moved to non-geographic [[area code 600]].

The modem for this service was the [[Bell 101]] dataset, which is the direct ancestor of the [[Bell 103 modem]] that launched computer [[time-sharing]]. The 101 was revolutionary because it ran on ordinary unconditioned telephone subscriber lines, allowing the Bell System to run TWX along with POTS on a single [[public switched telephone network]].

''Telex II'' was the name for the TWX network after it was acquired from AT&amp;T by [[Western Union]]. It was re-acquired by AT&amp;T in 1990 in the purchase of the Western Union assets that became AT&amp;T EasyLink Services.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Western Union===
In 1958, [[Western Union Telegraph Company|Western Union]] started to build a telex network in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Phillip R. |last=Easterlin |title=Telex in New York |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=April 1959 |pages=45 |issn=0096-6452 |oclc=1769771}}&lt;/ref&gt; This telex network started as a satellite exchange located in New York City and expanded to a nationwide network. Western Union chose Siemens &amp; Halske AG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Phillip R. |last=Easterlin |title=Telex in Private Wire Systems |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=October 1960 |pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; now Siemens AG, and ITT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=James S. |last=Chin |first2=Jan J. |last2=Gomerman |title=CSR4 Exchange |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=July 1966 |pages=142–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; to supply the exchange equipment, provisioned the exchange trunks via the Western Union national microwave system and leased the exchange to customer site facilities from the local telephone company. Teleprinter equipment was originally provided by Siemens &amp; Halske AG&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Fred W. |last=Smith |title=European Teleprinters |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=October 1960 |pages=172–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Teletype Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Fred W. |last=Smith |title=A New Line of Light-duty Teleprinters and ASR Sets |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=January 1964 |pages=18–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial direct international telex service was offered by Western Union, via W.U. International, in the summer of 1960 with limited service to London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T.J. |last=O’Sullivan |title=TW 56 Concentrator |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=July 1963 |pages=111–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the major exchanges were located in New York City (1), Chicago (2), San Francisco (3), Kansas City (4) and Atlanta (5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Phillip R. |last=Easterlin |title=Telex in the U.S.A. |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=January 1962 |pages=2–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telex network expanded by adding the final parent exchanges cities of Los Angeles (6), Dallas (7), Philadelphia (8) and Boston (9) starting in 1966.

The telex numbering plan, usually a six-digit number in the United States, was based on the major exchange where the customer's telex machine terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kenneth M. |last=Jockers |title=Planning Western Union Telex |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=July 1966 |pages=92–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all telex customers that terminated in the New York City exchange were assigned a telex number that started with a first digit "1". Further, all Chicago-based customers had telex numbers that started with a first digit of "2". This numbering plan was maintained by Western Union as the telex exchanges proliferated to smaller cities in the United States. The Western Union Telex network was built on three levels of exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kenneth M. |last=Jockers |title=Planning Western Union Telex |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=July 1966 |page=94 figure 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest level was made up of the nine exchange cities previously mentioned. Each of these cities had the dual capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections to multiple distant telex exchanges. The second level of exchanges, located in large cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Miami, Newark, Pittsburgh and Seattle, were similar to the highest level of exchanges in capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections. However, these second level exchanges had a smaller customer line capacity and only had trunk circuits connected to regional cities. The third level of exchanges, located in small to medium-sized cities, could terminate telex customer lines and had a single trunk group running to its parent exchange.

Loop signaling was offered in two different configurations for Western Union Telex in the United States. The first option, sometimes called local or [[Current loop|loop service]], provided a 60 milliampere loop circuit from the exchange to the customer teleprinter. The second option, sometimes called long distance or polar was used when a 60 milliampere connection could not be achieved, provided a ground return polar circuit using 35 milliamperes on separate send and receive wires. By the 1970s, under pressure from the Bell operating companies wanting to modernize their cable plant and lower the adjacent circuit noise that these telex circuits sometimes caused, Western Union migrated customers to a third option called F1F2. This F1F2 option replaced the DC voltage of the local and long distance options with [[modem]]s at the [[Telephone exchange|exchange]] and [[Subscription business model|subscriber]] ends of the telex circuit.

Western Union offered connections from Telex to the AT&amp;T Teletypewriter eXchange (TWX) system in May 1966 via its New York Information Services Computer Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sergio |last=Wernikoff |title=Information Services Computer Center |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=July 1966 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; These connections were limited to those TWX machines that were equipped with automatic answerback capability per CCITT standard.

USA based Telex users could send the same message to several places around the world at the same time, like email today, using the Western Union InfoMaster Computer. This involved transmitting the message via paper tape to the InfoMaster Computer (dial code 6111) and specifying the destination addresses for the single text. In this way, a single message could be sent to multiple distant Telex and TWX machines as well as delivering the same message to non-Telex and non-TWX subscribers via Western Union [[Mailgram]].

===International Record Carriers===
{{Distinguish|Internet Relay Chat (IRC)}}

"International Record Carrier" (IRC) was a term created by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. Bell's original consent agreement limited it to international dial telephony, and the [[Western Union]] Telegraph Company had given up its international telegraphic operation in a 1939 bid to monopolize U.S. telegraphy by taking over [[ITT Inc.|ITT's]] [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service]] (PTT) business. The result was a de-emphasis on telex in the U.S. and the creation of several international telex and telegraphy companies, collectively called IRCs:

* [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]] developed a subsidiary named Western Union Cable System. This company was later renamed as Western Union International (WUI) when it was spun off by Western Union as an independent company. WUI was purchased by [[MCI Communications| MCI Communications (MCI)]] in 1983 and operated as a subsidiary of MCI International.
* ITT's "World Communications" division (later known as ITT World Communications) was amalgamated from many smaller companies: Federal Telegraph, All American Cables and Radio, Globe Wireless, and the common carrier division of Mackay Marine. ITT World Communications was purchased by Western Union in 1987.
* [[RCA]] Communications (later known as RCA Global Communications) had specialized in global radiotelegraphic connections. In 1986, it was purchased by MCI International.
* Before World War I, the Tropical Radiotelegraph Company (later known as Tropical Radio Telecommunications, or TRT) put radio telegraphs on ships for its owner, the [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit Company (UFC)]], to enable them to deliver bananas to the best-paying markets. Communications expanded to UFC's plantations, and were eventually provided to local governments. TRT eventually became the national carrier for many small Central American nations.
* The [[Compagnie française du télégraphe de Paris à New-York|French Telegraph Cable Company]] (later known as FTC Communications, or just FTCC), which was founded in 1871, was owned by French investors and headquartered in the United States; it laid [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] between the two countries. International telegrams routed via FTCC used routing ID "PQ", the initials of the company's founder, [[Augustin Pouyer-Quertier]] (1820–1891).
* [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone Rubber]] developed its own IRC, the Trans-Liberia Radiotelegraph Company,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} which operated [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] from [[Akron, Ohio]] to the rubber plantations in [[Liberia]].

Bell Telex users had to select which IRC to use, and then append the necessary routing digits. The IRCs converted between TWX and Western Union Telegraph Co. standards.

==United Kingdom==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Telex began in the UK as an evolution from the 1930s Telex Printergram service, appearing in 1932 on a limited basis. This used the telephone network in conjunction with a Teleprinter 7B and signalling equipment to send a message to another subscriber with a Teleprinter, or to the Central Telegraph Office.

In 1945 as the traffic increased it was decided to have a separate network for Telex traffic and the first manual exchange opened in London. By 1954, the public inland Telex service opened via manually switched exchanges. A number of subscribers were served via automatic sub-centres which used relays and Type 2 [[Uniselector|uniselectors]], acting as concentrators for a manual exchange.

In the late 1950s the decision was made to convert to automatic switching and this was completed by 1961; there were 21 exchanges spread across the country, with one international exchange in London. The equipment used the [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] system for switching, as was the case for the telephone network. Conversion to Stored Programme Control (SPC) began in 1984 using exchanges made by [[Canadian Marconi Company|Canadian Marconi]], with the last Strowger exchange closing in 1992. User numbers increased over the following years into the 1990s.

The dominant supplier of the Telex machines was [[Creed &amp; Company|Creed]], a division of [[ITT Corporation|ITT]].

A separate service "Secure Stream 300" (previously Circuit Switched Data Network) was a variant of Telex running at 300 baud, used for telemetry and monitoring purposes by utility companies and banks, among others. This was a high security virtual [[private wire]] system with a high degree of resilience through diversely routed dual-path network configurations.

British Telecom stopped offering the Telex service to new customers in 2004 and discontinued the service in 2008, allowing users to transfer to Swiss Telex if they wished to continue to use Telex.

==Canada==
Canada-wide automatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced by the [[CPR Telegraphs|CPR Telegraph Company]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 (the two companies, operated by rivals [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], would join to form [[CNCP Telecommunications]] in 1967). This service supplemented the existing international telex service that was put in place in November 1956. Canadian telex customers could connect with nineteen European countries in addition to eighteen Latin American, African, and trans-Pacific countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C.J. |last=Colombo |title=Telex in Canada |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=January 1958 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major exchanges were located in [[Montreal]] (01), [[Toronto]] (02), and [[Winnipeg]] (03).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Phillip R. |last=Easterlin |title=Telex in New York |journal=Western Union Technical Review |date=April 1959 |page=47 figure 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
Telex is still in operation but not in the sense described in the CCITT Blue Book documentation. [[iTelegram]] offers "telex" without subscriber telex lines. Individual subscribers can use [[Deskmail]], a legacy Windows program that connects to the iTelegram telex network but this is via IP as the [[last mile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Telegram® - Answers to some common questions |url=https://www.itelegram.com/telegram/help.asp |website=itelegram.com |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-05-18 |quote=Western Union closed its telegram service in January, 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32231">'''The semantic turn''' refers to a [[paradigm shift]] in the design of artifacts – [[industrial design|industrial]], [[Graphic Design|graphic]], [[Information Design|informational]], [[Architectural Design|architectural]], and [[Social design|social]] – from an emphasis on how artifacts ought to function to what they mean to those affected by them – [[semantics]] being a concern for meaning. It provides a new foundation for professional design, a detailed design discourse, codifications of proven methods, compelling scientific justifications of its products, and a clear identity for professional designers working within a network of their [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].

The semantic turn suggests a distinction between the technical and user-irrelevant working of artifacts and the human interactions with artifacts, individually, socially, and culturally. Attending to the technical dimension of artifacts, for example, by applied scientists, mechanical or electronic engineers, and experts in economics, production, and marketing, is called technology-centered design. It addresses its subject matter in terms that ordinary users may not understand and applies design criteria users of technology do not care about. Attending to the meanings that users bring to their artifacts, how they use them and talk about them and among various stakeholders, is the domain of human-centered design. For ordinary users, the makeup and technical functioning of artifacts is mere background of what really matters to them.

A prime example for this distinction is the design of [[Human-centered computing|personal computers]]. For most people, the operations inside a computer are incomprehensible, but far from troubling because computers are designed to be experienced primarily through their interfaces. [[User interface|Human-computer interfaces]] consist of interactively rearrangeable icons, texts, and controls that users can understand in everyday terms and manipulate towards desirable ends. The design of intelligent artifacts suggests that the old adage of “form follows function” is no longer valid&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (1993). Where Meanings Escape Functions. ''Design Management Journal 4'', 2, pp. 30–37.&lt;/ref&gt; – except for the simplest of tools. The semantic turn suggests that human-centered designers’ unique expertise resides in the design of human interfaces with artifacts that are meaningful, easy to use, even enjoyable to experience, be it simple kitchen implements, public service systems, architectural spaces, or information campaigns. Although an automobile should obviously function as a means of transportation, human-centered designers emphasize the [[Experience design|experiences]] of driving, [[Usability|ease of operation]], feeling of safety, including the social meanings of driving a particular automobile. As artifacts have to work within many dimensions, human-centered designers must have a sense of and be able to work with all relevant stakeholders addressing different dimensions of the artifact.

==''The Semantic Turn'': a book and its themes==
'''''The Semantic Turn''''' is also the title of a book by [[Klaus Krippendorff]],&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus (2006). ''The Semantic Turn; A New Foundation for Design''. Boca Raton, London, New York: Taylor&amp;Francis, CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Communication at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], cybernetician, degreed designer, and researcher who has published much to advance the science for design. The subtitle of the book, ''A new Foundation for Design'', suggests a redesign of design practices in a human-centered design culture. Krippendorff takes an encompassing view of design, centering it on the meanings that artifacts acquire and what is or should be designers' primary concern.

''The Semantic Turn'' represents an evolution from "Product Semantics" by Krippendorff and Butter,&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (Eds.) (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; which was defined as ''"A systematic inquiry into how people attribute meanings to artifacts and interact with them accordingly"'' and ''"a vocabulary and methodology for designing artifacts in view of the meanings they could acquire for their users and the communities of their stakeholders"''. While retaining the emphasis on meaning and on the importance of both theory and practice, ''The Semantic Turn'' extends the concerns of designers first to the new challenges of design, including the design of ever more intangible artifacts such as services, identities, interfaces, multi-user systems, projects and discourses; and second, to consider the meaning of artifacts in use, in language, in the whole life cycle of the artifact, and in an ecology of artifacts.

===Design===
For Krippendorff, design ''"brings forth what would not come naturally (...); proposes realizable artifacts to others (...) must support the lives of ideally large communities (...) and must make sense to most, ideally to all who have a stake on them"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Design thus is intimatelly involved with the meaning that stakeholders attribute to artifacts. Designers ''"consider possible futures (...) evaluate their desirability (...) and create and work out realistic paths from the present towards desirable futures, and propose them to those that can bring a design to fruition"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging that all design serves others, ''The Semantic Turn'' does not treat THE user as statistical fiction, but as knowledgeable stakeholders and necessary partners in human-centered design processes.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predecessors of human-centeredness===
Krippendorff quotes the Greek philosopher Protagoras who is believed to have been the first to express human-centeredness in words by saying that ''"Man is the measure of all things, of things that are (...) and of things that are not (...)."'' Krippendorff goes on to cite the color theory of J. W. von Goethe&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Theodor, et al. (Ed.) (undated). Goethe. Vierzigster Teil: Zur Farbenlehre.(original 1810). Leipzig: Verlag Reclam.&lt;/ref&gt; who exposed Isaac Newton’s spectral theory of colors as epistemologically flawed by pointing out that color is the product of the human eye. Color does not exist without it. Krippendorff refers to the Italian philosopher G. Vico for opposing R. Descartes by claiming we humans know what we have constructed, made up, cognitively, materially, or socially,&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995). ''Radical Constructivism; A Way of Knowing and Learning''. Washington, DC: Falmer Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to the biologists J. Uexküll for his species-specific theory of meaning&lt;ref&gt;Uexküll, Jacob von (1934/1957), ''A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men: A Picture Book of Invisible Worlds''. pp. 5–80 in C. H. Schiller (Ed.). ''Instinctive Behavior: The Development of a Modern Concept''. New York: International University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and H. Maturana and F. Varela for developing a biological foundation of cognition,&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Humberto R. and Francisco J. Varela (1988). ''The Tree of Knowledge; The Biological Roots of Human Understanding''. Boston, MA: Shambhala.&lt;/ref&gt; to the psychologist J. J. Gibson for his conception of affordance, which acknowledges that our environment does not account for our perception, it merely affords our sensory-motor coordinations&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J. (1979). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''. Boston MA: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; or it does not; and to the anthropological linguist B. L. Whorf for his recognition that our perceptions are correlated with language, its grammar and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Whorf, Benjamin Lee (1956), ''Language, Thought and Reality'', John B. Carroll (Ed.). New York: John Wiley and MIT.&lt;/ref&gt; Most important, Krippendorff allies himself with L. Wittgenstein’s definition of meaning as use,&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig (1953). Philosophical Investigations. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the axiom that ''Humans do not see and act on the physical qualities of things, but on what they mean to them''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning===
Attributing meaning to something follows from sensing it, and is a prelude to action. ''" One always acts according to the meaning of whatever one faces "''&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and the consequences of these actions in turn become part of the meanings of what one interacts with. Meanings are always someone's construction and depend on context and culture. The same artifact may invoke different meanings at different times, in different contexts of use, and for different people. To design artifacts for use by others calls on designers to understand the understanding of others, a ''second order understanding'' that is fundamentally unlike the understanding of physical things. Since meanings cannot be observed directly, designers need to carefully observe the actions that imply certain meanings; involve themselves in dialog with their stakeholders; and invite them to participate in the design process.

===Meaning of artifacts in use===
People acquire the meanings of artifacts by their interfacing with them, where meanings become anticipated usabilities. Krippendorff does not limit the concept of interfaces to human computer interactions, however. For him, the concept applies to any artifact one faces. To users, artifacts are perceived as affordances, as the kind of interactions they enable or prohibit. Thus scissors and coffee cups are experienced as interfaces, just as personal computers are. Their physical or computational makeup become background phenomena to use. The meaning of an artifact in use is then ''" the range of imaginable senses and actions that users have reasons to expect" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Ideal interfaces are self-evident and ''" intrinsically motivating interactions between users and their artifacts" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on Heidegger's explorations of the human use of technology, Krippendorff argues that all artifacts must be designed to afford three stages of use: initial recognition, intermediate exploration, and ideally, unproblematic reliance. The latter is achieved when the artifact is so incorporated into the user's world that it becomes hardly noticed, is taken for granted while looking through it to what is to be accomplished. Recognition involves users' categorizations, how close the artifact is to the ''ideal type'' of its kind. Exploration is facilitated by informatives such as state indicators, progress reports, confirmations of actions and readiness, alarm signals, close correlations between actions and their expected effects, maps of possibilities, instructions, error messages, and multi-sensory feedback. Users' intrinsic motivation arises from reliance, the seemingly effortless, unproblematic yet skillful engagement with artifacts free of disruptions. A well designed interface enables unambiguous recognition, effective exploration, and leads to enjoyable reliance. To accomplish these transitions, human-centered designers need to involve second-order understanding of users' cognitive models, cultural habits, and competencies.

Typically, users approach their artifacts with very different competencies. ''The Semantic Turn'' offers the possibility of accommodating these differences by allowing the design of several semantic layers. For example, contemporary Xerox machines exhibit one layer for making copies, another for clearing paper jams, a third for replacing defective parts by trained service personnel, and a fourth is reserved for the factory repair of replaced components.

===Meaning of artifacts in language===
''"The fate of all artifacts is decided in language" '',&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 148&lt;/ref&gt; says Krippedorff. Indeed, designers must pay attention to the narratives in which an artifact appears as soon as it enters the conversations among stakeholders, bystanders, critics, and users, to the names that categorize the artifact as being of one kind or another, and to the adjectives that direct perception to particular qualities (is it a ''fast'' car? a ''clumsy'' cell phone? a ''high class'' dress?). Such characterizations can make or break an artifact and designers cannot ignore how people talk about them. Krippendorff proposes that ''artifacts should be designed so that their interfaces are [easily] narratable''&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 147, emphasis added&lt;/ref&gt; and fit into social or communicational relationships.

The ''character'' of an artifact – the set of adjectives deemed appropriate to it – can be assessed by means of semantic differential scales – seven point scales between polar opposite attributes such as elegant––––graceless; by categorizing free associations elicited from users, whether as first impressions or after extended use; by examining the content of stories people tell about the artifacts for implied judgments; or by pair comparisons of similar artifacts. Such methods give human-centered designers ways to quantify meanings, to work towards defined design criteria, including pursuing quantifiable aesthetic objectives, and justify a design to potential stakeholders.

Language permeates all of human life, including with artifacts. This applies not only to the users of artifacts but also to their designers. The narratives that evolve within design teams determine the direction a design is taking, and might end up convincing stakeholders to go along with a design project or oppose it, well before it is built, and influence designers in turn. What we know of current artifacts, ancient ones, outdated ones, antiques or museum pieces come to us in the form of stories. Designers need to analyse them for, as Krippendorff asserts, ''" The meanings that artifacts acquire in use are largely framed in language"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning in the lives of artifacts===
Here, Krippendorff invites designers to consider artifacts in their whole life cycle. In the case of industrial products, the life cycle might start with an initial idea, then followed by design, engineering, production, sales, use, storage, maintenance and finally retirement, as recycled or as waste. Well, not so "finally;" designers may learn much about a product's performance, unintended uses, unexpected problems, and resulting social consequences, which can serve to improve the design of the next generation of that product – design never ends. In each phase of the life cycle of an artifact, that artifact will have to support diverse but subjectively meaningful interfaces for different communities of stakeholders. In such stakeholder networks, artifacts need to proceed from one to the next: ''" no artifact can be realized within a culture without being meaningful to those who can move it through its various definitions" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning in an ecology of artifacts===
Dictionaries tend to define ecology as multi-species interaction in a common environment, the species being animals and plants. Humans, however, have created a perhaps greater diversity of ''species of artifacts'' than has nature. Krippendorff observes that species of artifacts too are born, grow in size and number, diversify into sub-species, associate with other species, adapt to each other and to their human environment, and either reproduce, evolve, or disappear – just as in nature. Species of artifacts may compete, cooperate or be parasitic on other artifacts. For an example of the latter, consider spam, which thrives in the email ecosystem and could not exist outside it. Whereas species of animals and plants interact with one another in their own terms, species of artifacts are brought into interaction through human agency. People arrange artifacts, like the furniture at home; connect them into networks, like computes in the internet; form large cultural cooperatives, like hospitals full of medical equipment, drugs, and treatments; retire one species in favor of another, like typewriters gave way to personal computers; or change their ecological meanings, like horses, originally used for work and transportation, found an ecological niche in sports.

In an ecology of artifacts, the meaning of one consists of the possible interactions with other artifacts: cooperation, competition (substitution), domination or submission, leading technological development, like computers do right now, supporting the leaders, like the gadgets found in computer stores. Similarly, roads and gas stations follow the development of automobiles and participate in a very large cultural complex, including the design of cities and the distribution of work, and affect nature through depletion of resources, creating waste and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Clearly, ''" designers who can handle the ecological meaning of their proposals have a better chance of keeping their designs alive" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Towards a science for design==
In 1969, Nobel laureate Herbert Simon called for a science of the artificial.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert A. (1969/2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Natural scientists, he argued, are concerned with what exists, whereas designers are concerned with what should be and how to achieve it. His conception of design was shaped by rational decision theory and early conceptions of computational logic, hence limited largely to technology-centered design. Krippendorff added the following contrasts to Simon’s:
* The natural sciences limit themselves to theorizing past regularities from existing data. They do not see scientists as change agents. Any science for design must concern itself with how designers can change existing regularities, overcome contingencies that cause recurring problems, and make a difference in the lives of present stakeholders or future communities. Designers do not produce theories but propose unprecedented artifacts, new practices, and narratives that must be realized in a network of stakeholders, which are actors in their own interest. The science for design cannot be ''about'' design or ''of'' design, which are pursued from outside the design community. It must provide practical and intellectual support of design by being ''for'' or in the service of design activity. In support of change that does not come naturally, it must also provide the conceptualizations needed to hold designers accountable for how their proposals affect future contingencies.
* The natural sciences privilege causal explanations, which rule out that their objects can understand how they are conceptualized, theorized, and studied. A science for human-centered design privileges the meanings (conceptions, explanations, and motivations) that knowledgeable users and stakeholders of a design can bring to it. It entails a reflexive kind of understanding unfamiliar in the natural sciences.
* As detached observers of their objects, natural scientists can afford to celebrate abstract and general theories. Designers, by contrast, must be concerned with all necessary details of their design. No technology works in the abstract. Even social artifacts need to be understood and enacted by their constituents. A design is always a proposal to other stakeholders who may contribute to a design or oppose its realization. Theories in the natural sciences do not affect what they theorize, but designs must enroll others into what they are proposing, treat them as intelligent agents, or will not come to fruition.
* In the natural sciences, research consists of gathering date or objective facts in support of theories about these data. Predictive theories assume the status quo (the continuation) of the phenomena they theorize. In the science for design, research means searching for previously unrecognized variables and proposing realistic paths into desirable futures. Design, to the extent it is innovative, may well break with past theories, overcome popular convictions, and challenge stubborn beliefs in a history-determined future. Fundamentally, past observations can never prove the validity of truly innovative designs.

A science for design makes three contributions to design:

===Design research===
Generally, research is any inquiry that generates communicable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Bruce (1995) [https://archive.org/details/TheNatureOfResearch], accessed 2009.10.15&lt;/ref&gt; Human-centered [[design research]] typically involves
* Eliciting and analyzing the narratives of problematic uses of artifacts and desirable futures, which motivate or inspire a community of potential users and stakeholders to consider changes in their lives.
* Searching for and evaluating examples of common, understandable, and attractive practices, especially from empirical domains other than the intended design, in view of their ability to serve as metaphors for new but immediately recognizable and meaningful interfaces.
* Exploring new technologies and materials that could support or improve current and future uses of the artifacts under consideration.
* Testing and evaluating alternative designs – recombinations and transformations of available technologies, possible interfaces, and social and ecological consequences – usually in terms relevant to present stakeholders and in lieu of future users.
* Inquiring into how a design survives in the ecology of artifacts, what lessons can be learned for future design activities, so called post-design research.

===Design methods===
Human-centered [[design methods]] may aim at:
* Systematic expansions of a design space – the possibilities in which a design can take place. This space should embrace and go beyond user and stakeholder expectations, especially including the (apparently) unthinkable. Such methods range from the computer generation of alternatives ([[Enumerative combinatorics|combinatorics]]) to the use of language games during which novel ideas are created, for example by [[brainstorming]].
* Focused involvement of users and stakeholders in the design process (in reducing the design space to realistic proposals for meaningful artifacts). There are three known ways:
** Acquiring an understanding of users’ and stakeholders’ understanding, so-called second-order understanding, for instance by [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]] or [[focus group]]s, and making design decisions dependent on that understanding
** Involving users and stakeholders in design decisions, for example, [[participatory design]]
** Delegating design by designing artifacts that either adapt themselves to their users’ and stakeholders’ worlds or can be redesigned by them, in personal computers, for example.
* Formalizing successful design practices into reproducible aids that can improve future design practices, both computationally, for example, [[Computer-aided design|computer aided design]], [[Computer supported cooperative work|collaborative software]], and [[rapid prototyping]], and prescriptively. Krippendorff describes five prescriptive methods:&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 230–260&lt;/ref&gt;
** (Re)designing the characters of artifacts
** Designing interfaces for artifacts in view of their usability and meanings in use
** Designing novel artifacts, including services and social practices, from sensible narratives and metaphors
** Designing design strategies
** Designing dialogical (collaborative) methodologies to involve others in a design process.
* Elaborating and refining the design discourse in order to
** Improve the reproducibility of knowledge about the design process, by generating retrievable records of past accounts of design processes and publishing pertinent findings
** Make the collaboration among designers as well as in interdisciplinary teams more efficient
** Inform pertinent design education
** Enhance the ability to ask fruitful research questions for which design research may provide conclusive answers
** Increase and maintain the reputation of professional design, especially in order for designers to play important roles within the network of its stakeholders. This means applying the science for design to itself.

===Validations of semantic claims===
In a science for design, validation consists of generating compelling justifications for the claims that designers must make regarding the meaning, virtue, potential reality, costs and benefits of their design for particular communities.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 260–267&lt;/ref&gt; Inasmuch as any design can prove itself only in the future, ''post factum'', and with the collaboration of others, human-centered design is justifiable only by means of plausible arguments [[Issue-Based Information System]]&lt;ref&gt;Rittel, Horst W. J. (1992). ''Planen, Entwerfen, Design; Ausgewȁhlte Schriften zur Theorie und Methodik ''. Wolf D. Reuter (Ed.). Stuttgart, Berlin, Kȍln: W. Kohlhammer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rittel, Horst W. J. &amp; Webber, Melvin M.. (1984). Planning problems are wicked problems. In Cross, Nigel (Ed.). ''Developments in design methodology''. New York: Wiley, pp. 135–144.&lt;/ref&gt; that motivate its stakeholders to realize or use that design. The science for design, always concerned with not yet observable contingencies, cannot provide the simple truth claims of the kind that natural scientist aspire to for their theories. But it can provide several other human-centered ways to back the claims designers need to make:
* Convincing demonstrations and expositions of a design in various contexts of use
* Statistical experiments with prototypes, models or visualizations involving users’ ability to make sense of, find appropriate meanings for, and handle a proposed artifact
* Appeals to trusted theories or principles of how meanings of artifacts are acquired in use, can be communicated through various channels, or emerge in a diversity of social situations, including in an ecology of other artifacts
* Accounts of the systematic application of established design methods that reduced the initial design space to the alternatives being proposed
* Affirmed commitments by relevant stakeholders to realize the design.

==Reception of "product semantics" and ''The Semantic Turn''==
Since its coinage in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (1984). Exploring the Symbolic Qualities of Form. ''Innovations 3'', 2 pp. 4–9. [http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/40], accessed 2009.10.15.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of “product semantics” has mushroomed. In 2009, a Google search identified over 18,000 documents referring to it. However, it has been critiqued by advocates of a more critical approach to design as overly simplistic.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

The semantics of artifacts has become of central importance in courses taught at leading design departments of many universities all over the world, among them at the Arizona State University; the Cranbrook Academy of Arts; The Ohio State University; the Savannah College of Art and Design; the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, USA; the Hochschule fűr Gestaltung Offenbach in Germany;&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Dagmar (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; the Hongik University in Seoul, Korea; the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai; the Musashino Art University in Tokyo, Japan; the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; the University of Art and Design in Helsinki, Finland; and more. It has also permeated other disciplines, notably [[ergonomics]], [[marketing]], [[Cognitive ergonomics|cognitive engineering]].

'''Trekiz''' is a [[technology]] company that provides customized travel planning and booking solutions through its [[World Wide Web|web]]-based platforms. Trekiz was registered in [[Hong Kong]] and its operations center was established in [[Beijing]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traveltrademagazine.com/trekiz-3/# Trekiz: Changing The Way We Travel With Web 3.0 Smart Platform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230811/http://traveltrademagazine.com/trekiz-3/ |date=2011-12-19 }} “Travel Trade Magazine”. November 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The company's main [[website]], Trekiz.com, is an online travel [[Computing platform|platform]] for creating and booking customized, multi-destination travel itineraries in real time. At the time of its launch, Trekiz.com focused on [[tourism]] in [[China]], but has since added activities, tours and hotel reservations in other international destinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theworldofchinese.com/business/anyone-can-innovate/1260-trekiz-launching-the-diy-travel-revolution.html Trekiz: Launching the DIY Revolution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201103711/http://www.theworldofchinese.com/business/anyone-can-innovate/1260-trekiz-launching-the-diy-travel-revolution.html |date=2011-12-01 }} “The World of Chinese”. August 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Trekiz also offers a [[business-to-business]] platform that allows travel industry professionals to expand their business's product base, adjust tour pricing and build more varied itineraries for customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traveltrademagazine.com/trekiz-3/# Trekiz: Changing The Way We Travel With Web 3.0 Smart Platform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230811/http://traveltrademagazine.com/trekiz-3/ |date=2011-12-19 }} “Travel Trade Magazine”. November 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Trekiz was conceived as a “smart travel platform” in the early 2000s by CEO Wenqing Tian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttgdigital.com/trekiz-claims-first-web-30-booking-platform/4680617.article Trekiz Claims First ‘Web 3.0’ Booking Platform] “Travel Trade Gazette”. June 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until March 2011 that the main website was finally launched. At the time, the Trekiz site featured more than 500 China activities provided by 117 tour operators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theworldofchinese.com/business/anyone-can-innovate/1260-trekiz-launching-the-diy-travel-revolution.html Trekiz: Launching the DIY Revolution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201103711/http://www.theworldofchinese.com/business/anyone-can-innovate/1260-trekiz-launching-the-diy-travel-revolution.html |date=2011-12-01 }} “The World of Chinese”. August 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to expanding its travel selection to include tours in global destinations such as [[Italy]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sweden]], [[Kenya]], [[South Africa]] and [[Morocco]], Trekiz developed a business-to-business platform targeted at industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelweekly.com.au/news/technology-trekiz-makes-booking-diy-travel-easier- Technology: Trekiz Makes Booking DIY Travel Easier for Agents]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} “Travel Weekly”. October 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website==
The Trekiz website allows users to build multi-destination travel itineraries – including tours, activities, hotels and flights – in real time using Trekiz's patented&lt;ref&gt;[http://traveltrademagazine.com/trekiz-3/# Trekiz: Changing The Way We Travel With Web 3.0 Smart Platform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230811/http://traveltrademagazine.com/trekiz-3/ |date=2011-12-19 }} “Travel Trade Magazine”. November 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; “trip planner.” Users can manipulate and rearrange elements of the tour in the “trip planner,” which continuously updates the total cost of all the specified services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-03/27/content_12232411.htm Scratching One Travel Itch at a Time – On the Internet] “China Daily”. March 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Once completed, the entire itinerary can be booked directly through the Trekiz website. Trekiz also provides detailed city guides.

==Web 3.0 Claims==
Trekiz identifies itself as a [[Semantic web|Web 3.0]] “smart platform” for booking travel itineraries. The company states that its use of technology to “intuitively and seamlessly integrate things that were formerly separate” and “tailor [the Trekiz experience] to the user” reinforce their Web 3.0 claim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agendabeijing.com/travel-issue/ Travel 3.0] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124010407/http://agendabeijing.com/travel-issue/ |date=2011-11-24 }} “Agenda”. April 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Because definitions of Web 3.0 tend to vary, it is not yet possible to determine whether Trekiz qualifies as a true Web 3.0 platform.

==Reception==
Trekiz was recognized as a 2010 [[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]] Global Award Winner. The Red Herring Global Award is an [[award]] given to innovative [[Startup company|startups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.herringevents.com/rha2010/winners/2010winners.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110195359/http://www.herringevents.com/rha2010/winners/2010winners.html# |archive-date=2011-11-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Twisted pair ''' cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors of a single [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] are twisted together for the purposes of improving [[electromagnetic compatibility]]. Compared to a [[Single-ended signaling|single conductor]] or an untwisted [[balanced pair]], a twisted pair reduces [[electromagnetic radiation]] from the pair and [[crosstalk]] between neighboring pairs and improves rejection of external [[electromagnetic interference]]. It was invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McBee |first1=David Barnett, David Groth, Jim |title=Cabling : the complete guide to network wiring |date=2004 |publisher=SYBEX |location=San Francisco |isbn=9780782143317 |page=11 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AKDSTYu3nl4C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
In a [[balanced line]], the two wires carry equal and opposite signals, and the destination detects the difference between the two. This is known as [[differential signaling]]. Noise sources introduce signals into the wires by coupling of electric or magnetic fields and tend to couple to both wires equally. The noise thus produces a [[common-mode signal]] which can be canceled at the receiver when the difference signal is taken.

[[Differential signaling]] starts to fail when the noise source is close to the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more strongly and the receiver will be unable to eliminate it. This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. Twisting the pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise-source is exchanged. Provided the interfering source remains uniform, or nearly so, over the distance of a single twist, the induced noise will remain common-mode.

The twist rate (also called ''pitch'' of the twist, usually defined in twists per [[meter]]) makes up part of the specification for a given type of cable. When nearby pairs have equal twist rates, the same conductors of the different pairs may repeatedly lie next to each other, partially undoing the benefits of differential mode. For this reason it is commonly specified that, at least for cables containing small numbers of pairs, the twist rates must differ.&lt;ref name="dmray"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crosstalk dependence on number of turns/inch for twisted pair versions of the end-cap umbilical cable|url=http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/~dmray/pdffiles/TP_umbilical_studies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to shielded or foiled twisted pair (typically F/UTP or S/FTP [[#Cable shielding|cable shielding]]), UTP (unshielded twisted pair) cable is not surrounded by any shielding. UTP is the primary wire type for [[telephone]] usage and is very common for [[computer networking]].&lt;!--Kvng RTH--&gt;

==History==
[[File:Wire Transposition.svg|thumb|Wire transposition on top of pole]]

The earliest telephones used telegraph lines, or open-wire [[single-wire earth return]] circuits. In the 1880s electric [[tram]]s were installed in many cities, which induced noise into these circuits. [[Lawsuit]]s being unavailing, the telephone companies converted to [[balanced circuit]]s, which had the incidental benefit of reducing [[attenuation]], hence increasing range.

As electrical power distribution became more commonplace, this measure proved inadequate. Two wires, strung on either side of cross bars on [[utility pole]]s, shared the route with electrical [[power line]]s. Within a few years, the growing use of electricity again brought an increase of interference, so engineers devised a method called [[Transposition (telecommunications)|wire transposition]], to cancel out the interference.

In wire transposition, the wires exchange position once every several poles. In this way, the two wires would receive similar [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] from power lines. This represented an early implementation of twisting, with a twist rate of about four twists per [[kilometre]], or six per [[mile]]. Such open-wire balanced lines with periodic transpositions still survive today in some rural areas.

Twisted-pair cabling was invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, the entire American [[telephone line]] network was either twisted pair or open wire with transposition to guard against interference. Today, most of the millions of kilometres of twisted pairs in the world are [[outside plant|outdoor landlines]], owned by telephone companies, used for voice service, and only handled or even seen by telephone workers.

==Unshielded twisted pair==
[[File:UTP-cable.svg|thumb|Cross-section of cable with four unshielded twisted pairs]]

'''Unshielded twisted pair''' (UTP) cables are found in many [[Ethernet]] networks and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard [[25-pair color code]] originally developed by [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. The cables are typically made with [[copper]] wires measured at 22 or 24 [[American Wire Gauge]] (AWG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven T. Karris|title=Networks: Design and Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWMDf4ciB1AC&amp;pg=SA6-PA2|year=2009|publisher=Orchard Publications|isbn=978-1-934404-15-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the colored insulation typically made from an insulator such as [[polyethylene]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]] and the total package covered in a [[polyethylene]] jacket.

For urban outdoor telephone cables containing hundreds or thousands of pairs, the cable is divided into small but identical bundles. Each bundle consists of twisted pairs that have different twist rates. The bundles are in turn twisted together to make up the cable. Pairs having the same twist rate within the cable can still experience some degree of [[crosstalk]]. Wire pairs are selected carefully to minimize crosstalk within a large cable.

[[File:UTP cable.jpg|thumb|Unshielded twisted pair cable with different twist rates]]
UTP [[electrical cable|cable]] is also the most common cable used in [[computer networking]]. Modern [[Ethernet]], the most common data networking standard, can use UTP cables. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to [[optical fiber]] and [[coaxial cable]].

UTP is also finding increasing use in [[video]] applications, primarily in [[security camera]]s. Many cameras include a UTP output with [[screw terminal]]s; UTP cable [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] has improved to match the [[baseband]] of [[television]] signals. As UTP is a balanced transmission line, a [[balun]] is needed to connect to unbalanced equipment, for example any using [[BNC connector]]s and designed for coaxial cable.

==Cable shielding==
{{Main|Electromagnetic shielding}}
[[File:FTP cable3.jpg|thumb|F/UTP cable]]

[[File:10G BASE-T x 3 cables.svg|thumb|U/FTP, F/UTP and F/FTP are used in Cat 6a cables]]

Twisted pair cables often incorporate shielding in an attempt to prevent electromagnetic interference. Shielding provides an electrically conductive barrier to attenuate electromagnetic waves external to the shield; and provides a conduction path by which induced currents can be circulated and returned to the source via ground reference connection.

Such shielding can be applied to individual pairs or quads; or to a collection of pairs. Individual pairs are foil shielded, while an overall cable (of multiple pairs) may use any of braided screen or foil or braiding with foil.

When shielding is applied to a collection of pairs, it is usually referred to as screening, but usage among vendors and authors in applying such words as ''screening'', ''shielding'', and ''STP (shielded twisted pair)'' can be subject to variability.&lt;ref name="anitech"&gt;[http://www.anitech-systems.com/MP4000/manual/briefs/ICM-4020E_Hub_Switch_Route_Cable_BR120501.pdf Anitech Systems MP 4000 Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siemon1"&gt;[http://www.siemon.com/us/white_papers/06-07-20-grounding.asp Grounding for Screened and Shielded Network Cabling - Siemon]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISO/IEC 11801]]:2002 (Annex E) attempts to internationally standardize the various designations for shielded cables by using combinations of three letters - U for unshielded, S for braided shielding (in outer layer only), and F for foil shielding - to explicitly indicate the type of screen for overall cable protection and for protecting individual pairs or quads, using a two-part abbreviation in the form of ''x/xTP''.

Shielded Cat 5e, Cat 6/6&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, and Cat 8/8.1 cables typically have F/UTP construction, while shielded Cat 7/7&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and Cat 8.2 cables use S/FTP construction.&lt;ref name=maguire&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/bq/public/jul15/maguire_25gbt_01_0715.pdf|accessdate=2015-09-25|date=2015-07-12 |title=Size of the Category 7A Installed Base|last=Valerie |first=Maguire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the shielding is made of metal, it may also serve as a path to ground; usually a screen shielded, twisted pair cable has an integrally incorporated, grounding wire, called a ''drain wire'', which makes electrical contact with the shield or screen. The purpose of the drain wire is for easy connection of the screen to terminals, which are usually designed for connection of round wires.

Common shield construction types include:
; Individual shield (U/FTP): Individual shielding with aluminum foil for each twisted pair or quad. Common names: pair in metal foil, shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair. This type of shielding protects cable from external EMI entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.

; Overall shield (F/UTP, S/UTP, and SF/UTP): Overall foil, braided shield or braiding with foil across all of the pairs within the 100&amp;nbsp;ohm twisted pair cable. Common names: foiled twisted pair, shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable.

; Individual and overall shield (F/FTP, S/FTP, and SF/FTP): Individual shielding using foil between the twisted pair sets, and also an outer foil or braided shielding. Common names: fully shielded twisted pair, screened foiled twisted pair, shielded foiled twisted pair, screened shielded twisted pair, shielded screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.

An early example of shielded twisted-pair was IBM STP-A, which is a two-pair 150&amp;nbsp;ohm S/FTP cable defined in 1985 by the IBM Cabling System specifications, and used with [[token ring]] or [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI networks]].&lt;ref name="anitech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techfest.com/networking/cabling/ibmcs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analog telephone===
Before digital communication and ethernet became widespread there was no international standard for telephone cable.  Standards were set at a national level.  For instance, in the UK the [[General Post Office]] specified CW1293 and CW1308 cables.  CW1308 was a similar specification to the earlier CW1293 but with an improved color code.  CW1293 used mostly solid colors on the cores making it difficult to identify the pair  it was twisted with without stripping back a large amount of sheath.  CW1308 has narrow rings of the paired color printed over the base color  to solve this problem.  Both cables are a similar standard to category 3 cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Stephen Roberts, ''Telephone Installation Handbook'', pp. 32-34, Elsevier, 2001 ISBN 0080521487.|Barry J. Elliot, ''Designing a Structured Cabling System to ISO 11801'', p. 269, CRC Press, 2002 ISBN 0824741307.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the common use of polyethylene and other plastics for insulation, telephone twisted pair cable was insulated with waxed paper or cotton with a wax coating applied to the copper.  The overall sheath of this type of cable was usually lead.  This style of cable came into use in the late 19th century shortly after the invention of the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;''Telephony'', vol. 153, p. 118, Telephone Publishing Corporation 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cable termination in termination boxes were sealed with molten wax or epoxy resin to prevent the ingress of moisture which would seriously degrade the insulating properties of the paper insulation.&lt;ref&gt;''Paper Maker and British Paper Trade Journal'', vol. 83-84, p. 294, November 1, 1932 {{oclc|10634178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, such seals made future maintenance and changes more difficult.  These cables are no longer made, but are still occasionally encountered in old buildings and in various external areas, commonly rural villages.

==Solid-core cable vs. stranded cable==
A solid-core cable uses one solid wire per conductor and in a four pair cable there would be a total of eight solid wires.&lt;ref name="dcuse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison between CAT5, CAT5e, CAT6, CAT7 Cables|url=http://discountcablesusa.com/ethernet-cables100.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stranded conductor uses multiple wires wrapped around each other in each conductor and in a four pair with seven strands per conductor cable, there would be a total of 56 wires (2 per pair × 4 pairs × 7 strands).&lt;ref name="dcuse" /&gt;

Solid core cable is intended for permanently installed runs. It is less flexible than stranded cable and is more prone to failure if repeatedly flexed. Stranded cable is used for fly leads at patch panel and for connections from wall-ports to end devices, as it resists cracking of the conductors.

Connectors are designed differently for solid core than for stranded. Use of a connector with the wrong cable type can lead to unreliable cabling. Plugs designed for solid and stranded core are readily available, and some vendors even offer plugs designed for use with both types. The punch-down blocks on patch-panel and wall-port jacks are designed for use with solid core cable, these work via a method known as insulation-displacement which pierces the sides of the insulation and "bites" in to the copper conductor to form a connection.

==Advantages==
* Electrical noise going into or coming from the cable can be prevented.&lt;ref name="cirris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirris.com/testing/twisted_pair/twist.html|title=Twisted Pair Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Crosstalk]] is minimized.&lt;ref name="cirris" /&gt;
* Cheapest form of cable available for networking purposes.&lt;ref name="cirris"/&gt;
* Easy to handle and install.&lt;ref name="cirris"/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
* Deformation: twisted pair's susceptibility to electromagnetic interference greatly depends on the pair twisting schemes (sometimes patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation. As a result, twisted pair cables usually have stringent requirements for maximum pulling tension as well as minimum bend radius. This fragility of twisted pair cables makes the installation practices an important part of ensuring the cable's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Impact of Installation Stresses On Cable Performance|url=http://www.belden.com/docs/upload/TB66.pdf|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Delay skew: different pairs within the cable have different delays, due to different twist rates used to minimize crosstalk between the pairs.  This can degrade image quality when multiple pairs are used to carry components of a video signal. Low skew cable is available to mitigate this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 7987R Technical Data Sheet (Metric)|url=http://www.belden.com/techdatas/metric/7987R.pdf|website=Belden.com|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 7989R Technical Data Sheet (Metric)|url=http://www.belden.com/techdatas/metric/7989R.pdf|website=Belden.com|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Imbalance: differences between the two wires in a pair can cause coupling between the common mode and the differential mode.  Differential to common mode conversion produces common mode currents that can cause external interference and can produce common mode signals in other pairs.  Common mode to differential mode conversion can produce differential mode signals from common mode interference from other pairs or external sources.  Imbalance can be caused by asymmetry between the two conductors of the pair from each other and in relationship to other wires and the shield.  Some sources of asymmetry are differences in conductor diameter and insulation thickness.  In telephone jargon, the common mode is called ''longitudinal'' and the differential mode is called ''metallic''.&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{cite book| last=Reeve | first=Whitman D. | year= 1995|title=Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook - Digital |edition=1st |publisher= IEEE Press | isbn= 0-7803-0440-3 | pp=215–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Less common variants==
; Loaded twisted pair
:  A twisted pair that has intentionally added [[inductance]], formerly common practice on telecommunication lines. The added inductors are known as [[load coil]]s and reduce attenuation for [[voiceband]] frequencies but increase it on higher frequencies. Load coils reduce distortion in voiceband on very long lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk801/tk36/technologies_tech_note09186a00800a8663.shtml|website=Cisco.com|title=Understanding Line Impairments|accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context a line without load coils is referred to as an unloaded line. 
; Bonded twisted pair
: A twisted pair variant in which the pairs are individually bonded to increase robustness of the cable. Pioneered by [[Belden (electronics company)|Belden]], it means the electrical specifications of the cable are maintained despite rough handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contractor Field-Testing Survey Reveals Performance-Related Cost Savings Using Bonded-Pair Cables|url=http://www.belden.com/docs/upload/TB67.pdf|website=Belden.com|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Twisted ribbon cable
: A variant of standard [[ribbon cable]] in which adjacent pairs of conductors are bonded and twisted together. The twisted pairs are then lightly bonded to each other in a ribbon format. Periodically along the ribbon there are short sections with no twisting to enable connectors and [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] headers to be terminated using the usual ribbon cable [[insulation-displacement connector|IDC]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3M Twisted Pair Flat Cable|url=http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/22068O/3mtm-twisted-pair-flat-cable-050-28awg-1700-series-ts0115.pdf|publisher=3M|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UMAX Technologies''' ({{zh|c=世成科技|p=Shìchéng Kējì}}), originally known as '''UMAX Computer Corporation''', is a manufacturer of computer products, including [[Image scanner|scanner]]s, [[mouse|mice]], and [[USB flash drive|flash drive]]s, based in [[Taiwan]]. The company also uses the '''Yamada''' and '''Vaova''' brand names.&lt;ref name="brandnames"&gt;[http://www.umax.co.uk/WebNew_UK/index.htm UMAX's website in the UK]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
UMAX was formerly a maker of [[Macintosh clones|Apple Macintosh clones]], using the ''SuperMac'' brand name outside of [[Europe]]. Some of their models included the SuperMac S900/S910, J700, C500 and C500e/i/LT, C600e/v/LT/x and Aegis 200. The C500 was marketed as the Apus 2000 in Europe. After [[Steve Jobs]] returned to [[Apple Computer|Apple]] as the new CEO, he revoked all of the clone producers' licenses to produce Mac clones except for UMAX,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cucug.org/sr/sr9709.html#NEWS.10 Article]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}} at cucug.org&lt;/ref&gt; due to their sub-US$1,000 low-end offerings, a market in which Apple was not strong, and UMAX's stated desire to expand the Macintosh platform's presence in East Asian markets. UMAX could not remain profitable selling only these systems, however; it briefly made [[IBM PC compatible]] computers in the mid-1990s, but since then UMAX has mainly concentrated on manufacturing scanners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kennedybrandt.com/supermac_insider/history/history3.html |title= The History of UCC and the SuperMac Computers: 'The End'| work=SuperMac Insider| publisher= republished at KennedyBrandt.com| year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, UMAX was the leading Taiwanese scanner maker, with a market share of 13% second worldwide behind [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP).&lt;ref name="LeePecht1997"&gt;{{cite book|first1= Chung-Shing| last1= Lee| first2= Michael| last2= Pecht|title=Electronics Industry in Taiwan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR8KHgM4yLIC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1997|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-3170-1|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued to be the case throughout 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1996-05-05/taiwans-high-tech-race-intl-edition |title= Taiwan's High Tech Race| work= [[BusinessWeek]]| publisher= Bloomberg| first= Pete| last= Engardio| date= 5 May 1996| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''PC Data'' figures, in 1997 UMAX briefly overtook HP in some monthly sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url= http://www.umax.com/company/press/index.jsp?yearPR=98&amp;monthPR=mar&amp;rlse=mar16b |title= Industry Analysts Score UMAX As New Market Leader | website= UMAX.com| date= 16 March 2002| location= Fremont, California| author= A&amp;R Partners for UMAX| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021222173744/http://www.umax.com/company/press/index.jsp?yearPR=98&amp;monthPR=mar&amp;rlse=mar16b| archivedate= 22 December 2002| deadurl= yes| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same source however, by 1999 UMAX was being "eclipsed" by HP whose scanner market share doubled that year from 13% to 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/08/11/hp_thrashing_umax_in_scanner/| title= HP thrashing UMAX in scanner market| website=TheRegister.co.uk| date= 11 August 1999| first= Mike| last= Magee| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some markets with high price-sensitivity like India for example, UMAX continued to have a slight lead on HP throughout 1999-2000 with the two companies claiming 44% and 40%, respectively, of the scanner sales in this country; 85% of which were for products costing less than 10,000 [[Indian rupee|Rs]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://archives.digitaltoday.in/businesstoday/netexcl/netex0508/pc.html |work= Business Today| title=  Growing add-ons: An incisive analysis of the booming peripherals market in the country| first= Aparna| last= Ramalingam | date= 7 August 2000 | publisher= Living Media India Ltd| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, HP and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] were dominating the world's flatbed scanner market, "accounting for a combined unit market share of 81 per cent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.itbusiness.ca/news/flatbed-scanner-market-isnt-flat-at-all/6650| title= Flatbed scanner market isn’t flat at all| website=ITBusiness.ca| author= ERC Canada |date= 3 December 2003| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 UMAX started to charge its US customers for [[Device driver|driver]] upgrades for its scanners—a practice that soon proved controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/06/03/now_you_pay_for_drivers/| first= Andrew |last= Orlowski| title= Now you pay for Drivers – UMAX pioneers new price gouge| website=TheRegister.co.uk| date= 3 June 2002| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/06/04/umax_us_offers_price_cut/ | first= Andrew |last= Orlowski| title= UMAX US offers price cut … for free drivers: Less than zero?| website=TheRegister.co.uk| date= 4 June 2002| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until their exit from the desktop scanner marked in 2002, [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]] used UMAX as its [[OEM]] for these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1113840/heidelberg-exit-desktop-scanners| title= Heidelberg to exit desktop scanners| work= PrintWeek.com| publisher= MA Business Limited |date= 11 April 2002| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UMAX also made a 1.3 [[megapixel]] [[digital camera]] called the AstraPix 490. It is capable of recording video clips, functioning as a webcam and can even be used to listen to music encoded in [[MP3]] format.

== Scanner software ==
UMAX offers some semi-free (in the sense that some versions/updates cost money and some do not) basic scanner software for [[Microsoft Windows]] (up to [[Windows XP]]) and [[Mac OS]]:
* VistaScan is their basic [[TWAIN]] scanner module, which also contains [[Windows Image Acquisition]] (WIA) drivers in its newer versions. It features a simpler interface compared to MagicScan. However, not all versions work with all products. In general, VistaScan versions after 3.55 no longer support [[SCSI]] scanners. The German site of UMAX has a (bilingual) webpage/wizard that helps the user select the proper version for their scanner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umax.de/support/treiber.htm |title=Umax Download Area |publisher=UMAX.de |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* MagicScan is the higher-end version of VistaScan, with a user interface aimed at more experienced users; it did not ship with the cheaper scanners (Astra, etc.) but only with the higher-end (PowerLook) scanners. It does however work with many of the cheaper UMAX scanners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-10341725-263.html |title= Using MagicScan instead of VistaScan to avoid the RAM Doubler conflict| website= CNET.com| author= CNET Staff| date= 2 September 2009| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= tips&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.scantips.com/umaxms.html| title= A few scanning tips: Umax MagicScan 4.2| date= 2004 |first= Wayne |last= Fulton | website= ScanTips.com| access-date= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions after 4.71 no longer ship with SCSI drivers.

Additionally, UMAX offers more sophisticated (typically non-free) third-party photo scanning/correction software:

For [[optical character recognition]], some UMAX scanners came bundled with [[OmniPage]]&lt;ref name="macw"/&gt; and others with [[ABBYY]] [[FineReader]].&lt;ref name="pcw6700"/&gt;

The Unix [[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]] software generally supports well the UMAX SCSI scanners, with varying degrees of support for the other ones (USB, [[Firewire]], [[parallel port|parallel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sane-project.org/sane-backends.html#S-UMAX |title=SANE: Backends (Drivers) |website=SANE-project.org |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23473">An '''underwater explosion''' (also known as an '''UNDEX''') is a [[explosive material|chemical]] or [[nuclear explosive|nuclear]] explosion that occurs under the surface of a body of water.

==Properties of water==
Underwater explosions differ from in-air explosions due to the properties of [[water]]:

*'''Mass and [[compressibility|incompressibility]] (all explosions)''' – water has a much higher [[density]] than [[air]], which makes water harder to move (higher [[inertia]]). It is also relatively hard to compress (increase density) when under pressure in a low range, say up to 100 atmospheres. These two together make water an excellent conductor of [[shock wave]]s from an [[explosion]].
*'''Effect of neutron exposure on salt water (nuclear explosions only)''' – most underwater blast scenarios happen in [[seawater]], not fresh or pure water. The water itself is not much affected by neutrons but salt is strongly affected. When exposed to neutron radiation during the microsecond of active detonation of a nuclear pit, water itself does not typically "[[neutron activation|activate]]", or become radioactive. The two atoms in water, [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], can absorb an extra neutron, becoming [[deuterium]] and [[oxygen-17]] respectively, both of which are stable [[isotope]]s. Even [[oxygen-18]] is stable. Radioactive atoms can result if a hydrogen atom absorbs two [[neutron]]s, an oxygen atom absorbs three neutrons, or oxygen-16 undergoes a high energy neutron [[(n-p) reaction]] to produce a short lived nitrogen-16. In any typical scenario the probability of such multiple capture in significant numbers in the short time of active nuclear reactions around a bomb are very low. They are somewhat greater when the water is continuously irradiated, as in the closed loop of a [[nuclear reactor]].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salt in seawater readily absorbs neutrons into both the [[sodium|sodium-23]] and [[chlorine|chlorine-35]] atoms, which change to radioactive isotopes. [[Sodium-24]] has a [[half-life]] of about 15 hours, while that of [[chlorine-36]] (which has a lower activation cross-section) is 300,000 years. The sodium is the most dangerous contaminant after the explosion because it has a short half-life.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} These are generally the main radioactive contaminants in an underwater blast; others are the usual blend of irradiated minerals, [[coral]], unused nuclear fuel, and bomb case components present in a surface blast [[nuclear fallout]], carried in suspension or dissolved in the water. Plain distillation or evaporating water (clouds, humidity, and precipitation) removes radiation contamination, leaving behind the radioactive salt.

==Effects==
Effects of an underwater [[explosion]] depend on several things, including distance from the explosion, the energy of the explosion, the depth of the explosion, and the depth of the water.&lt;ref name="Mehaute"&gt;{{cite book |last=Le Méhauté |first=Bernard |author2=Wang, Shen |title=Water waves generated by underwater explosion |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |year=1995 |location= |isbn=981-02-2083-9|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA304244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwater explosions are categorized by the depth of the explosion. Shallow underwater explosions are those where a [[subsidence crater|crater]] formed at the water's surface is large in comparison with the depth of the explosion. Deep underwater explosions are those where the crater is small in comparison with the depth of the explosion,&lt;ref name="Mehaute"/&gt; or nonexistent.

The overall effect of an underwater explosion depends on depth, the size and nature of the explosive charge, and the presence, composition and distance of reflecting surfaces such as the seabed, surface, [[thermocline]]s, etc. This phenomenon has been extensively used in [[anti-ship missile|antiship warhead]] design since an underwater explosion (particularly one underneath a hull) can produce greater damage than an above-surface one of the same explosive size. Initial damage to a target will be caused by the first [[shockwave]]; this damage will be amplified by the subsequent physical movement of water and by the repeated secondary shockwaves or [[bubble pulse]]. Additionally, charge detonation away from the target can result in damage over a larger hull area.&lt;ref&gt;RMCS Precis on Naval Ammunition, Jan 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwater nuclear tests close to the surface can disperse radioactive water and steam over a large area, with severe effects on marine life, nearby infrastructures and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ctbto.org/specials/infamous-anniversaries/25-july-1946test-baker-bikini-atoll/ |title= 'Test Baker', Bikini Atoll|accessdate=31 May 2012|work=CTBTO Preparatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-test1.htm/ |title= Is it possible to test a nuclear weapon without producing radioactive fallout? |accessdate=31 May 2012|work=How stuff works}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detonation of nuclear weapons underwater was banned by the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] and it is also prohibited under the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] of 1996.

==Shallow underwater explosion==
[[File:Crossroads baker explosion.jpg|thumb|left|The 1946 Baker test, just after the chimney had broken through the cloud, and the crack had formed on the water's surface]]

The Baker nuclear test at [[Bikini Atoll]] in July 1946 was a shallow underwater explosion, part of [[Operation Crossroads]]. A 20 [[kiloton]] warhead was detonated in a [[lagoon]] which was approximately {{convert|200|ft|abbr=on}} deep. The first effect was illumination of the water because of the underwater fireball. A rapidly expanding gas bubble created a [[shock wave]] that caused an expanding ring of apparently dark water at the surface, called the ''slick'', followed by an expanding ring of apparently white water, called the ''crack''. A mound of water and spray, called the ''spray dome'', formed at the water's surface which became more columnar as it rose. When the rising gas bubble broke the surface, it created a shock wave in the air as well. Water vapor in the air condensed as a result of a [[Prandtl-Glauert singularity]], making a spherical cloud that marked the location of the shock wave. Water filling the cavity formed by the bubble caused a hollow column of water, called the ''chimney'' or ''plume'', to rise {{convert|6000|ft|abbr=on}} in the air and break through the top of the cloud. A series of ocean [[surface wave]]s moved outward from the center. The first wave was about {{convert|94|ft|abbr=on}} high at {{convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} from the center. Other waves followed, and at further distances some of these were higher than the first wave. For example, at {{convert|22000|ft|abbr=on}} from the center, the ninth wave was the highest at {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on}}. Gravity caused the column to fall to the surface and caused a cloud of mist to move outward rapidly from the base of the column, called the ''base surge''. The ultimate size of the base surge was {{convert|3.5|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|1800|ft|abbr=on}} high. The base surge rose from the surface and merged with other products of the explosion, to form clouds which produced moderate to heavy rainfall for nearly one hour.&lt;ref name="GlasstoneC2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Glasstone |first=Samuel |last2=Dolan |first2=Philip |title=The effects of nuclear weapons |url=https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/ |edition=Third |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense; Energy Research and Development Administration |year=1977 |location=Washington |id= |chapter=Descriptions of nuclear explosions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deep underwater explosion==
[[File:Wigwam.jpg|thumb|right|The 1955 [[Operation Wigwam|Wigwam]] test]]

An example of a deep underwater explosion is the Wahoo test, which was carried out in 1958 as part of [[Operation Hardtack I]]. A 9 kt [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb|Mk-7]] was detonated at a depth of {{convert|500|ft|abbr=on}} in deep water. There was little evidence of a fireball. The spray dome rose to a height of {{convert|900|ft|abbr=on}}. Gas from the bubble broke through the spray dome to form jets which shot out in all directions and reached heights of up to {{convert|1700|ft|abbr=on}}. The base surge at its maximum size was {{convert|2.5|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name="GlasstoneC2"/&gt;

The heights of surface waves generated by deep underwater explosions are greater because more energy is delivered to the water. During the [[Cold War]], underwater explosions were thought to operate under the same principles as tsunamis, potentially increasing dramatically in height as they move over shallow water, and flooding the land beyond the shoreline.&lt;ref name="GlasstoneC6"&gt;{{cite book |last=Glasstone |first=Samuel |last2=Dolan |first2=Philip |title=The effects of nuclear weapons |url=https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/ |edition=third |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense; Energy Research and Development Administration |year=1977 |location=Washington |id= |chapter=Shock effects of surface and subsurface bursts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research and analysis suggested that water waves generated by explosions were different from those generated by tsunamis and landslides. Méhauté ''et al.'' conclude in their 1996 overview ''Water Waves Generated by Underwater Explosion'' that the surface waves from even a very large offshore undersea explosion would expend most of their energy on the continental shelf, resulting in coastal flooding no worse than that from a bad storm.&lt;ref name="Mehaute"/&gt;

The [[Operation Wigwam]] test in 1955 occurred at a depth of {{convert|2000|ft|abbr=on}}, the deepest detonation of any nuclear device.

[[File:PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION OF WATER NEAR AN UNDERWATER NUCLEAR EXPLOSION.gif|thumb|upright|Pressure distribution in water near the blast bubble]]

Unless it breaks the water surface while still a hot gas bubble, an underwater nuclear explosion leaves no trace at the surface but hot, radioactive water rising from below. This is always the case with explosions deeper than about {{convert|2000|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="GlasstoneC2"/&gt;

During such an explosion, the hot gas bubble quickly collapses because:

*The water pressure is enormous deeper than 2,000 feet.
*The expansion reduces gas pressure, which decreases temperature.
*[[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]] at the gas/water boundary causes "fingers" of water to extend into the bubble, increasing the boundary surface area.
*Water is incompressible.
*Vast amounts of energy are absorbed by phase change (water becomes steam at the boundary).
*Expansion quickly becomes unsustainable because the amount of water pushed outward increases with the cube of the blast-bubble radius.

Since water is not readily compressible, moving this much of it out of the way so quickly absorbs a massive amount of energy—all of which comes from the pressure inside the expanding bubble. Eventually, the water pressure outside the bubble causes it to collapse back into a small sphere and then rebound, expanding again. This is repeated several times, but each rebound contains only about 40% of the energy of the previous cycle. At its maximum diameter (during the first oscillation), a very large nuclear bomb exploded in very deep water creates a bubble about a half-mile wide in about one second, and then contracts (which also takes one second).

Blast bubbles from deep nuclear explosions become mere hot water in about six seconds and leave no "regular" bubbles to float up to the surface. This is sooner than blast bubbles from conventional explosives.

This drastic loss of energy between cycles is caused in part by the extreme force of a nuclear explosion pushing the bubble wall outward supersonically (faster than the speed of sound in saltwater). This causes [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]]. That is, the smooth inner wall surface becomes turbulent and fractal, with fingers and branches of cold ocean water extending into the bubble. That cold water cools the hot gas inside and causes it to condense. The bubble becomes less of a sphere and looks more like the [[Crab Nebula]], the deviation of which from a smooth surface is also due to Rayleigh–Taylor instability.

As one might expect, large, shallow explosions expand faster than deep, small ones.

Deep explosions have longer oscillations.

The water pressure just outside the bubble varies dramatically.

Despite being in direct contact with a nuclear explosion, the water of the expanding bubble wall does not boil. This is because the pressure inside the bubble exceeds (by far) the vapor pressure of ocean water. The water touching the blast can only boil during contraction. This boiling is like evaporation, cooling the bubble wall, and it is another reason that an oscillating blast bubble contains only 40% of the energy it had in the previous cycle.

During these hot gas oscillations, the bubble continually rises ("migrates") for the same reason a mushroom cloud rises: it is less dense. This causes the blast bubble never to be perfectly spherical. Instead, the bottom of the bubble is flatter, and during contraction, it even tends to "reach up" toward the blast center. In the last contraction cycle, the bottom of the bubble touches the top before the sides have fully collapsed, and the bubble becomes a [[torus]] in its last second of life. After that, all that remains of a large nuclear explosion is a mass of hot water, slowly rising from the cold depths of the ocean.

Note: it is often believed that the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|French]] did extensive underwater tests in French West Polynesia on the [[Moruroa]] and [[Fangataufa]] Atolls. This is incorrect; the bombs were placed in shafts drilled into the underlying coral and volcanic rock, and they did not intentionally leak fallout.

==Underwater Nuclear Detonation Detection via Hydroacoustics==
There are several methods of detecting nuclear detonations. [[Hydroacoustics]] is the primary means of determining if a nuclear detonation has occurred underwater. [[Hydrophone]]s are used to monitor the change in water pressure as sound waves propagate through the world's oceans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctbto.org/verification-regime/monitoring-technologies-how-they-work/hydroacoustic-monitoring/|title=Hydroacoustic monitoring: CTBTO Preparatory Commission|website=www.ctbto.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound travels through 20&amp;nbsp;°C water at approximately 1482 meters per second, compared to the 332&amp;nbsp;m/s speed of sound through air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~emusic/acoustics/speed.htm|title=How fast does sound travel?|website=www.indiana.edu|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.le.ac.uk/se/centres/sci/selfstudy/snd3.htm|title=Untitled Document|website=www.le.ac.uk|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world's oceans, sound travels most efficiently at a depth of approximately 1000 meters. Sound waves that travel at this depth travel at minimum speed and are trapped in a layer known as the Sound Fixing and Ranging Channel ([[SOFAR channel|SOFAR]]).&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Sounds can be detected in the SOFAR from large distances, allowing for a limited number of monitoring stations required to detect oceanic activity. Hydroacoustics was originally developed in the early 20th century as a means of detecting objects like icebergs and shoals to prevent accidents at sea.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Three hydroacoustic stations were built before the adoption of the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]]. Two hydrophone stations were built in the North Pacific Ocean and Mid-Atlantic Ocean, and a T-phase station was built off the west coast of Canada. When the CTBT was adopted, 8 more hydroacoustic stations were constructed to create a comprehensive network capable of identifying underwater nuclear detonations anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/nuclear-monitoring/techniques/hydroacoustic|title=Hydroacoustic Monitoring|last=Australia|first=c\=AU\;o\=Australia Government\;ou\=Geoscience|date=2014-05-15|website=www.ga.gov.au|language=EN|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 11 hydroacoustic stations, in addition to 326 monitoring stations and laboratories, comprise the [[International Monitoring System]] (IMS), which is monitored by the [[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctbto.org/verification-regime/background/overview-of-the-verification-regime/|title=Overview of the verification regime: CTBTO Preparatory Commission|website=www.ctbto.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different types of hydroacoustic stations currently used in the IMS network; 6 hydrophone monitoring stations and 5 T-phase stations. These 11 stations are primarily located in the southern hemisphere, which is primarily ocean.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/137th/lawrence.html|title=ASA/EAA/DAGA '99 - Hydroacoustic Monitoring for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|website=acoustics.org|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrophone monitoring stations consist of an array of three hydrophones suspended from cables tethered to the ocean floor. They are positioned at a depth located within the SOFAR in order to effectively gather readings.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Each hydrophone records 250 samples per second, while the tethering cable supplies power and carries information to the shore.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; This information is converted to a usable form and transmitted via secure satellite link to other facilities for analysis. T-phase monitoring stations record seismic signals generate from sound waves that have coupled with the ocean floor or shoreline.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://can-ndc.nrcan.gc.ca/ha_hydroacoustic-en.php|title=IMS Hydroacoustic Network|last=Monitoring|first=Government of Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Nuclear Explosion|website=can-ndc.nrcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; T-phase stations are generally located on steep-sloped islands in order to gather the cleanest possible seismic readings.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Like hydrophone stations, this information is sent to the shore and transmitted via satellite link for further analysis.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Hydrophone stations have the benefit of gathering readings directly from the SOFAR, but are generally more expensive to implement than T-phase stations.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Hydroacoustic stations monitor frequencies from 1 to 100 Hertz to determine if an underwater detonation has occurred. If a potential detonation has been identified by one or more stations, the gathered signals will contain a high bandwidth with the frequency spectrum indicating an underwater cavity at the source.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

A '''ventricular assist device (VAD)''' is an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] device for assisting cardiac circulation, which is used either to partially or to completely replace the function of a failing [[heart]]. The function of VADs is different from that of [[artificial cardiac pacemaker]]s; some are for short-term use, typically for patients recovering from [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) and for patients recovering from [[cardiac surgery]]; some are for long-term use (months to years to perpetuity), typically for patients suffering from advanced [[heart failure]].

VADs are designed to assist either the right [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] (RVAD) or the left ventricle (LVAD), or to assist both ventricles (BiVAD). The type of ventricular assistance device applied depends upon the type of underlying [[heart disease]], and upon the pulmonary arterial-resistance, which determines the workload of the right ventricle. The left-ventricle assistance device (LVAD) is the most common device applied to a defective heart (as it is sufficient in most cases -the right side of the heart is then often already able to make use of the heavily increased blood flow-), but when the pulmonary arterial-resistance is high, then an (additional) right-ventricle assistance device (RVAD) might be necessary to resolve the problem of cardiac circulation. If both a LVAD and a RVAD is needed a BiVAD is normally used, rather than a separate LVAD and an RVAD.

Normally, the long-term VAD is used as a [[bridge to transplantation]] (BTT)—keeping the patient alive, and in reasonably good condition, and able to await the heart transplant outside of the hospital.
Other "bridges" include bridge to candidacy, bridge to decision, and bridge to recovery. 
In some instances VAD's are also used as [[destination therapy]] (DT). In this instance, the patient shall not undergo a heart transplantion and the VAD is what the patient will use for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name="content.nejm.org"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Birks | first1 = EJ| last2 = Tansley | first2 = PD | last3 = Hardy | first3 = J et al. | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa053063 | title = Left Ventricular Assist Device and Drug Therapy for the Reversal of Heart Failure | journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 355 | issue = 18 | pages = 1873–1884 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17079761 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ventracor.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080204022437/http://www.ventracor.com/news_item.asp?newsID=431 "First VentrAssist Heart Recovery Featured on National TV"].

VADs are distinct from [[artificial heart]]s, which are designed to assume cardiac function, and generally require the removal of the patient's heart.

===Pumps===

The [[pump]]s used in VADs can be divided into two main categories—pulsatile pumps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fajdek|first1=B|last2=Krzysztof|first2=J|title=Automatic control system for ventricular assist device|journal=19th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)|date=2–5 September 2014|pages=874–879|doi=10.1109/MMAR.2014.6957472}}&lt;/ref&gt; that mimic the natural pulsing action of the heart, and continuous flow pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schulman | first1 = AR | last2 = Martens | first2 = TP | last3 = Christos | first3 = PJ et al.

If the pump is contained inside the body then a vent tube to the outside air is required.

Continuous-flow VADs are smaller and have proven to be more durable than pulsatile VADs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Slaughter | first1 = MS | last2 = Pagani | first2 = FD | last3 = Rogers | first3 = JG et al. | doi = 10.1016/j.healun.2010.01.011 | title = Clinical management of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices in advanced heart failure | journal = The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = S1–39 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20181499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They normally use either a [[centrifugal pump]] or an [[axial flow pump]]. Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin.  In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated in the direction of the rotor's axis.&lt;ref name=fukamachi_2005&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fukamachi |first= Kiyo |author2=Smedira, Nicholas  |date=August 2005 |title= Smaller, Safer, Totally Implantable LVADs: Fact or Fantasy?|journal= American College of Cardiology Current Journal Review |volume= 14 |issue= 8 |pages= 40–42 |doi=10.1016/j.accreview.2005.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important issue with continuous flow pumps is the method used to suspend the rotor. Early versions used solid bearings; however, newer pumps, some of which are approved for use in the EU, use either [[magnetic levitation]] ("maglev")&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Frank.

The first successful implantation of a left ventricular assist device was completed in 1966 by Dr. [[Michael E. DeBakey]] to a 37-year-old woman. A paracorporeal (external) circuit was able to provide mechanical support for 10 days after the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirklin|first1=JK|last2=Naftel|first2=DC|title=Mechanical circulatory support: registering a therapy in evolution.|journal=[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation: Heart Failure]]|date=September 2008|volume=1|issue=3|pages=200–5|pmid=19808290|doi=10.1161/circheartfailure.108.782599|pmc=3437761}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful long-term implantation of an artificial LVAD was conducted in 1988 by Dr. [[William F. Bernhard]] of [[Boston Children's Hospital]] Medical Center and Thermedics, Inc of Woburn, MA under a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research contract which developed Heart-mate, an electronically controlled assist device.  This was funded by a three-year $6.2 million contract to Thermedics and Children's Hospital, Boston MA from the National Heart and Lung and Blood Institute, a program of the NIH.&lt;ref name="Children's Hospital Boston MA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heart Pump Progress Announced - A promising step in artificial heart technology|journal=Children's Today|date=19 March 1988|issue=March|page=1,5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The early VADs emulated the heart by using a "pulsatile" action where blood is alternately sucked into the pump from the left ventricle then forced out into the aorta. Devices of this kind include the HeartMate IP LVAS, which was approved for use in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in October 1994. These devices began to gain acceptance in the late 1990's as heart surgeons including [[Eric Rose]], [[O. H. Frazier]] and [[Mehmet Oz]] began popularizing the concept that patients could live outside the hospital. Media coverage of outpatients with VADs underscored these arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2617eheart.html|title=Electric Heart|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work has concentrated on continuous flow pumps, which can be roughly categorized as either centrifugal pumps or [[Axial flow pump|axial flow]] [[impeller]] driven pumps.  These pumps have the advantage of greater simplicity resulting in smaller size and greater reliability.  These devices are  referred to as second generation VADs. A side effect is that the user will not have a [[pulse]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Third generation VADs suspend the impeller in the pump using either hydrodynamic or electromagnetic suspension, thus removing the need for bearings and reducing the number of moving parts to one.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Another technology undergoing clinical trials is the use of trans cutaneous induction to power and control the device rather than using percutaneous cables. Apart from the obvious cosmetic advantage this reduces the risk of infection and the consequent need to take preventative action. A pulsatile pump using this technology has CE Mark approval and is in clinical trials for US FDA approval.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

A very different approach in the early stages of development is the use of an inflatable cuff around the aorta. Inflating the cuff contracts the aorta and deflating the cuff allows the aorta to expand—in effect the aorta becomes a second left ventricle. A proposed refinement is to use the patient's skeletal muscle, driven by a [[pacemaker]],  to power this device which would make it truly self-contained. However a similar operation ([[cardiomyoplasty]]) was tried in the 1990s with disappointing results.  In any case, it has substantial potential advantages in avoiding the need to operate on the heart itself and in avoiding any contact between blood and the device. This approach involves a return to a pulsatile flow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Peter Houghton]] was the longest surviving recipient of a VAD for permanent use. He received an experimental Jarvik 2000 LVAD in June 2000. Since then, he completed a 91-mile charity walk, published two books, lectured widely, hiked in the Swiss Alps and the American West, flew in an ultra-light aircraft, and traveled extensively around the world.

==Studies and outcomes==
===Recent developments===
*In July 2009 in England, surgeons removed a donor heart that had been implanted in a toddler next to her native heart, after her native heart had recovered. This technique suggests mechanical assist device, such as an LVAD, can take some or all the work away from the native heart and allow it time to heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Thomas |last= Maugh |title= Transplant shows heart's reparative capabilities |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/14/science/sci-heart14 |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date= 14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2009, 18-month follow-up results from the HeartMate II Clinical Trial concluded that continuous-flow LVAD provides effective hemodynamic support for at least 18 months in patients awaiting transplantation, with improved functional status and quality of life. (see below).&lt;ref name=jacc_jul_09&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pagani | first1 = FD | last2 = Miller | first2 = LW | last3 = Russell | first3 = SD et al. | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.03.055 | title = Extended Mechanical Circulatory Support with a Continuous-Flow Rotary Left Ventricular Assist Device | journal = [[Journal of the American College of Cardiology]] | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 312–321 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19608028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Heidelberg University Hospital reported in July 2009 that the first HeartAssist5, known as the modern version of the DeBakey VAD, was implanted there. The HeartAssist5 weighs 92&amp;nbsp;grams, is made of titanium and plastic, and serves to pump blood from the left ventricle into the aorta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Heidelberg Cardiac Surgeons implant world’s first new DeBakey Heart Assist Device|url= http://insciences.org/article.php?article_id=6496 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718113010/http://insciences.org/article.php?article_id=6496|archivedate=18 July 2011|newspaper= Insciences|date= 17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A phase 1 clinical trial is underway (as of August 2009), consisting of patients with coronary artery bypass grafting and patients in end-stage heart failure who have a left ventricular assist device. The trial involves testing a patch, called Anginera(TM) that contains cells that secrete hormone-like growth factors that stimulate other cells to grow. The patches are seeded with heart muscle cells and then implanted onto the heart with the goal of getting the muscle cells to start communicating with native tissues in a way that allows for regular contractions.&lt;ref name=az_dstar_theregen&gt;{{cite news |first= Dale|last= Quinn|title= VA study: heart-healing patch |url= http://www.azstarnet.com/business/303476 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807141013/http://www.azstarnet.com/business/303476|archivedate=7 August 2009|newspaper= [[Arizona Daily Star]]|date= 4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ctgov_anginera&gt;{{cite news |title= A Study of Anginera In Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery |url= http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00364390 |newspaper= ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher= U.S. National Institutes of Health |date= 27 March 2009 |accessdate=15 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Hall-of-Fame Baseball Player Rod Carew had congestive heart failure and was fitted with a HeartMate II.

The majority of VADs on the market today are somewhat bulky. The smallest device approved by the FDA, the HeartMate II, weighs about {{convert|1|lb|kg}} and measures {{convert|3|in|cm}}. This has proven particularly important for women and children, for whom alternatives would have been too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors= Bogaev, R; Chen, L; Russell, SD; et al. |year= 2007 |title=Medical Aspects of End-Stage Heart Failure: Transplantation and Device Therapies I, Abstract 1762: An Emerging Option for Women with Advanced Heart Failure: Results of the HeartMate II Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device Bridge to Transplant Trial|journal= [[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]] |volume= 116 |series= II |page= 372 |publisher= American Heart Association|url= http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/116/16_MeetingAbstracts/II_372-c|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608220036/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/116/16_MeetingAbstracts/II_372-c|archivedate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, Heartmate III has been approved by the FDA. It is smaller than its predecessor HeartMate II, and uses a full maglev impeller instead of the cup-and-ball bearing system found in HeartMate II.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thoratec.com/medical-professionals/vad-product-information/heartmate3/HeartMate3_PressKit-UK.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One device gained CE Mark approval for use in the EU and began clinical trials in the US ([[VentrAssist]]).  As of June 2007 these pumps had been implanted in over 100 patients. In 2009, Ventracor was placed into the hands of Administrators due to financial problems and was later that year liquidated. No other companies purchased the technology, so as a result the VentrAssist device was essentially defunct. Around 30–50 patients worldwide remain supported on VentrAssist devices as of January 2010.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Heartware HVAD works similarly to the VentrAssist—albeit much smaller and not requiring an abdominal pocket to be implanted into. The device has obtained CE Mark in Europe, and FDA approval in the U.S. Recently, it was shown that the Heartware HVAD can be implanted through limited access without [[sternotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Popov | first1 = AF | last2 = Hosseini | first2 = MT | last3 = Zych | first3 = B et al.| title = HeartWare Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation Through Bilateral Anterior Thoracotomy | doi = 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.09.055 | journal = [[The Annals of Thoracic Surgery]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 674–676 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22269746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a small number of cases left ventricular assist devices, combined with drug therapy, have enabled the heart to recover sufficiently for the device to be able to be removed (''explanted'').&lt;ref name="content.nejm.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ventracor.com"/&gt;

===HeartMate II LVAD pivotal study===
A series of studies involving the use of the HeartMate II LVAD have proven useful in establishing the viability and risks of using LVADs for bridge-to-transplantation and destination therapy.

* The pilot trial for the HeartMate II LVAD began in November 2003 and consisted of 46 study patients at 15 centers. Results included 11 patients supported for more than one year and three patients supported for more than two years.
* The HeartMate II [[pivotal trial]] began in 2005 and included the evaluation of HeartMate II for two indications: Bridge to transplantation (BTT) and destination therapy (DT), or long-term, permanent support. Thoratec Corp. announced that this was the first time the FDA had approved a clinical trial to include both indications in one protocol.&lt;ref name=thor_hm2_piv&gt;{{cite news |first= Susan |last= Benton |title= HeartMate II Pivotal Clinical Trial Fact Sheet|url= http://www.thoratec.com/downloads/heartmate-ii-pivotal-clinical-trial-fact-sheet-081909.pdf |publisher= Thoratec Corporation |date= 19 August 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crsti_hm2_piv&gt;{{cite news |first= Todd |last= Dewey |title= The HeartMate II LVAS Pivotal Trial |url= http://www.crsti.org/protocols/heartmate-2.html |publisher= Cardiopulmonary Research Science and Technology Institute |date= 19 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070713184120/http://www.crsti.org/protocols/heartmate-2.html |archivedate = 13 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nypresb_hm2&gt;{{cite news |first= Belinda |last= Mager |title= FDA Approves HeartMate II Mechanical Heart Pump for Heart-Failure Patients Waiting for Organ Transplantation |url= http://nyp.org/news/hospital/heartmateII-organ-transplantation.html |archivedate=8 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508074333/http://www.nyp.org/news/hospital/heartmateII-organ-transplantation.html|publisher= [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]] |date= 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A multicenter study in the United States from 2005 to 2007 with 113 patients (of which 100 reported principal outcomes) showed that significant improvements in function were prevalent after three months, and a survival rate of 68% after twelve months.&lt;ref name=njem_aug07&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = LW | last2 = Pagani | first2 = FD | last3 = Russell | first3 = SD et al. | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa067758 | title = Use of a Continuous-Flow Device in Patients Awaiting Heart Transplantation | journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 357 | issue = 9 | pages = 885–896 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17761592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Based on one-year follow up data from the first 194 patients enrolled in the trial, the FDA approved HeartMate II for bridge-to-transplantation. The trial provided clinical evidence of improved survival rates and quality of life for a broad range of patients.&lt;ref name=umhs&gt;{{cite news |first= Kara |last= Gavin |title=Exciting times for heart-assisting devices at U-M |url=http://www2.med.umich.edu/prmc/media/newsroom/details.cfm?ID=179 |publisher= University of Michigan Health System |date= 23 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510224935/http://www2.med.umich.edu/prmc/media/newsroom/details.cfm?ID=179|archivedate=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fda_heartmate_ii&gt;{{cite news |title=Thoratec HeartMate II LVAS – P060040 | url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm074231.htm |agency= [[Food and Drug Administration]] |date= 23 April 2008 |accessdate=28 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eighteen-month follow up data on 281 patients who had either reached the study end-point or completed 18 months of post-operative follow-up showed improved survival, less frequent adverse events and greater reliability with continuous flow LVADS compared to pulsatile flow devices. Of the 281 patients, 157 patients had undergone transplant, 58 patients were continuing with LVADs in their body and seven patients had the LVAD removed because their heart recovered; the remaining 56 had died.  The results showed that the NYHA Class of heart failure the patients had been designated had significantly improved after six months of LVAD support compared to the pre-LVAD baseline. Although this trial involved bridge-to-transplant indication, the results provide early evidence that continuous flow LVADs have advantages in terms of durability and reliability for patients receiving mechanical support for destination therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eisen | first1 = HJ | last2 = Hankins | first2 = SR | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.028 | title = Continuous Flow Rotary Left Ventricular Assist Device | journal = [[Journal of the American College of Cardiology]] | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 322–324 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19608029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the FDA approval of HeartMate II LVAD for bridge-to-transplantation purposes, a post-approval ("registry") study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of the device in a commercial setting. The study found that the device improved outcomes, both compared to other LVAD treatments and baseline patients. Specifically, HeartMate II patients showed lower creatinine levels, 30-day survival rates were considerably higher at 96%, and 93% reached successful outcomes (transplant, cardiac recovery, or long-term LVAD).&lt;ref name=JoCFAug09&gt;{{cite journal |authors= Starling, RC; Naka, Y; Boyle, AJ; et al. |date=Aug 2009 |title= Initial FDA Post-Approval Study INTERMACS Registry Results with a Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device as a Bridge to Heart Transplantation |journal= Journal of Cardiac Failure |volume= 15 |issue= 6 |page= S46 |doi= 10.1016/j.cardfail.2009.06.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HARPS===
The Harefield Recovery Protocol Study (HARPS) is a clinical trial to evaluate whether advanced heart failure patients requiring VAD support can recover sufficient myocardial function to allow device removal (known as explantation). HARPS combines an LVAD (the HeartMate XVE) with conventional oral heart failure medications, followed by the novel β2 agonist clenbuterol. This opens the possibility that some advanced heart failure patients may forgo heart transplantation.&lt;ref name=HARPS_01&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Leslie |author2=Aaronson and Pagani  |year= 2008 |title= Harefield Recovery Protocol Study for Patients With Refractory Chronic Heart Failure (HARPS) |journal= ClinicalTrials.gov |url= http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00585546 |accessdate= 2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, 73% (11 of 15) of patients who underwent the combination therapy regimen demonstrated sufficient recovery to allow explantation and avoid heart transplantation; freedom from recurrent heart failure in surviving patients was 100% and 89% at one and four years after explantation, respectively; average ejection fraction was 64% at 59 months after explantation—all patients were NYHA Class I; and no significant adverse effects were reported with clenbuterol therapy.

===REMATCH===
The REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure) clinical trial began in May 1998 and ran through July 2001 in 20 cardiac transplant centers around the USA.  The trial  was designed to compare long-term implantation of left ventricular assist devices with optimal medical management for patients with end-stage heart failure who require, but do not qualify to receive cardiac transplantation. As a result of the clinical outcomes, the device received FDA approval for both indications, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.&lt;ref name=rematch_ats&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0003-4975(99)00042-9 | last1 = Rose | first1 = EA | last2 = Moskowitz  | first2 = AJ | last3 = Packer | first3 = M et al. | title = The REMATCH trial: Rationale, design, and end points. Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure | journal = [[The Annals of Thoracic Surgery]] | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 723–730 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10215217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial demonstrated an 81% improvement in two-year survival among patients receiving HeartMate XVE compared to optimal medical management. In addition, a destination therapy study following the REMATCH trial demonstrated an additional 17% improvement (61% vs. 52%) in one-year survival of patients that were implanted with a VAD (HeartMate XVE), with an implication for the appropriate selection of candidates and timing of VAD implantation.

A test carried out in 2001 by [[Eric Rose|Dr. Eric A. Rose]] and REMATCH study group with patients with congestive heart failure that were ineligible for a transplant showed a survival at two years of 23% for those implanted with an LVAD compared with 8% for those who were treated with drugs. The two major complications of VAD implantation were infection and mechanical failure (see below).

According to a retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated with a left ventricular assist device versus inotrope therapy while awaiting heart transplantation, the group treated with LVAD had improved clinical and metabolic function at the time of transplant with better blood pressure, sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. After transplant, 57.7% of the inotrope group had renal failure versus 16.6% in the LVAD group; 31.6% of the inotrope group had right heart failure versus 5.6% in the LVAD group; and event-free survival was 15.8% in the inotrope group versus 55.6% in the LVAD group.&lt;ref name=intrepid&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = JG | last2 = Butler | first2 = J | last3 = Lansman | first3 = SL et al. | title = Chronic Mechanical Circulatory Support for Inotrope-Dependent Heart Failure Patients Who Are Not Transplant Candidates | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2007.03.063 | journal = [[Journal of the American College of Cardiology]] | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 741–747 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17707178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications and side effects==
Bleeding is the most common postoperative early complication after implantation or explantation of LVADs, necessitating reoperation in up to 60% of recipients.&lt;ref name=Schaffer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schaffer|first=JM|author2=Arnaoutakis, GJ |author3=Allen, JG et al.|title=Bleeding Complications and Blood Product Utilization With Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation|journal=[[The Annals of Thoracic Surgery]]|volume=91|issue=3|pages=740–749|doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Daniel J.|author2=Robert B.

Because the devices generally result in blood flowing over a non-biologic surface, predisposing the blood to [[Coagulation|clotting]], there is need for [[anticoagulation]] measures. One device, the HeartMate XVE, is designed with a biologic surface derived from [[fibrin]] and does not require long term anticoagulation (except aspirin); unfortunately, this biologic surface may also predispose the patient to infection through selective reduction of certain types of leukocytes.&lt;ref name=ats_anticoag&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Samuels | first1 = LE | last2 = Kohout | first2 = J | last3 = Casanova-Ghosh | first3 = E et al. | doi = 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.01.100 | title = Argatroban as a Primary or Secondary Postoperative Anticoagulant in Patients Implanted with Ventricular Assist Devices | journal = [[The Annals of Thoracic Surgery]] | volume = 85 | issue = 5 | pages = 1651–1655 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18442558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New VAD designs which are now approved for use in the European Community and are undergoing trials for FDA approval have all but eliminated mechanical failure.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

VAD-related infection can be caused by a large number of different organisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Lancet (journal)|The Lancet Infectious Diseases]] |authors=Gordon, RJ; Quagliarello, B; Lowy, FD | title=Ventricular assist device-related infections | year=2006 | volume=6 | issue=7 | pages=426–37 | doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70522-9 | pmid=16790383}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gram positive bacteria (''[[Staphylococci]]'', especially ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|Staph. aureus]]'', ''[[Enterococci]]'')
* Gram negative bacteria (''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Enterobacter]]'' species, ''[[Klebsiella]]'' species)
* Fungi. especially ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'' species

Treatment of VAD-related infection is exceedingly difficult and many patients die of infection despite optimal treatment. Initial treatment should be with broad spectrum antibiotics, but every effort must be made to obtain appropriate samples for culture.  A final decision regarding antibiotic therapy must be based on the results of microbiogical cultures.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Other problems include [[immunosuppression]], clotting with resultant stroke, and bleeding secondary to anticoagulation. Some of the [[polyurethane]] components used in the devices cause the deletion of a subset of [[White blood cell|immune cells]] when blood comes in contact with them. This predisposes the patient to [[fungus|fungal]] and some [[virus|viral]] infections necessitating appropriate [[Prophylaxis|prophylactic therapy]].&lt;ref name=holman_infection&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0003-4975(03)00479-X | last1 = Holman | first1 = WL | last2 = Rayburn | first2 = BK | last3 = McGiffin | first3 = DC et al. | title = Infection in ventricular assist devices: Prevention and treatment | journal = [[The Annals of Thoracic Surgery]] | volume = 75 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = S48–S57 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12820735 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''water thief'''" refers to three devices&amp;nbsp;– one ancient and two modern.

# A water thief is a [[synthetic rubber]] fitting that attaches to an unthreaded [[faucet]] on one end and a common [[garden hose]] on the other. It is commonly used to fill fresh [[water tank]]s in [[recreational vehicle]]s when a threaded hose bib is not available.
# A water thief allows [[firefighter]]s to break down one larger line into several smaller ones, each with independent control of [[water]] flow at the [[valve]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-152/issue-1/features/stealing-water-with-the-water-thief.html "Stealing" Water with the Water Thief by Doug Leihbacher]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Another device, used in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], was called a "water thief" or "[[Water clock|clepsydra]]." [[Carl Sagan]] described it in his book ''[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]'' as "...&amp;nbsp;a brazen sphere with an open neck and small holes in the bottom, it is filled by immersing it in water. If you pull it out with the neck uncovered, the water pours out of the holes, making a small shower. But if you pull it out properly, with the neck covered, the water is retained in the sphere until you lift your thumb."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Sagan (1980), ''[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]'', Random House, pp.&amp;nbsp;179–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The earliest description of the device is in: [[Empedocles]], [http://www.mycrandall.ca/courses/grphil/EmpedoclesText.htm Fragment B100].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Boyle]], ''A Continuation of New Experiments Physico-mechanical, Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, and Their Effects'', Henry Hall, 1669, p. 29 (Boyle's explanation of the ascension of water in sucking pumps) and ''The Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle: In Six Volumes'', Vol. I, J. and F. Rivington, 1772, pp. 191–2: "if a gardener's watering-pot be filled with water, the hole at the top being stopped, the water will not flow out of any of the holes in the bottom; but if the finger be removed to let in the air above, it will run out at them all..." See also Marcus Hellyer (ed.), ''The Scientific Revolution: The Essential Readings'', Blackwell, 2008, p. 77 (a commentary on Boyle's observations about gardener's watering-pot) and [[Boyle's law]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winifred Byanyima''' (born 13 January 1959) is a Ugandan-born [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical engineer]], politician, and diplomat. She is the executive director of [[Oxfam International]], to which she was appointed in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Winnie Byanyima Appointed To Lead Oxfam International | date=15 January 2013 |
last=Administrator | accessdate=19 July 2014 | publisher=Oxfamblogs.org | url=http://www.oxfamblogs.org/eastafrica/?p=5641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, she served as the director of the Gender Team in the Bureau for Development Policy at the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/interview-with-undp-gender-team-director-winnie-byanyima-incorporating-gender-perspective-in-all-steps-of-economic-policy-management-process-7373/ | title=Interview With UNDP Gender Team Director, Winnie Byanyima – "Incorporating Gender Perspective In All Steps of Economic Policy Management Process" |last=ADB | date=29 October 2010 | accessdate=19 July 2014 | publisher=[[African Development Bank]] (ADB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
She was born in [[Mbarara District]] in the [[Western Region, Uganda|Western Region]] of Uganda, a [[Uganda Protectorate|British protectorate]] at the time. Her parents are Boniface Byanyima, one-time national chairman of the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party in Uganda]], and Gertrude Byanyima, a former schoolteacher who died in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/659377 | title=Byanyima's Wife Dead | date=13 November 2008 | newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala) | accessdate=19 July 2014 | last=Conan Businge | first=and Ali Waiswa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winnie Byanyima attended [[Mount Saint Mary's College Namagunga]] in [[Mukono District]]. She went on to obtain a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from the [[University of Manchester]], becoming the first female Ugandan to become an aeronautical engineer. She later received a master's degree in mechanical engineering, specializing in energy conservation from [[Cranfield University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=January 2015 | url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/winnie-byanyima-oxfam-international-executive-director | accessdate=7 April 2015 | last=Oxfam | publisher=[[Oxford Committee for Famine Relief]] (Oxfam) | title=Winnie Byanyima, Oxfam International Executive Director}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Following the completion of her training as an aeronautical engineer, Byanyima worked as a [[flight engineer]] for [[Uganda Airlines]]. When [[Yoweri Museveni]] started the 1981–1986 [[Ugandan Bush War]], Byanyima left her job and joined the armed rebellion. Museveni and Byanyima had been raised together at the Byanyima household as children, with the Byanyima family paying for all Museveni's education and scholastic needs.

Museveni, Byanyima, and her husband [[Kizza Besigye]] were combatants in the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) during that war. Though both Byanyima and her husband have since fallen out with the Ugandan president because of his repressive undemocratic rule despite his earlier stated convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=19 July 2014 | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1157272/-/c22kvez/-/index.html | title=Besigye Injuries Disturbing, Says Byanyima | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] (Kampala) | date=6 May 2011 | last=Butagira| first=Tabu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the NRA won that war, Byanyima served as Uganda's ambassador to France from 1989 until 1994. She then returned home and became an active participant in [[Ugandan politics]]. She served as a member of the [[Constituent Assembly]] that drafted the [[Constitution of Uganda|1995 Ugandan Constitution]]. She then served two consecutive terms as a [[Parliament of Uganda|member of parliament]], representing [[Mbarara|Mbarara Municipality]] from 1994 until 2004. She was then appointed director of the Directorate of Women, Gender and Development at the headquarters of the [[African Union]] in [[Addis Ababa, Ethiopia]]. She served in that capacity until she was appointed as director of the Gender Team in the Bureau for Development Policy at UNDP in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/535097 | title=Byanyima Scoops Top Job | publisher=[[New Vision]] | date=29 November 2006 | accessdate=19 July 2014 | last=Onyalla | first=Harriette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Byanyima was announced as the next executive director of Oxfam International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=23180:winnie-byanyima-to-head-oxfam&amp;catid=34:news&amp;Itemid=114 | title=Winnie Byanyima To Head Oxfam | date=15 January 2013 | first=Edris | last=Kiggundu | accessdate=19 July 2014 |  newspaper=[[The Observer (Uganda)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing [[Jeremy Hobbs]].

In January 2015, Byanyima co-chaired the World Economic Forum in Davos. She used the forum to press for action to narrow the gap between rich and poor. The charity’s research claims that the share of the world's wealth owned by the richest 1 percent of the world population had increased to nearly 50 percent in 2014, whereas 99 percent shares the other half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/global-wealth-oxfam-inequality-davos-economic-summit-switzerland|title=New Oxfam Report Says Half of Global Wealth Held By The Top One Percent | accessdate=7 April 2015 | date=19 January 2015 | last=Larry Elliott | first=and Ed Pilkington | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] (London)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] (London) | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/20/oxfam-85-richest-people-half-of-the-world | title=Oxfam: 85 Richest People As Wealthy As Poorest Half of The World | first=Graeme | last=Wearden | accessdate=7 April 2015 | date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

In November 2016, Byanyima was appointed by [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] to the High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines, co-chaired by [[Ruth Dreifuss]], former President of [[Switzerland]], and [[Festus Mogae]], former President of [[Botswana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sga1608.doc.htm Secretary-General Appoints Two Former Presidents, 14 Others as Members of High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines] [[United Nations]], press release of 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal details==
Byanyima is married to political opposition figure [[Kizza Besigye]], the former chairman of the [[Forum for Democratic Change]] (FDC) political party in Uganda. They are the parents of one son named Anselm. Byanyima is a member of the FDC, although she has significantly reduced her participation in partisan Ugandan politics since she became a Ugandan diplomat in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/9/803/745788|title=I Cannot Leave Baby Besigye, Says Winnie | newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala)|

'''Zakuski''' (plural from [[Russian language|Russian]]: закуски {{IPA-ru|zɐˈkuskʲɪ|}}; singular '''zakuska''' from закуска) is a  [[Slavs|Slavic]] term of Russian origin for hot and cold [[hors d'oeuvre]]s, [[entrée]]s and [[snack]]s,&lt;ref name="CCR"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4kvrPEweOcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Zakuski&amp;q=Zakuski&amp;f=false | encyclopedia=Culture and Customs of Russia | title=Zakuski | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | year=2000 | isbn=9780313311017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCF"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = The Oxford Companion to Food | author = Alan Davidson | title = Zakuski | year = 2014 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | pages = 889–890 | isbn = 9780191040726 | url = https://books.google.de/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA889&amp;q=Zakuski }}&lt;/ref&gt;  either as a course as it is or "intended to follow each [[shot glass|shot]] of [[vodka]] or another alcoholic drink."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zf6tJnMjbi4C&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Zakuski&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tml7UYrgCcaXiAKZ94HIBA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Zakuski&amp;f=false Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Russian]&lt;/ref&gt; The word literally means ''something to bite after''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dicipedia.net/dic-ru-ru-Ozhegov-term-8982.htm Закуска]. С.И. Ожегов, Н.Ю. Шведова. Толковый словарь русского языка. Азъ, 1992 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  It probably originated through the fusion of Viking-Nordic and Slavic cultures in the early Rus'  [[Novgorod Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1035845794|title=T-bone whacks and caviar snacks : cooking with two Texans in Siberia and the Russian Far East|last=Sharon,|first=Hudgins,|publisher=|others=Hudgins, Tom,|year=|isbn=9781574417227|location=Denton, Texas|pages=18|oclc=1035845794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/medievalnovgorod/nov05.html#16|title=Food|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereby this custom was probably also influenced from Swedish and Finnish ''brännvinsbord'' which was also the ancestor of modern [[smörgåsbord]].&lt;ref name="OCF" /&gt; A table with zakuski was kept in the houses of the [[Russian nobility|Russian gentry]] for feeding casual visitors who travelled long distances and whose arrival time was often unpredictable.&lt;ref name="CCR" /&gt; At banquets and parties, zakuski were often served in a separate room adjacent to the dining room or on a separate table in the dining room. The tradition eventually spread to other layers of society and remained in the [[Soviet cuisine|Soviet times]], but due to lack of space, they were served on the dinner table. Zakuski became thus the first course of a festive dinner.&lt;ref name="OCF" /&gt;

Nowadays, these appetizers are commonly served at banquets, dinners, parties and receptions in countries which were formerly part of the [[Russian Empire]] including some [[post-Soviet states]] and [[Poland]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''zakąski'').&lt;ref name="CCR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="procner"&gt;{{cite book | last=Procner | first=Aleksandra | date=1999 | title=Technologia gastronomiczna z towaroznawstwem | trans-title=Gastronomic technology with commodity-knowledge | language=Polish | location=Warszawa | publisher=WSiP | isbn=83-02-02789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broad selection of zakuski constitutes a standard first course at any feast table. Usually, zakuski are already laid on the table when guests are called to the dining room.&lt;ref name="CCR" /&gt;

Typical zakuski consist of [[cold cuts]], [[cured fish]]es, mixed [[salad]]s, [[Kholodets (dish)|kholodets]] (meat jelly), [[pirog]]s (varenyky) or [[pirozhki]], various [[pickled vegetables]] such as [[tomato]]es, [[beet]]s, [[Pickled cucumber|cucumber]]s, [[sauerkraut]], pickled mushrooms, [[deviled egg]]s, hard [[cheese]]s, [[caviar]], [[canapé]]s, [[open sandwich]]es, and [[bread]]s.&lt;ref name="OCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JOC"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tbyW2LeXIOkC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Zakuski&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zakuski&amp;f=false JOC All New Rev. - 1997 - Irma S.
